  <p>&pound;20 million out of the &pound;40 million aid package for farmers which I announced on 20 September will be disbursed to hill cattle and sheep farmers as an enhancement to the headage rates paid under the Hill Livestock Compensatory Allowances Scheme.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to protect the marine and coastal environments of Scotland, and the livelihoods of those who work in related industries and businesses, from the effects of pollution caused by the discharge of plutonium into the Irish Sea and whether such plans take account of a recent study by the Norwegian Radiation Protection Board and the Federal German Office for Maritime Shipping and Hydrography which showed that such discharges may travel up to 1,000 kms around the Scottish coastline.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-11-16.S1W-2100.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa1116.htm#1811">

  <p>Several studies have shown that marine currents carry radioactivity discharged to the Irish Sea to considerable distances from the point of discharge, in this case the Sellafield site. The levels of activity detected, however, are very small.</p>

  <p>Discharges from Sellafield are regulated by authorisations issued by the Environment Agency for England and Wales. In order to protect the food chain and the environment near the Sellafield site, those authorisations contain a clause requiring the operator to take the best practicable means to reduce the level of radioactivity in discharges from the site. As a result of that requirement, levels of plutonium in Sellafield discharges have fallen very considerably over the years. Extensive monitoring around the Sellafield site and in the marine environment of the United Kingdom indicates that levels of radioactivity fall rapidly with distance from the site. Consequently, there is no need for additional protection measures to be taken in Scotland. Monitoring of the UK marine environment around Sellafield will continue.</p>

  <p>As advised in my answer to Mr Wilson&#8217;s question S1W-1437, the budget for the Scottish Executive EU Office comes from the Administration Vote 6. That answer gave a detailed breakdown of the budget for 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>Given that this budget was drawn up for the first year of operation of the new office before the final staff team was in place, certain assumptions about costs had to be made. Once the office has been operational for six months the budget will be reviewed and next year&#8217;s draft budget drawn up in the light of that experience. At present no further estimated costs for future years have been calculated.</p>

  <p>The measures referred to form part of the proposals for a new Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) which is the subject of ongoing EU negotiations. It is not yet clear to what extent eligibility for vessel construction and modernisation funding will be linked to Multi-Annual Guidance Programme targets and vessel capacity reduction criteria. I shall discuss with the industry priorities for FIFG expenditure.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Bill received Royal Assent on 11 November. The establishment of the Agency underlines the Executive&#8217;s commitment to food safety, from farm to fork. We will make sure that the Agency gets the best possible start so that it can quickly achieve its paramount aim of protecting public health and meet the challenges that it will undoubtedly face. Arrangements are underway for setting up the Scottish arm of the Agency to be based in Aberdeen and the independent Scottish Food Advisory Committee to advise on food safety issues in Scotland. We are currently recruiting the Scottish Director and the process of recruiting the members of the Advisory Committee begins at the end of the month.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive expects Health Boards to undertake thorough consultation on their strategic proposals. In doing so, Health Boards should consult all bodies with a valid interest in time to allow all comments to be considered and taken into account before they take final decisions. We expect Fife Health Board to follow this process in taking forward its proposals for acute services.</p>

  <p>The Executive is aware that the Health Board has declared its preferred configuration for acute services. However, the Health Board will be reviewing its proposals in the light of the outcome of the options appraisal that has still to be completed, public discussion and formal consultation which is scheduled to commence in January 2000. Following consultation the Health Board will submit to us any final decisions that require our approval.</p>

  <p>Information is already available in respect of (a) eviction decrees issued by the courts (but not broken down into categories of tenants as specified in question S1W-999) and (b) actual evictions (from 1998-99) from tenancies with housing associations and co-operatives registered with Scottish Homes. We are currently considering, with local authorities, whether information about eviction actions, and actual evictions, in respect of council tenants should in future be collected centrally. Any such arrangements, if agreed, will apply from 1 April 2000.</p>

  <p>Health and environmental consequences are uppermost in the priorities of the Ministry of Defence, emergency services, local authorities and health boards when preparing emergency plans. These are regularly rehearsed, reviewed and revised to take account of all known threats and risks. Specific responsibility for addressing the possibility of year 2000 computer problems affecting facilities at Clyde Naval Base, however, lies with the Secretary of State for Defence.</p>

  <p>The present Victim Notification Scheme would not prevent the victims of crime being notified of the release of a person from custody in these circumstances. The age of a person at the time of committing a crime would not in itself prevent the victim or, in the case of homicide, next of kin, being notified of that person&#8217;s release from custody under the Victim Notification Scheme.</p>

  <p>Our Land Reform Action Plan sets out an integrated programme of action and legislation on land reform over the next four or five years. It has 43 separate items, and demonstrates the scale of our commitment to change.</p>

  <p>I promised that we would publish regular updates to show how we are delivering on our promises. The first of these progress reports is published today. All MSPs are receiving copies.</p>

  <p>I am delighted to say that it shows that we have already achieved five of our targets and that we have made significant progress on a wide range of other items. Further progress reports will be published quarterly.</p>

  <p>There will be an opportunity for a Debate on this on 24 November.</p>

  <p>Under the current Agricultural Wages (Scotland) Order (No 46) 1998, hill shepherds are paid at a weekly rate for all hours worked on the &quot;customary&quot; duties related to tending sheep. This rate includes a notional allowance for overtime. Actual overtime is paid only when a hill shepherd undertakes additional duties unrelated to sheep.</p>

  <p>From 1 January 2000, hill shepherds will be paid a basic rate for the first 39 hours worked each week and an overtime rate for any additional hours regardless of the nature of the work undertaken. The reference to &quot;customary&quot; duties will disappear from the new Wages Order, but hill shepherds will have the same level of protection of pay and conditions of service as all other agricultural workers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Agricultural Wages Board is responsible for making Wages Orders.</p>

One of the conditions attaching to the further financial contributions of all the co-funders&#8217; is that a new management structure is put in place.

  <p>None of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s contribution of &pound;2 million to the rescue package will be paid over until the co-funders&#8217; pre-conditions have been met. The co-funders&#8217; money will be used to help pay off debts to Queen&#8217;s Park Football Club&#8217;s creditors.</p>

  <p>The provision of bus services is a matter for individual bus operators using their commercial judgement on the level and frequency of services. It is the responsibility of the relevant local authority or public transport authority to identify where there is a social need for particular bus services which are not provided by operators on a commercial basis, and to make subsidy available, if it so chooses, to procure such services through competitive tendering.

  <p>Based on a study undertaken for the Scottish Office in 1994, which considered the section of the route between Junction 2 (Edinburgh-Newbridge) and Junction 6 (Newhouse), and more recent work relating to the Newhouse to Glasgow (Baillieston) section, it is estimated that it would cost &pound;238 million (excluding VAT) to upgrade the route between Newbridge and Baillieston to dual three-lane standard.

  <p>Vandalism is a particular problem for rail safety in Scotland. 94% of all train accidents in Scotland in the year to 31 March 1999 were caused by vandalism, as against 59% for Great Britain as a whole.
