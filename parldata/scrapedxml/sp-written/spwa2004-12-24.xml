  <p>Information from this baseline study indicated that over 3,400 children and young people were identified as having been diagnosed with autistic spectrum disorder. The figures provided produce a prevalence rate of 35 children per 10,000, which is less than the estimated prevalence rate of 60 per 10,000 in the <em>Public Health Institute of Scotland&rsquo;s Autistic Spectrum Disorders Needs Assessment Report</em> .</p>

  <p>Note: 1. Based on patients whose registration status indicates &quot;withdrawn&quot; between the dates in question. This occurs when there is a request for the registration record to be withdrawn (made usually by the dentist, and subsequently approved by the NHS board). Patient registrations can be withdrawn for a number of reasons, including the dentist moving to another area, non-payment of charges by the patient or entry into a private arrangement because the dentist has decided to stop treating some or all categories of NHS patients. The numbers also include withdrawals carried out where more than one active registration exists for the same patient, as part of data cleansing. Some patients whose registration has been withdrawn may register with another dentist under NHS arrangements elsewhere.</p>

  <p>There is no specific allocation made to GP practices for accepting drug addicts on to their practice list.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract, GP practices receive a Global Sum payment as a contribution towards their running costs, including staff costs, in delivering essential and additional services to the patients on their list. This resource allocation is based on the relative needs of the practice population and the associated workload and cost of delivering healthcare to patients.</p>

  <p>NHS boards have also been allocated &pound;34.9 million in 2004-05 for the provision of a range of enhanced services, which includes services to drug misusers. It is for boards to decide how best to provide enhanced services in their area, taking account of local circumstances.</p>

  <p>As the First Minister has made clear we have a strong commitment to extending the existing level of professionalism within the Scottish Executive. This includes the finance function, which is unified within the Executive under a Finance Director and already includes a number of professionally qualified staff.

  <p>The original publication contained an error on page 26, where it stated that the Justice savings would be &pound;28 million. The correct figure, given on page 4, is &pound;30 million. Page 25 of the Efficient Government Plan states that, overall (including the savings from health and local government), the potential savings from procurement amount to &pound;200 million. The outstanding &pound;70 million required to make the total of &pound;745 million will come from additional procurement savings in the Scottish public sector. These figures are the annually recurring cash-releasing efficiency savings from 2007-08. The figure of &pound;1.7 billion refers to the total amount of efficiency savings that will be saved over the three year period 2005-06 to 2007-08.</p>

This has considerable potential to achieve more efficient use of public expenditure.</p>

  <p>The terms of the project are to develop a long-term financial planning model for use within the Executive. The intention is to develop a long-term platform to enable consistency of assumptions and scenarios. This will enable better strategic decision making and control within the Executive which will allow targeting of resources to where they will achieve greatest value.

  <p>The Executive remains deeply concerned about the continuing high incidence of knife crime and its contribution to violent crime. The role of knives and other weapons in homicides and assaults needs urgent and effective action. Accordingly the Executive has been reviewing knife crime law and enforcement, as promised in the Partnership Agreement. The First Minister in his statement on 22 November 2004 set out a programme of measures which we believe will tackle the impact of knife crime across Scotland today. One of the measures in this five-point plan is a proposal to ban the general sale of swords.</p>

  <p>The Executive will be consulting on these proposals early in 2005. We recognise that, in strengthening the law on the sale, ownership and use of swords, exceptions may have to be built into the legislation to cover legitimate aspects on sword use and ownership, for example for sporting or cultural purposes.</p>

  <p>The grant &quot;floor&quot; is set to provide all councils with a guaranteed minimum year-on-year increase in Aggregate External Finance (AEF). The level of the floor is set with reference to the average annual increase in AEF and provides a safety net to ensure that no council&rsquo;s AEF falls below the minimum prescribed increase, but also to allow the AEF distribution needs-based formula to take effect for the majority of councils.</p>

  <p>The minimum floor level for 2005-06 was set at 3.4% in the last three year settlement when the average increase which applied at that time was 4.9% and has not been revised as a result of the current settlement. For 2006-07 and 2007-08 the average year on year increases in AEF are 3.3% and 2.3% and the floor has provisionally been set at 2% and 1.75% respectively. The increases in AEF provided for those councils who would otherwise fall below the floor level are offset by reductions in the grants to those councils above the floor, based on their relative share of the total AEF. Setting the floor at a higher level would require other councils to contribute more, and place more councils at the floor level, thereby reducing the impact of the needs-based distribution formula.</p>

  <p>The methodology for calculating the minimum grant &quot;floor&quot; is agreed in consultation with COSLA following consideration and recommendations from the official level Three Year Settlement Group whose membership is made up of local authority, COSLA and Scottish Executive representatives.

  <p>The distribution of AEF is based on a needs-based formula. Local authorities with below average increases have therefore been assessed as having reduced expenditure needs compared to those with above average increases. Reduced needs can result from lower population levels, reduced numbers of schoolchildren or a range of other indications, and authorities should adjust their service provision to reflect those reduced needs.</p>

  <p>The outcome of Spending Review 2004 is a robust settlement for local authorities and builds on the large increases provided in previous settlements. This settlement is based on increases in Grant Aided Expenditure which assume council tax increases of 2.5% in 2006-07 and 2007-08. Local authorities have already estimated that council tax levels will increase by around 4.5% in 2005-06, but I have made it clear that I would expect all local authorities to keep council tax increases to reasonable levels.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the fact that Dundee City Council, Glasgow City Council and West Dunbartonshire Council received a minimum grant increase in AEF this year and have the highest levels of poverty and deprivation in Scotland, what action it is taking to ensure that these local authorities are able to address poverty and deprivation issues.</p>

  <p>The local government revenue grant is distributed by a needs based system which takes account of a range of factors, particularly population changes. Authorities with declining population will tend to require lower total increases in grant. However, the distribution formula also takes account of the impact of deprivation on the costs of service delivery. There are 16 assessments within the formula, such as those for Social Work and Education, that include deprivation adjustments. In addition, the provision for local authority expenditure through Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) allocations for Education Deprivation amounts to &pound;56.7 million in 2005-06 and allocates &pound;1.6 million, &pound;32.9 million and &pound;1.7 million to Dundee City, Glasgow City and West Dunbartonshire Councils respectively. The total for this GAE rises to &pound;57.8 million in 2006-07 and &pound;59.0 million in 2007-08. In addition to this, a number of important social work assessments are influenced by health indicators which reflect deprivation.</p>

  <p>There are a range of other funds available that address poverty and deprivation including specific programmes such as the &pound;318 million Community Regeneration Fund (2005-08); &pound;20 million Working for Families Fund (2004-06, and &pound;1,207 million for Supporting People (2005-08). The individual allocations to Dundee City, Glasgow City and West Dunbartonshire for each of these funds are shown in the table below:</p>

  <p>The responsibility for the recruitment of all staff in NHSScotland is managed locally by each of the individual NHS boards across Scotland. However, the Executive is pursing several initiatives on behalf of the health service on a Scotland wide basis which will enable NHS boards to improve their ability to recruit and retain consultant staff in specialties where there is currently a shortage.</p>

  <p>A short-life working group is currently assessing a range of retention initiatives, with particular emphasis on crucial shortage areas that includes radiology.</p>

  <p>This activity is all taking place within a background of Scottish, United Kingdom and, indeed global, shortages in some specialties that includes Radiology.</p>

  <p>The requirements for, and the development of, nursing roles is primarily a matter for individual NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The Executive are committed to providing national leadership on workforce design, new roles and new ways of working, and workload across the health workforce. This strand of work is part of the National Workforce Committee agenda.</p>

  <p>In addition, a consultation paper on role development which includes a framework for Developing Nursing Roles has been out for consultation. This draft framework provides principles that underpin nursing roles and states that adequate support, resources and training require to be provided. We are currently reviewing the outcome of this consultation exercise however, NHSScotland is already finding this draft framework useful in helping them plan and organise role development within nursing. This work has been integrated into the work of the National Workforce Committee, Workforce Design sub-committee.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what input it has had to the proposed UK Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill; under what circumstances it is envisaged that the Home Secretary will be able to direct chief constables in Scotland under the terms of the bill, and what representations it has made, or proposes to make, regarding section 25 of the bill.</p>

  <p>We have had substantial input to the Serious Organised Crime and Police Bill and that will continue as the bill goes through its Parliamentary Stages in the UK Parliament. As regards clause 25 of the bill, amendments were tabled on 21 December to restrict the provisions in that clause to England, Wales and Northern Ireland. A new clause was also tabled to give Scottish ministers equivalent powers to those in clause 25 as regards Scottish police forces and the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency.</p>

  <p>The Schools Estate Strategy <em>Building our Future: Scotland&rsquo;s School Estate</em> which was published jointly by the Scottish Executive and COSLA in 2002, and many of our subsequent publications in support of that strategy, highlight the importance of sustainability. Specific procurement guidance on sustainability is also available from the Executive&rsquo;s Scottish Procurement Directorate.</p>

  <p>We ran a workshop at Glencoe last July on sustainability and the school estate, and have just launched a new publication entitled &quot;Sustainability&quot; which not only outlines how to achieve a sustainable school but also offers a number of examples of recent good practice in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Final detailed decisions, though, on the design and specification of new schools remain the responsibility of education authorities.</p>

  <p>The continuation of Quality of Life &ndash; supported by an additional &pound;100 million over 2006-07 to 2007-08 period &ndash; reflects our ongoing commitment to focus on improving the environment and promoting community well-being of communities across Scotland. The Quality of Life fund will continue to allow councils and their partners to be responsive to local needs and to build safer, stronger communities.</p>

  <p>Other additional funding sources are also available for local authorities and other public bodies to support the type of activities with which the Quality of Life fund has historically been involved. For example, &pound;95 million has been committed to tackle anti-social behaviour in 2004-06. The new Community Regeneration Fund being administered by Community Planning Partnerships - &pound;104 million in 2005-06 - contributes to quality of life activities. There is also &pound;24.1 million of funding available in 2005-06 to education authorities for the Hungry for Success initiative used to promote healthy eating and good nutrition in schools.</p>

  <p>Unique category drugs recommended by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) must be made available uniformly across Scotland. The NHS executive membership on the SMC will agree a national implementation plan for these products. Normally, these drugs should be provided to meet clinical need within three months of publication of the SMC advice. However, this implementation period may be varied if this is necessary, for example, where there is a requirement to establish an audit. All NHS boards will be required to follow the national implementation plan for these drugs. Local NHS boards will agree the implementation plan for drugs where alternative drug treatment already exists.</p>

  <p>Scotland has national physical activity targets for adults and children and swimming can make a contribution to daily activity.</p>

  <p>As part of the National Physical Activity Strategy for Scotland, the Scottish Executive has committed &pound;24 million funding to <strong></strong>sportscotland to develop Active Schools in Scotland. Active school co-ordinators will build opportunities for school pupils to engage in physical activity including swimming.</p>

  <p>Scottish Swimming features in the Active Schools Training Guide offering a range of courses for potential activity leaders.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working in partnership with Scottish Swimming, to develop a new resource supporting active lifestyles. The resource, for use at poolside, is directed at target groups that may not be reached by commercial products already on the market. The first phase of the programme targets adults aged 25 to 40.</p>

  <p>The promotion from next year of Edinburgh and the Lothians as a leisure tourism destination will from April 2005 be the responsibility of the VisitScotland network office in Edinburgh, while business tourism in the area will be promoted by the city&rsquo;s Convention Bureau, being set up jointly by Edinburgh City Council and VisitScotland. In addition, Edinburgh will continue to feature prominently in VisitScotland&rsquo;s national marketing campaigns.</p>

  <p>Tourism business and local authority involvement in these new marketing arrangements is crucial to their success. VisitScotland&rsquo;s total budget in 2004-05 for marketing Edinburgh stands at just under &pound;2 million, with a further &pound;668,000 specifically allocated to business tourism promotion of the city. VisitScotland will maintain this level of marketing spend in 2005-06, and in addition, Edinburgh will benefit from VisitScotland&rsquo;s new city/rural campaign which will equate to a further &pound;2 million of marketing spend. Edinburgh and Lothians business groups will also be able to access the recently announced Challenge Fund of &pound;1 million on top of the above amounts.</p>

  <p>The current operating budget for all of the Area Tourist Boards taken together shows an expected deficit of just under &pound;2 million in the current financial year. Funding for the VisitScotland network offices next year will come from local authorities, VisitScotland itself, European funds and tourism businesses. Although businesses will no longer pay membership fees, income is expected to be generated from the sale of a range of products and services available across the network.</p>

  <p>The tourism network project team is on target to produce a first draft business plan for the tourism network by 31 December 2004. The initial indications are that, once efficiencies to be gained from network integration are achieved, the tourism network will be sustainable.</p>
