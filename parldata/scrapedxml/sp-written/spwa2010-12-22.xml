  <p>Depending on the habitat and land use of a particular area, apart from the sealing end compound required at each end of an undergrounded stretch of transmission line, the majority of environmental effects will be during construction.</p>

  <p>While there can be no guarantee that the area affected will be perfectly returned to its pre-construction condition, any undergrounding of the main Beauly to Denny line would be undertaken in accordance with the appropriate environmental regulations and best practice to ensure that its impact was minimised.</p>

  <p>The next critical step in the distribution of funds under the 2008 act is the order to be made by the UK Government for the apportionment of the funds between UK administrations. We understand that the UK Government plans to open the consultation on the apportionment under section 17 of the act in January and the subsequent affirmative order will be laid before the UK Parliament in early spring.</p>

  <p>The Scottish plans for distribution, as I outlined to the Economy, Energy and Tourism Committee in June 2010, depend to some extent on the level of funds which will be available. Current indications are that the total amount for distribution is likely to be lower than expected and the reclaim company may well release those funds more slowly. I will report to the Parliament once these issues, which are principally matters for the UK Government, have been resolved.</p>

  <p>Our best estimate is that the BIG Lottery Fund may be able to release some funds in late summer 2011.</p>

  <p>Determining areas of priority for fuel deliveries is a matter for fuel distribution companies based on their customer needs and demands. During times of fuel disruption, Scotland&rsquo;s fuel distribution companies work very closely with the Scottish Government, local authorities and other key stakeholders to monitor and maintain key fuel deliveries. However, it is normal practice for heating fuel distributors to prioritise fuel for their vulnerable customers and those who have run out.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s recent consultation paper &quot;Securing the Benefits of Scotland&rsquo;s Next Energy Revolution&quot; argued that the Crown Estate Commissioners in Scotland should be more accountable to the people of Scotland and maximise the economic impact from our unique renewables resource. In this particular case, the Scottish Government is fully aware of the decisions taken by the Crown Estate Commissioners. It is not the case that the Crown Estate Commissioners have imposed a moratorium on development activity, but they have indicated that they are taking a cautionary approach at the present time on the award of any additional leases. This approach is driven by the need to gain a greater understanding of key development issues. The Scottish Government supports a marine planning approach which encourages development in the most appropriate locations and minimises cumulative impacts, while not ruling out projects in areas that will not adversely impact on existing leaseholders, or the environment. The Scottish Government would wish the Crown Estate Commissioners to consider all mechanisms and options to enable leases for wave and tidal developments to proceed consistent with the long-term opportunities for the area.</p>

  <p>Very little is known at present about the ways in which marine renewables developments within a particular zone or region will interact. These are among a range of important issues which the Scottish Government, the Crown Estate Commissioners, technology developers and other key stakeholders are dealing with through the work of the Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters Delivery Group. Future licensing of marine renewables activities will take account of the interaction between those activities and their environment.</p>

  <p>Applications to Scottish ministers for power stations, and those for significant power lines, needs to be accompanied by an Environmental Statement (ES), which describes the effects the development is likely to have on the environment.</p>

  <p>Carbon Payback calculations are included within the ES documentation and during the consultation period the application, and the environmental statement, are made available locally for public inspection.</p>

  <p>Specific information on individual or aggregated applications is not maintained centrally, however, a copy of each environmental statement for each wind farm is retained and is available for inspection at any time within the Scottish Government library at Victoria Quay, Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government funded a study in 2007 to scope out the potential carbon impacts of wind farm development on peat. This study developed guidance and a method to calculate carbon emission savings associated with wind farm developments on peat using a full life cycle analysis approach.</p>

  <p>(a) Yes - developers are encouraged to use the guidance above and its calculator when preparing formal applications for section 36 consent.</p>

  <p>The carbon emissions from a wind farm development, and the predicted carbon payback, clearly represent an impact on the natural environment, and so consideration of this impact is included within a submission to ministers whenever such a calculation has been provided within the Environmental Statement. These impacts represent a material consideration in respect of both the natural environment and the Scottish Government&rsquo;s obligations under the Climate Change Act 2008.</p>

  <p>Scotland has a robust consenting system and Scottish ministers will always seek to strike the right balance between developing and delivering Scotland&rsquo;s energy future and protecting environmental, cultural heritage, economic and community issues.</p>

  <p>At the first Apprenticeship Summit in April 2009, employers told us of the additional barriers small and medium-sized enterprises (SME) can face in engaging with the modern apprenticeship (MA) programme in Scotland. Skills Development Scotland (SDS) have made efforts and progress has been made through &quot;Supporting Business through Recovery&quot; initiatives to ensure that all businesses have better information about the modern apprenticeship programme and that they are actively encouraged to take part. We know that 39 micro businesses that employ fewer than 10 people have offered MA places to 62 employees through the &quot;Invest in a Micro Business&quot; initiative.</p>

  <p>At the start of 2010, SDS ran a radio campaign specifically to raise awareness of the MA programme with SMEs and The Scottish Government, in partnership with SDS, introduced an apprenticeship grant to further incentivise the MA programme for SMEs.</p>

  <p>SMEs can also benefit from the Adopt an Apprentice and Safeguard an apprentice schemes. These are designed to ensure apprentices are supported to complete their training during the economic downturn. Safeguard is targeted specifically at SMEs and last available figures indicate 105 small companies have taken advantage of this initiative, offering training to 356 individuals.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland is committed to driving tourism growth in Perthshire and will continue to do so in 2011 by promoting Perthshire in key national and local marketing campaigns and communications with consumers at home and abroad.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland will do this by working in partnership with individual businesses, public agencies, and local authorities to target consumers though marketing, information and inspiration, and quality to maximise the economic benefits of tourism to the area.</p>

  <p>Marketing activity includes publications such as the Perthshire, Angus and Dundee <em>Where to Stay</em> and <em>What to See and Do</em> guides; VisitScotland.com and Perthshire.co.uk websites; marketing activities on seasonal campaigns such as Perfect Day, My Scotland and Winter White; consumer e-zines and e-newsletters and of course providing additional information and inspiration through the six VisitScotland Information Centres (VIC) based in Perthshire.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland and Scottish Enterprise work closely with various key stakeholders in Perthshire including Highland Perthshire Destination Management Organisation, Atholl Estates, Gleneagles Hotel, Horsecross Arts Ltd, Nae Limits, Pitlochry Festival Theatre and Scone Estates. These key tourism organisations have received advice and support on strategy development, business planning, training and product development, marketing and promotion and are key partners in helping Scotland and Perthshire increase it&rsquo;s the visitor offering on the global tourism market.</p>

  <p>In order to increase partnership working and further improve the promotion of Perthshire as a tourism destination I facilitated three stakeholder sessions (in Birnam on 15 July 2010, Crieff on 23 November 2010 and Pitlochry on 20 December 2010) with tourism businesses and organisations in the area that are keen to develop and improve their product.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland, Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise work extensively with whisky attractions and retailers to help promote whisky tourism in Perthshire and across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Whisky features across a great range of VisitScotland&rsquo;s promotion of Scotland, including Perthshire, in their marketing campaigns both domestically and abroad, across brochures, websites, PR activity and a variety of other communications to consumers. This is particularly so during our yearlong focus on Scotland&rsquo;s Food and Drink in the lead up to the second Year of Homecoming in 2014.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland and the enterprise agencies in partnership with The Scotch Whisky Association and The Scotch Whisky Experience supported the establishment of Scotlandwhisky.com, a dedicated site exploring where tourism and whisky can work together. It allows visitors and potential visitors to search for local distilleries, whisky tours, and promotes local whisky festivals and events across Scotland including Perthshire.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland works with several Perthshire based distilleries to provide visitors with special promotions some of which also link to other tourism businesses and activities. These offers are promoted through VisitScotland Information Centre&rsquo;s, websites and other dedicated marketing activities.</p>

  <p>Whisky attractions such as Dewar&rsquo;s world of whisky in Aberfeldy and Edradour in Pitlochry feature in VisitScotland guides and brochures, marketing campaigns such as Winter White. Several whisky and local distilleries also feature in VisitScotland&rsquo;s What To See And Do guide for the area.</p>
