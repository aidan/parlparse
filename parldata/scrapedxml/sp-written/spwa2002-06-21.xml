  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service announced its current plans for the conversion of some on-call stations to full-time working earlier this year. In coming to its decision, the service took the joint working party&#8217;s views into account. Ambulance stations at Fraserburgh, Dunoon and Stranraer will be converted from part-time to full-time working in 2002-03 and at Balfron, Annan and Peterhead in 2003-04.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive on what grounds it concluded that East Lothian did not need to submit a formal planning application for consideration by the Scottish ministers for the extension to Aberlady Primary School to be funded by a section 75 agreement with Cala homes and whether such grounds took account of public opposition to the style and nature of the proposed extension.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-06-21.4.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80171" speakername="Hugh Henry" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0621.htm#4">

  <p>As planning authorities are not allowed to grant themselves planning permission, they are required to submit details of the proposed development to the Scottish ministers for consideration as a Notice of Intention to Develop (NID).</p>

  <p>The Scottish ministers will normally make a presumption against calling for a formal application from a local authority where the proposed development either accords with the approved local plan for the area or has not attracted a significant body of objections. In the case of the extension to Aberlady Primary School, the proposal was considered to be in accord with the local plan and only six letters of representation were received. The detailed design matters relating to the extension of Aberlady Primary School are essentially for the planning authority, taking into account local circumstances and any relevant guidance. The Scottish ministers therefore did not consider that there was sufficient justification for intervention in this case.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what organisations were consulted before the ScotXed questionnaire was distributed and whether the Catholic Church was included in those organisations.</p>

  <p>The information required by the Scottish Executive Education Department (SEED) to be collected through the Scottish Exchange of Educational Data (ScotXed) for the September 2002 School Census is detailed on the ScotXed website:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.svtc.org.uk/scotxed/" target="_blank">http://www.svtc.org.uk/scotxed/</a>.</p>

  <p>Most of this information is already routinely collected by schools and local authorities and held on existing management information systems.</p>

  <p>As a result, there is no &quot;ScotXed questionnaire&quot; as such, although, at the request of local authorities, SEED produced a template to assist schools and local authorities with the collection of information on the ethnic background and national identity of pupils. A number of local authorities have decided to adapt this template to collect additional information for their own internal use on main home language and religious affiliation.</p>

  <p>SEED does not collect this additional information, which is purely a matter for the local authority concerned. Accordingly, we have not included the Catholic Church or other religious institutions in consultations on ScotXed.</p>

  <p>The strategic planning for the ScotXed project is undertaken by the School Education Information Advisory Group (SEIAG), which has endorsed plans for the 2002 Scottish School Census and beyond. The SEIAG membership includes representatives of: the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland, COSLA, the Headteacher&#8217;s Association of Scotland, the Association of Head Teachers in Scotland, the Educational Institute of Scotland, the Scottish Secondary Teacher&#8217;s Association, the Scottish Qualifications Authority, Learning and Teaching Scotland, and HM Inspectorate of Education.</p>

  <p>Consultations have also taken place with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, the Scottish Parent Teacher Council and with the Scottish School Board Association who have publicly welcomed the project. Regular consultations take place with each local authority.</p>

  <p>We are at the early stages of discussion of service level agreements or protocols with the police, which will build upon less formal discussions which have taken place over many years. Timeliness of reporting is discussed where appropriate with other reporting agencies as part of the normal liaison process.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how often it has waived the need for local authorities to submit a formal planning application for development of an authority&#8217;s own buildings since 1 July 1999 and what criteria it uses in order to reach such a decision.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-06-21.16.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80171" speakername="Hugh Henry" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0621.htm#8">

  <p>The Notice of Intention to Develop (NID) procedure applies where a local authority requires planning permission for a development which it proposes to carry out. Where an objection is received, the authority is required to submit details of the proposal for consideration by the Scottish ministers. There is a presumption against requiring a local authority to submit a formal planning application unless the proposal is contrary to the local plan or has attracted a substantial body of objections.</p>

  <p>However, the NID submissions can cover a wide range of local authority developments, including many that do not involve buildings (for example, car parks, roads and sewers). Details of NID submissions that relate only to buildings are not held separately and could therefore only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, not all local authority developments are notified through the NID procedure. In cases where developments are to benefit from an element of private funding, the applicant may not be the local authority and therefore the NID procedure is not appropriate. These developments are subject to normal planning application procedures. It would be difficult to identify specifically which of these applications involved local authority buildings and again this information could only be provided at disproportionate cost.</p>
