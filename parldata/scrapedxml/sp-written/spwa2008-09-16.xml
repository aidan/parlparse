It is for the commission, which is independent of government, to weigh up the evidence and representations received in determining the outcome of its inquiry.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service has been running programmes to improve the wellbeing of its workforce and control sickness absence for a number of years. These include a range of &quot;working well&quot; initiatives together with stringent application of the management of sickness absence policy and procedures, linked to close monitoring and reporting of sickness absence and its reasons. The service also benefits from the initiatives at national level to promote and share good practice in promoting attendance and managing sickness absence.</p>

  <p>The service recorded a rate of 5.2% for the month of June 2008, this is a significant reduction on their June 2007 figure which was 6%.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is investing record levels of funding in local government, &pound;34.9 billion over the period 2008-11. Education authorities have the flexibility to allocate the resources available to them to meet their local needs and priorities. This includes providing for pupils for whom English is not their first language and meeting their duties under the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 which requires education authorities to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all pupils for whom English is an additional language.</p>

  <p>In addition, we continue to encourage schools and colleges to work in partnership to meet the needs of learners. As part of our adult English for speakers of other languages (ESOL) strategy for Scotland, the Scottish Government and the Scottish Funding Council have recently allocated &pound;2.7 million of additional funding to community learning and development partnerships and colleges, along with advice encouraging them to develop ESOL for families and actively link with schools as one of the key priorities.</p>

  <p>The Homecoming Scotland Events Guide currently lists all events that are being directly funded through the Homecoming project. Funding has been allocated through three programmes: the Signature Programme; the Themed Events Programme, and the Rolling Programme. The criteria to judge the suitability of events was their fit with the five pillars of Homecoming - Burns, Golf, Whisky, Great Scottish Minds and Innovations, and Ancestry - and their ability to attract visitors and generate interest in the Homecoming. In particular, the eligibility criteria for the Themed Events Programme were given in the leaflet produced by EventScotland for applicants for event support. These criteria were that applications would be assessed on their demonstrated ability to reflect the Homecoming Scotland objectives and themes, and against the eligibility criteria outlined below:</p>

  <p>Events must take place in Scotland during 2009 between 25 January and 30 November (inclusive).</p>

  <p>Applications had to be made by a legally constituted organisation.</p>

  <p>Both new and existing events could apply. Applications had to demonstrate that the funds applied for would develop new, special activity for 2009.</p>

  <p>Existing events must demonstrate their capacity to further develop and grow in terms of audience/participant numbers and impact in 2009.</p>

  <p>The level of grant applied for must be supported by a clear business case that justifies the request.</p>

  <p>All applications had to demonstrate a robust means for measuring event outcomes, in particular tourism additionality and engagement with the Scottish diaspora.</p>

  <p>All applications had to have the support of the relevant local authority and other appropriate agencies/partners/organisations.</p>

  <p>It was not intended that an award from Homecoming Scotland would provide the majority of funding for any supported event. Applicants were therefore required to secure additional event income from alternative sources.</p>

  <p>Homecoming Scotland could not offer replacement funding, e.g. to fill a budget gap created by the withdrawal of another funding source.</p>

  <p>Funding available through Homecoming Scotland was distinct from funding currently available through EventScotland&rsquo;s Regional and International Programmes which are targeted at supporting the long-term strategic growth and development of events.</p>

  <p>Organisations applying to Homecoming Scotland could also, where appropriate, apply to EventScotland&rsquo;s Regional and International Programmes.</p>

  <p>The spend profile and allocation of the &quot;up to &pound;100 million&quot; has yet to be finalised. In allocating this accelerated funding we will prioritise bringing forward new construction but will also spend on off the shelf units and land acquisitions where this is strategically sensible and offers good value for money. Allocations will be made to projects rather than to specific local authority areas.</p>

  <p>Ultimately, the level of fares is a matter for individual bus operators who use their own commercial judgement in these matters. Scottish Government support for bus services is considerable, amounting to some &pound;280 million per year. This substantial investment is intended to help the industry drive down costs, encourage more routes and enable more older and disabled people to use these important services. Following the budget statement by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth on 6 February 2008 I can confirm that it is our intention that the budget for the Bus Service Operators Grant will be around &pound;61 million in 2008-09.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government therefore does not hold data on numbers of accredited installers, broken down by local authority area. Details of Scottish installers accredited under MCS are available on BERR&rsquo;s Low Carbon Buildings Programme website at:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government undertakes an annual teacher workforce planning exercise at a national level to ensure there are sufficient numbers of teachers in publicly funded schools. The exercise takes account of pupil projections and numbers of teachers leaving and entering the profession. Secondary subjects are placed in priority categories for intake to courses of initial teacher education based on a number of factors such as the vacancy levels and the number of places offered by authorities for particular subjects on the teacher induction scheme. Modern languages has been a top priority subject for a number of years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also carries out a teacher vacancy survey each February. The latest survey in February 2008 shows that only 0.3% of the full complement of teaching posts in modern languages were vacant over three months. Vacancies over three months are usually taken as an indicator of teacher shortage as it discounts the normal turnover of staff.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers received a copy of the RPS Ecology report commissioned by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) on its publication in June 2006. At that time, SNH objected to the proposal. Subsequently the developer submitted further information which enabled SNH to lift their objection, subject to conditions being imposed. Scottish ministers determined the Gordonbush application, taking into account the subsequent SNH advice and other relevant consultee responses.</p>
