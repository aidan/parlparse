  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-2684 by Susan Deacon on 10 December 1999, whether, given the different testing regimes for amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) being used in Scotland and Northern Ireland, it is complying with the statement in EU Directive 91/492/EEC that &quot;the placing on the market of live molluscs should no longer be hindered by disparities existing in the Member States in respect of health requirements&quot; and what discussions it has had with Her Majesty's Government or the Northern Ireland authorities regarding a common testing regime for ASP.</p>

  <p>The issue of different parts of scallops being tested for amnesic shellfish poisoning by different authorities within the EU was considered by the EC Standing Veterinary Committee at a meeting held on 14-15 December. It was agreed at the meeting that this matter should be considered by an Expert Group and then taken forward to the meeting of EU reference laboratories and national laboratories for monitoring marine biotoxins scheduled for March 2000.</p>

  <p>Our proposals for the Census in Scotland on 29 April 2001 are contained in the draft Census (Scotland) Order 2000 which I have laid before Parliament today.</p>

  <p>In deciding which topics to cover we have consulted widely, and taken full account of Scottish circumstances, the UK Government&#8217;s proposals made in March in the White Paper (Cm 4253), and all representations made to us since the May elections. The draft Order balances the cases made for specific topics by Census users against the public acceptability of the questions, whether or not they can be asked in a way that gives reliable information, and alternative methods of collecting information.</p>

  <p>In addition to the questions asked in the 1991 Census, we propose to ask new questions on carers, general health and the year of last employment. Other questions will be extended &#8211; for example the question on workplace and means of travel to work will not just cover those working but will also cover students and schoolchildren for their place of study. The question on ethnicity will be extended to cover mixed ethnic groups. The question on relationships within households will collect additional information beyond the relationship to the head of household which allows more detailed family and household classifications to be used in Census results.</p>

  <p>A number of cases for questions have been rejected after careful consideration. We concluded that there is not a sufficiently strong case in Scotland to collect information on religion through the Census to supplement the proposed question on ethnic group. Nevertheless, we are alive to concerns expressed about religious discrimination. That is why in developing our Equality Strategy we will work to foster tolerance and promote understanding of religious beliefs and practices. As part of the wider research and information strategy on equality and social inclusion we will undertake further work such as sample surveys to provide better information about minority cultural sub-groups. In taking that forward we will consult with the Commission for Racial Equality, the Scottish Inter Faith Council and others.</p>

  <p>We have also decided not to propose a question on personal income. Despite strong support for the question from a number of users, we have concluded that the inclusion of an income question would mean that the risk to the overall response to the Census was unacceptably high. There is also doubt about the quality of the information that could be collected. Recognising the strength of support for this topic we intend to pursue further the availability of DSS benefit data for small areas and other ways of producing estimates of income by area.</p>

  <p>The proposals for the 2001 Census laid before the Parliament today will provide a wealth of priority statistical information on Scotland, local and health authorities, and local communities which will underpin the development and monitoring of policies by the Scottish Parliament and other bodies in the new millennium.</p>

  <p>The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) last met on 29 November. Their advice was made publicly available at a press briefing on 22 December. Copies are now available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe). On the two main issues considered at the meeting, SEAC advised no change to the over 30 month rule at this time, and also that the ban on the feeding of porcine meat and bone meal in poultry feed should continue.</p>
