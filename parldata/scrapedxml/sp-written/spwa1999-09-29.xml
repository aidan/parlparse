  <p>It has not been the policy of successive governments to compensate for losses incurred due to disease or other natural phenomena in the fisheries sector. However, the Scottish Executive is currently consulting on the terms of EU structural assistance in the fisheries sector for the future. The availability of funds will be limited, but the option of compensation for scallop farmers could be considered in the course of this consultation.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-383 by Mr John Home Robertson on 2 July, how many Scottish Fishery Protection Agency (SFPA) crew hours per annum the surveillance effort in the 6,000 square miles of previously SFPA patrolled seas, which now fall under the exclusive jurisdiction of the Royal Navy, involved prior to this transfer of responsibility and whether it will confirm that the SFPA&#8217;s workforce will not be reduced as a consequence of this transfer.</p>

  <p>As I explained in my reply of 2 July, the area in question required very little attention from our patrol vessels. That judgement was based on traditional fishing patterns and information from aerial surveillance. Only six fishing vessels were sighted in that area by the SFPA&#8217;s patrol vessels during the year ending 31 March 99.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to calculate this patrol effort in terms of precise crew hours.</p>

  <p>The transfer of their minimal patrolling responsibility to the Royal Navy will have no significant effect on the workload of the SFPA.</p>

  <p>Some 92 per cent of UK aquaculture production is based in Scotland where it makes a major contribution to the rural economy, particularly in the Highlands and Islands. Farm gate values were around &pound;260-275m in 1996 and 1997 (data for 1998 is not currently available), supporting around 2200-2300 direct jobs, full-time and part-time. The processing sector adds around a further &pound;230-240m annually.</p>

These estimates are not available by local authority area.

  <p>The Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information is based closely on the UK Government's Code of Practice on Access to Government Information. The Code was introduced in this form to ensure that openness arrangements were in place from 1 July 1999. As the Code represents an interim measure pending legislation on freedom of information (the proposals for which will be the subject of wide consultation), no amendments to the Code are currently being considered. We will however be monitoring the operation of the Code and will present a report to Parliament next year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to review the law relating to the granting of security over moveable property.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-09-29.21.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80252" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa0929.htm#1719">

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises that there is a perception that businesses in Scotland are being inhibited in raising capital because, under Scots law, they cannot create a security over moveable property without giving up possession of that property. In addition, although the mechanism of floating charges is used extensively by companies in Scotland to obtain finance, it is thought to have some disadvantages. In certain circumstances, the floating charge holder may receive less than the debt owed to him. The Scottish Executive also acknowledges that this is an extremely complex issue.</p>

  <p>Consequently, the Scottish Executive has decided to commission research into the matter. This will determine the extent of problems being faced by Scottish businesses.</p>

  <p>The intention is that the research would be completed by the end of year 2000 and that it would inform the preparation of policy proposals, which would be the subject of consultation in the following year.</p>

  <p>By taking this issue forward in a considered manner, the Scottish Executive hopes that a solution will be found that will provide benefit to businesses operating in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The problem of poverty is not restricted to limited income, although this is a commonly used measure. According to data from the Family Resources Survey for 1996-97 and the subsequent Households Below Average Income analysis, approximately 300,000 children in Scotland were living in households with less than 50% of average Great Britain household income. There are currently no corresponding figures available at Local Authority area level.</p>

  <p>Under the 1997, 1998 and 1999 Sheep Annual Premium (SAP) Schemes, a total of 153 producers have had premium withheld, or been asked to repay subsidy payments, because of inadequate flock record keeping. Of that total, 67 producers were found to have present on their holding (on the day of the inspection) numbers of sheep greater than that on which SAP had been claimed.</p>

  <p>The rail Freight Facilities Grant scheme is executively devolved to Scottish Ministers. At present, there are no plans to review the scheme, for which &pound;6.1 million per annum has been allocated for the next three years.</p>

  <p>The U.K. Government intends to consult later this year on its intention to extend Freight Facilities Grant to coastal and short sea shipping movements. The Scottish Executive will be fully involved in this consultation. I would expect any extended scheme to apply to all British ports.</p>

  <p>The provision of local bus services in Renfrewshire and Inverclyde is a matter for the commercial judgement of individual bus operators and for local authorities where they identify a social need. The Scottish Executive recognises that in rural areas bus services can provide a very real lifeline. Support via our Rural Transport Funding package has been provided to Renfrewshire and Inverclyde Councils to help local authorities to provide additional public transport services which could not be provided commercially. <br /></p>
