  <p>16-year-olds are eligible for Modern Apprenticeships provided they are in employment and the training leads to a Scottish Vocational Qualification at level 3. There are currently no plans to extend Modern Apprenticeships to non-employment settings, including schools.

  <p>Funding for child protection is part of the general budgets of the many agencies involved such as Social Work Departments, health boards and the police, who have discretion to determine their own spending priorities. Expenditure specific to child protection is not therefore separately identified or monitored.</p>

  <p>Any increased costs associated with the new junior doctors&#146; contract reflect not just the numbers of junior doctors exceeding New Deal hours limits but also payments made in recognition of work intensity. It is not possible to calculate the cost of junior doctors working beyond hours limits alone.</p>

  <p>The new contract is intended to provide a strong financial incentive for NHS Trusts to reduce the hours worked by their doctors. Costs will reduce as trusts take action to achieve greater compliance with New Deal targets.</p>

  <p>Health boards were recently given their revenue allocations for 2001-02. The average increase in unified budgets is 6.5%. This is on top of significant increases in funding during 2000-01. It is the responsibility of health boards to determine local priorities for the use of funds including meeting the targets and standards of the New Deal for Junior Doctors.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for the relevant Drug Action Team (DAT) and its constituent agencies.</p>

  <p>I understand, however, that a number of measures are currently being developed by the team. A Prevalence and Risk Assessment Study on injecting drug users has recently been completed and will inform the future planning of services.</p>

  <p>The Executive has set a national target to reduce the proportion of drug misusers who inject by 20% by 2005 and DATs are required to set relevant local targets. We will be monitoring progress in meeting targets through annual DAT Corporate Action Plans. Plans for 2001-02 are currently in preparation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not maintain comprehensive records on the number of electronics businesses opened in Scotland. However, the Executive is aware of the following:</p>

  <p>1998-99 - four opened and are located in Livingston, Irvine and Bathgate;</p>

  <p>1999-2000 - four opened and are located in Glasgow, Port Glasgow, Glenrothes and Clydebank.</p>

  <p>The main form of financial assistance provided by the Executive to businesses investing in the Assisted Areas of Scotland is through Regional Selective Assistance (RSA). In addition, the SMART and SPUR schemes support small- and medium-sized businesses across Scotland to undertake research and development.</p>

  <p>Through these programmes, grants amounting to &#163;20.8 million in the financial year 1998-99, &#163;17.3 million in 1999-2000 and &#163;30.7 million in 2000-01 were paid to companies in the electronics sector in Scotland. Of this total of &#163;68.8 million, some 96% was paid out under the RSA scheme.</p>

  <p>It is not the department&#146;s practice to list individual grant payments made to firms. However details of all offers of RSA involving grant over &#163;75,000 are listed in the Office of National Statistics&#146; quarterly <i>Labour Market Trends</i> after the first payment of grant has been made. This publication is held in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>None. Scottish Borders Council initiated its local emergency plan and acted upon this in conjunction with Scottish Power, Lothian and Borders Police and other emergency services. Throughout the emergency, officials kept in close touch with Scottish Power and submitted regular reports to ministers to keep them apprised of the overall response to the emergency situation. It will be a matter for Scottish Borders Council to review their emergency planning arrangements to see what, if anything, might be improved.</p>

  <p>Grant offers to call centre projects are subject to the normal criteria of the Regional Selective Assistance grant scheme including location, investment, jobs, need, viability and private sector investment. However, grant offers in respect of call centre projects will typically require the assisted jobs to be maintained for longer periods than are specified for other types of projects assisted under the scheme.</p>

  <p>The strategy for enterprise &quot;A Smart Successful Scotland&quot; places skills and learning at the heart of the activities of the Enterprise Networks. This strategic focus on raising skills levels and better matching skills and opportunities is relevant in all sectors and industries, including the call centre sector. Higher and further education institutions offer a wide range of learning opportunities and skills training designed to respond to current and future labour market needs.</p>

  <p>In addition, a number of further education colleges offer tailored call centre training and Local Enterprise Companies use a range of training providers to meet the training needs of call centre employers. This includes specialised training, such as voice coaching, and a professional development award for call centres and employability skills, such as confidence building, team working, and IT skills. Higher education institutions provide language courses and some provide tailored courses for business and industry supporting a wide range of skill requirements. This includes provision aimed at the call centre market linking language and IT training with customer care and technical telephone skills.</p>

  <p>The allocated resources available to support the EQUAL Community Initiative for the years 2001 to 2006 amount to &#8364;365 million (approximately &#163;234 million) for Great Britain as a whole. A separate Scottish allocation amounting to &#8364;31,730 million (approximately &#163;20 million) has been agreed for the seven thematic priorities which will be administered by the Scottish Executive as Managing Authority. Scottish organisations will also have access to the asylum seekers thematic priority, which will be administered at the UK level.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to identify the estimated annual expenditure, as expenditure will vary from year to year depending upon the nature of the activities to be supported.</p>

  <p>The detail of financial allocations to individual projects will depend upon the Development Partnerships which come forward in the call for applications which is expected to be issued in June 2001.</p>

  <p>The present operator decided to withdraw from this freight shipping route with effect from 30 April. The Scottish Executive has recognised the contribution of the route for the export of livestock from Orkney. &#163;200,000 was allocated to the route under the Tariff Rebate Subsidy (TRS) scheme during 2000-01.</p>

  <p>The Executive confirmed in discussions with the operator and Orkney Islands Council before the service was withdrawn that a TRS allocation continued to be available for 2001-02, at the same assistance rate of 50% of shipping costs. This assistance will now be available to any alternative operator.</p>

  <p>The Foot-and-Mouth Disease (FMD) Impact Assessment Group which I announced on 8 March is providing ongoing advice to the Ministerial Committee for Rural Development FMD Sub-Group. Expert organisations such as VisitScotland, the Enterprise Networks and the Scottish Agricultural College have been feeding in very useful information which have helped inform the Ministerial Group on FMD&#146;s decisions on hardship relief and its thinking on recovery. To date much of that information has been qualitative and to provide more quantified information the group has recently commissioned a survey of over 2,000 businesses across Scotland to identify the outbreak&#146;s impact. The survey results are currently being collated and the final report will be published on 29 June. Copies of the report will be available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The NHS Scotland uses around 10 million needles a year at a cost of &#163;1.2 million. The individual cost of needles can vary widely from 2p for a replacement needle to over &#163;50 for specialised needles. On average a normal needle costs about 12p and retractable needles 27 to 30p. I recently launched the <i>Needlestick Injuries: Sharpen Your Awareness</i> report at the UNISON Scotland Conference and announced that the Scottish Executive would issue guidelines to NHS Scotland on the implementation of the report and would provide &#163;270,000 to support the report&#146;s recommendations for the introduction of safer needles based on risk assessment.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Public Authority dwellings include all dwellings owned by local authorities, Scottish Homes and New Towns (when in existence). Scottish Homes stopped building dwellings in 1992, and all New Towns were wound up by the end of 1995. Figures from 1996 onwards, therefore, include additions to the local authority stock only.</p>

  <p>2. The Scotland total for 1999 excludes figures for one local authority (Dumfries and Galloway) that has not yet submitted a return.</p>

  <p>The table above presents the new dwellings constructed for the <u>public sector</u> stock only, as requested. However, further additions were made to the <u>social rented</u> stock by housing associations, which completed a total of 29,367 dwellings throughout Scotland during the period 1990 to 1999.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive allocates substantial resources to the NHS throughout Scotland, with every health board receiving at least 5.5% more this year. The NHS locally is best placed to decide how to use these resources most effectively to support national priorities, including those set out in the framework, taking account of local circumstances.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. NHS Spend in Scotland for each year reported above relates to the financial year. For example, the figure reported for 1995 relates to the financial accounting period from April 1 1995 to March 31 1996.</p>

  <p>2. International comparisons of ratios of public expenditure to GDP use data on GDP at market prices. No data on GDP at market prices are available for Scotland but, to enable broad comparisons with ratios that have been calculated for other countries, estimates based on GDP at market prices have been derived. The methodology used is consistent with <i>Government Expenditure &amp; Revenue in Scotland</i>. This method implicitly assumes that the Scottish share of UK GDP at market prices (including North Sea oil output) is the same as the share of GDP at factor cost. Given the assumptions involved, the estimates should be treated with caution.</p>

  <p>3. Estimates for years after 1999 are not available. As the Scottish Executive does not produce forecasts of GDP growth, it is not possible to publish projections of ratios of public expenditure to GDP for the period after 1999.</p>

  <p>Over the period 1995 to 1999, expenditure on the NHS in Scotland as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product is estimated to have risen from 6.4% to 6.7%. This demonstrates the Scottish Executive&#146;s commitment to substantial increases in health spending over the duration of this Parliament.</p>

  <p>As further tangible evidence of this, the health budget is increasing from &#163;4.9 billion in 1999-2000 to &#163;6.7 billion in 2003-04. This represents a major investment in the NHS in Scotland by the Executive.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the standards of maintenance of trunk roads will change from 1 April 2001; if so, in what precise respects, and whether it will decline to award contracts to any private sector bidders for any trunk road unit contract unless it is satisfied that such bidders can provide, without a radio network, a service in winter emergency conditions which is fully comparable to the current service.</p>

  <p>The standards of maintenance contained within the new contracts are generally the same as specified in the existing contracts. In respect of the communications system specified in the contract, it is for the operators to examine carefully the technology they require to ensure safe communications across the unit.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the trunk road unit contract tender documents specified the number of snow blowers and snow ploughs which the successful contractors would be required to maintain and whether, for each unit area, award of the contract to a private sector bidder will allow the number of such vehicles to be reduced.</p>

  <p>The tender documents did not specify the type and number of plant which contractors have to provide for winter maintenance. The contractors are bound to meet the specification for the level of service set out in the contract. The Executive required bidders to declare, as part of their tenders, the minimum plant which they proposed to provide, where the proposed depots would be situated and the details of proposed gritting routes so that an assessment could be made of whether the service level could be met. The contracts require the declared plant to be provided, but the provision of that plant does not absolve the companies from the requirement to meet the specification for service level and the resource level necessary to achieve the specification. Snow ploughs and blowers will be provided in each of the new units.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive allocated &#163;53.7 million to the 48 Social Inclusion Partnerships (SIPs) and three New Life Urban Partnerships in 1999-2000. The grant claims are paid in arrears and claims for 1999-2000 are still being processed. We expect that expenditure by SIPs and New Life partnerships in 1999-2000 will total &#163;49.4 million. Of the unspent amount, &#163;1.5 million was carried forward to 2000-01.</p>

  <p>Allocations for 2000-01 totalled &#163;57.9 million, including the amounts carried forward from 1999-2000. Until the financial year is complete, we will not know how much of this allocation has been spent.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-12087 by Nicol Stephen on 4 January 2001, what progress has been made regarding the introduction in Scotland of provisions similar to those in clause 13 of the UK Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill.</p>

  <p>The provision referred to has now become Clause 14 of the Special Educational Needs and Disability Bill. Clause 14 requires local education authorities and schools in England and Wales to plan, to increase participation in the curriculum and physical access to school premises and also to improve the delivery of information for disabled pupils.</p>

  <p>The Executive is considering a number of legislative and other routes to give effect to the new duty in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The report (Supply of Teachers, Vol. 1 &#150; Jan 2001) details the background to the current position on the collection of information relevant to teacher supply and outlining planned improvements to current methods. Copies of this report have been made available to committee members and placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 10751). The answer to your question for primary and secondary can be found at Annex C of the report.</p>

  <p>There is no initial teacher education qualification in special educational needs and therefore no applications. A qualification in teaching children with special educational needs is an extension of the professional development of a teacher and is undertaken as in-service training.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises the importance of the telecommunications sector to Scotland. As an example, the recent consultation package on &quot;Planning and Radio Telecommunications&quot;, prompted by concerns about mobile phone masts, was drawn up in consultation with the telecommunications industry, among others. The revised planning controls for mobile phone masts should be in place by the middle of the year.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no such plans. The proposed review of National Planning Policy Guideline 2 on Business and Industry will consider the planning implications for business and industry development of advances in information and communications technology.</p>
