  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the average cost of orthodontic treatment per person is in each health board area when the treatment is provided by (a) the NHS and (b) private practices.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-10-03.4.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa1003.htm#9528">

  <p>The average cost of orthodontic treatment per patient when provided under NHS arrangements, by health board area for the year ending 31 March 2000, is shown in the table below. The costs may appear low as orthodontic treatment includes orthodontic examinations which a large number of patients receive without any subsequent treatment. In addition, orthodontic treatment may take a number of years to complete and dentists do not receive full payment for the treatment undertaken until it is complete, although they may receive interim payments.</p>

  <p>Information on the cost of orthodontic treatment when provided by private practices is not available.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s LFA scheme is based on the classification of individual farms. That classification takes account of soil fertility, climate, topography, altitude and location. My priority is to secure early European Commission agreement to the scheme. But as the scheme&#8217;s safety net declines, my intention is to refine the approach when various factors, including remoteness, can be reassessed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, as a competent authority, is required to operate within governing European and UK legislation on the deliberate release of genetically modified crops. Under European Directive 90/220/EEC, consent can only be refused where there is scientific evidence that a release will pose a risk to human health or environmental safety. Consent was granted for this site to participate in the trial programme following safety assurances from the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) that there are no unacceptable risks to public health and environmental safety were very low. If any evidence emerges to bring this decision into question we will review it, but at present there are no grounds on which to withdraw consent.</p>

  <p>My reply to question S1W-5177 concerned the increase in the amount of non-domestic rates income <u>distributed</u> to councils as part of their aggregate external finance for 2000-01, a composite calculation including surpluses and deficits from previous years not included in previous NDRI distributions. The &pound;1,550 million referred to in my reply to question S1W-5176 is the amount that it is estimated that councils will <u>collect</u> in NDRI during 2000-01 only.</p>

  <p>The amount of NDRI to be distributed is currently &pound;190 million higher than originally forecast, mainly due to updated information supplied by councils on previous years. Consequently, the amount of revenue support grant (RSG) required to make up the total aggregate external finance is &pound;190 million lower than forecast. Such savings in RSG will remain in the Departmental Expenditure Limit as a provision to cover requirements for additional RSG arising from the impact of NDR appeals, and for other adjustments. The position will be reviewed when the likely scale of appeals can be estimated more accurately.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s drive to improve the diet of young people is being taken forward in line with the Scottish Diet Action Plan, &quot;Eating for Health&quot;. A wide variety of action is underway at both national and local level, ranging from healthy eating campaigns targeting the young by the Health Education Board for Scotland, health boards and schools, through to community food initiatives, School Nutrition Action Groups, cooking skills courses and healthy eating vending machines within schools. Encouragingly, and also noted in the Chief Medical Officer&#8217;s Report, there have been significant increases in young people&#8217;s consumption of fruit, vegetables, salads, low fat milk, pasta and rice.</p>

  <p>The reported increase in consumption of chips, sweets and fatty foods is, however, clearly a matter for concern. The Executive is, therefore, continuing to give priority to the encouragement of healthier food choices by young people. New initiatives are being introduced, such as extension of breakfast clubs and fruit and salad bars in schools and provision of fruit for infants &#8211; all supported by the recently announced &pound;26 million Health Improvement Fund. The forthcoming appointment of a national diet action co-ordinator whose responsibilities will include working closely with those interests exercising a major influence on young people&#8217;s diet, will also make an important contribution.</p>

  <p>I have today published and laid before the Parliament a consultation paper, <i>Modernising the Complaints System</i> . It is available on the Scottish Executive&#8217;s website. The paper seeks views on a range of issues to be addressed in framing the Act of the Scottish Parliament which will put in place permanent arrangements for investigating complaints of maladministration. In line with the Executive&#8217;s commitment to open and participative policy development, this is an initial consultation which is intended to stimulate public debate on the issues. We will develop detailed proposals based on the responses to this consultation and these will then follow the consultation arrangements required for legislation in the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>Ministers are committed to the promotion of modern government and high quality public services which are open, efficient, accountable and responsive to public need. Accordingly, I am taking the opportunity provided by this consultation to consider the arrangements for the other public sector ombudsmen in Scotland, i.e. the Health Service and Local Government Ombudsmen.</p>

  <p>I want to hear views from as wide a range of interests as possible so the paper is being given a very wide distribution. I will be writing to each MSP individually, enclosing a copy of the paper and encouraging them to let me have their views on this important subject. Copies of the paper are available from today in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>The Chief Executive of the Scottish Fishermen&#8217;s Federation wrote to me in July, proposing the establishment of a Seal Commission. We subsequently discussed the matter at a meeting on 8 August. I have since written to the federation reminding them that the Natural Environment Research Council&#8217;s Special Committee on Seals already exists to provide independent scientific advice to Scottish Ministers on the management of the seal population under the terms of section 13 of the Conservation of Seals Act 1970 and that the same Act provides a framework for controlling seal numbers. No further discussions are planned.</p>

  <p>A sign language interpretation service is currently provided on request for meetings of the Parliament and for committee meetings. Requests can be made through the Parliament&#8217;s Visitor Centre and the service is provided under a contract arrangement. To date, the service has been requested on only one occasion for a debate in the Chamber (Members&#8217; Business Debate on British Sign Language on 16 February 2000). It has been requested on two occasions for committee meetings.</p>
