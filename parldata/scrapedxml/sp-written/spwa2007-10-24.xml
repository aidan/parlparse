  <p>There have been no meetings between Scottish ministers and Scottish Natural Heritage since 4 May 2007 regarding the implications for single farm payments of SNH management agreements. SNH have had a number of conversations with my officials about this difficult issue, and have recently written to them about it.

  <p>The Scottish Arts Council, Scottish Screen and the National Collections, like other public bodies, are under a legal duty to promote race equality, and following a duty placed on them by the Scottish Government last year, are each due to publish race equality schemes by 30 November 2007 setting out how they are meeting this duty.</p>

  <p>In response to our encouragement the Scottish Arts Council, Scottish Screen and the National Collections have taken action to encourage attendance at cultural events by a range of under-represented sections of society in Scotland, with a particular focus on minority ethnic communities. Scottish Screen in particular has demonstrated this through actions such as their support for the &quot;CinemaChina&quot; film festival, the Pakistani Film, Media and Arts Festival, and &quot;Trouble Sleeping&quot;, a new talent development initiative, working on a project involving asylum seekers in Glasgow.</p>

  <p><em>Improving Scottish Education</em> , published by Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education in November 2006, identified the attainment of pupils from P1 to P4 as a key strength of the primary sector. We also know from the Scottish Survey of Achievement that attainment of pupils in P3 is strong. Inspection evidence has identified a number of factors in school which contribute to the quality of pupils&rsquo; attainment. Factors which contribute significantly include the quality of teaching and the quality of pupils&rsquo; learning experiences. Also, where staff provide a supportive climate for learning, demonstrate high expectations of pupils&rsquo; achievement and establish positive relationships with pupils, inspectors have found important benefits in terms of pupils&rsquo; attainment.</p>

  <p>There is also research evidence to suggest that children in the early years can benefit from smaller class sizes. Other factors outwith the school such as the child&rsquo;s pre-school experience and the influence and involvement of the home will also impact on the children&rsquo;s ability to do well.</p>

  <p>If Scotland is to be the best it can be in the 21st century, we need children and young people who are effective contributors, responsible citizens and confident individuals as well as successful learners. The primary sector is well placed to make the values, purposes and principles of Curriculum for Excellence a reality for Scotland&rsquo;s children. The recently published draft outcomes will raise the level of expectation for attainment and achievement.</p>

  <p>No. This information is not collected. The principal central source of evidence about the quality of attainment in individual Scottish primary schools is gathered through Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education inspection reports. The proportion of schools inspected in any one year does not allow for rank ordering of all primary schools in Scotland, nor would it be appropriate to do so.</p>

  <p>All public bodies in Scotland are subject to a duty under the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 to further biodiversity conservation in carrying out their functions. The Scottish Government produced guidance in 2005 to promote the duty and to encourage its implementation.

  <p>The Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 Act also requires public bodies to consult Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) in relation to the exercise of any function on, or affecting, any land which is or forms part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest. Public bodies must have regard to any advice received from SNH as a result of such consultation.</p>

  <p>It is for each public body to decide how to comply with the requirements in the 2004 act.</p>

  <p>Under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961, flood prevention schemes follow a statutory procedure under which schemes are brought forward by the local authority, advertised and submitted to Scottish ministers for confirmation. Flood Prevention Schemes are subject to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s environmental, economic and technical criteria.</p>

  <p>Each Flood Prevention Scheme is also subject to public scrutiny under statutory planning procedures. It is for the planning authority to determine planning applications in its administrative area taking account of all relevant factors, including policies contained in the development plan, national and Scottish planning policy guidance, other specific material considerations which may include issues such as flooding and representations received.</p>

  <p>Statutory provisions are in place so that if a proposed development is likely to result in an increase in the number of buildings at risk of being damaged by flooding the planning authority have to consult the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) before granting planning permission. If SEPA advise against planning permission but the planning authority wishes to approve or recommends conditions which the authority does not intend to apply, they are required to notify the application to the Scottish ministers who may call it in for their own decision.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are expected to provide such services and support from their general allocations.</p>

  <p>I understand that NHS Lanarkshire works closely with the Scottish Muscle Network to ensure that those suffering from muscular dystrophy, and their families, receive a co-ordinated approach to their care. Inter-agency working in this area is on-going and the board is currently working with the network on the development of an integrated care pathway.</p>

  <p>Specialist services, including specialist physiotherapy services, for NHS Lanarkshire residents are provided by Yorkhill Hospital during the paediatric stages and into the early teenage years. Knowing that the transition from paediatric to adult services is an anxious time for patients and their families, the board makes every effort to ensure that GPs, the district nursing service and other agencies involved link with the patient, their families and specialist services to prepare for this transition. Individual needs, including those of the carer, are assessed and reviewed to ensure holistic care is provided and that on-going care is co-ordinated and responsive to need.</p>

  <p>NHS Lanarkshire believes that its commitment to the management of long-term conditions will ensure the needs of people with muscular dystrophy and their carers are met.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to the principle of equal pay for work of equal value, and this underpins the new Agenda for Change pay system.</p>

  <p>All parties to the agreement in Scotland have taken the view that consistency and accuracy are central to the effective implementation of Agenda for Change. This is reflected in the job evaluation scheme which has been designed to be very deliberate, robust and rigorous in its assessment of pay. Added to this is a two stage checking process where job evaluation outcomes are considered at both a local and national level. These processes were agreed and taken forward in partnership with trade unions and professional organisations.</p>

  <p>The Agenda for Change job evaluation system is designed to assess the tasks undertaken in a particular job and the skills and knowledge required to carry out those tasks to an acceptable level. In the past job titles were in some circumstances used quite generically, and did not necessarily reflect key differences in the work which was being undertaken by individuals. Therefore under Agenda for Change job evaluation, staff who were previously working under the same job title may not necessarily come out to the same band once they have been through the job evaluation process.</p>

  <p>In circumstances where staff feel that the job evaluation system has assessed them incorrectly, they can request a review of the outcome. The review process is conducted in partnership, and is undertaken by fully trained job evaluators who have had no involvement in the original assessment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is keen to ensure that all major sporting events, including the 2012 games, can provide an opportunity to increase sports participation in Scotland and inspire people to become involved in sport in many ways. We are confident that top Scottish athletes competing in the Olympic Games will inspire a generation of young people throughout Scotland to get involved in sport and benefit from the lifelong rewards of a healthy and active lifestyle.</p>

  <p>We must be realistic about the potential benefits from the games but at the same time continue to work hard to secure opportunities and benefits for different sectors across Scotland.</p>

  <p>However, we must ensure that opportunities presented by the Olympic and Paralympic Games are not at the detriment of funding to Scottish sports. The Scottish Government strongly opposes the diversion of monies from the National Lottery good causes and have asked the UK Government to look seriously at other funding streams for the additional costs of the games.</p>

  <p>The loss of lottery funding to good causes in Scotland as a result of the Games will be approximately &pound;150 million, &pound;13 million from sport.</p>
