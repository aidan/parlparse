  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, with regard to the customer care complaints system in respect of installations under its central heating programme administered through Eaga Partnership Ltd, how many complaints have been made about the standard of work by contractors; how many complaints have been made about disruption to decoration or any other item, over and above that initially envisaged when the heating installation was planned; how many staff from Eaga have been available to deal with any complaints; what the average response time has been to resolve complaints; on how many occasions Eaga incurred additional expenses in resolving a complaint, showing whether the resolution of the complaint involved additional remedial work or repair to decoration or any other item; on how many occasions a contractor has incurred additional expense to resolve a complaint, showing whether the resolution of the complaint involved additional remedial works or repair to decoration or any other item; how many inspectors Eaga has for monitoring and approving heating installations, and what percentage of installations have been routinely inspected, broken down by quarter since the programme began.</p>

  <p>In January 2003 Eaga introduced a new system for recording and dealing with complaints. They now have a comprehensive register of complaints and action taken on them and a dedicated complaints team.</p>

  <p>In the period 1 January to 30 May 2003 there have been 48 complaints about standards of workmanship by contractors; 19 have been upheld, seven have not been upheld and a decision has yet to be made in 22 cases. There have been a total of 73 complaints about excessive mess and upheaval, damage to decoration or household goods, and debris left behind. Twenty-nine of these complaints have been upheld, 17 have not been upheld and 27 are pending. There were 2,854 installations in this period, so the number of complaints relates to 4.24% of this total.</p>

  <p>Eaga have two staff who deal with complaints and a further member of staff who deals with enquiries from MSPs. Other members of staff, up to and including the manager, are available if required and senior members of staff will become involved in individual cases if an adjudication or second opinion is required. For those complaints, which have been resolved, the average time taken to resolve them was 12 days.</p>

  <p>Eaga have not previously maintained a central register of remedial works required to resolve complaints or additional expenses incurred as a consequence. They will now keep such a register.</p>

  <p>Installations are inspected by Eaga&#8217;s technical monitoring officers. They ensure that the required specifications, such as the number and siting of radiators and the position of the boiler, have been met. Eaga also employ two specialist companies who carry out a 100% inspection of installations to ensure that quality standards are met.</p>

  <p>Where a complaint is upheld and remedial works are required to the central heating system, or other substantial works are needed, those works are inspected on completion.</p>

  <p>Prescriptions written by NHS prescribers are recorded in the patient&#8217;s notes. It is for the patient to present the prescription for dispensing.

  <p>Our priority remains to work with the users of services and their carers, the partner agencies, the voluntary sector and others to advance change and improvement in the quality and accessibility of mental health services, bringing more care closer to the communities served.</p>

  <p><em>Partnership for Care</em> (Bib. number 26689) most recently set out our vision for the future of the health service including our ambitions for improving mental health services. Current activity and planned next steps were also set out in the paper <em>Mental Health: Moving the Agenda Forward </em>(Bib. number 27705), published on 26 March 2003. Together these form the core of our agenda for further developing mental health services and also form the basis for an event in Edinburgh on 19 June 2003 for users, carers, planners and providers of mental health services which I am to address.</p>

  <p>The criteria for the design of lighting column layouts for trunk roads and motorways, including the M8, are set out in the Design Manual for Roads and Bridges. There is currently a temporary reduction of lighting on the M8/A8 corridor during maintenance works. However, I am not aware of any permanent reduction in the number of lighting columns on the M8.</p>
