  <p>There are no restrictions which would prevent a GP/clinician from referring a patient to a health board other than their health board of residence. Similarly there are no restrictions which would prevent a patient from receiving long term care from outwith their health board of residence. All referrals to health boards for specialist treatments are made on the basis of clinical need, and it would be a matter for the referring GP/clinician to decide on how best to address a patient's needs.</p>

  <p>The appointment of members to the boards of health boards and Trusts are made by me on behalf of Scottish Ministers. These appointments are made on merit, by fair and open process and are subject to independent assessment. Consideration is given to the balance of the boards and how they reflect their local communities. People can apply at any time for appointment to the boards of their local health board and Trusts: some appointments are also advertised in local and national newspapers. Applications and information can be obtained from the NHS Public Appointments Branch in the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to reviewing and developing the system for making public appointments in Scotland and I am already taking steps to improve the processes for NHS appointments. The Executive issued its consultation document on public appointments on 9 February 2000 inviting views about a number of key issues and underlining its commitment to making public appointments in Scotland more representative of Scottish society. This consultation was further discussed in the parliamentary debate on 30 March 2000.</p>

  <p>The primary responsibility for the delivery and management of nutritional education within the curriculum, the quality of school meals and the provision of any additional services such as breakfast clubs rests with authorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises that priority must be given to tackling the legacy of health inequalities that Scotland has inherited. This informs our approach to resource allocation and a key aim of the current review of the formula by which resources are allocated between health boards is to ensure that resource distribution reflects underlying healthcare needs.</p>

  <p>At local level, health boards are required already to set out their plans for using their resources to meet the healthcare needs of their populations, including tackling health inequalities, in their Health Improvement Plans (HIPs). In relation to Glasgow, Greater Glasgow Health Board&#8217;s HIP, together with its recent restructuring and its engagement with strategic partnerships, reflect a strong commitment to tackling health inequalities.</p>

  <p>Following its decision that the additional resources made available as a result of the increase in tobacco duty should be allocated to health spending, the Scottish Executive has also announced an intention to target &pound;26 million to measures to reinforce the drive to improve public health.</p>

  <p>Where private sector tenants are unlawfully evicted, legal remedies are available to them through civil action, arising from breach of contract by the landlord. In addition, the Procurator Fiscal can prosecute the private landlord for the summary offence of unlawful eviction.</p>

  <p>I have therefore not published any new proposals to use the Housing Bill for change in this area. However, the Homelessness Task Force is engaged in detailed consideration of the nature and causes of homelessness in Scotland, including homelessness arising from the private rented sector.</p>

  <p>Internal correspondence, publication and distribution of documents is normally carried out electronically, via e-mail, shared file facilities and the Executive&#8217;s Intranet. By the summer, letters sent to Ministers, where official advice is sought, should be handled as electronic images within the Executive. Where external correspondents send e-mail, replies from officials of the Executive are normally sent electronically. Many members of the public do not have (or do not supply) e-mail addresses when corresponding with the Executive, and this constrains our ability to respond electronically. All Scottish Executive publications are routinely made available on the website:</p>

  <p>Procurators Fiscal have the benefit of a wide training calendar at both national and regional level. Matters relating to road traffic accidents are addressed from time to time in the training programme and, especially at regional level, there are opportunities to learn from experts in accident investigation.</p>

  <p>Crash scene interpretation is a complex science and it would, of course, be unsafe for Procurators Fiscal to rely on their own limited training and skills in the matter. In relation to crash scene interpretation, as in relation to other subject areas requiring specialist knowledge and experience, Procurators Fiscal make extensive use of specialist advice from properly qualified experts.</p>

  <p>The use of temporary sheriffs has been suspended since 11 November 1999.</p>

  <p>Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) allowances for police services are included within the calculation of the annual local government finance settlement. Police GAE is distributed largely on the basis of force strength (adjusted to take account of the additional costs of serving rural areas) and force expenditure commitments (e.g. on pensions). The current formula was agreed in 1996 following a review with CoSLA and the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS). Details are provided in the Grant Aided Expenditure 2000-1 <i>Green Book</i> , copies of which are held by SPICe.</p>

  <p>A joint review group, including Scottish Executive, CoSLA and ACPOS representatives, is currently considering the development of a new needs-based formula for the distribution of police GAE.</p>

  <p>Details of the political activities of all applicants for public appointments are not held centrally. However, details of the political activities of <i>successful</i> applicants are provided on a quarterly basis to the Commissioner for Public Appointments for inclusion in her Annual Report. The Commissioner&#8217;s Code of Practice requires all applicants to declare their political activities in terms of the following three categories:</p>

  <p><u>Category A:</u></p>

  <p>Applicants who have:</p>

  <p>obtained office as a Local Councillor, MP, MSP, MEP etc;</p>

  <p>stood as a candidate for one of the above offices;</p>

  <p>spoken on behalf of a party or candidate.</p>

  <p><u>Category B:</u></p>

  <p>Applicants who have:</p>

  <p>acted as a political agent;</p>

  <p>held office such as Chair, Treasurer, or Secretary of a local branch of a party;</p>

  <p>canvassed on behalf of a party or helped at elections;</p>

  <p>undertaken any other political activity which they consider relevant.</p>

  <p><u>Category C:</u></p>

  <p>Applicants for whom none of the above activities apply.</p>

  <p>In the majority of cases, individuals appointed to public bodies are not, and have not been, politically active. During the period from 1 April 1999 to 31 December 1999, a total of 186 appointments were made by Scottish Office/Scottish Executive Ministers. Of this total, 142 appointees came within the scope of Category C, 18 within the scope of Category A and 26 within the scope of Category B.</p>

  <p>The majority of the activities of the Scottish Rehabilitation Technology Forum (SCOTRET) are undertaken by its four sub-groups: Orthotics, Prosthetics, Wheelchairs and Seating and Electronic Assistive Technology. Membership of the sub-groups is multidisciplinary and includes surgeons, therapists, prosthetists/orthotists and clinical engineers from each of the main Mobility and Rehabilitation Technology Centres in Scotland who are active in the sub-group areas of rehabilitation technology provision. Scottish Healthcare Supplies, who have responsibility for arranging central contracts for the NHS in Scotland, are also involved in the work of the sub-groups.</p>

  <p>SCOTRET also have a Co-ordinating Group chaired by Mr David Condie, Rehabilitation Engineering Services Manager, Tayside Orthopaedic and Rehabilitation Technology Centre, which comprises the Directors/Managers of the five Scottish rehabilitation technology centres and the Convenors of the four sub-groups. The Co-ordinating Group monitors the activities of the four sub-groups and addresses issues which cut across disciplines.</p>

  <p>SCOTRET was established in July 1997 as an association of Scottish NHS providers of rehabilitation technology and as such does not include any end users of the service in its membership. Patient end users are however included on the Rehabilitation Technology Services Advisory Group (ReTSAG), which is chaired by the Scottish Executive and also includes representatives from the SCOTRET Co-ordinating Group in its membership.</p>

  <p>A copy of the SCOTRET Constitution and current Co-ordinating Group membership list has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, as has the remit and membership of ReTSAG.</p>

  <p>Yes. The Waste Framework Directive requires member states to encourage the reduction, reuse and recycling of waste, or the use of waste as a source of energy, to ensure that waste is recovered or disposed of without endangering human health or harming the environment, and to establish an adequate network of disposal installations. Member states are also required to draw up waste management plans that show how they will attain these objectives. For Scotland, this duty was given to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency as laid out in the Environment Act 1995. Last year Scotland became the first UK country to launch its Waste Strategy. On the 9 December 1999 I announced to the Parliament the launch of the National Waste Strategy: Scotland and adopted it on behalf of the Executive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and CoSLA are working together on the introduction of a card that will incorporate a wide range of functions to give young people easy access to local authority services such as libraries, leisure and recreational facilities and reduced access to travel costs. It is anticipated that an integral part will be to provide proof of age, which will enable retailers to screen the sales of age-restricted products, such as alcohol, tobacco, lottery tickets, and fireworks to young people. The technical development of this &quot;one card&quot; approach is being taken forward as part of the Young Scot youth information and discount package. It is hoped to commence the first pilots of this new style card by the beginning of next year.</p>
