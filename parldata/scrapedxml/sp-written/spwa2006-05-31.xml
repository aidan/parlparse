  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has conducted an economic assessment of extra burdens on local authorities that may arise should levels of homelessness increase as a result of the enactment of provisions in the Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Bill which would allow a creditor to apply for a court order forcing a debtor to sell property if more than &pound;1,500 is owed.</p>

  <p>The Executive intends that the new diligence of land attachment in the Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Bill will strike a fair balance between creditors and debtors.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not agree that land attachment will cause an increase in homelessness, and has not therefore carried out an economic assessment of the possible impact on local authorities.</p>

  <p>The Executive nonetheless notes the recommendation of the Enterprise and Culture Committee in their stage 1 report that the main dwellinghouse should be exempted. We will therefore consider carefully whether or not to make changes at stage 2 of the bill.</p>

  <p>In local authority and housing association sectors, 2,260 households in Dundee have received a central heating system through the programme.</p>

  <p>In the private sector the programme is administered by Eaga Partnership, which holds information by main postcode area. From September 2001 to end of April 2006, Eaga has installed 2,825 central heating systems in pensioner households in the DD postcode area.</p>

  <p>The Debt Arrangement Scheme is being delivered in partnership with Money Advice Scotland and Citizens Advice Scotland, through Money Advice Training Resources Information and Consultancy Services (MATRICS).</p>

  <p>The Executive is therefore working with MATRICS to encourage individual money advisers to become approved for the purpose of applying for debt payment programmes on behalf of debtors.</p>

  <p>As part of that effort the Executive reviewed the scheme between December 2005 and February 2006. As a result of that review, the Executive announced on 24 May 2006 that the scheme would be amended to allow for a payment programme to include debt relief.</p>

  <p>This change has been welcomed by the money advice sector, and it is hoped that it will lead to an increase in the number of approved money advisers.</p>

  <p>Further changes to the scheme are still being considered, and may be introduced after consultation with MATRICS.</p>

  <p>In March 2005 we announced support for three separate financial education pilot projects totalling &pound;1.4 million over two years, in partnership with Citizens Advice Scotland, Greater Easterhouse Money Advice Project and Young Scot. The aim of these projects was to allow individuals to increase their financial capability and make better informed decisions about which products best meet their needs.</p>

  <p>From April this year we have provided &pound;10.6 million funding to the 11 local authorities with the greatest concentration of financial exclusion and income deprivation &ndash; this will be spread over two years. Authorities will be able to utilise part of this funding towards financial literacy training.</p>

  <p>The regulation and safety of medicines are reserved and are the responsibility of the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). The MHRA and the Commission on Human Medicines run the UK&rsquo;s spontaneous adverse drug reaction reporting scheme, the Yellow Card Scheme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold information on the number of reports of suspected adverse drug reactions received via the Yellow Card Scheme.</p>

  <p>The MHRA publishes on its website anonymised aggregated reports of suspected adverse drug reactions broken down by drug and by reporter type. Data which provide a greater level of detail and which could potentially lead to the identification of individual reporters or patients require an application to the Independent Scientific Advisory Committee. Application forms can be found on their website <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The Information requested is shown in the following table. The increase in the numbers of patients, over the period, with a diagnosis of adverse drug reactions may, in part, be explained by improvements in the recording of secondary diagnoses in recent years. Data prior to 1997 has not been included in the table because the different coding structure used to collect it does not allow for a direct comparison.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, in light of the ruling by the European Commission that British citizens who travel elsewhere in the European Union for health treatment should be recompensed, the same ruling would apply to citizens who travel from Scotland to England.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-05-31.15.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0531.htm#8">

  <p>The recent European Court of Justice ruling indicates that reimbursement of a patient&rsquo;s costs should follow arrangements already in force for treatment in the patient&rsquo;s home country. Currently, patients required to travel within Scotland, or indeed to England, for treatment may receive reimbursement for the expenses incurred under one of two statutory patients&rsquo; travelling expenses schemes: a non-means tested Highlands and Islands scheme, for patients resident or working in the former Highlands and Islands development area, and a means-tested scheme for the rest of the country.</p>

  <p>Under the scheme regulations patients, and where considered medically necessary their escorts, are reimbursed, either fully or partially, their travelling expenses. In addition the cost of unavoidable overnight expenses can be reimbursed if the NHS board is satisfied that an overnight stay is in practice unavoidable.</p>

  <p>NHS boards also have discretion to reimburse the travel costs and unavoidable overnight expenses of patients not eligible for assistance under the statutory travel schemes when this is viewed as an extension to patients&rsquo; treatment costs and is deemed to be clinically necessary.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it ensures that the Patients&rsquo; Forum reflects the diversity of the population and what outcomes have resulted from views expressed through the forum.</p>

  <p>Each community health partnership (CHP) is required to maintain an effective and formal dialogue with its local community through the development of a local Public Partnership Forum. Guidance on the establishment of Public Partnership Forum can be found at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/11/20168/45831#6" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2004/11/20168/45831#6</a> .</p>

  <p>The duty placed on health boards to involve and consult the public applies equally to CHPs, and national guidance on public involvement should underpin their work. A key role for the Public Partnership Forum is therefore to engage local service users, carers, the public and key local partners, such as the voluntary sector, in discussion about how to improve health services. This means engaging with local people in issues concerning the nature, design and quality of service delivery and outcomes. This in turn should enable the CHP to respond positively to the needs, concerns, and experiences of patients and their carers and families, while informing the development of its work plans and decisions about local priorities for service improvement. It is therefore important that the Public Partnership Forum is able to represent the views of all the communities in the CHP area, in particular those who could be socially excluded or face discrimination when accessing services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Health Council has a key quality assurance role in terms of whether or not health boards are effectively carrying out their statutory duty to involve the public, both through the work of Public Partnership Forum and other involvement activities carried out locally. Where the council believes that a CHP is not effectively engaging with its local community through its Public Partnership Forum, then it may ask the health board to ensure appropriate remedial action is taken.</p>

  <p>The Rough Sleepers Initiative funding was originally distributed on the basis of bids made by local authorities. This funding has been included in the Revenue Support Grant since 2002-03, and the proportion of funding allocated to each local authority has continued to be calculated on the same basis.</p>

  <p>The distribution of both Homelessness Task Force and general homelessness (GAE) funding is based on an historic calculation of the numbers of homelessness applications as a proportion of the population, in each local authority.</p>

  <p>The Rough Sleepers Initiative was integrated into the local authorities&rsquo; strategies and both funding streams now support the implementation of these.</p>

  <p>The Executive has made a commitment to amalgamate currently distinct homelessness funding streams from 2007-08. Consideration is currently taking place around the most appropriate arrangements for doing so.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive collects details on each application made to local authorities under the homelessness legislation. However, these data are not collected in a way which allows a meaningful breakdown by parliamentary constituency. Annual figures on the numbers assessed as homeless can be found online in the publications section of the housing statistics website <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/housing/hsbref" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/housing/hsbref</a> . The most recent figures are for 2004-05 (published in Statistical Bulletin: Housing Series: HSG/2005/6: Operation of the Homeless Persons legislation in Scotland: national and local authority analyses 2004-05). Figures for 2005-06 will be published later this year.</p>

  <p>None of this was from end-year flexibility but from ministerial approval to increase spend in what they regard as a priority programme. This was done for all councils.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to change the criteria by which the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters Unit (SEIRU) are required to take into account public opinion in planning matters. Paragraph 46 of <em>Scottish Planning Policy 1: The Planning System</em> (Bib. number 25316) sets out the requirement by which planning applications are required to be determined. SEIRU are already required to give the same weight to relevant planning matters raised in representations by the public as by planning authorities. The weight to be attached to these representations would depend on the extent to which relevant planning considerations are raised, rather than the numbers of objections.</p>

  <p>Decisions on planning applications are required to be made in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. Depending on the circumstances of the case, such considerations can include Scottish Planning Policies (SPP) and Planning Advice Notes (PAN). It would be for the body determining the application to consider the weight to be given to a new SPP or PAN which was relevant to the case but not yet included in the development plan.</p>

The lease costs are in the order of &pound;0.5 million per annum over 10 years which includes installation and operational costs.

  <p>Voluntary organisations have not been required to register with any regulatory body. Consequently, this information is not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>However, following the creation of the Office of the Scottish Charities Regulator (OSCR), voluntary organisations seeking charitable status in Scotland are required to meet the new charity test set out in the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005, in order to be awarded charitable status and be placed on the Scottish Charity Register.</p>

  <p>Charitable status was previously granted by the Inland Revenue (Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs) under the Charities Act 1993. Under section 3 (7) (b) trustees of charities were required to notify the commissioners (Charity Commission) if their charities were winding up and this information can be obtained from Her Majesty&rsquo;s Revenue and Customs.</p>
