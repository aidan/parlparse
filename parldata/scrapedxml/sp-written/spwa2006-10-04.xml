  <p>In general all patients in Scotland will have access to mental health services under the 2003 act. The Scottish Executive has no specific obligations towards asylum seekers under the 2003 act. The Home Office has an interest in relation to asylum seekers and other persons who are subject to immigration control. There are protocols in place between the Home Office and local agencies in respect of treatment for mental disorder, including treatment under the 2003 act of detained asylum seekers.</p>

  <p>Local authorities generally have the same powers to assist asylum seekers under the 2003 act as they do to assist any other person under the act. Local authorities have a number of functions in relation to persons who are not in hospital and who have or have had a mental disorder. These are outlined in chapter 2 of part 4 to the 2003 act and include functions for making or securing provision for care and support services (section 25), providing or securing the provision of services designed to promote well-being and social development (section 26) and providing or securing the provision of facilities for, or assistance with, travel (section 27) for such persons. Local authorities also have a duty under the act to inquire into individual cases in certain circumstances where they believe that a person in their area who is aged 16 years or over has a mental disorder (section 33).</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have no specific obligations to asylum seekers under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003. The Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland has a duty to visit people with mental disorder including those who may be subject to the 2003 act. I understand the commission&rsquo;s visit programme will include asylum seekers. There are powers under the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 for the Mental Welfare Commission to carry out an investigation into the circumstances of the care and treatment received in any case reported to it where it appears to the commission that there may have been deficiencies of care.</p>

  <p>No. Section 115 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 provides that certain persons who are subject to immigration control are not entitled to specified benefits. Provision is made in regulation 14 of the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 (Consequential Provisions) Order 2005 that no services shall be provided by local authorities under sections 25 to 27 of the 2003 act to a person to whom section 115 of the Immigration and Asylum Act 1999 applies solely because he is destitute or because of the physical effects, or anticipated physical effects, of his being destitute. However, those provisions do not disapply the local authorities&rsquo; powers to provide services to such a person under the 2003 act.</p>

  <p>Health education is an important element of every young person&rsquo;s education. We expect all schools to provide health education within a comprehensive programme of personal and social education. However, it is for individual schools and local authorities to decide the content of the health education programmes they deliver and how they allocate their resources.</p>

  <p>The current review of the curriculum, <em>A Curriculum for Excellence</em>, recognises the need for young people to develop the knowledge and understanding, skills and abilities necessary for their physical, emotional and social well being. Review work to date has demonstrated that space can be found in the curriculum for learning in depth and for wider experiences such as first aid. We will be publishing very soon the first of a series of documents which pave the way for full implementation of the new curriculum.</p>

  <p>We are currently considering how best to recognise the wider achievements of all young people across Scotland. Work is on-going to consider these issues and we shall publish a package of proposals in due course.</p>

  <p>Firstly, we are working with the Scottish Legal Aid Board and the Law Society of Scotland to ensure that the legal aid fee structure provides adequate remuneration for work necessarily performed by solicitors.</p>

  <p>Secondly, in civil law, the Scottish Legal Aid Board is taking forward the development of a network of publicly employed solicitors where there is unmet need. In criminal law, the Public Defence Solicitors&rsquo; Office based in Inverness would cover access to justice issues in Moray.</p>

  <p>Lastly, it is proposed that the Legal Profession and Legal Aid (Scotland) Bill should include provision for funding non lawyers to provide advice and assistance in specialist areas.</p>

  <p>The Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, as amended by the Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002, gives carers who provide, or intend to provide, care on a regular and substantial basis the right to an assessment of their support needs as a carer. Such an assessment is independent of any assessment of need carried out on the person cared for. Local authorities and NHS boards are also required by the 2002 act to inform carers of their right to an assessment and have a general duty to help and support carers. Local authorities and partner agencies must take the carer&rsquo;s assessment into account, as well as the views of the carer, in deciding what services to provide to the cared-for person.</p>

  <p>The Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 does not provide for a formal assessment of carers of people with mental health problems. However, it sets out principles which professionals performing functions under the act have to consider. These include taking into account the views of the person&rsquo;s carer and their needs and circumstances. The person&rsquo;s primary carer also has the right to appear at hearings of the Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland, to make representation and to lead or produce evidence. These measures support and encourage both patients and their carers to be more meaningfully involved in the care and treatment provided.</p>

  <p>Under the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Joint Performance Information and Assessment Framework, local partnerships now set annual targets for completed carers&rsquo; assessments and monitor progress against them. This is being done through Local Improvement Targets (LITs) which are agreed by NHS boards, local authorities and other relevant partners. At present LITs focus on older people&rsquo;s services. From 2007 we plan to extend them to all client groups and to all carers. It is for individual partnerships to aggregate the need identified in carer, and user, assessments in order to plan service provision in their area.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive offers a range of support to migrant workers in Scotland. This includes workers&rsquo; information guides in Polish and English, which reflects the fact that over 65% of workers from the new accession states are Polish. The guide is available online, at <a href="http://www.szkocja.eu" target="_blank">www.szkocja.eu</a> and <a href="http://www.scotlandistheplace.com" target="_blank">www.scotlandistheplace.com</a> or in hard copy, from various public, private and voluntary sector sources, including banks. It contains information about opening bank accounts as well as a range of other information about living and working in Scotland. We are currently looking at also producing this guide in other languages. We recognise that some individuals have experienced difficulty in opening bank accounts and this is an issue which has been raised with the Committee of Scottish Clearing Bankers (which represents all four Scottish clearing banks) on a number of occasions, most recently in July of this year. Scottish banks all have policies on this issue and have opened many thousands of bank accounts for migrant workers over recent years. Any individual experiencing a problem should be encouraged to use the selected bank&rsquo;s complaints or enquiries process.</p>

  <p>The decision to create this post was taken by the Executive&rsquo;s Management Group and followed consultation with the Chair of the Scottish Science Advisory Committee and the President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. The Permanent Secretary notified ministers of this decision on 4 August 2005, and the post was openly advertised on 25 November. Applications were invited from practising scientists or technologists of international reputation, who would be required to maintain active links with the research community once appointed. Professor Anne Glover was appointed after the standard boarding process on a four year secondment from Aberdeen University and she took up post on 1 August. The creation of this post within the Scottish Executive will enable the Scottish Executive to develop and implement its science strategy more effectively. The role will involve co-ordinating and strengthening the management of science across the Executive&rsquo;s Departments; enhancing the use of science in policy making; developing better links with Whitehall science; developing the science profession within the Executive, and championing and promoting science across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s general financial support for school buildings is not allocated for specific aspects of investment, although in announcing recently &pound;30 million of extra capital grant we specifically emphasised the benefits and importance of improving energy efficiency in schools. This extra &pound;30 million brings total Schools Fund grant available to authorities this financial year to over &pound;131 million, a five fold increase since 2002-03.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are also eligible to apply for grant from the Scottish Community &amp; Householder Renewables Initiative (SCHRI). Since 2002 grants totalling &pound;587,000 for the installation of renewable energy devices in schools have been made to the following local authorities:</p>

  <p>Telecommunications regulation is reserved and this matter is under the remit of Ofcom, the independent UK-wide telecoms regulator. I can advise however, that Directive 92/44/EEC was repealed by Article 26 of the Framework Directive (Directive 2002/21/EC) and now the Universal Service Directive, implemented via the UK Communications Act 2003, currently governs leased lines.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland very actively promotes Scotland as a visitor destination, although not as a cruise liner destination as such. However, cruise liners bring a significant number of visitors to particular areas of Scotland during the year. That is why VisitScotland, with funding from Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothians, has recently commissioned research into the scope and potential of the cruise market for Scotland. This will enable VisitScotland and its partners to consider an appropriate strategy for developing Scotland as a cruise destination.</p>
