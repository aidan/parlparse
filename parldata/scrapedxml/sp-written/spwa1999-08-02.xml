  <p>Those improvements to public private partnerships I announced on 24 June which relate to matters covered by contract will have no impact on the Falkirk Council scheme for the construction of 5 new schools. This is because, with the exception of the announcement on pension provisions, these changes took effect from 24 June and will not be applied retrospectively. It is worth noting however, that the Council has an option to purchase the schools at market value, capped at &pound;5 million, at the end of the initial contract, if it wants to do so.</p>

  <p>The provisions for better protection for staff pensions came into effect on 14 June. I promised to publish more financial information for PFI projects on a sector by sector basis and have already made details of estimated service payments available in answer to a question from Andrew Wilson (S1W-357). Figures for the Falkirk project were included in the local authority sector.</p>

  <p>There would be considerable implications for financial systems. For example systems including payroll, pension, purchasing and billing operations would need to be adapted to handle the Euro as would council tax and business rate collection arrangements. Coin-operated machines would need altered and pricing policies examined.</p>

  <p>The precise implications would vary from council to council. In the event of the UK joining it would be up to each council to identify the impact on its operations; and to plan accordingly. But in that event support and guidance would be offered based, amongst other things, on experience in first-wave countries and on pilot projects. Information and experience will be shared through the central/local government working group and the local authorities&#146; own network of officials.</p>

  <p>Additives used in food are agreed at EU level. The use of such additives is controlled in Scotland by the Miscellaneous Food Additives Regulations 1995 which prescribe permitted additives to be used in certain foods. Food containing additives is required by the Food Labelling Regulations 1996 to be specifically labelled.</p>

  <p>Hormones are not defined as food additives under these Regulations. The use of hormones is controlled, however, by separate legislation which prohibits their use as growth promoters in animals in the European Union. This measure is implemented in Scotland by the Animals and Fresh Meat (Hormonal Substances) Regulations 1988.</p>

  <p>The Retail Price Index increased by 6.9% from 1996 to 1998. There is no generally accepted authoritative index for the movement in land prices in Edinburgh or nationally. The movement in residential property prices is monitored by various bodies but normally on an all-Scotland basis and again no single generally accepted index is available. Given also that there is no agreed correlation between land and house prices it was concluded that the most reliable basis for indexing price change was the Retail Price Index.</p>

  <p>Establishment of the Chief Nursing Officer&#146;s review of the contribution made by nurses to improving the public&#146;s health has been postponed pending the completion of the Chief Medical Officer&#146;s review of the public health function. Given the importance we attach to improving the health of the people of Scotland it is vital that these important pieces of work are complementary and focus the efforts of both professions on the considerable task facing us.</p>

  <p>Work on the Chief Medical Officer&#146;s review is nearing a conclusion and it is anticipated that a detailed proposal for the Chief Nursing Officer&#146;s review will be brought forward in the autumn.</p>

  <p>Following the publication of the Acute Services Review, it became apparent that a number of studies into student nurse attrition were already taking place. This included research by Stirling University, practical initiatives by other Scottish providers of nurse education, and a comprehensive study funded by the Welsh Office.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Office convened a seminar in April 1999, attended by representatives of all seven Scottish providers of diploma level pre-registration nurse education, and of a number of NHS Trusts. The findings from the various studies were presented, and ideas on how to reduce unnecessary attrition were shared. In view of the amount of knowledge already available, the seminar concluded that a further study by the Scottish Office was not a high priority.</p>

  <p>All seven institutions are tackling attrition in collaboration with their local Trusts. Their attrition rates are monitored annually by the Scottish Executive.</p>
