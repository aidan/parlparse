  <p>The Single Farm Payment Scheme is regulated primarily by European legislation with domestic legislation (i.e. Scottish or UK statutory instrument, as appropriate) being used for those aspects where member states have a choice over the way in which a measure is implemented. Since the inception of the Single Farm Payment Scheme various European Council Regulations (currently EC 73/2009) have chosen to define eligible land as arable land, permanent pasture or land used to grow permanent crops. Member states do not have a choice over what may constitute eligible land and it follows that land that cannot satisfy any of the regulatory definitions is ineligible.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-35161 on 2 August 2010.</p>

  <p>Eligible land is either arable land, permanent pasture of land used to grow permanent crops. It follows that land that does not meet these definitions, which are set in European legislation, is ineligible for the purposes of the Single Farm Payment Scheme. The following is an illustrative but not exhaustive list of the types of ineligible land.</p>

  <p>Ineligible land will include impenetrable gorse, scrub or bracken, areas made up of rock, scree, ponds and water courses, woods, buildings, yards, hard standing and roads. Areas of gorse, bracken and unwanted encroachment of dense vegetation need to be carefully assessed for the purposes of claiming agricultural support. The key is not to claim areas of dense cover that are impenetrable to stock and where there is no growth below for grazing. Woodland which has a vegetative under-growth in which livestock can forage is eligible for the purposes of the Single Farm Payment Scheme but if the tree cover prevents vegetation from growing, the area cannot be used as forage and is ineligible.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-35161 on 2 August 2010.</p>

  <p>The Single Farm Payment Scheme is regulated by European Council Regulation (EC) 73/2009 and this defines what constitutes eligible land. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate have taken this as the starting point for guidance issued to farmers and crofters in the form of the Single Farm Payment Scheme notes for guidance as well as internal guidance to its own staff, both in its headquarters and across its 16 area offices located throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate issued individual copies of the Single Farm Payment Scheme notes for guidance to 21,500 farmers and crofters across Scotland earlier this year. These notes are available at:</p>

  <p>The Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate&rsquo;s Agricultural and Rural Delivery Division headquarters staff are responsible for the issue of internal guidance to its 250 professional and technical staff and ongoing support in the form of training in relation to, amongst other things, what constitutes eligible or ineligible land. This work takes as its starting point European Council Regulation 73/2009 that defines what constitutes eligible land. These frontline staff undertake on-farm inspections to ensure compliance with scheme conditions on eligibility and managerial and supervisory controls are used to monitor staff performance. A key element in ensuring a consistent approach is the reliance placed on training delivered both centrally and locally.</p>

  <p>Giant hogweed is listed on schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 which makes it an offence to plant, or cause this plant to grow, in the wild.</p>

  <p>Advice on the risk of burning from contact with the sap of giant hogweed is provided on the Scottish Government website (<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/invasivespecies" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/invasivespecies</a>) and within the <em>Horticultural Code of Practice</em> published by the Scottish Executive in 2005 and available at:</p>

  <p>Local authorities and other organisations may provide further information in areas where the plant is being controlled. I understand that Highland Council currently consider that there is sufficient general local awareness of the problems caused by giant hogweed since it has had an established presence in the area for some time.</p>

  <p>Injurious weeds specified in the Weeds Act 1959 include spear thistle (Cirsium vulgare), creeping or field thistle (Cirsium arvense), curled and broad-leaved docks (Rumex crispus/obtusifolius), and common ragwort (Senecio jacobaea). Giant hogweed is not covered by the provisions of the Weeds Act 1959.</p>

  <p>Giant hogweed is listed on schedule 9 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 which makes it an offence to plant, or cause this plant to grow, in the wild. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill, which is currently under consideration by the Scottish Parliament, includes provisions intended to improve the effectiveness of controls applicable to invasive non-native species and which could potentially apply to situations where a local authority or another public body has identified the need to control giant hogweed.</p>
