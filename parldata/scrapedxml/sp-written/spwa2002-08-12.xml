  <p>There are currently 592 asbestos related claims before the Court of Session. The cases are procedurally at different stages. In December 2001, Lord Mackay of Drumadoon was appointed by the Lord President of the Court of Session to oversee cases where it appeared their progress had been affected by external factors. Since that date 254 cases have called by order of the court to ensure compliance with the Rules of the Court of Session and to facilitate settlement where this is possible. The court has been advised that 60 of these cases have now settled. Further hearings continue to be scheduled. Procedural reforms for personal injury actions generally have been recommended by a working group chaired by Lord Coulsfield. These reforms have the support of the Executive. On 11 June 2002, the Lord President wrote to Justice 2 Committee outlining progress with the work preparatory to the introduction of a revised procedure early in 2003. The Lord President&#146;s letter is one of the papers for the committee&#146;s 24th meeting on 18 June 2002, and is available through the Parliament&#146;s website.</p>

  <p>The classification of drugs is a reserved matter. The Scottish Executive was informed by Her Majesty's Government of the proposal to reclassify cannabis and the consequences highlighted were fully considered. The Home Secretary's decision was based, in part, on a recommendation by the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs, on which Scottish interests are well represented. The Executive has issued a guide, which is also on the Know the Score website at: <a href="http://www.knowthescore.info/" target="_blank">www.knowthescore.info</a> , setting out the legal position in Scotland, the effects of cannabis and the health risks associated with its use.</p>

  <p>The Home Secretary proposed on 10 July that cannabis should be reclassified from a Class B to a Class C drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. If approved by the Westminster Parliament, this will reduce the maximum penalty for possession of cannabis from five years to two years imprisonment. The Home Secretary also proposed a 14-year maximum prison sentence for drug traffickers who deal in Class B or Class C drugs. The current maximum penalty for possession with intent to supply Class C drugs is five years in prison, compared with 14 years for Class B drugs. The Scottish Executive does not provide advice to judges on sentencing as the independence of the judiciary is a fundamental principle of the Scottish legal system. The role of the Scottish Executive is to ensure that the courts have an adequate range of penalties available to them.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to change its drugs strategy. The research referred to was about young people who already have drug problems. As part of the research, an international literature review examined a range of school-based programmes that sought to reduce drug use in this group. There was some evidence that such programmes did reduce drug use but that certain approaches, e.g. skills development, building self-esteem and confidence, were more beneficial than others. Education, as part of a programme of treatment and care, can have successful results but the use of a purely educational approach was found to be generally ineffective in reducing drug use. The Effective Intervention Unit's (EIU) review did not examine drug education programmes in Scotland, nor did it examine the effectiveness of drug education generally. To follow up the research, the EIU will be working with the Lloyds TSB Foundation Partnership Drugs Initiative to develop a practical guide to the planning, designing and delivery of services for young people with drug problems.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has already taken a number of actions to improve drug treatment services for young people in rural areas. All areas are benefiting from increased drug treatment resources of &#163;13.3 million for the period 2001-02 to 2003-04. In addition, funding of &#163;18 million has been made available over the same period through the Changing Children&#146;s Services Fund for work with young people and families affected by drug misuse. Applications have now been approved and grants issued to all local authorities, both urban and rural. These include prevention and treatment facilities for the under 16s. The Executive has set a national standard for all Drug Action Teams (DATs) to ensure that drug users aged under 16 have access to drug treatment and care services which are in line with national guidance, by 2004. Achievement of the standard is being monitored through DAT annual Corporate Action Plans. Plans received to date demonstrate a wide range of new and expanded services for young people in rural areas, covering education, prevention and treatment.</p>

  <p>No. Measuring recidivism is a complex issue, and recidivists may commit further crimes for which custodial sentences are not awarded by sentencers and the reason for recidivism are affected by many factors outwith prison. Furthermore, individual prisoners may well spend time in both private and public prisons during the course of the sentence. The Scottish Prison Service publishes information on &quot;Return to Custody&quot;, the most recent being follow-up information on those prisoners released from prison during 1998.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what is being done to ensure that people with schizophrenia in (a) Caithness, Sutherland and Easter Ross and (b) the Western Isles have access to new and more effective drugs, given that these areas have among the lowest percentage shares of atypical antipsychotic prescriptions.</p>

  <p>On 25 July 2002, the Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) issued a comment on the NICE Guidance on the use of atypical antipsychotic drugs for schizophrenia, advising that the NICE Guidance is as valid for Scotland as for England and Wales. The guidance recommends that the newer (atypical) antipsychotics should be considered alongside the older, existing medicines as one of the options of first choice to treat people with newly diagnosed schizophrenia. NHS Scotland is expected to take account of advice and evidence from the HTBS and ensure that recommended drugs or treatments are made available to meet clinical need.</p>

  <p>The Executive's plans are set out in the <i>Action Plan for the Social</i> <i>Services Workforce</i> , which was published on 18 April 2002.</p>

  <p>Since then significant progress has been made towards introducing the new honours degree course by 2004. We have set up two project groups whose membership is drawn from the Scottish Social Services Council, institutes of higher education, employers, the independent sector, user interests and professional associations to consider the structure and viability of the new degree and the role of practice learning. Both groups will regularly report on progress to ministers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether any disclosures made by Mr Peter McMahon to media in respect of the former First Minister constitute breaches of confidentiality; if so, which specific disclosures so constitute breaches of confidentiality; what the reasons are for not taking action against any such breaches; whether, had any such breaches been made by a former civil servant rather than by a former special adviser, it would have treated them differently, and, in particular, whether action would have been taken in such a case.</p>

  <p>The articles written by Peter McMahon commenting on events when he was a special adviser did not contain anything which involved a significant breach of his duties in respect of confidential government information. On that basis legal action could not be justified. Civil servants, including special advisers, are bound by a duty of confidentiality and legal action would be considered against any existing or former civil servant, including special advisers, where there was a significant breach of that duty.</p>

  <p>Guidance to education authorities and schools and the framework of national qualifications provide ample opportunities for teaching Sustainable Development at every level of the school curriculum. Under the School Improvement Framework, which monitors the delivery of the National Priorities in Education, a performance measure has been included for education authorities on the percentage of schools participating in the Eco-Schools Award or similar accredited environmental award. A number of initiatives have also been undertaken in conjunction with Learning and Teaching Scotland to assist education authorities and schools to promote environmental and sustainable development education. These include the learning support pack &#150; Our World, Our Future and Living and Learning in a Time of Change &#150; Starting Points for Teachers and School Management Teams. The new National Qualifications introduce a set of courses from Access to Advanced Higher within the subject area of Managing Environmental Resources. Learning and Teaching Scotland is involved in a partnership with Scottish Natural Heritage, World Wildlife Fund for Nature, Scotland, Eco-Schools, Scotland, Equal Schools Scotland, International Development Education Association of Scotland, Royal Incorporation of Architects in Scotland, Royal Town Planning Institute in Scotland, Scottish Civic Trust and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, Scotland in the sustainable secondary schools project to take forward a four-year initiative on education for sustainable development in secondary schools. Education for Sustainable Development is of course an important element of education for citizenship and officials are currently in discussion with Learning and Teaching Scotland about developing support for schools following the publication of <i>Education for Citizenship in Scotland</i> .</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its policy is on the circumstances under which primary schools should lose a teacher following a decrease in the school roll; whether such reductions in teacher complement should not take effect over a period of one year but over a longer period, and what guidance it will give to local authorities on this matter.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for the management of publicly funded schools, including the recruitment and deployment of teachers rests with individual local authorities. Within that responsibility it is a matter for local authorities to determine the most appropriate rate of change in staffing levels when a school roll declines. The Scottish Executive does not intend to issue guidance on this matter.</p>
