  <p>The Home Office will administer the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland scheme.</p>

  <p>Under the scheme the suitability of the period of time spent living in Scotland will be assessed by the immigration caseworker or entry clearance officer on the facts of each application, but the following should be used as general guidance:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>For courses lasting one academic year, the student can normally be expected to have lived in Scotland for at least three months. </p>
<p>For courses lasting two academic years, the student can normally be expected to have lived in Scotland for at least six months. </p>
<p>For courses lasting three academic years, the student can normally be expected to have lived in Scotland for at least 12 months.</p>

  <p>This advice is contained in the guidance on the scheme, which is available through the Scottish Executive and Home Office websites.</p>

  <p>Section 22 of the National Assistance Act 1948 requires local authorities to set the gross fees for local authority care home places at an amount equivalent to the full cost to the authority of providing them. Fees for supported residents of independent sector care homes are simply the rate agreed between the local authority and the provider.</p>

  <p>Consequently, the local authority figures will be the total cost of providing care divided by the number of residents in the care home. The figures provided by independent sector care homes will be the total gross charge for all residents each week, before any deductions are made, divided by the total number of residents. Local authority figures are not therefore comparable with those of the independent sector.</p>

  <p>The detailed design for the works in the A7 Auchenrivock Improvement is still underway. Ground Investigation works are on-going at present and the preferred road alignment has been adopted. I anticipate that draft orders will be published in late 2005 and, subject to satisfactory completion of the statutory procedures, work on construction could commence in early 2007 for a completion date in early 2008. I expect the scheme to cost &pound;5.6 million plus any VAT that might be due.</p>
