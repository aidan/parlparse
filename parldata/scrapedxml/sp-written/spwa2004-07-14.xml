  <p>I attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council on 21 June in Luxembourg together with Margaret Beckett and Ben Bradshaw.</p>

  <p><strong>On fisheries</strong> the Council adopted the conclusions of the Commission&#8217;s communication on Environmentally Friendly Fishing Methods. The text supports the simplification and improvement of the EU&#8217;s technical conservation regulations to help to optimise catches of target species (reducing by-catch and discarding) and minimise the impact of fishing on marine habitats. The Commission has also been asked to give a high priority to schemes promoting environmentally friendly fishing, develop pilot projects for reducing discarding and to explore the potential for financial and non-financial incentives for using more environmentally friendly fishing methods. The Executive believes these measures can make a contribution to securing a more sustainable marine environment.</p>

  <p>The Council also reached agreement on a Regulation setting the maximum level of fishing effort for Western Waters. Fishing effort was allocated on the basis of kilowatt/days which member states will be allowed to share among their fleets. The new regime should ensure that fishing effort is not increased and that no major shifts in fishing effort occur. The Executive is content with the new Western Waters arrangements and supports the measures put forward.</p>

  <p>Finally there was an exchange of views regarding the establishment of a Community Fisheries Control Agency. The Executive believes that there is a need to promote more consistent standards of control and enforcement across the EU. However, the agency should be a small technical body, concentrating on training and joint enforcement operations. The Council welcomed the Commission&#8217;s proposal, which will now be discussed at a technical level.</p>

  <p><strong>On agriculture</strong>, the Council held a public debate following the Commission&#8217;s presentation of an Action Plan for Organic Food and Farming. The UK joined others in welcoming the plan while stressing that expansion of the organic sector would have to be driven by consumer demand. The UK would play its part in further discussion but would want to ensure that requirements laid on the organic sector were economically realistic.</p>

  <p>The Commission updated the Council on continuing World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations under the Doha Development Agenda and on its negotiations for a trade agreement with the Mercosur countries. The UK endorsed the efforts of the Commission to work for progress on both fronts and, on the WTO, emphasised the value of securing progress before the summer break. We re-iterated the benefits that a Doha deal could bring to the world economy and especially to developing countries.</p>

  <p>The German Minister presented a memorandum to the Council on renewable resources, following a conference held last month in Bonn. Delegations welcomed the German paper, noting the growing importance of renewables. The Commission said it would submit a biomass plan by the end of 2005.</p>

  <p>The Council had a brief exchange of views on the Commission&#8217;s report on the operation of the beef labelling regulations. There was general agreement that the regulations had done much to support consumer confidence in beef and that major changes were not needed. Further technical discussion will take place at official level.</p>

  <p>The Commission reported on continuing negotiations with trading partners over the rice tariff and with Russia on its requirements for certificates covering animal and animal product imports.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-07-14.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0714.htm#3">

  <p>As a rule, the Scottish Ambulance Service takes emergency patients to the nearest accident and emergency department, unless otherwise specified by the local NHS board. In some circumstances, the ambulance crew may decide to take a patient to a different unit that specialises in dealing with the patient&#8217;s condition.</p>

  <p>Each Scottish Ambulance Service Division is represented on the service re-design committees operating in their areas. This provides for the ambulance service to be involved in considering possible service changes at an early stage. These arrangements are entirely compatible with the principles of partnership working within NHSScotland. The need for such early engagement is also emphasised in the Department&#8217;s recently issued HDL (2004) 33 entitled <em>Clarification of Finance (Revenue) Arrangements Relating to the Scottish Ambulance Service</em>.</p>

  <p>I have set the following targets for Fisheries Research Services (FRS) for the financial year 2004-05.</p>

  <p>Delivery of Service:</p>

  <p>To achieve 93% of the performance targets set in the Schedules to the Service Level Agreement.</p>

  <p>To achieve 85% of the milestones agreed for Research and Development projects.</p>

  <p>To achieve an output of 1.3 publications per scientific member of staff.</p>

  <p>To produce 22 information leaflets and 10 major articles in the industry press.</p>

  <p>Quality of Service:</p>

  <p>To submit the scientific work of the Marine Ecosystems Programme to a peer review during 2004-05, and to put in place an agreed action plan to implement recommendations by the end of March 2005.</p>

  <p>To achieve accreditation by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service of the monitoring programmes for five new areas of work by March 2005.</p>

  <p>Efficiency Targets:</p>

  <p>93% of costs to be recovered from external customers (other than those agreed to be undertaken at marginal or shared costs).</p>

  <p>To restrict administrative staff costs to a maximum of 18% of the total staff costs.</p>

  <p>To achieve a research vessel utilisation of 96%, operating at a daily cost of &#163;12,150 for <em>Scotia</em> and &#163;2,960 for <em>Clupea</em>.</p>

  <p>To achieve cash releasing efficiency gains to the value of 1% of FRS&#8217; budget.</p>

  <p>These targets should provide a sound basis for evaluating performance by establishing a time series for certain indicators and by requiring external scrutiny by accreditors and scientific peers.</p>

  <p>Attached for reference is a table showing the comparison with performance in 2003-04.</p>

  <p>As Forth Valley were already operating &quot;Well Man Clinics&quot; they were not invited to bid along with other health board partnerships. Instead Forth Valley Health Board and partners were invited to submit a proposal for resources to continue development and roll out of their model for well man clinics on which we based our strategy. We have recently received their proposal which is being considered.</p>
