  <p>The Scottish Executive reviews annually accidents on trunk roads and investigates clusters of accidents at particular locations and routes with high accident rates. The Executive undertakes annually a programme of road safety remedial measures on the trunk road network targeted at such locations.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are responsible for road safety on local roads in their areas. In particular, local authorities are required to investigate accidents on local roads and to carry out a programme of measures to prevent such accidents.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides funding to the Scottish Road Safety Campaign for the development of key road safety education materials and publicity messages. Copies of the campaign&#8217;s Annual Report and Business Plan for 2001-02 are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17135).</p>
