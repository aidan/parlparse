  <p>Resurfacing works are planned to start in March 2011 at the earliest, however this depends on a number of technical and financial factors.

  <p>Yes. The resurfacing work cannot take place during the winter. The bridge is very exposed and some of the operations required, including bridge deck waterproofing and surfacing, cannot be carried out at low temperatures, in wet conditions or during high winds. It is therefore necessary to carry out the work between March and October to minimise the probability of excessive weather delays. Consultation on mitigation measures to reduce disruption is already underway with the Highland Council and other stakeholders.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-10-30.S3W-28070.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80397" speakername="John Swinney" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa1030.htm#2">

  <p>The Financial Services Compensation Scheme (FSCS) is the UK&rsquo;s statutory fund of last resort for customers of financial services firms, banks and building societies, and credit unions. The FSCS is an independent body, set up under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. If a financial services firm is unable, or likely to be unable, to pay claims against it, the FSCS can pay compensation to consumers. This means that credit unions enjoy exactly the same protection as banks and building societies.</p>

  <p>In order to benefit from the &quot;safety net&quot; provided by the FSCS, all financial services firms and credit unions must pay a levy. There is a limit to the amount that FSCS can levy and it is proportionate to the size and nature of the individual financial institution or credit union.</p>

  <p>Credit unions have an important role to play in addressing financial exclusion. Without the protection offered by the FSCS, should a credit union fail, its members would suffer disproportionately from the loss of their savings.</p>

Although each company monitors the overall weight of freight vehicles and trailers for loading and space allocation purposes, this data is not retained for record keeping purposes. However, deck space data is available showing the lane meterage used by commercial vehicles on the Gourock-Dunoon route (as currently operated by Cowal Ferries Ltd), on the Clyde and Hebrides ferry network (as currently operated by CalMac Ferries Ltd) and on the Northern Isles ferry network (as currently operated by NorthLink Ferries Ltd). Please note that we do not hold comparable data for the Northern Isles prior to 2003.</p>

  <p>The carrying statistics are available from the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre (Bib. number 49477).</p>

  <p>Common good land and assets are the responsibility of local authorities and it is up to them how to involve local communities in the management of these areas.</p>

  <p>There is a statutory duty on councils to have regard to the interests of the area in which the common good formerly related. Under the principles of best value they are also required to demonstrate responsiveness to the needs of communities. How these obligations are fulfilled is a matter for local authorities to decide.</p>

  <p>The Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 makes it clear that local authorities are the stewards of common good land and assets. Most common good assets are held in perpetuity meaning they cannot be disposed of. In many cases a specific deed of trust, or conditions of bequest, will exist for land or assets, and if so, then a council is bound by them.</p>

  <p>The ring-fenced grant for school travel co-ordinator posts was rolled up into the local authority grant settlement in 2008-09.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continues to provide local authorities with &pound;9.09 million per year for Cycling, Walking and Safer Streets projects which they can supplement if they wish to. Also, this year we will provide &pound;3.165 million to Sustrans and Cycling Scotland to deliver projects that will, for example, provide cycle racks and promote cycle training in schools, and other resources that tackle the school run, such as Walk to School Week material.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to the first supplementary to question S3F-1930 by Nicola Sturgeon on 1 October 2009 ( <em>Official Report</em> c. 20201), whether it will list the further 100 school projects that will be finished by the end of the current parliamentary session.</p>

  <p>In addition to the 152 school rebuilding or refurbishment projects completed between May 2007 and December 2008, as listed in response to S3W-27951 on 30 October 2009, a further 84 projects were completed by August 2009.

  <p>The remuneration package was set at the beginning of the recruitment process by Scottish Enterprise in consultation with Scottish ministers. The package was established using the Scottish Government&rsquo;s <em>Public Sector Pay Policy for Senior Appointments</em> .</p>

  <p>This was arrived at taking account of a Hay Group job size evaluation completed in October 2008. That independent, market-facing review considered the chief executive role as it is now, after the implementation of the enterprise network reforms announced in September 2007.</p>
