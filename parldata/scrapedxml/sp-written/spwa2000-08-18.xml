  <p>Information on the destination of special school leavers is only available for leavers from local authority schools who have been dealt with by Careers Services. In 1998-99, for those school leavers with known main destinations, 290 entered further education, 88 entered training, 51 entered employment and four entered higher education.

  <p>The information requested is not held by the Executive.</p>

  <p>The General Practitioner sub-committee of the Scottish Advisory Committee on the Medical Workforce are working with ISD Scotland to develop a statistical model to project the supply and demand of GPs in Scotland. This will include GP retirals, but this is a highly variable factor and the forecast will, of necessity, have a high degree of uncertainty.</p>

  <p>There are no plans for a full-scale review of the law on sex offences in Scotland. Work is already being carried out on certain aspects of the law through <i>Towards a Just Conclusion</i> and by the Millan Committee&#8217;s review of the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 and the MacLean Committee&#8217;s review of the treatment of serious sexual or violent offenders.</p>

  <p>We will also look closely at the outcomes of the Home Office work to consider what implications there may be for law in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The department does not collect data on the number of early education and childcare workers (often termed &quot;nursery nurses&quot;) employed across the full range of local authority services.

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not currently collect comprehensive data on local authority staff by occupational group and qualification. It is not therefore possible to derive a child:nursery nurse ratio for all early education and childcare services. It is, however, estimated that at September 1999 the average child:staff ratio in local authority pre-school education centres and partner pre-school education centres in the private and voluntary sectors was 6.2:1.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive set out its proposals for the regulation of early education and childcare in <i>Regulation of Early Education and Childcare: The Way Ahead</i> published in May. Providers will have to meet National Care Standards focusing on the quality of care but some input requirements, for example on staffing, will remain. The paper set out the intention to move to a fully qualified workforce but to retain in the short term the requirement that at least half of staff should hold an appropriate qualification. A range of qualifications is relevant including those leading to use of the term &quot;nursery nurse&quot;. For pre-school education, we intend to repeal the relevant regulations of the Schools (Scotland) Code and introduce a system of guidance covering teacher involvement from the beginning of academic year 2001-02.</p>

  <p><i>Working with Children: A Guide to Qualifications, and Careers in Early Education, Childcare and Playwork</i> published by the Scottish Executive Education Department in January 2000, describes different occupations, including that of nursery nurse, within the sector. It also presents a framework of qualifications available to nursery nurses and other workers. A copy of the document is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 6621).</p>

  <p>Other relevant information is given in <i>Childcare: The Training Challenge, An Action Plan for the Training and Development of Workers in Early Education, Childcare and Playwork</i> published by the Scottish Executive Education Department in July 2000. This sets out how the Executive intends to work with other bodies to help expand the workforce, widen training opportunities and enhance the quality of training. The plan makes clear that it is for employers to provide suitable occupational outlets for those holding advanced qualifications. To support the Action Plan, &pound;3.9 million will be available to local authorities and other bodies over this and next financial year. A copy of the document is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 7138).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive intends that the proposed Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care will regulate all providers of early education and childcare and that Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectors of Schools will continue to inspect on a periodic basis.</p>

  <p>Currently, those holding an SVQ 3 in Early Years Care and Education or an HNC in Childcare and Education are generally considered as nursery nurses. This is not expected to change. It is for individual employers to deploy staff appropriately to achieve quality standards and to meet staffing requirements. Employers are also best placed to judge additional training requirements for members of staff, including nursery nurses. This will not change when the proposals set out in <i>The Way Forward for Care: A Policy Position Paper</i> and <i>Regulation of Early Education and Childcare: The Way Ahead</i> are implemented. The ending of the statutory specification of teacher:pupil ratios in local authority nursery schools and classes will not of itself entail changes to the job role or training of nursery nurses.</p>

  <p><i>Meeting Children&#8217;s Education Needs: The Role of Staff and Staff Development</i> by Christine Stephen, Sally Brown, Peter Cope and Steve Watherhouse of Stirling University was commissioned by the Scottish Office Education and Industry Department in 1997. It examines the roles of staff (including nursery nurses) working in pre-school provision in the voluntary, private and local authority sectors. A summary of the research can be found in <i>Pre-school Educational Research: Linking Policy with Practice</i> , published by the Scottish Executive Education Department in 1999, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. no. 4023).</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive has recently commissioned a wide-ranging workforce survey which will provide detailed information on those working in early education and childcare, including their qualifications.</p>
