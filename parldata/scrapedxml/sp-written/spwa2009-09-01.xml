  <p>Information on the number of agricultural co-operatives in Scotland is not held centrally by the Scottish Government. However, the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society (SAOS) is the key umbrella body for agricultural co-operatives in Scotland with 73 co-operative members. Further information about agricultural co-operatives can be found on the SAOS website:</p>

  <p>The Energy Saving Trust (EST) has been appointed as managing agent for the scheme and will work with delivery partners to ensure that the appropriate insulation measures are installed to a high standard. This will include the management of complaints and queries regarding the installations, and ensuring that the quality of the measures installed conform to the standards required under the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT).</p>

  <p>Under CERT, energy suppliers are required to carry out technical monitoring of 5% of professionally installed insulation and heating measures and carry out customer satisfaction monitoring on 1% of measures. The technical monitoring has to be carried out in an independent manner by a suitably qualified person and this will apply automatically to the CERT measures installed under the Home Insulation Scheme (HIS). In addition, the Energy Saving Trust will be carrying out 5% customer satisfaction monitoring on HIS clients.</p>

  <p>There will therefore be two layers of monitoring considering both the technical and customer satisfaction aspects of the scheme. Monthly reports will also be provided to the Scottish Government and Fuel Poverty Forum on a range of outcomes under HIS including the measures installed and the numbers of complaints received.</p>

  <p>Seven criteria for area selection were agreed with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities (COSLA), following a joint COSLA-Scottish Government workshop for local authorities on 28 April. Local authorities attending this joint session contributed to discussion which helped shape the agreed criteria. Local authorities were asked, in their bids, to provide information relating to their proposed areas against the selection criteria. To assist in the provision of such information, sources of available data such as the Energy Saving Scotland advice network were suggested to local authorities. The full list of criteria used was as follows:</p>

  <p>Criteria A: Levels of carbon emissions in an area/neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>Criteria B: Levels of fuel poverty in an area/neighbourhood.</p>

  <p>Criteria C: Numbers of dwellings that can be treated with loft insulation and cavity fill.</p>

  <p>Criteria D: Potential for complementary funding from other sources.</p>

  <p>Criteria E: Appropriate mix of geographical areas.</p>

  <p>Criteria F: Ability to deliver within the prescribed timescale.</p>

  <p>Criteria G: Mechanisms for community engagement.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-09-01.S3W-26393.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80370" speakername="Alex Neil" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0901.htm#5">

  <p>The Scottish Government does not hold information on fuel poverty rates at the local level, such as Duddingston and Granton. The <em>Scottish House Condition Survey</em> provides fuel poverty rates disaggregated as far as local authority level; below this the figures are not statistically robust.</p>

  <p>The areas considered by the Scottish Government for inclusion in the Home Insulation Scheme were selected by local councils. In the City of Edinburgh Council&rsquo;s case, the areas put forward for consideration for 2009-10 were Craigentinny and Duddingston. It was recognised that data for some of the selection criteria agreed for the scheme was incomplete across Scotland at the appropriately disaggregated level. The Edinburgh bid included data indicative of fuel poverty levels in Craigentinny and Duddingston taken from a variety of sources. This included data from the home energy efficiency database, TADEA, a not-for-profit energy advice company, and information from relevant datazones identifying areas of low income considered to be most at risk of fuel poverty. Other relevant sources open to local councils included local housing or fuel poverty strategies, or data from the Energy Saving Scotland advice centre network.</p>

  <p>Estimates for those specific years have not been made. However, the most recent update of Professor Glen Bramley&rsquo;s model of affordable housing need was published in November 2006 and offered five-yearly assessments to 2021 of housing need and affordability at local authority, and housing market area levels based on data from 2005.</p>

  <p>In many cases, Bramley&rsquo;s estimates differ from the housing needs assessments undertaken for individual local authorities. This is due to the fact that local authority housing needs assessments vary in terms of coverage, time series and methodology. While it is not possible to model national affordable housing need with complete precision, the Scottish Government published new guidance for local authorities in early 2008 which provides a step-by-step approach to assessing housing need and demand across all tenures. Data from these assessments is expected from early 2010.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently considering how the Bramley model of affordable housing need could be updated in light of the significant changes in the economic climate.</p>

  <p>I met Mr Al Megrahi at his request on 5 August as part of my consideration of the application made by the Libyan Government for transfer under the prisoner transfer agreement between the UK and Libyan Governments. This follows the commitment given by Jack Straw MP, Secretary of State for Justice, that in cases where applications for transfer were not submitted personally by the prisoner, the prisoner must be given the opportunity to make representations. Mr Al Megrahi had the opportunity to make representations and he chose to do so in person. Therefore, I was duty bound to receive his representations. I accordingly met him.</p>

  <p>The meeting was of no relevance to the appeal. Should future applications be made under this or other prisoner transfer agreements, similar meetings could well take place and for the same reason.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>All prisoners have health care screening on admission into custody and have access to doctors, nurses and the wider health care team to address any emerging health care needs during their time in prison. All care is based on individualised health care need and age is no barrier to accessing treatment and the management of life-long conditions.</p>

  <p>In addition, the SPS provides health and lifestyle promotion, including the provision of well man and well women clinics across our prisons. SPS is also planning the introduction of a Keep Well community lifestyle screening programme to older prisoners, which will provide a specific additional health assessment to improve the early identification and targeting of prisoners at particular risk of preventable serious ill-health, continuing their care through a prison sentence and afterwards in the community.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working with COSLA and other agencies within the framework of &quot;Protecting Scotland&rsquo;s Communities, Fair, Fast and Flexible Justice&quot; to design criminal justice services which meet the specific needs of all offenders. I undertook, during my appearance at the Equal Opportunities meeting on 23 June 2009, to ensure that the Gender Equality Duty was applied to this work, which means that issues around delivery of appropriate services and continuity of support for female prisoners after release into the community is undertaken in a coherent and joined-up way.</p>

  <p>The community justice authorities are also working locally to strengthen the links between local authorities and other public and voluntary services to improve continuity of support for female prisoners in addressing their offending behaviour following release. One example of this is the mentoring project service being piloted for women offenders in the south west Scotland community justice authority for women subject to community penalties or on release from prison.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that all applications were subject to the same four stage assessment process: an initial sift to check eligibility, scoring against key assessment criteria for the fund, consideration of the ranked order by an independent advisory panel before final deliberation by myself and ministerial colleagues. Our decisions were guided by the extent to which projects demonstrated that they met the aims of the fund, whilst taking as much account of geographic spread as was possible.</p>

  <p>The assessment process is detailed in full on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p>We are taking a variety of steps to reduce food waste.</p>

  <p>For supermarkets, the Courtauld Commitment, run by the Waste and Resources Action Programme, aims to reduce food waste, as well as unnecessary packaging. More information on the Courtauld Commitment can be found at <a href="http://www.wrap.org.uk/retail/courtauld_commitment/index.html" target="_blank">http://www.wrap.org.uk/retail/courtauld_commitment/index.html</a>.</p>

  <p>For households, we support Waste Aware Scotland&rsquo;s Love Food Hate Waste campaign,<a href="http://www.wasteawarelovefood.org.uk" target="_blank"> www.wasteawarelovefood.org.uk</a>, which provides advice on how household food waste can be reduced through planning purchasing decisions, storing food in the correct way and not cooking too much. In addition, six trials to collect food waste from households for composting were funded by the Scottish Government. The trials found that 30% of people participating in the trials indicated that they had made changes to reduce the amount of food waste produced by their households in the first place.</p>

  <p>For commercial premises, Envirowise Scotland, provides advice to business on reducing waste, including food waste:</p>

  <p>The current Courtauld Commitment with retailers has a specific target to help reduce the amount of food householders across the UK throw away by 155,000 tonnes by 2010, against a 2008 baseline. We do not have any other specific targets to reduce food waste at this moment in time. The Waste and Resources Action Programme are leading work to develop a further Courtauld commitment with retailers, to go beyond 2010.</p>

  <p>We do not yet have information on progress in relation to the target on food waste in the Courtauld Commitment with retailers. This is our only specific target on food waste.</p>

  <p>Both Envirowise Scotland, <a href="http://www.envirowise.gov.uk/scotland/Envirowise-in-Scotland.html" target="_blank">http://www.envirowise.gov.uk/scotland/Envirowise-in-Scotland.html</a> , and the National Industrial Symbiosis Programme Scotland (NISP Scotland), <a href="http://www.nisp.org.uk/scotland.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.nisp.org.uk/scotland.aspx</a> , are funded by the Scottish Government to reduce business waste. An independent study into the performance of Envirowise identified that in 2007 alone, Envirowise reduced commercial waste arisings in Scotland by over 70,000 tonnes and raw material use by over 14,000 tonnes. During 2008-09, NISP Scotland diverted 73,742 tonnes of industry materials from landfill.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) also provides advice to business on waste reduction through their regulatory functions and has recently delivered a training programme to assist all field staff with the promotion of resource efficiency to all businesses they come into contact with. SEPA also contributes to the development of advice and guidance available through NetRegs,<a href="http://www.netregs.gov.uk" target="_blank"> http://www.netregs.gov.uk</a>, which contains a range of information about reducing, re-using and recycling business waste.</p>

  <p>There are no such targets in place at the moment. However, question 9 in Scotland&rsquo;s draft <em>Zero Waste Plan</em> , currently out for consultation, asks whether the government should set any targets in relation to the prevention of commercial and industrial waste and construction and demolition waste:</p>
