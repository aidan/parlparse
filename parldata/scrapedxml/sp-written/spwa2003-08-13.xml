  <p>We made clear that further support measures, in addition to those funded from our own &#163;50 million package for the industry and possibly part-funded by structural funds, may be necessary; but that because of public expenditure management arrangements in the UK the Executive would not gain any direct benefit from the availability of additional EU funding and would need to reprioritise existing expenditure commitments to fund any such measures.</p>

  <p>The efficacy of all Factor VIII and Factor IX products are assessed by clinical trials carried out in Haemophilia centres on behalf of the product manufacturers as a prerequisite to the manufacturer being granted a license to market the product by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Efficacy is defined for this purpose as stopping or preventing bleeding.</p>

  <p>The efficacy of Factor VIII and IX has been established for over 30 years. Treatments with these products are very effective, without them patients would suffer spontaneous bleeding which caused severe disability and in severe cases ultimately death.</p>

  <p>1. The number of ADR reports relates to the total number of reports associated with the active products Factor VIII and Factor IX. No distinction has been made as to whether the product originated from human blood or from recombinant DNA technology.</p>

  <p>MHRA point out that it is important to note that a report of a suspected ADR does not necessarily mean that it was caused by the medicine.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S1W-33605, S1W-33606, and S1W-33607 by Mr Frank McAveety on 14 February 2003, whether it has reflected further on any implications of the BetterCare Group Ltd ruling and, in particular, whether the ruling will have any implications for the provision of public services.</p>

  <p>The BetterCare Group Ltd ruling implies that the Competition Act 1998 may apply to public bodies in certain circumstances, for example where they purchase services. The Competition Act is intended to prohibit agreements between undertakings which are anti-competitive and to prevent abuse by undertakings of a dominant market position. Irrespective of application of the Competition Act, public bodies should avoid anti-competitive behaviour. Furthermore, European Community law places detailed obligations (aimed at promoting fair and open competition) on public bodies when procuring services. As such the Executive does not expect the BetterCare Group Ltd ruling to have significant implications for the provision of public services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) was the subject of a primary inspection by Her Majesty&#39;s Inspector of Constabulary in 2000. There were two follow-up review inspections carried out in 2001 and 2002. The cost of these inspections cannot, however, be separately identified. The review inspection reports were both positive and noted that considerable progress that had been made since the primary inspection. While the primary inspection was brought forward in terms of scheduling, these inspections are essentially part of normal Her Majesty&#39;s Inspectorate of the Constabulary activity.</p>

  <p>The cost of the involvement of the Procurator Fiscal at Paisley in the investigation and consideration of criminal proceedings against SCRO officers, which resulted in no proceedings being taken, also cannot be separately identified.</p>

  <p>An independent investigator, external to the police service, carried out an assessment of the process and procedures in place at SCRO Fingerprint Bureau in 1997. He concluded that there were no matters of misconduct or lack of capability surrounding the fingerprint comparisons carried out at the time. An Independent Scrutiny Committee later endorsed that conclusion. The cost of these assessments was &#163;19,725.</p>

  <p>The definition of an expert group is vague, potentially covering a wide range of bodies including non-departmental public bodies, working parties and advisory groups. Information on the establishment and resourcing of all such bodies is not registered and held centrally.</p>
