  <p>Part V of the Police Act 1997 provides for extended access to criminal record checks. Different levels of checks will be available with more detailed checks being provided for positions which involve regularly caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of persons aged under 18. There will be a range of positions to which this definition may apply including certain youth workers. It is not possible at this stage to identify what the cost of checks for youth workers will be but the average cost of checks is currently estimated to be within the range of &pound;10-15.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what resources for tackling drug misuse in Scotland will be available as a result of the recent spending review.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-09-29.S1W-10118.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80192" speakername="Angus MacKay" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0929.htm#10118">

  <p>In the Spending Review, the Executive has agreed a new &pound;100 million package of drugs expenditure for the three years from 2001-02. This will fund the Drugs Action Plan we published in May, which sets out our plans in support of the field across the four pillars of the drugs strategy: young people, communities, treatment and availability.</p>

  <p>Taken together these measures will build into a series of interlinked activities across the key areas, representing the biggest programme of anti-drugs initiatives ever seen in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In the course of the review we have been taking steps to ensure that we are making the best use of the resources currently devoted to tackling drug misuse, but also identifying the scope for new initiatives on drugs. That work has involved every Cabinet member and Departments across the Executive. We have also taken account of the views of the Drug Action Teams (DATs) throughout Scotland and their constituent agencies.</p>

  <p>Scotland&#8217;s first three-year budget for drugs will provide a framework in which the DATs and the agencies can plan well ahead. It will remove uncertainties over funding which, in some cases, led to short-term measures, and prevented an effective and sustained response.</p>

  <p>As part of the planning for the review we commissioned the first ever comprehensive study of drugs spending by government in Scotland. The results from this have informed the review. The study concluded that we spend around &pound;145 million tackling the problem, and there are significant additional costs in dealing with the consequences of it. The study will be published soon.</p>

  <p>We want to see a balanced strategy which recognises the importance for communities of tackling the drug dealers, but which also reflects the need to treat and rehabilitate misusers and steer young people away from drug misuse with prevention and education measures. That task requires the right mix of adequate resources, properly targeted.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s key aim for <u>young people</u> is to help them resist drug misuse in order to reach their full potential in society. There is clear evidence that later life drug misuse can be tracked back to pre-teens and childhood problems. The new resources will therefore include:</p>

  <p>&pound;21 million to provide support for the care of vulnerable young people and families where there are drug misusing parents, increase youth and community work on education and prevention, and build on existing work to ensure that every school pupil in Scotland receives drug education in line with national advice;</p>

  <p>&pound;6.3 million for public awareness initiatives at both a local and national level.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s key aim for <u>communities</u> is to protect communities from drug-related anti-social and criminal behaviour. We know how the cycle of drug related crime in hard-pressed communities can threaten community life and trap misusers. The new resources will therefore include:</p>

  <p>&pound;5 million extra for Social Inclusion Partnerships to put more resources into supporting community based initiatives to address drug misuse issues, in collaboration with Drug Action Teams.</p>

  <p>&pound;9.5 million for community disposals for an additional 2,500-3,000 drug related offenders.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s key aim for <u>treatment</u> of drug misusers is to enable people to receive treatment for drugs problems and live healthy and crime free lives. There is strong evidence of the effectiveness of treatment and rehabilitation in cutting drug related crime; reducing drug related deaths, overdoses and drug related harm, and improving the health of misusers. We want people who have misused drugs in the past to be able to access new opportunities for training, employment and education. The new resources will therefore include:</p>

  <p>&pound;10 million to provide treatment services in the community for more drug misusers. Our aim is to increase those in contact with services for the first time from 11,000 to 16,500 by 2004;</p>

  <p>&pound;21 million for rehabilitation services to equip former drug misusers for opportunities such as training, employment, education and accommodation;</p>

  <p>&pound;8 million to provide 120 new drugs treatment and throughcare workers to deliver comprehensive treatment packages from entry to release and beyond and throughcare support for up to 9,000 people leaving prisons every year;</p>

  <p>&pound;6.5 million to assist 1,000 reforming drug misusers a year to prepare for training and employment.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s key aim for drug <u>availability</u><strong> </strong>is to stifle the availability of illegal drugs on the streets. We know the importance communities attach to cracking down on drug dealers and organised crime. That is why we have already provided &pound;10 million to establish the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency.</p>

  <p>A key component in the drugs strategy is to base policies and approaches on timely and good quality research, information and intelligence and to ensure that the local delivery mechanisms are strong. The new resources will therefore include:</p>

  <p>&pound;2 million for a new national research programme focused on identifying what interventions are effective;</p>

  <p>&pound;3.3 million for enhanced information and support for DATs which deliver the drugs strategy on the ground.</p>

  <p>We are currently considering in detail how the additional resources will be distributed. The arrangements will require the DATs to be involved in planning the use of the new resources. DATs will also be required to agree outcomes and outputs with the spending authority and jointly monitor achievement.</p>

  <p>Scotland&#8217;s drugs strategy is about being clear on what we want to achieve; providing the structures, support and resources for implementation, and working closely with the DATs in delivering the necessary outcomes. We believe that we have done this with a series of measures since coming into office. With this announcement we are sending out a message to the Drug Action Teams, the agencies and our communities that the Executive is backing them with the resources they need, and challenging them to deliver local solutions to the problems caused by drug misuse.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The figures relate to (a) planning applications notified to the Secretary of State/Scottish Ministers where, for example, a council proposes to grant planning permission for a proposal which is a significant departure from a Structure Plan, and (b) Notices of Intention to Develop for certain proposed local authority developments which have attracted objections.</p>

  <p>2. The data relates to fiscal years.</p>

  <p>3. A number of applications have still to be determined. For 1997-98, the number is two, for 1998-99 and 1999-2000, the figures are two and 11 respectively.</p>

  <p>Following the launch of <i>Smoking Kills</i> in December 1998, an &pound;8 million drive to stub out smoking was announced for Scotland. &pound;5 million was allocated over three years, commencing 1999-2000, for health education activity focussing on young people. &pound;3 million was allocated over three years to health boards for smoking cessation services and Nicotine Replacement Therapy to be targeted at areas of social deprivation.</p>

  <p>Smoking cessation has also been identified as a priority for investment from the &pound;26 million health promotion fund. Health boards will be able to provide more practical support through the NHS for those people who want to quit smoking.</p>

  <p>A Smoking Cessation Service for Glasgow was launched on 8 March 2000 to provide a comprehensive network of smoking cessation services. The disadvantaged will be a priority group.
