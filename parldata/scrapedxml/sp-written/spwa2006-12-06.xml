  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will make certain that the National Alcohol Information Resource will ensure that alcohol and drug action teams&rsquo; corporate action plans provide information which distinguishes (a) drug clients from alcohol clients and (b) family members seeking counselling from substance users needing help and which does not repeatedly count a client who is passed from one agency to another as a new client at each move.</p>

  <p>We are currently in discussion with the National Alcohol Information Resource (NAIR) about the information that is collected about people in contact with alcohol services.</p>

  <p>NAIR does not specify the information that is provided in corporate action plans; this is agreed by the Executive and local alcohol and drug action teams as part of annual accountability arrangements.</p>

The Scottish House Condition Survey (SHCS) estimated that in 1996, 738,000 households (35%) in Scotland were in fuel poverty. The 2002 survey estimated that 286,000 households (13%) were in fuel poverty.

  <p>We are already tackling childhood obesity through the implementation of our diet and physical activity strategies. We have already introduced nutrition guidance for early education and childcare settings, funded over 600 Active Schools Co-ordinators, implemented the Hungry for Success programme which we are supporting through legislation with the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) Bill, invested &pound;5 million to encourage children to walk and cycle to school, and we continue to work towards making every school a Health Promoting School by 2007. We have also promoted health improvement messages to children and their families through our healthyliving campaign and the distribution of materials through NHS Health Scotland.</p>

  <p>We will continue to support the delivery of <em>Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines</em> <em>Network 69</em>, published in 2003 which provided advice to general practitioners about managing childhood obesity through behaviour change by ensuring that there are opportunities for children to eat healthily and be more active. However, we must also recognise that parents play a significant role in ensuring that their children have the opportunity to make the healthy choice.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department is clear about the need to fully realise the benefits of the new contracts. In 2005 the department set out its requirements for health boards to develop plans to ensure that they maximised the benefits to patients of the major investment made in Pay Modernisation through the new Consultant and GMS contracts and Agenda for Change.</p>

  <p>These plans highlight how the tools provided by Pay Modernisation have helped to achieve service improvements and support delivery of key NHS priorities such as National access/waiting targets, improved delivery of unscheduled care, and integrated service and workforce planning.</p>

  <p>The latest Pay Modernisation Benefits Realisation Plans were submitted by boards in March 2006. Boards progress in relation to these plans is monitored on an on-going basis as part of routine service management.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>(a) The information is in the <em>Prison Population Projections, Scotland, 2006-2007 to 2015-2016</em> News Release which SPS published on 10 November 2006 and is on the SPS website at <a href="http://www.sps.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.sps.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>Airwave is a cellular system which does not rely on individual base stations remaining operational at all times. If one base station is busy or goes down the terminal is automatically re-routed through another. O2, the service provider, is contracted to provide guaranteed radio coverage rather than a set number of base stations. All 632 Airwave sites in Scotland have a backup battery that provides power for a minimum of five hours in the event of a mains power cut. In addition around 50% of Scottish sites have permanent back-up generators that will provide power for a minimum of seven days. This is expected to increase to 60% of sites by the end of 2007. I am advised that this provision is sufficient to maintain full nationwide coverage and operational effectiveness.</p>
