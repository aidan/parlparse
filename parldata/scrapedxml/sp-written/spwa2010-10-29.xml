  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-36496 by Michael Russell on 28 September 2010, whether it can now provide information on the engagements of the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning during his trip to China; who he will see; who will accompany him, and what the total estimated cost is.</p>

  <p>I undertook a range of engagements in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing and Tianjin focusing on education (schools, vocational and skills based training, further and higher education) but also covering life sciences, renewable energy, the arts and culture. A full report of my visit can be found at: http://www.engageforeducation.org/blog/. The final cost of the visit including all flights and accommodation for the official delegation of four, Scottish Government hosted events, dinners and receptions is expected to be just under &pound;30,000.</p>

  <p>These costs are set against a backdrop of Scottish universities international activities contributing more than &pound;500 million to the economy. As we pursue every avenue to build growth and help Scotland emerge as strongly as possible from the global downturn it is absolutely right that we set aside time, effort and resources to engage with one of the world&rsquo;s fastest growing economies.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-28850 by John Swinney on 17 February 2010, what the latest position is on the waiving of non-consolidated performance payments (bonuses) by chief executives of non-departmental public bodies and public corporations covered by the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Public Sector Pay Policy in 2010-11 and 2009-10.</p>

  <p>37 chief executives are covered by the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Public Sector Pay Policy for Senior Appointments in 2010-11. Of these, 12 chief executives are not eligible to be considered for a non-consolidated performance payment this pay year. Remuneration proposals in respect of a further 12 have either yet to be submitted or have yet to be approved. Of those with a non-consolidated performance payment arrangement in their contract who have had their 2010-11 remuneration proposals approved, all have either waived their right to be considered for such a payment or have waived their bonus in whole or in part.</p>

  <p>36 chief executives are covered by the pay policy in 2009-10. Of these, 10 chief executives were not eligible to be considered for a non-consolidated performance payment in that pay year. Remuneration proposals in respect of a further three have yet to be considered by the Scottish Government. Of the remaining 23 chief executives with a non-consolidated performance payment arrangement in their contract whose 2009-10 remuneration proposals have been approved so far, nine have now indicated they are waiving all or part of any non-consolidated performance payment awarded to them in 2009-10.</p>

  <p>In waiving some or all of their non-consolidated performance payment, chief executives of non-departmental public bodies and public corporations are showing leadership by setting an example of restraint in a tough fiscal environment. I welcome this and thank them for taking that initiative.</p>
