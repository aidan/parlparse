  <p>There are regular discussions between the Scottish Government and UK Department of Health on various health related issues. The pilot practice accreditation scheme is a Department of Health initiative linked to quality of care and registration of GP practices with the English Care Quality Commission. In Scotland there is a broadly equivalent Quality Practice Award run by RCGP Scotland which aims to improve patient care by encouraging and supporting practices to deliver the highest quality care to their patients.</p>

  <p>Thirty-six chief executives are covered by the Public Sector Pay Policy for Senior Appointments 2009-10. Of these, 10 chief executives are not eligible to be considered for a bonus this pay year.

Of the remaining 14 chief executives whose 2009-10 pay proposals have been approved so far, seven have indicated that they propose to waive part or all of any bonus awarded to them in 2009-10.</p>

  <p>Alongside grants, the Scottish Government funds the work of specialist home renewables advisors to provide intensive, hands on support to householders on all aspects of their renewable energy installation including assistance with planning permission if necessary.</p>

  <p>The terms and conditions of the grants also make clear to applicants that they must secure any necessary planning permissions and building consents and signposts them to their local authority for further information.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Energy Saving Trust, funded by the Scottish Government, provide advice to local authorities and housing associations through the Practical Help service, including advice on planning.</p>

  <p>Micro-generation and offshore energy generation are already exempted from payment of business rates. It is not possible at this stage to give details of the number of businesses that will benefit from the new rates relief scheme for renewable energy producers. Figures will be available at the end of 2010-11, the first full year of the scheme. There are around 170 onshore sites across Scotland involved in the production of renewable energy that may currently be eligible to apply for relief under the scheme. The number benefiting should increase as new sites open. The Scottish Government will work with the industry to raise awareness and encourage uptake.</p>
