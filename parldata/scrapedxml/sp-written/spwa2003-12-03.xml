  <p>No such research has been undertaken, or is planned in Scotland. The State Veterinary Service in Scotland monitors the tuberculosis situation closely. There is no evidence to date of unexplained local spread or recrudescence of disease, which we would expect to see if a wildlife vector was involved in disease transmission. <a name="FinalCheck"></a></p>

  <p>The Executive has provided around &pound;2 million of funding since September 2001 for a range of projects which assist asylum seekers to integrate into the local community. These include facilities such as drop in centres, language classes and child care provision and the Framework for Dialogue project being run by the Scottish Refugee Council in partnership with Glasgow City Council and the Glasgow Council for the Voluntary Sector. In addition we have spent a further &pound;3 million on language services and on implementing the Scottish Refugee integration Forum Action Plan.</p>

  <p>It is for the relevant local authority, in this case West Dunbartonshire Council, to determine whether provision is required to deal with flooding in its area. However, I am aware that local authorities in the catchment of the River Clyde are presently investigating flood risk from the river and options to address that risk. So far, no formal proposals for flood prevention schemes for the River Clyde, nor for Clydebank, have been submitted to the Executive.</p>

  <p>Decisions on the provision of financial resources to manage flood risk can only be taken once a statutory flood prevention scheme has been confirmed by ministers.</p>

  <p>TETRA systems are subject to the same provisions for control of public exposures to radiofrequency (RF) radiation as global system for mobile telecommunications (GSM) equipment. These provisions include a requirement that operators ensure that public exposures are kept within the guideline levels defined by the international commission on non-ionizing radiation protection (ICNIRP). To monitor compliance with this requirement, the Radiocommunications Agency (RA) is undertaking an audit of base stations with particular emphasis on those near schools and hospitals. The general finding of the RA audit is that levels of RF radiation exposure are thousands of times below the ICNIRP public exposure guideline level. For example, the highest measured exposure level for the 21 Scottish school inspections carried out so far this year (and published on the RA website at <a href="www.radio.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.radio.gov.uk</a> ) was less than one five-thousandth of the ICNIRP public exposure guideline level. The measurement programme in Scotland has not yet been extended to include TETRA emissions but the RA propose to make appropriate changes to cover these emissions as TETRA base stations become operational.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to introduce a voluntary entitlement card for services directly delivered by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Executive is supporting a number of local authorities in the development of a voluntary citizen's entitlement card for their services including cashless catering in schools, school registration, concessionary fares and access to leisure and library services amongst others.</p>

  <p>Our partnership agreement confirms we will evaluate the local pilot projects in order to assess the desirability of creating a national voluntary citizen's entitlement card for appropriate public services.</p>

  <p><em>Agenda for Change</em> proposals, if agreed, will apply in full to all staff directly employed by NHS organisations, except very senior managers and staff within the remit of the Doctor's and Dentists' Review Body. This is the position across the UK. Chief executives in small trusts whose job weight is under 720 points will be covered by <em>Agenda for Change</em> . There will be separate arrangements for chief executives, directors at board level and senior posts with a job weight over 720 points after job evaluation.</p>

  <p>Out-patient clinics which deal solely with urgent referrals, such as fracture clinics, are not included in the national waiting times database because patients who access such clinics generally do so for emergency assessment and treatment and not through referral by their GPs.</p>

  <p>The information provided on the database (now available on the web at <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/waiting/" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/waiting/</a>) is the expected waiting time (90th percentile) for a routine appointment at each consultant-led out-patient clinic, following a GP referral. During the pilot period earlier this year, GPs indicated that this information was most relevant to them and to patients, when considering referrals.</p>

  <p>It is very important that people in Scotland know about the national waiting times database so that they and their GPs can use the information it contains to guide decisions about referrals to out-patient clinics. That is why our publicity material such as posters and leaflets is concentrated on GP practices.</p>

  <p>In addition, NHS Health Department Letter (2003) 54, issued on 30 October 2003, (available at<a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/publicationsind%5Cex.htm" target="_blank"> http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/publicationsind\ex.htm</a>) provides guidance on the use of the database to NHS boards and trusts and local health councils.</p>

  <p>The database is accessible via the Scotland Health on the Web (SHOW) homepage at<a href="www.show.scot.nhs.uk" target="_blank"> www.show.scot.nhs.uk</a>. A large number of links to this page are available, including on the Scottish Executive website at:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of changes to the method of payment of care home fees and the withdrawal of direct payment of residential allowance to clients, whether it will ensure that sufficient funding is provided to local authorities so that no shortfall in funding will occur and that no local authority will be required to make savings in its social services budget in order to reallocate funding to cover the new system.</p>

  <p>Residential allowance for new care home residents was stopped in April 2002, as recommended by the Royal Commission on Long Term Care. The residential care financial assessment ensures that care home residents are no worse off as a result of receiving less benefit income. Instead, they simply make a smaller contribution to the local authority towards their fees. Additional funding was transferred from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) and distributed to local authorities to meet the consequent reduction in their income.</p>

  <p>This October, residential allowance was withdrawn from those remaining residents who had still been receiving it since before April 2002. Additional resources to meet the consequent reduction in local authority income for October 2003 to March 2004 have again been transferred. The transfer was calculated using DWP's caseload information and divided between local authorities on the basis of their own caseload returns. This transfer included a one-off amount for the costs of administering the change. The transfer for future years is yet to be agreed with DWP.</p>

  <p>The average water bill for small businesses is not available, though we can use the size of the bill as a proxy for the size of the business, with a threshold of &pound;600 or less approximating to a small business. The average bill raised by Scottish Water from customers with bills less than &pound;600 in 2001-02 was &pound;225, in 2002-03 was &pound;260 and in 2003-04 was &pound;335.

  <p>The Convener of the Holyrood Progress Group has informed me that the policy of the group and of the Holyrood Project Team is to keep design changes to a minimum. However, it is inevitable that some changes will be required in any project of this complexity and scale. Detailed information about the number of changes that have been required is not readily available, and the provision of such information would involve a significant amount of staff time.</p>
