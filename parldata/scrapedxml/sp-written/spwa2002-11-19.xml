  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much has been paid to Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd under the PFI contract for the construction of the terminal at Inverness Airport in each year from the inception of the contract to date; what the estimated costs are from now until the conclusion of the contract; what the estimated final total cost of the contract will be, and what the estimated cost of construction would have been if no PFI scheme had been entered into.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the PFI contract, no money has been paid to Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd (HIAL) for the construction of the terminal at Inverness Airport. The total amount to be paid by HIAL to the terminal&#8217;s owners and operators, Inverness Air Terminal Ltd, over the contract years, is dependent on throughput at the terminal. Expansion of the terminal, to be funded by the PFI contractor, will be determined by enhanced passenger numbers. The cost of the terminal&#8217;s construction under PFI, as measured against procurement by public sector, represented value for money for the taxpayer. The details are commercially confidential.</p>

  <p>Street crime is not classified separately within centrally collected statistics. In addition to the specific targets for police forces already announced discussions are on-going with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and police authorities on setting a target to reduce the fear of crime.</p>

  <p>Excludes crimes of handling offensive weapons.</p>

  <p>In March 2002, the Executive set a target, for the police service across Scotland, for violent crime to be reduced by 2003-04 to a level 5% below the three-year average of 1997-2000. How crime rates are tackled locally is primarily an operational matter for chief constables to decide in consultation with the local communities.</p>

  <p>No specific guidance is issued to local authorities by the Scottish Executive on obtaining disclosure checks on members of school boards. School board members do not, in that capacity, normally have opportunities for unsupervised access to pupils.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does, however, recommend that basic disclosure checks should be sought on all volunteer helpers in schools and at school events, with enhanced checks for those who have regular opportunities for unsupervised access to pupils.</p>

  <p>At September 1998, there were an estimated 164 full-time equivalent teachers who had a hearing impairment teaching qualification in publicly funded schools in Scotland. Detailed information is not held for all authorities and is therefore not available in the form requested.</p>

  <p>However, the following table shows the number of peripatetic teachers for hearing impairment who were employed by education authority area in September 1999. No more recent data is available.</p>

  <p>Between 1999-2000 and 2001-02 the Scottish Executive provided &#163;80 million to local authorities through the National Grid for Learning programme of the Excellence Fund. This money was intended to help them achieve a number of targets for ICT in schools, including provision of modern computers and networking.</p>

  <p>The results of the 2001 School Census (available on the internet at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/bulletins/00168-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/bulletins/00168-00.asp</a>) and the recently published results of the annual ICT survey (available on the internet at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/bulletins/00193-00.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/bulletins/00193-00.asp</a>) give details of progress. The ICT survey indicated that, by February 2002, some 49% of secondary schools, 8% of primary schools and 13% of special schools in Scotland had broadband connections of 2Mbps or greater. In addition, 94% of secondary schools, 47% of primary schools and 39% of special schools have been internally networked for teaching purposes.</p>

  <p>As part of its broadband strategy, the Executive has developed the Pathfinder initiatives. Contracts to deliver broadband connections to all schools in the Highlands and Islands and in the South of Scotland (covering 8 of the 32 education authorities) are expected to be signed in 2003. A review of ICT infrastructure in every education authority is currently taking place as part of the considerations about ensuring schools outside the Pathfinder areas have access to broadband connections.</p>

The Executive made clear to education authorities in March 2001 that access to e-mail using, for instance, whole class e-mail addresses was acceptable for younger pupils, where authorities had concerns about child protection.

  <p>Varieties of GM maize with a marketing consent for import into the EU have satisfied member states, including the UK, that neither the crop itself nor the marketed product poses a risk in terms of human health and environmental safety and are not required to be subjected to testing before entering the country. None of the varieties listed have yet received this marketing consent. Maize products intended for food or animal feed use are required to satisfy relevant food safety authorities in member states. Maize products intended for cultivation in Scotland or the rest of the UK must also be listed on the European Common Catalogue. There are currently no GM maize varieties grown commercially in the UK.</p>

  <p>GM varieties without European marketing consent cannot be sold on a commercial basis and require a Part B consent to be released for research and development purposes. Scottish ministers would only be prepared to issue the necessary consent on the basis of advice from the Executive&#8217;s scientific advisors that it was safe to do so. There are no GM maize varieties currently grown for research purposes in Scotland.</p>

  <p><em>Consultation and Public Involvement EDraft Interim Guidance</em> was issued to NHSScotland in May. Central to the guidance is the need to involve patients and the public at an early stage of service change proposals, and in a modern, transparent and productive way. While the interim guidance is subject to a consultation process at present, NHS boards are expected to be able to clearly demonstrate that they have followed these principles for service change proposals.</p>

  <p>Significant efforts have been made by NHS Greater Glasgow to provide full support for the former residents of Lennox Castle Hospital and their families.</p>

  <p>From 1998 to April 2002 when the hospital closed, 351 patients were discharged, mainly to supported accommodation in and around Glasgow. The staff there are in regular contact with patients E families to offer support and advice, whilst additional measures to support former patients include:</p>

  <p>A Care Manager has been allocated to all patients discharged from the long-stay hospital, who conducts a yearly review of the patients and their care. When the need for further support is identified, a further plan is developed to meet the patient&#8217;s specific needs.</p>

  <p>During the closure process, Greater Glasgow Primary Care NHS Trust employed a Relative Liaison Worker who continues to act as a communication link with patients Efamilies, addressing any concerns.</p>

  <p>Social work services, through the established contract compliance mechanisms, will conduct a review of the involvement of families in the lives of patients who have been resettled.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. Etanercept and infliximab are available on NHS prescription. However, their use depends on the clinical judgement of specialists experienced in the management of rheumatoid arthritis. Data on drugs dispensed in hospitals is not held centrally. Centrally collected data relates to items dispensed in the community by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors.</p>

  <p>The Health Technology Board for Scotland (HTBS) has recently recommended etanercept and infliximab for use in certain circumstances in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. NHSScotland is expected to take account of advice and evidence from the HTBS and ensure that recommended drugs or treatments are made available to meet clinical need.</p>

  <p>As an agency of the Scottish Executive, Historic Scotland discharges Scottish ministers Estatutory responsibilities for scheduling. No targets for scheduling historical monuments and sites are set for the Ancient Monuments Board for Scotland, which is an advisory non-departmental public body, or the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland recognises the importance of finding new uses for historic buildings. Many will be considered adaptable to appropriate change in order to secure continued use. They will be given consent and may attract grant. However, a small number are considered by Historic Scotland as too important to the nation to warrant any change other than the least intervention necessary for their preservation.</p>

  <p>This was one of a number of options considered and rejected when Historic Scotland was established as an executive agency in 1991 and again as part of a review in 1994. The status of Historic Scotland as an executive agency, within the Scottish Executive, was confirmed by the then First Minister in July 1999 in the answer given to question S1W-696 on 28 July 1999.

  <p>Home ownership has increased substantially in recent years, from 1,132,000 dwellings (52.4% of stock) in 1991 to 1,506,000 dwellings (64.2% of stock) in 2001. This creates more opportunities for new households and those moving into home ownership for the first time. They also currently benefit from historically low interest rates.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s policy is to support Scottish households who aspire to home ownership whenever the financial circumstances of the household make this a sensible option. Our two main policies in this connection are the right to buy for those in the social rented sector and grant funding for low cost home ownership through Communities Scotland.</p>

  <p>In the three financial years to March 2002, a total of 40,934 houses were sold to sitting tenants by local authorities and Scottish Homes, and a further 2,134 by housing associations. Although sales of individual houses are not classified into rural and urban, 25% of local authority sales were in those 14 authorities with the most substantial rural areas, which held 23.5% of the local authority housing stock in 2001.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland and its predecessor, Scottish Homes, approved grant linked to low cost home ownership schemes for 2,906 households in urban areas and 770 in rural areas in the last three financial years to end March 2002. Expenditure in those three years for these purposes was &#163;67.9 million.</p>

  <p>Pre-natal, that is before pregnancy, ultrasound scanning, is only used in the diagnosis and management of specific conditions and, therefore, there is no uniform service. Ultrasound scanning is, however, routinely conducted throughout Scotland during the antenatal period of pregnancy, at approximately 10 to 12 weeks, to confirm pregnancy, identify progress and carry out accurate dating. Other ultrasound scans may be carried out in relation to the management of specific conditions in pregnancy, but these are not routine. Some trusts provide routine foetal anomaly scanning at around 18 to 20 weeks of pregnancy whilst other trusts only offer this on demand or when a problem arises. The Health Technology Board for Scotland is currently reviewing the scientific evidence for routine ultrasound scanning before the 24th week of pregnancy and the resulting recommendations will inform guidance to the NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to determine, from national sources, patients who were treated specifically in beds allocated for acute care. The following table shows the total number of individuals who were admitted to a psychiatric hospital or unit, excluding patients admitted to the specialty of Psychiatry of Old Age, on at least one occasion during the year specified. It is likely that some of the patients included in the table will have been admitted for reasons other than for acute care. The figures for year ending March 2002 are not yet available.</p>

  <p>The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art was founded in 1959 to continue the international collections of the National Gallery into the 20th century. It has never been the specific responsibility of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art to support artists working in Scotland, which has been central to the remit of the Scottish Arts Council. However, one of the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art&#8217;s aims is to acquire significant works by the best artists working in Scotland and to mount exhibitions of their work. The term &quot;best&quot; is difficult to define but all works acquired by the gallery must be able to stand up to being viewed in an international, as opposed to a local, context. The collective judgement of all the expert curators working at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, as well as broad professional opinion, inform these decisions. Since it moved into its present building in 1984, 50% of its exhibitions have been devoted to modern and contemporary Scottish art, including large surveys such as The Vigorous Imagination (1987) and Scottish Art since 1900 (1989). The first exhibition of a living artist in the refurbished Playfair Galleries in 2004 will be of Douglas Gordon, a Turner Prize-winning Scot.</p>

  <p>The Trustees of the National Galleries of Scotland are responsible to the Scottish Executive. In common with other non-departmental public bodies, the National Galleries agree a corporate plan for all their galleries (including the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art) with the Scottish Executive each year and publish regular reports on all their activities (acquisitions<em>, </em>exhibitions etc). The Scottish Executive monitors the National Galleries continuously and measures their performance against the agreed criteria laid down in the corporate plan.</p>

  <p>The Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art already publishes a list of its acquisitions in its reports. It does not at present publish the price of each acquisition nor give an explanation for the acquisition of each item. This is consistent with the policy of the National Galleries of Scotland as well as with all national museums and galleries in Britain.</p>

  <p>To explain each acquisition would be voluminous since the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art often acquires several hundred items each year.</p>

  <p>To display the cost of each item acquired would reduce the value of the works of art solely to their monetary value. The gallery already writes explanatory labels about nearly all the works it has acquired and these may indicate a reason for the acquisition where it is relevant to understanding the work in question. However, to concentrate on why a work was acquired rather than trying to give an insight into the work itself would be highly restrictive and divert attention from the work to the gallery.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The available information is given in the following table. The information held by the SPS cannot identify the numbers of remand prisoners who subsequently received a prison sentence for the offences for which they were remanded in custody. Some prisoners are imprisoned frequently for short periods and re-offend very shortly after release. It is therefore possible for a prisoner to be received into custody under sentence for offences committed before those for which they had last been remanded in custody. The available information therefore cannot identify how the offences for which a prisoner is serving a sentence relate to the charges for any previous period on remand. The information on costs per prisoner place is also not available. The SPS is set a Key Performance Indicator to operate within an average annual cost per prisoner place. Costs are not maintained separately by gender or sentence period. These are set out in the SPS annual reports.</p>

  <p>Local authorities already have a duty to provide throughcare to prisoners subject to statutory supervision on release. Under provisions in the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968, short-term prisoners not subject to statutory supervision on release are also entitled to request advice, guidance and assistance from local authorities in the 12 months following their release from prison.</p>

  <p>The Tripartite Group, consisting of representatives from the Scottish Executive, the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) and the Association of Directors of Social Work, has prepared a report on ways to strengthen the present throughcare arrangements and to manage the effective transition from prison to the community. One of the priorities for future action is to formalise liaison arrangements between SPS and local authority criminal justice social work services to ensure a coherent framework for throughcare services. I plan to publish the report next month.</p>

  <p>The number of hits on the site since its introduction is 395,908. However, given the opinion of the National Audit Office, in their report on Government websites, that hits is not a reliable way to measure activity, we monitor the site using figures relating to page impressions. Page impressions measure the number of actual pages a user views on the site.</p>

  <p>Since its introduction in June 2001, there have been 76,989 page impressions viewed on the Learn to Let Go website Emonthly figures are as follows. We had no firm projections of how many page impressions the site would attract, as there were no precedents to benchmark against.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive resources are channelled to the community and voluntary sectors in disadvantaged areas in a number of ways, for example through Social Inclusion Partnerships, the Better Neighbourhood Services Fund, and via local authorities, health boards and other community planning agencies. The Scottish Executive encourages local authorities and other agencies to involve the voluntary and community sector in planning and managing services at local level as they are known to have particular skills in working with particular groups and in particular areas. The Local Government in Scotland Bill sets out a framework for community engagement in Community Planning including a duty for local authorities (as facilitators of the process) to consult and co-operate with community bodies. We will expect to see the interests of voluntary and community organisations properly respected in the community planning process throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>Consultation on the review of the assessment and recording process began in May 2001. The Scottish Executive has been developing further, with input from service users and providers, the proposals for change that were published in February 2002.</p>

  <p>In conjunction with the Special Educational Needs Forum, a forum of professionals, officials and parents, the Executive intends to publish early in 2003, a strategy for meeting the needs of children who require additional support for learning. A draft bill will also be published early next year and further consultation will take place on the proposed provisions in the draft bill.</p>

  <p>These documents will set out the further detail on the proposals for the new framework. New guidance will also be produced over the course of the next year to support implementation of the framework. The approach of consulting with and involving those affected by the system will continue throughout the development and implementation of the new framework for pupils who have additional support needs for learning.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, debts, whether they are for water charges, rent, council tax or due to utilities are treated equally in the debt collection process.</p>

  <p>However, if the debtor is in receipt of certain benefits and the debts are being recovered by direct deductions, these are made in the order set out in Schedule 9 to the Social Security (Claims and Payments) Regulations 1987. In Scotland, council tax and water charges debts are collected together and are therefore on an equal footing. Debts in relation to electricity, gas or rent hold a higher priority in the 1987 regulations than those for water charges.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress it is making in Renfrewshire on the implementation of the 10-point action plan arising from <em>Scotland&#8217;s Action Programme to Reduce Youth Crime 2002</em> .</p>

  <p>Following the publication of the action plan, Renfrewshire Council received &#163;113,506 from the Executive this year to prevent and reduce youth crime and a further &#163;15,000 to help complete its youth crime audit. The council has now received a total of nearly &#163;395,000 for investment in youth justice this year. This money and the national initiatives we are taking forward under the action plan will support local implementation. For example, the Safer Scotland police campaign (Action Point 4 of the 10-point plan) was launched across Scotland in October, offering public reassurance and higher visibility policing. Forces will also be focusing on key local issues such as youth disorder.</p>

  <p>The Executive published a report of a local authority youth justice mapping exercise which contains information about existing initiatives in Renfrewshire. The report is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 24541).</p>

  <p>On 18 October, I announced the creation of a National Crime Prevention Fund. All national voluntary sector agencies that deliver youth justice services, including SACRO, have been invited to apply to this fund.</p>

  <p>Microsoft products used in the parliamentary estate are purchased under an agreement negotiated in March 2002 by the Office of Government Commerce on behalf of the UK public sector, including the devolved administrations. Through consolidating the purchasing power of the UK public sector this agreement has secured the most competitive prices for Microsoft products available to the organisations within its scope. The confidentiality provisions of this agreement do, however, prevent the publication of those prices.</p>

  <p>When developing the current Technology Refresh strategy, several office automation suites were considered, all of which offered basic compatibility. The Microsoft Office suite best met the technical and business needs of the Parliament.</p>
