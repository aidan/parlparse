  <p>The first objective of the Executive&rsquo;s <em>Strategy for Stronger Engagement with China</em> , launched in August 2006, aims to raise understanding of Chinese language and culture and, specifically, to have at least 200 pupils studying for Chinese language national qualifications in Scottish schools by 2010. Accordingly, the Executive is working with the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) to develop qualifications in Chinese that will come on stream within the next two years. We are also working to ensure the timely and coordinated supply of Chinese language teachers (with General Teaching Council Scotland and the Confucius Institute at Edinburgh University) and the provision of appropriate curricular resources (with Learning and Teaching Scotland).</p>

  <p>In addition to the activities outlined in response to questions S2W-31814 on 26 February 2007 and S2W-31815 on 26 February 2007, the Executive also supports, and is a member of, the Scotland China Education Network (SCEN) that was established in 2006 and aims to:promote educational links between Scottish and Chinese schools by bringing together those involved to support each other and to share experiences and good practice.work in collaboration with the SQA and other national agencies to develop qualifications in Chinese language and culture.raise the understanding of Chinese language and culture in Scottish schools and promote the understanding of Scottish culture and education in Chinese schools.All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at: <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>.</p>

  <p>We do not hold this information centrally at present. However, a list of China linked schools in Scotland has been collated by the Executive with British Council Scotland and the Scotland China Education Network, a copy of which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number: 41961).</p>

  <p>The Executive has commissioned a national survey to establish the extent to which Scottish schools are engaging internationally, including with China, and the findings of this will be available in the spring. A more detailed research study is being undertaken by Strathclyde University to ascertain the number of schools teaching Chinese language and culture in Scotland, as well as evaluating possible areas of concern with regard to uptake, curricular developments and materials. Findings will be available towards the end of 2007.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has provided &pound;346,000 over three years (2005-08) to the British Council Scotland to promote and administer a Scotland-China School Links Initiative, where up to 120 young Scots can learn Chinese and experience Chinese culture and way of life. The initiative also encourages Chinese Language Assistants to come to Scotland to teach Chinese and assists graduates from Scotland to travel to China as English language assistants. Further school links are being established through funding head teachers/teachers from Scottish schools to travel to China for one week visits, to establish new school links. There is also funding for head teachers and teachers to visit their partner schools to ensure that links can be consolidated and developed. Information, including application procedures are on the British Council Scotland website: <a href="http://www.britishcouncil.org/scotland.htm" target="_blank">http://www.britishcouncil.org/scotland.htm</a> .</p>

  <p>The &pound;4 million annual funding given to education authorities in 2006-07 for language learning and teaching can also be used by them to support the teaching of Chinese.</p>

  <p>In August 2006 we launched our China Strategy. Two key objectives within the strategy are increasing trade and expanding connections between businesses in both countries. Over the last two years the First Minister, The Finance Minister and I have visited China raising Scotland&rsquo;s business profile, strengthening links and establishing partnerships. Last year we signed a co-operation agreement with Shangdong Province &ndash; China&rsquo;s second largest regional economy.</p>

  <p>Scottish Development International (SDI) has offices in Beijing and Shanghai and has recently doubled its staff in China. SDI provides support services direct to Scottish companies looking to develop business in/with China. It has made additional investment in terms of awareness-raising about the opportunities and challenges of the Chinese market and in terms of information provision to Scottish companies. SDI works closely with key partners such as China Britain Business Council and UK Trade and Investment to deliver services, and seeks the support of the globalscot network to assist Scottish companies.</p>

  <p>There are no plans at this stage to relocate staff from the FRS facility at Faskally. Fisheries Research Services are however conducting an option appraisal exercise to ascertain whether or not further investment in the Faskally site represents good value for money, compared to a range of other options. Any decision will be consistent with the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s relocation policy.</p>

  <p>Information in relation to accidents involving fishing vessels and their crews is maintained on a UK basis by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB) of the Department for Transport. MAIB have provided the following details in relation to Scottish registered fishing vessels which have been lost and the resulting crew fatalities. Records held by MAIB do not show the nationality of deceased persons to separately identify Scottish fishermen. Details for the UK overall are also shown. Information for 2006 is, at this stage, still provisional.</p>

  <p>There is evidence that biosecurity standards within the livestock industry generally have declined in recent years and the draft order is intended to improve biosecurity at animal gatherings. Any occasion when animals are brought together from different sources brings a degree of animal disease risk, hence the importance to biosecurity of clear periods before and after such events.</p>

  <p>I cannot yet give precise details of how we will achieve the difficult balances between what is our ideal position and what is practical, achievable and proportionate but we will include in revised proposals the option for farmers who let out their land for agricultural shows to choose either to observe a 27 day post show clear period, or to restock the land after the event, with animals moved back on to the area used for the show being subject to a 13 day standstill.I am also aware that there appears to be a degree of misunderstanding about the role of the biosecurity officer at shows. This person will not be expected to have undertaken training nor indeed carry any legal responsibility but will, if contacted, be required to satisfy the relevant authorities on a range of matters associated with running the show in compliance with the licence conditions.Officials will now clarify a number of matters arising from the consultation and develop revised proposals and associated guidance for further consultation in due course.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are responsible for designing healthcare services, including acute maternity services, to meet the needs of the populations for which they are responsible. Services are expected to meet quality and other standards established by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and to comply with guidelines provided by the relevant Royal Colleges. Boards also take account of developments in clinical practice, for example in terms of trends in lengths of stay. In addition, Scottish Executive policy set out in Delivering for Health and elsewhere makes clear that services must be responsive to patients and place patients at the centre of their care.</p>

  <p>In designing services, boards will also take account of the design and capacity of comparable services in other parts of the UK.Within this framework, it is for boards to decide on the capacity of acute services, including acute maternity services. The Scottish Executive has not issued guidance on the subject of acute service capacity.</p>
