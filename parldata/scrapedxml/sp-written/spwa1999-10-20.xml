  <p>The topics proposed by the UK Government for the 2001 Census of Population were announced in the White Paper (Cm 4253) published on 4 March 1999. The White Paper did not contain a proposal to include a question on Scots language in the Census in Scotland.</p>

  <p>1. The gross expenditure includes an estimated apportionment for revenue contributions to capital and support services costs.</p>

  <p>2. Loan charges are excluded.</p>

  <p>3. All inter account and inter authority transfers are deducted from expenditure.</p>

  <p>4. The Social Work client groups have been updated in line with the new CIPFA guidelines on accounting for social services.</p>

  <p>5. The introduction of a new category "services for all community care client groups" in 1994-95 may have caused discontinuity in the time series. Care should be taken when comparing figures before and after this period. For example, a significant amount of the expenditure classified as for 'older people' in 1993-94, will have been recorded as 'Services for all community care client groups' in 1994-95 onwards.</p>

  <p>6. 1997-98 data are provisional and may be subject to revision.</p>

  <p>The criteria used were road safety, the impact on the environment of large signs, the cost of replacing existing signs and whether there was a significant number of Gaelic speakers in the area concerned.</p>

  <p>Following useful discussions I had on 4 October with Highland Council I decided to permit the Council to erect bilingual directional road signs on local roads throughout the Highland Council area if the Council wishes to do so within the resources at its disposal and where there is local community support.</p>

  <p>Prior to 1996, sewerage charges were collected as part of the Council Tax or Community Charge and were not identified separately.</p>

  <p>Non-domestic customers are charged on a number of different bases, including rateable value and volumetric charges, with various standing charges for connection. Non-domestic customers vary greatly in the size of their water consumption and sewage emissions. It is therefore not possible to estimate a valid average charge for non-domestic customers.</p>

  <p>Future charges will be determined on the basis of advice from the new Water Industry Commissioner who will take account of the customer interest and the investment needs of the industry. <br /></p>
