  <p>As the provision and management of allotments is a matter for local authorities rather than the Executive, it was agreed with COSLA that they would take the lead on the development of best practice guidelines. We understand that COSLA has met with the City of Edinburgh Council to discuss a framework for guidelines and is currently consulting more widely on this issue.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are best placed to assess the needs of their communities and develop policy on the provisions and management of allotments. As current legislation does not appear to cause difficulties for local authorities in this respect, there are no plans for amendment.</p>

  <p>I have set the following targets for Fisheries Research Services for the financial year 2005-06.</p>

  <p>Delivery of Service:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>To achieve 95% of the performance targets set in the schedules to the service level agreement.<br />
              To achieve 86% of the milestones agreed for research and development projects.<br />
              To achieve an output of 1.3 publications per scientific member of staff.<br />
              To produce 22 information leaflets and 10 major articles in the industry press.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>Quality of Service:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>To begin implementation of the Joint Code of Practice for Research issued by the BBSRC, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, FSA and NERC, and endorsed by Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Development Department, within two areas of the agency&rsquo;s research.<br />
              To submit the scientific work of the Aquaculture and Aquatic Animal Health Programme to a peer review during 2005-06, and to put in place an agreed action plan to implement recommendations by the end of March 2006.<br />
              To achieve accreditation by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service to ISO 17025 standard of the monitoring programmes for four new areas of work by March 2006.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>Efficiency Targets:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>94% of costs to be recovered from external customers (other than those agreed to be undertaken at marginal or shared costs).<br />
              To restrict administrative staff costs to a maximum of 18% of the total staff costs.<br />
              To achieve a research vessel utilisation of 96%, operating at a daily cost of &pound;12,689 for <em>Scotia</em> and &pound;3,665 for <em>Clupea</em>.<br />
              To achieve cash releasing efficiency gains to the value of 1% of FRS&rsquo; budget.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>These targets should provide a sound basis for evaluating performance by establishing a time series for certain indicators and by requiring external scrutiny by accreditors and scientific peers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive commissioned an independent study to estimate the summit&rsquo;s economic impact, including benefits and costs. I am publishing the study today. Copies of the study have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 38309).</p>

  <p>The G8 summit offered an unprecedented opportunity to promote Scotland on the international stage. The first-class policing and security operation underlined once again that Scotland is a great location for hosting major events. The Executive ensured we made the most of the opportunity G8 offered to promote Scotland.</p>

  <p>The G8 summit also delivered economic benefits for Scotland. There were clearly costs to the Executive associated with hosting a high-profile event of this magnitude. But the summit also delivered immediate and longer term economic benefits.</p>

  <p>The study includes a detailed assessment of the economic impact of the summit. The key findings were:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>additional spending directly associated with the G8 summit was worth almost &pound;65 million to the Scottish economy, while the net cost to the Scottish Executive was &pound;60 million;<br />
              the value of the worldwide media coverage immediately around the time of the summit has been calculated at over &pound;66 million;<br />
              using this figure, the report estimated the longer term pattern of coverage to be &pound;618 million over the six months up to and including the summit despite the inevitable impact of the London terror attacks on the first full day of the summit, and<br />
              the most important impacts will occur over the next few years as the increased profile that Scotland generated takes effect and is used to create new economic opportunities.</p>

  <p>I wish to ensure continuity for people currently receiving a service through New Futures Fund (NFF) and to encourage more comprehensive and sustainable delivery of the NFF approach. From April 2006, Community Planning Partnerships (CPPs) will take the lead in developing the local infrastructure of support services, building on the work of current NFF projects and other support services in their areas. This is consistent with our approach to getting people back into work and the related employment outcomes set out by the CPPs within their Regeneration Outcomes Agreements</p>

  <p>I recognise the challenges associated with mainstreaming NFF and so propose to make available to a number of CPPs additional funding of up to &pound;3.1 million in both 2006-07 and 2007-08. This is equivalent to the current costs of NFF.</p>

  <p>My officials will shortly be meeting with CPPs to discuss this in more detail. At the same time, the Enterprise Networks, which are currently responsible for NFF, will advise existing projects of these plans.</p>

  <p>While the Lord Advocate and the police have a duty to uphold the European Convention on Human Rights, their responsibility is for the investigation of crimes under Scots law. Torture, an attempt to commit torture, or conspiracy to commit torture are crimes punishable under Scots law at common law or under section 134 of the Criminal Justice Act 1988 by imprisonment for a maximum period of life imprisonment.

  <p>A request by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe in terms of Article 52 is directed to national government, as a party to the Convention. As indicated in my previous answer to question S2W-21211 on 14 December 2005, the Scottish Executive will of course assist the UK Government with any information sought by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe in relation to any inquiries made by him in pursuance of his powers under Article 52 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Lord Advocate has given advice in respect of the legal implications for Scottish public officials, including senior police officers, following the decision by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe to use his legal powers under Article 52 of the European Convention on Human Rights to investigate the use of rendition flights and whether it is aware that Scottish public officials may have, through action or omission, been aware of the deprivation of liberty by a foreign agency on Scottish soil and, if so, what advice the Lord Advocate has given in respect of this issue.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not generally disclose whether the advice of the Scottish Law Officers has been sought or obtained in relation to any particular matter. Any such advice would in any case be confidential. The request for information by the Secretary General of the Council of Europe, in terms of Article 52 of the European Convention of Human Rights, has been made to the UK Government, as a Party to the Convention and the Scottish Executive will assist the UK Government with any information required in order to fulfil the request made by the Secretary General.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no knowledge of any Scottish public official being aware of the deprivation of liberty of any person or persons by a foreign agency within Scottish jurisdiction.</p>

  <p>It is customary practice for the First Minister to ask the Minister or Deputy Minister with portfolio responsibility for a topic to reply to any letter about that topic. In this case, I responded fully to the convener&rsquo;s letter setting out the Executive&rsquo;s position.</p>

  <p>There is a rigorous process of assessing and evaluating individual applications to the Children, Young People and Families Unified Voluntary Sector Fund against the objectives and detailed criteria agreed by ministers. Value for money aspects are considered as part of this process and successful applications are selected only after detailed discussions among departments across the Executive. Progress against targets and outcomes are also monitored by the Executive.</p>
