  <p>For rural priorities (RP) capital claims, applicants must submit a capital claim form, ensuring the claim details are accurate, valid and in accordance with their contract. Invoices in support of the claim must be properly receipted as per instructions on the website.</p>

  <p>For annual recurrent claims, applicants need to complete two forms: a Single Application Form declaring all their land and any options on them, and the RP1 form, which records RP-specific claim details, following the published instructions carefully.</p>

  <p>Payment processes and procedures under RP have been established to comply with the detailed financial control requirements of EU regulations.</p>

  <p>Full guidance on the process for annual recurrent and capital claims under RP is available on the RP website at:</p>

  <p>The Langholm Demonstration Project is the main ongoing research project.</p>

  <p>This topic has been looked at several times and was reviewed by Park et al in 2005 <em>The Impacts of Predatory Birds on Waders, Songbirds, Gamebirds and Fisheries Interests</em> (report to Moorland Forum) and 2008 <em>Impacts of birds of prey on game birds in the UK: a review</em> (Ibis 150 (Suppl. 1), 9&ndash;26).</p>

  <p>Wider research that is available includes, spatial and temporal associations between recovering populations of common raven Corvus corax and British upland wader populations.

  <p>No licence to kill buzzards for this purpose has been granted. However any application to carry out licensed control of avian predators to prevent serious damage to livestock would have to meet two tests as set out in the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981:</p>

  <p>that the proposed licensed control will prevent serious damage, and</p>

  <p>that there is no satisfactory alternative to licensed control of the predator.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government would also not grant any licence that threatened the conservation status of the species concerned. Further detailed guidance has been discussed with stakeholders. This process has not been completed.</p>

  <p>Any guidance should contain a list outlining alternatives solutions that must be shown to be unsatisfactory before any licence can be considered. This would include: increasing cover in release pens, changes to pen construction or placement, disrupting predator flight lines, the use of deterrents and diversionary feeding.

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the unique challenges that face Scotland&rsquo;s rural and island communities - including those on the Small Isles of Muck, Eigg, Rum and Canna - and is committed to ensuring that appropriate support is provided to enable them to seize the opportunities available and allow them to take control of their own development going forward.</p>

  <p>Support is available through the Scottish Rural Development Programme (SRDP), a &pound;1.5 billion programme to develop all parts of rural Scotland. The LEADER scheme is one part of the SRDP. It provides a bottom up approach to delivery of innovative approaches to rural problems. LEADER Local Action Groups are based in 95% of rural Scotland and cover all of the remote rural areas. Local Action Groups are a local partnership of local public agencies working in the rural field and private socio-economic individuals or businesses.</p>

  <p>Further to this, Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE), the Scottish Government&rsquo;s economic and community development agency for the Highlands and Islands, has a Strengthening Communities remit, which recognises that social and economic development are complementary in achieving growth in remote, sparsely populated areas. HIE&rsquo;s Growth at the Edge/Fas aig an Oir initiative is undertaken across all of HIE&rsquo;s fragile communities and involves a higher rate of financial assistance, Community Account Management, assistance to social enterprises and voluntary organisations with aspirations to grow into social enterprises, and selective assistance to small private businesses which have clear community as well as economic benefit.</p>

  <p>Schools, provide a strong focal point for the whole community, and are a major factor in ensuring sustainability in remote areas. Local access to educational opportunities plays an important role in creating a wealthier and fairer Scotland, particularly in island communities where the range of opportunities and services available locally may already be less than is available in urban areas. That is why the Scottish Government has legislated to update and strengthen the statutory consultation process required when education authorities are considering changes to their school estate and provides for authorities in rural areas to have a special regard to prescribed factors before proposing the closure of one of their schools. This effectively creates a legislative presumption against the closure of a rural school by making such a decision one of last resort and supports viable and sustainable rural communities.</p>

  <p>The UK Forestry Standard, and its associated guidelines, sets standards for the planning, design and management of new woodland. It applies throughout Scotland to undesignated sites and to designated wildlife sites (where, depending upon the nature of the designation, special considerations may apply). The standard is used to assess proposals for new woodlands that are submitted for determination under environmental impact assessment legislation, for proposals for grant aid under the Scotland Rural Development Programme and for proposals on the national forest estate. In addition, proposals are subject to public consultation, and local authorities are encouraged to develop forest and woodland strategies to guide the location of new woodland.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) is the SEARS organisation responsible for providing guidance on woodland in relation to biodiversity and the historic environment. Guidance on the location of new woodland includes the Scottish Forestry Strategy which identifies conserving and enhancing biodiversity and protecting the historic environment as key priorities; the Scottish Biodiversity Strategy and the UK Biodiversity Action Plan; &quot;Woods for Nature&quot; which sets out Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s biodiversity programme for 2008-11; the UK Forestry Standard and its associated guidelines which cover biodiversity and the historic environment, and other documents, which include <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Woodlands and the Historic Environment,</em> and <em>Historic Environment Information and Advice for Forest and Woodland Managers in Scotland</em> . FCS staff also have access to information from other SEARS partners and government bodies, including SNH and Historic Scotland.</p>

  <p>The UK Forestry Standard, and its associated guidelines, sets standards for the planning, design and management of new woodland throughout Scotland, including on agricultural land. The standard is used to assess proposals for new woodlands that are submitted for determination under environmental impact assessment legislation, for proposals for grant aid under the Scotland Rural Development Programme and for proposals on the national forest estate. In addition, proposals are subject to public consultation, and local authorities are encouraged to develop forest and woodland strategies to guide the location of new woodland.</p>

  <p>There are 7,500 hectares approved for planting in 2010-11, and we expect that figure to increase, aided by the significant improvements we have made to the rates of grant available through the SRDP and by streamlining administration.

  <p>Since 2003, we have seen a rise in fuel poverty levels as a result of the continuing upward trend in energy prices and the effect of the recession. Energy prices are dictated by markets and regulation of energy companies is reserved to Westminster. I will continue to keep up the pressure to ensure these companies do all in their power to protect their most vulnerable customers from the effects of these rises.</p>

  <p>In the years ahead, we will continue to work to maximise the impact our Energy Assistance Package has on reducing fuel poverty levels and ensure it builds on the successes of its first year. As part of our continuing efforts to address fuel poverty I have asked the independent Fuel Poverty Forum to review the first year of EAP and I look forward to receiving its report and the recommendations it contains.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government considers that there are two important ways in which the Scottish people derive benefit from biodiversity and the natural heritage. In the first place, significant value is derived from user benefits, ranging from ecosystem services such as water purification and nutrient recycling, to the pleasure provided by visiting natural areas and seeing plants and animals. In addition, although it less readily susceptible to quantification or analysis, we recognise that for a variety of moral or precautionary reasons, many people also place significant value on the simple existence of natural heritage and biodiversity.</p>

  <p>Article 3(1)(b) of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive sets out that it only applies to coastal waters in so far as particular aspects of their environmental status are not already addressed by the Water Framework Directive or other European legislation. The Marine Strategy Framework Directive will apply to coastal waters for other aspects of Good Environmental Status. The Draft European Commission Decision on criteria and methodological standards for Good Environmental Status notes that the assessment and methodologies should take into account and, where appropriate, be based on those applicable under existing European legislation, including the Water Framework Directive. Links between the two Directives will be explored further during the implementation of the Marine Strategy Framework Directive.</p>

  <p>Some of this information is already in the public domain.</p>

  <p>Information on the numbers of police officers by grade and the pay ranges for each grade is available on the Scottish Government website.</p>

  <p>Pay for local government employees is a matter for local authorities and the information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Information on public body chief executives, chairs and members is available on the Scottish Government website.</p>

  <p>There were 359 permanent employees in the Scottish Government core directorates at 31 March 2010 whose full-time base equivalent salary was in excess of an MSP&rsquo;s salary. Of these, four had a base salary in excess of the First Minister&rsquo;s combined salary.</p>

  <p>Beyond that data already published and in relation to &quot;other taxpayer-funded organisations&quot;, the information requested is not held centrally and could only be collected at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>The General Teaching Council Scotland Code of Professionalism and Conduct states that teachers must not be prejudiced in their views about learners lifestyle, culture, disability, beliefs, colour, gender, language, sexuality or age. If a teacher breached the Code the Council could take action to remove them from the register.</p>

  <p>A similar arrangement is in place for the police force where the Police (Scotland) Regulations 2004 require members of the police to at all times abstain from any activity which is likely to interfere with the impartial discharge of that member&rsquo;s duties or which is likely to give rise to the impression amongst members of the public that it may so interfere, and in particular a member of a police force shall not take any active part in politics.</p>

  <p>Of course this is a complex issue and any use of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s powers in this area would require to take into account human rights standards, employment law and potentially also the boundary between reserved and devolved powers.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. 2009 figures are provisional</p>

  <p>2. The UK Tourism Survey underwent a methodology change in May 2005, with the survey moving from a telephone survey to a face-to-face survey. The change was made because of serious doubts about the reliability of the survey data being produced by the telephone survey methodology.</p>

  <p>3. In 2005, the Office for National Statistics changed the methodology of the International Passenger Survey by adding Prestwick and Liverpool airports as survey sampling points. This did not change the total UK estimates, but had a significant effect on the Scottish figures.</p>

  <p>4. Due to the unreliability of the UK Tourism Survey data before 2005, and the effect of the methodology change in the International Passenger Survey in 2005, data for years before 2005 have not been included.</p>

  <p>The common pheasant (phasianus colchicus) is understood to be native to parts of Asia. The common pheasant has been widely introduced throughout the world for sporting purposes and has been breeding in the UK in the wild for centuries.</p>

  <p>The red-legged partridge (alectoris rufa) is understood to be native to southern Europe, including France, Spain and Portugal. It has been widely released in the UK for sporting purposes. Some red-legged partridges do breed in the wild in Scotland, although it is doubtful whether the population would be self-sustaining without further releases.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not consider black francolin to be a naturally occurring species in Great Britain. We expect Article 11 of the EU Directive on Conservation of Wild Birds (79/409/EEC) would apply to any introduction of black francolin, although this is ultimately a matter for the courts. Domestic provisions to control harmful releases of species in the wild would apply, if appropriate.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-33201 by Richard Lochhead on 30 April 2010, whether it considers grey squirrel, American mink and Canada goose to be naturally occurring in the United Kingdom.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-06-16.S3W-34121.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80301" speakername="Roseanna Cunningham" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0616.htm#22">

  <p>The question refers to a previous answer (S3W-33201) concerning provisions of the Birds Directive (2009/147/EC), which is relevant to Canada goose. Canada goose is included on the European Commission&rsquo;s list of bird species of the European Union as an accidental visitor and as having an artificially introduced breeding population. Whether this could be considered as &quot;naturally occurring&quot; for the purposes of the provisions of the Birds Directive could be a matter for the courts to determine. We are not aware of any case law to inform a view on this. <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/wildbirds/eu_species/voous_en.htm" target="_blank">http://ec.europa.eu/environment/nature/conservation/wildbirds/eu_species/voous_en.htm</a> .</p>

  <p>Grey squirrel and American mink are invasive non-native species which were also introduced artificially into the EU and are regular breeders in the wild.</p>

  <p>Provisions of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 enable the Scottish Ministers to regulate the introduction into the wild of any species where appropriate.</p>
