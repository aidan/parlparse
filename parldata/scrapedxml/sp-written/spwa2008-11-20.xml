  <p>I recently announced that we would be asking a number of public bodies to consider how the land they manage could be made to local authorities to increase the number of allotments across Scotland, including the South of Scotland. Officials from across the public sector (including local authorities) will be meeting shortly to discuss the policy, legal and financial implications and the mechanisms required to effect transfer.</p>

  <p>This research paper by Mr Houlton records injuries sustained by working gun dogs over the two shooting seasons. A total of 337 dogs were injured (24.8% of the group) including 114 foot and lameness injuries and 41 tail injuries. The report demonstrates that there was a highly significant association between tail injuries and undocked Springer and Cocker Spaniels.</p>

  <p>However, there were only 22 undocked Springer and Cocker Spaniels in the study group compared to 409 docked dogs in these breeds. It is therefore considered advisable to await the results of the research on tail injuries being conducted by the Royal Veterinary College and the University of Bristol Veterinary School before any consideration is given to reviewing the ban on tail docking.</p>

  <p>Information on the business rates paid by individual businesses is not held centrally. The information available relates to the business rates paid on non-domestic properties. Some of these will be owned by businesses, but others will be in the public sector. Further, while from 1 April 2009, 100% relief will be available under the Small Business Bonus Scheme for individual ratepayers with non-domestic properties of which the combined rateable value is &pound;8,000 or less, a significant number of non-domestic properties will have their business rates reduced to zero as a result of other rates reliefs.</p>

  <p>Information for 2008-09 will be available shortly on the number of non-domestic properties which have been awarded relief under the scheme, using information provided routinely by local authorities in regular statistical returns. Using this information, it may be possible to make an estimate of the number of non-domestic properties that will pay no business rates from April 2009 as a result of the scheme.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will consider legislation to entitle children&rsquo;s panel members to have paid time off to participate in hearings.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-11-20.S3W-17667.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80331" speakername="Adam Ingram" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa1120.htm#6">

  <p>There are no plans to introduce legislation of this type.</p>

  <p>Section 50 of the Employment Rights Act 1996, states that an employer shall, with certain exceptions, permit an employee who is a member of a children&rsquo;s panel to take reasonable time off for the purpose of attending hearings. For many panel members this is already paid time off. Employers recognise that the skills and experience gained through being a panel member can be of benefit within the workplace. They also see this as a way of putting something back into the community.</p>

  <p>It is one of the strengths of Scotland&rsquo;s unique system of children&rsquo;s hearings that the panel comprises of volunteers recruited from the local community. The contribution that those members make is valued very highly. The reform of the children&rsquo;s hearings system is an opportunity to provide a more improved and consistent level of support.</p>

  <p>The Children (Scotland) Act 1995 requires local authorities to give effect to a supervision requirement made by a children&rsquo;s panel. The act also places a duty on local authorities to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are &quot;in need&quot; by providing a range and level of services appropriate to their needs.</p>

  <p>Resources have been allocated to local authorities and under the single outcome agreement, it is for the local authorities to agree their strategic priorities for the local area and express those priorities as outcomes to be delivered by the partners.</p>

  <p>Under the <em>Getting It Right For Every Child</em> programme, agencies involved in a child&rsquo;s care are being encouraged to come together at an early juncture to agree the child&rsquo;s intervention plan, its resourcing and implementation, using a common language and approach. This approach will be strengthened under the new Early Years Framework, jointly developed with COSLA, where the importance of early identification of need and providing timely and appropriate support is recognised.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government can set the direction of policy and is giving local authorities and community planning partners the room they need to deliver services that meet varying local needs.</p>

  <p>There is financial backing from the Scottish Government of around &pound;1.4 million for each pathfinder during its development stages. This will enable planning and development of proposals to establish a pipeline of projects for primary and community care facilities, and for other key infrastructure projects in keeping with the &quot;community hub&quot; concept. As indicated in my announcement on 13 November, the two pathfinders will be seeking private sector development partners through a procurement process during the first half of 2009. The hub initiative is designed flexibly to use public or private funding.</p>

  <p><em>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</em> is the agreement reached between the Scottish Government, the teaching unions and Convention of Scottish Local Authorities following the McCrone report. It delineates the central role teachers play in the quality and effectiveness of learning in schools. The outline of teachers duties presented in annex B includes &quot;teaching assigned classes together with associated preparation and correction&quot; and &quot;developing the curriculum.&quot; Teachers currently produce, use and interpret a wide range of materials to support learning and teaching as part of their normal duties. That will not change within Curriculum for Excellence.</p>

  <p><em>Building the Curriculum 3: A framework for learning and teaching</em> sets out the parameters for those involved in planning a child or young person&rsquo;s experiences of learning. It provides a curriculum framework to be used for all young people. It describes an overall outcome-based approach and is therefore not prescriptive on detail or content. It emphasises the principles for curriculum design and provides the flexibility, breadth and depth that people asked for in the national debate on education. The experiences and outcomes that describe the broad content of the curriculum are designed to enable teachers to adopt learning and teaching approaches that meet the needs of all pupils. Emerging guidance, including exemplification of the curriculum, will assist teachers produce relevant Curriculum for Excellence materials.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has recently established a new working relationship with local government which will help support the education of pupils with additional support needs, including those with long-term conditions. The Scottish Government is providing local government with &pound;34.9 billion over the next three years, an increase of 13.1% across the period. Significant controls and flexibilities have been devolved to better enable local authorities to respond to local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also undertaking a number of other initiatives to help support schools to provide support and services for pupils with long-term conditions including:</p>

  <p>Funding a National Development Officer to focus on transitions for all young people at risk of missing out on education and training opportunities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Teacher Education Committee Action Plan &ndash; <em>Framework for Inclusion, </em>a two year action plan to take forward inclusive education in initial teacher education and continuous professional development.</p>

  <p>Following talks with the Scottish Government, the General Teaching Council for Scotland has now added five new additional support needs areas to their professional recognition framework. These cover autism, dyslexia, hearing impairment, visual impairment and dual sensory impairment.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the Scottish Government will soon publish <em>The Autism Toolbox</em>, an autism resource for Scottish local authorities and schools. The toolbox will draw on a range of practice experience, literature and research to support education authorities and schools in the delivery of services and planning for children and young people with autism spectrum disorders.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the Scottish Government is to increase sustainable economic growth. The changing economic climate has further increased the importance of ensuring that the right advice and support is readily available to firms. The actions we are taking under our Scottish Government economic recovery plan will help enable more business growth/start-ups &ndash; especially important in the current economic climate.</p>

  <p>For example, we are working to make the planning system an aid, not a barrier to economic growth; have developed an online portal to help small and medium-sized business access, and bid for government contracts, and aspire to the 10 day target of paying the bills of small businesses.</p>

  <p>Business rates account for a higher proportion of costs for small businesses than they do for larger businesses, so reductions in business rates for smaller firms simply remove an element of competitive disadvantage that they suffer. We have already introduced measures to reduce business rates for our smallest businesses through the Small Business Bonus Scheme, which is benefiting tens of thousands of Scottish businesses.</p>

  <p>In addition, firms across Scotland can access advice on cash flow and business efficiency issues from the Business Gateway website and where appropriate, direct from Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage identified 148,000 hectares of ancient woodlands in Scotland, in their Scottish Ancient Woodlands Inventory, published in 1987. Of these woodlands, 60% were still semi-natural woods and 40% were composed of plantations that had replaced the original, more natural woods.</p>

  <p>Currently, all ancient and other native woodlands in Scotland are being surveyed under the Native Woodlands Survey of Scotland. This major project, led by Forestry Commission Scotland, will be completed in 2013. We will then, for the first time, have a comprehensive picture of the extent and current ecological condition of our ancient and native woods.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that ancient woodlands include many of the most valuable woodlands for biodiversity, and that they are also important in terms of cultural heritage. About 25% of ancient woods are currently protected within sites designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest for their woodland habitat features.</p>

  <p>Improving the condition of designated woodland features and increasing the area of ancient and native woods that are being managed to restore biodiversity are priorities under the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Forestry Strategy.</p>

  <p>The &pound;100 million accelerated funding will be split &pound;30 million in 2008-09 and &pound;70 million in 2009-10. To date &pound;9 million of project expenditure has been announced and further tranches covering the &pound;30 million will be announced over the coming month. We are prioritising bringing forward new construction but also spending on off the shelf units and land acquisitions where this is strategically sensible and offers good value for money.</p>

  <p>Edinburgh is a local authority which has seen its levels of resources protected this year receiving a total of &pound;36.1 million in 2008-09. Projects within Edinburgh are therefore not currently being prioritised for the accelerated &pound;30 million.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3O-2233 by Linda Fabiani on 7 February 2008 ( <em>Official Report</em> c. 5994) whether it will reconsider the decision to remove &pound;500,000 of funding for Expo 2010 in Shanghai, in light of Lord Steel&rsquo;s comments reported in <em>The Scotsman</em> and <em>The Herald</em> newspapers on 4 November 2008 and the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s stated desire to protect the economy from the worsening effects of recession.</p>

  <p>It is the Foreign and Commonwealth Office&rsquo;s (FCO) role to represent Scotland at the Expo, along with the other countries of the UK, and to do so not only if the Scottish Government provides earmarked funds. Scotland already pays its share of the FCO&rsquo;s budget and of the other UK-wide bodies at the UK pavilion and we expect that Scotland will be appropriately represented.</p>

  <p>I discussed this point with Ian McCartney, UK Commissioner for the Expo when I met him in June when I offered to discuss with the FCO the possibility of funding from the Scottish Government for specific events to showcase Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is planning that the Public Services Reform Bill will be introduced to the Parliament in early 2009. The bill will be accompanied by the Financial Memorandum setting out the best estimates of the administrative, compliance and other costs to which the provisions of the bill would give rise, best estimates of the timescales over which such costs would be expected to arise, and an indication of the margins of uncertainty in such estimates.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that I have written to John Denham, Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills to signal my support for the proposal to give employees a legal right to request time off to train and to formally request that the proposed legislation is drafted to cover Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recently consulted on extending the UK Government&rsquo;s proposal for a right to request time off to train to employees in Scotland. 93% of respondents, including employers, trade unions and business organisations, supported this despite the challenges of the current economic climate.</p>

  <p>Companies who continue to develop the skills of their employees through the challenging times ahead will reap the benefits of this when the economy changes gear. Investing in skills is vital for economic recovery and our support for the proposed right to request time to train aligns with our economic recovery plan. However, aware of the pressures facing businesses in these tough times, I will ensure that appropriate support measures are in place for employers in Scotland if this right is enshrined in employment legislation.</p>

  <p>To support employers - particularly small businesses - with the introduction of this right, Skills Development Scotland will establish a dedicated helpline, providing access to expert advisers to help employers assess the skills needs of their business and other training issues.</p>

  <p>We will work with trade unions and business organisations to develop guidance for employees and employers on using the new legislation if and when it is introduced.</p>

  <p>Deciding on sentences for women offenders is entirely a matter for Courts. The Scottish Prison Service is required under law to receive anybody who is sent to them from Court. Expectant mothers and mothers of babies and young children are no exception.</p>

  <p>Nobody likes the idea of a baby being brought up in prison but separating mothers and their newborn babies can have a lasting and damaging effect. The Scottish Prison Service together with social work services considers each case on its individual merits taking into account the demands of parenting very young children in a prison environment. Decisions to maintain a baby with its mother or to separate them are always based on the best interests of the child.</p>

  <p>For the avoidance of doubt, the construction of the generating station granted under the Electricity Act does not vary from the development consented in the 2005 planning authority consent, other than the upgrade of five turbines, however the section 36 consent must reflect the total generating capacity granted for the development.</p>

  <p>I have made clear, in my statement on 10 September and in the debate in the Parliament on 13 November that the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) will work collaboratively with public and private sectors in Scotland to maximise value for money from public infrastructure investment, using innovative approaches and at arm&rsquo;s length from government. Operational management is a matter for the SFT Board.</p>

  <p>As the publication <em>Taking Forward the Scottish Futures Trust</em> (Bib. number 45605) makes clear, and as I have emphasised in my statement on 10 September and in the debate in the Parliament on 13 November, SFT will work collaboratively with the public and private sectors to help identify the most cost-effective approach to planning, preparing, and procuring solutions to Scotland&rsquo;s infrastructure needs. There will be no single investment model. The most appropriate approach to funding infrastructure investment will depend on the circumstances of the project and the availability and cost of capital funding from the market and from public sector sources.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the strategic business case titled <em>Taking Forward the Scottish Futures Trust </em> (Bib. number 45605), published on 20 May 2008, which explains the objectives of setting up the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) and lists early priorities for action. This document can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/Recent" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/Recent</a> . It remains the intention, as the strategic business case indicated, that proposals for an SFT Finance and Investment function will be brought forward by autumn 2009 for possible implementation by 2010.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water, like other Scottish public corporations and non-departmental public bodies in Scotland, is subject to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s policy on public sector pay. The pay award implemented recently by Scottish Water was approved under the policy for 2007-08. Efficiency savings reduce the cost of pay proposals for organisations but do not impact on the level of increases that staff receive. The policy limits on the average increases made to staff ensures fairness across public bodies. Copies of the relevant policy document are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 46949).</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Sex Offender Treatment Programmes are currently delivered at four Scottish Prison Service (SPS) sites &ndash; HM Prisons Peterhead, Edinburgh, Barlinnie and HM YOI Polmont. There are no plans at present to roll out the delivery of Sex Offender Treatment Programmes to other prisons.</p>

  <p>The power to exclude a pupil for any reason, including substance misuse, rests with education authorities. It is, therefore, for education authorities in conjunction with schools to take decisions on exclusions based on the individual circumstances of the case. The Scottish Government is developing new guidance on exclusion to support education authorities in taking these decisions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has established an expert steering group on substance misuse education in schools to produce advice, guidance and proposals aimed at helping schools and authorities to achieve the improvements sought through Curriculum for Excellence.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what representations it has made to the UK Government regarding the UK Counter-Terrorism Bill.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-11-20.S3W-17192.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa1120.htm#39">

  <p>Counter-Terrorism legislation is reserved. I have, however, met Lord West, the Parliamentary Under Secretary for Security and Counter Terrorism, to discuss counter-terrorism issues, including the Counter-Terrorism Bill and I have written to both the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith MP and the Minister of State for Employment and Welfare Reform and Minister for London, Tony McNulty MP, on aspects of the legislation.</p>

  <p>Terrorism is perpetuated by individuals not communities and while there is clearly a need for government to ensure that communities are safe from harm, there is also a need to ensure that all are protected from harassment. The Scottish Government has, therefore, made it clear that we will support this legislation provided that the measures are proportionate, fit for purpose and accord fully with Scots law.</p>

  <p>We have a fully committed programme of transport infrastructure investment to 2012. We have already brought forward plans for the Edinburgh-Glasgow Improvement Programme as part of the Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR) and the Forth Replacement Crossing is also being taken forward on that basis.</p>

  <p>The STPR is currently in the process of concluding and ministers are considering the emerging findings. It is expected there will be an announcement on the outcome of the review later this year.</p>
