  <p>All NHS Scotland organisations responsible for patient services are required to provide activity data via Scottish Morbidity Record (SMR) to the Information and Statistics Division, NHS Scotland.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for NHS boards to use all available sources of information in planning healthcare services required to meet the assessed needs of their resident populations.</p>

  <p>Six additional consultant oncology posts were created from the first year&rsquo;s investment plans to support implementation of <i>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change.</i> It is expected that appointments to these posts will drive down the current levels of new referrals per consultant at the Beatson.</p>

  <p>During the term of his appointment as Medical Director at the Beatson Oncology Centre, Dr Adam Bryson reports directly to the Chief Executive of NHS Greater Glasgow, Mr Tom Divers. The NHS Performance Assessment Framework provides the focus for annual accountability reviews with NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The answer given to question S1W-20103 reflected the difficulty in obtaining full information timeously at the time of drafting of the answer. I am pleased to give the information requested, which I have now been able to obtain.</p>

  <p>Following the answer given to question S1W-9585, further discussions were held both within the Executive and with our health service colleagues to fully assess the location and specialty breakdown for the new consultant posts to be established. As a result of these discussions, it was decided that the funding announced in June 2000 should be specifically targeted to create an additional six posts in cancer services, two for the establishment of a national retrieval service for the transport of critically ill children and two in immunology. Further and substantial new funding in cancer services was also announced on 3 July 2001, to support the implementation of <i>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change</i>.</p>

  <p>In full consultation with the three regional cancer networks, the services provided for patients with cancer have been enhanced by the equivalent of six additional whole time consultant posts as a direct result of this funding. The allocation of two of the consultant posts in the national retrieval service made it possible for the service to commence formally at the beginning of May 2001. Of the two posts targeted for immunology services, the advertisement for one has been instructed and discussions are continuing to achieve the most effective use of the other post to support services.</p>

  <p>The higher education institutions have advised that 99 pre-registration student radiographers began training in academic year 2000-01. I also refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-22801 today.</p>

  <p>At last December's Fisheries Council, the commission proposed reductions in various Nephrops total allocated catch (TAC). In line with the scientific advice, the UK argued successfully for increases on these commission proposals. The outcome for 2002 was a Nephrops TAC in the North Sea restored to 2000 levels, and a Nephrops TAC West of Scotland restored to 2001 levels but lower than the TAC for 2000.</p>

  <p>I have decided to establish a high-level Scottish Waste Strategy Advisory Group, which I shall chair, to assist me to ensure the strategy is being effective and to advise on any changes which might be required as it develops. I envisage the group consisting of representatives of key stakeholders in the waste field, including local government, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the Scottish Environmental Services Association, Enterprise Agencies, the Institute of Waste Management, NGOs, CBI Scotland, the Recycling Advisory Group Scotland, and REMADE Scotland. The group will initially meet some three times over the next year and its composition and remit will be reviewed at that stage.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water (WoSW). The Chief Executive&rsquo;s response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The proposed new water treatment plant at Milngavie has been sized to meet expected demand over the foreseeable future. This has resulted in a 390 Ml/d demand which is being accommodated by utilising 150 Ml/d spare capacity at Balmore Water Treatment Works (WTW) and building a new 240Ml/d plant at Milngavie. Traditional ways of sizing treatment plants were to allow for treating 110% of the reliable yield of the catchment feeding the works. This methodology would have indicated a need for 490 Ml/d capacity, i.e. a new plant at Milngavie with 340 Ml/d capacity.</p>

  <p>Domestic demand is the product of population times the amount consumed per head. Projections show the supply population to be falling and recent thinking suggests per capita water consumption will be near static. The overall effect is expected to be marginally falling future demand. The GRO standard figures were used as a basis and these were modified through extensive additional consultation and consideration of WoSW historical data. Current water demands are available in the Glasgow and the Clyde Valley Joint Structure Plan 2000 and also in the Scottish Office &ndash; Scottish Domestic Consumption Study. However, Katrine Water Project and WoSW also undertook studies to establish Per Capita Consumption figures.</p>

  <p>Industrial and commercial demand is mainly through metered supplies so we have reliable figures for this element. No allowance has been made for future increases in commercial demand.</p>

  <p>One aspect of the supply volume which we can influence is leakage. There is an overall target for reduction in leakage of between 50 and 70 Ml/d for the whole Glasgow network. This has been determined as the economic level of leakage after extensive studies by RPS Limited. The target for the areas directly supplied by Milngavie WTW is 43 Ml/d. This has been taken into account in determining the level of supply required from the Katrine Water Project.</p>

  <p>It should also be noted that demand is not constant and there are considerable seasonal and daily variations. Short-term peaks frequently occur and the whole system has to be capable of maintaining supply under all conditions short of the most catastrophic of incidents. To size the new works to accommodate short-term peaks would necessitate building a larger plant. As an alternative, treated water reservoirs are used to attenuate the short-term peaks in demand. The sizing of the new plant is a carefully calculated balance between treatment capacity of the plant and the storage capacity of the reservoirs.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West of Scotland Water. The Chief Executive&rsquo;s response is as follows:</p>

  <p>It would not be practical to place an electronic copy of the full Environmental Statement from the planning application for the Katrine Water Project on the authority&rsquo;s website as it has a file size of over 156 megabytes. This is a very large file, being 500 times the size of the current Water Bill on the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s website. In practise, if it were put on the authority&rsquo;s website it would overload the system.</p>

  <p>To download this file with a high speed ISDN line could take an hour, and with a standard modem over a phone line connection it could take 10 hours.</p>

  <p>As the Environmental Statement is only one part of the planning application then, it could be reasoned, that the whole planning application should be made available electronically. The planning application comprises files totalling 347 MB.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for West Of Scotland Water. The Chief Executive&rsquo;s response is as follows:</p>

  <p>In their tender returns to West of Scotland Water, none of the bidders made any specific proposals to construct a water treatment plant at Milngavie since they were not asked to.</p>

  <p>Specifically, the OJEC notice for this project (issued in December 1999) states the following:</p>

  <p>(a) The contract is likely to include for project development as well as the design, construction and commissioning of a potable water treatment facility with associated pumping station(s), storage tank(s) and pipelines. It is the authority&rsquo;s intention to enter into a partnering agreement with the successful tenderer.</p>

  <p>(b) It is intended that the initial award will include participation in the project development and option appraisal and will result in a full design with target completion costs. It is anticipated that the same tendering entity responsible for producing the design will be instructed to construct the works.</p>

  <p>(c) The purpose of the works is to upgrade the existing water supply to the greater Glasgow area in line with current and future UK and EU legislation relating to water quality.</p>

  <p>The tendering process adopted by West of Scotland Water was explained to Mr McNulty in reply to his letter of 15 November 2001.</p>

  <p>The Executive is investing &#163;23.5 million over the four years to 2004 to support the development across Scotland of programmes such as CHOSI for persistent offenders. Our Action Programme to reduce youth crime, published in January 2002, states that we will provide an interim report on the use of the first slice of this investment. This will be available within the next two months.</p>
