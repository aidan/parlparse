  <p>Whilst local government had flexibility to allocate other resources to this area, the specific amounts allocated to local government for Alternatives to Exclusion programme from 2003 to 2007 were as follows:</p>

  <p>2003-04: &pound;11 million</p>

  <p>2004-05: &pound;11 million</p>

  <p>2005-06: &pound;11 million</p>

  <p>2006-07: &pound;11 million.</p>

  <p>Some spending on children and young people will have been subsumed within budgets that covered services to people of all ages - e.g. community health &ndash; and as such, it is not possible to identify the total budget for children and young people over this period. It is not therefore possible to present this as a percentage of the budget for children and young people.</p>

  <p>No. The National Year of Reading 2008 is an initiative in England funded by the Department for Children, Schools and Families and led by the National Literacy Trust and the Reading Agency. In Scotland, activities to promote reading and literacy are delivered through a wide range of partners, including the Scottish Book Trust, the Books, Reading and Writing (BRAW) project, Communities Scotland and Learning and Teaching Scotland as well as, of course, through public libraries.</p>

  <p>Although the tables show a rising trend in compensation payments, the number of claims is steady with around 150 reaching settlement each year. The large increase in 2006-07 is considered to be exceptional and caused by a larger than normal number of high-value settlements &ndash; mostly birth related cases which often take several years to settle.</p>

  <p>Based on a population count, proportionally the amount of money paid out in Scotland on clinical negligence claims is far less than that in the rest of the UK.</p>

  <p>It is for each local authority to decide how they allocate their funding to particular projects. A record level of investment in local government is only one part of the package that we agreed with COSLA in our concordat. It also contains a commitment to reduce ring fencing, which will give local authorities much greater freedom and flexibility to allocate their resources as they wish. However we hope that local authorities will wish to allocate funding to homecoming, and early indications are that many will do so.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has a national antisocial behaviour strategy which was introduced with the Antisocial Behaviour Act 2004. The strategy, which applies to all including tenants is currently under review, the findings of which will be reported to Parliament by the end of 2008. There are provisions in the act that give registered social landlords and local authorities robust powers to address antisocial behaviour of their tenants. The Act also contains provisions to ensure that private landlords fulfil their responsibility to address the behaviour of their tenants.</p>

To support this process I am issuing a discussion paper designed to initiate discussion and debate among stakeholders across Scotland and generate a dialogue to inform the way forward.

The National Year of Reading 2008 is an initiative in England funded by the Department for Children, Schools and Families and led by the National Literacy Trust and the Reading Agency.

  <p>I had a useful meeting on 28 January with a cross-party group of MSPs and the Chair and Chief Executive of Project Scotland in which I confirmed funding for 2008-09 of &pound;1.4 million to meet current commitments to volunteers.</p>

  <p>In doing so, I recognised the quality of the work done by Project Scotland, in particular the way in which it had raised the profile of volunteering amongst young people and had identified ways in which young people could improve their skills and employability.</p>

  <p>I noted that the funding of Project Scotland had been an ad hoc arrangement in previous years, rather than an established programme, and that this had made it difficult for Project Scotland to secure funding from the intended private sector funders who, nevertheless, continued to show considerable interest.</p>

  <p>The outcome of the meeting was that, as it had substantial potential to assist in the delivery of outcomes in the skills and employability area, Project Scotland should pursue further discussions with the private sector and agencies working on such programmes in order to secure long-term funding.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, like the Scottish Executive before it, does not provide specific funding for the rebuilding of individual schools. Under the local government settlement the government makes capital resources available to authorities. It is then for the authority to decide what proportion of their allocation, together with any other resources they wish so to deploy, will be used to fund capital investment in schools and in which particular schools.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Budget and the concordat signed by the Scottish Government and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities provide for significant growth in the capital resources being made available to local authorities. There is almost &pound;3 billion over the three year period 2008-09 to 2010-11 to secure investment in schools and other local government infrastructure, including an extra &pound;115 million in 2008-09 which can be invested in schools if authorities so choose. The local government capital budget represents an average increase of 15% in each year of the settlement compared to 2007-08 figures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive encourages and supports partnership working between local authorities and teacher education universities to ensure that initial teacher education courses and induction arrangements provide the best possible preparation for student and probationer teachers.</p>

  <p>We are also committed to ensuring that all teachers engage in relevant, high quality continuing professional development opportunities that enable them to meet their full potential.</p>

  <p>A recent example of how discussion about how a particular issue should be covered in initial teacher education and reinforced by continuing professional development was a constructive meeting involving Ministers, Deans of Faculties of Education and Sir Jackie Stewart about dyslexia.</p>

  <p>My officials have recently held discussions with the chair of the Scottish Archaeological Finds Allocation Panel and the Queen and Lord Treasurer's Remembrancer to discuss the operation of the Treasure Trove system in Scotland. I have also offered to meet the chair and the other panel members.</p>

  <p>In addition to this I have recently agreed to the publication of a code of practice on Treasure Trove which is intended to act as an advisory notice setting out guidance and best practice in relation to Scots common law as applied to portable antiquities.</p>

  <p>The code will be published and widely distributed shortly.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency frequently discuss a wide range of matters, including the disposal of construction site waste. The Woodfuel Task Force which we launched in June last year, has also considered this issue. We are currently considering its recommendations.</p>
