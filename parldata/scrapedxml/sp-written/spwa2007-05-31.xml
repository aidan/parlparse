  <p>The consultation on the draft regulations on the licensing of animal dealers has been completed and the responses are being considered. As a result of these responses it will be necessary to make a number of changes to the draft regulations before they are presented to Parliament.

The European Commission proposal to increase the de-minimis limit on agricultural support from 1 January 2008, if accepted by member states, might prove useful.

  <p>In his statement to parliament last week, the First Minister set out the future direction of economic policy in Scotland. He made clear that delivering faster and more sustainable growth is this government&rsquo;s overarching priority.</p>

  <p>In particular, we have set ourselves an explicit objective to increase Scotland&rsquo;s rate of growth to at least match UK growth during this parliamentary term. Equally important, we have set ourselves a further objective that all our citizens should benefit from this growth and that this growth should be environmentally sustainable.</p>

  <p>Economic success is the prerequisite of every other priority for this government, whether that is a world-class education system, a properly funded and respected national health service or getting people into employment as a means of fostering a sense of responsibility and social cohesion.</p>

We will aim to bring it into line with that of other small European nations.

  <p>Through our trade and investment arm, Scottish Development International, we will promote Scottish economic growth by:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>increasing the participation of Scottish companies &ndash; especially those with strong growth potential in the industries<sup>1</sup> designated as high priority by the enterprise networks &ndash; in international markets;</p>
<p>encouraging companies based outside Scotland, especially those in the priority industries, to do business in or with Scotland, and</p>
<p>encouraging talented individuals with skills needed by Scotland&rsquo;s priority industries to pursue their careers here.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>Note 1: Scottish Enterprise has identified six industries that have the potential to grow faster than the Scottish average. These are financial services; electronic markets; energy; life sciences; tourism, and food and drink. Scottish Enterprise has also identified priority industries that have the potential to create disproportionate growth in specific regions of Scotland. These are textiles; aerospace; shipbuilding and marine; chemicals; construction, and forest industries. Highlands and Islands Enterprise has also identified six priority industries. These are tourism; food and primary products; health sciences; renewables; manufacturing and engineering, and creative industries.</p>

In addition, we will take full advantage of the new opportunities available under the Territorial Cooperation Objective to develop links and work jointly with our Irish, Nordic and other partners. The Executive will also ensure appropriate systems are in place to ensure the efficient delivery of projects consistent with, and contributing to, programme goals in line with EU audit requirements and to relieve further the burden of applying and managing projects to stakeholders.</p>

  <p>It is equally important that we close the 2000-06 programmes successfully, on time and without audit qualification.</p>

  <p>I have made clear that we will reverse the previous decisions on accident and emergency services at Monklands and Ayr hospitals. In considering proposals for significant service change that come to me for a final decision in the future, I will consider each case on its merits but will operate a presumption against centralisation of services. This does not mean that there will be no changes to health services in the future but that any NHS board that submits proposals for service reconfiguration must persuade me that their case is robust, that all possible alternatives have been considered, and that due weight has been given to both patient need and public opinion.</p>

  <p>Exercise-on-prescription is one way to encourage patients to increase their level of activity by attending leisure centres or gyms for supervised exercise programmes. Decisions about the most appropriate treatment or care are taken jointly by the patient and the relevant health care professional. So, if a patient does not wish to participate in an exercise programme this can be addressed as part of these informed discussions. A national working group has been set up by the Scottish Executive to develop guidance on the promotion of physical activity in primary care, including exercise-on-prescription.</p>

  <p>There are currently five local NHS 24 centres which were developed in partnership with local NHS boards in Highland, Ayrshire and Arran, Lanarkshire, Tayside and Dumfries and Galloway and which have been in operation since November 2005. The centres are co-located with local NHS board facilities and in the case of the Highland local centre, within Scottish Ambulance Service premises. The local centres operate at peak times during the out-of-hours period when call demand is at its highest, during the evening, weekends and public holidays when GP surgeries are closed.</p>

  <p>As part of NHS 24&rsquo;s three year strategy (2006-09), work is underway to develop further local centres throughout Scotland in partnership with other local NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The introduction of local NHS 24 centres has increased the capacity for nurse recruitment to be carried out in new areas. This has been done in partnership with the area NHS boards, increasing the number of nurses available to the whole service; improving local knowledge and understanding of both services and geography and therefore enhancing patient care. It has also supported the principle of increasing choice, flexibility and opportunity for highly experienced nurses who may wish to retain two posts in the NHS &ndash; one with NHS 24 and one in a local face-to-face setting - to increase and maintain their skills.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been working with Irvine Bay Urban Regeneration Company (URC) and local partners, including North Ayrshire Council, Communities Scotland and Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire, to assist in the development of comprehensive regeneration proposals for the Irvine Bay area of North Ayrshire, which covers the town of Ardrossan. Irvine Bay URC will be submitting a finalised business plan to the Executive in June 2007 for consideration. Decisions on any future investment by the Executive will be taken in that context.</p>

  <p>One of our central priorities is to support Scotland&rsquo;s economic growth. We have already made clear that one of the ways in which we will do so is by removing or reducing the burden of business rates for small businesses, many of which are located in traditional town centres across Scotland. We will announce further measures in due course.</p>

  <p>We have made clear our commitment to introduce a presumption against the closure of rural schools and shall be considering further the detailed implications of taking that forward. We shall also take this into account in our consideration of decisions on any rural school closure proposals which may require ministerial consent.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises that images of smokers featured in films, TV and magazines may influence young people to smoke. In developing our longer term national smoking prevention strategy, therefore, we will work with the UK Government and other devolved governments to explore ways to reduce positive and increase negative images of smoking in the media. It does not seem unreasonable for issues relating to film classification to form part of these considerations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s priorities for transport are:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>full utilisation of our transport infrastructure and our investment in it;</p>
<p>delivering the right infrastructure for business success, and</p>
<p>a focus on the needs of Scottish commuters, working to make journeys greener, safer and easier.</p>

  <p>As a first step, we have already announced that we will remove tolls from the Forth and Tay Bridges.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-05-31.S3W-91.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80347" speakername="Mr Jim Mather" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0531.htm#25">

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s key objective for Scottish tourism is to support sustainable growth of the contribution that tourism makes to economic growth right across Scotland, thus achieving the widely shared ambition to grow tourism revenues by 50% over the decade to 2015. This sustainable growth will be achieved by tourism businesses delivering continuous improvement to the excellent and varied products and services which they already offer, and marketing them effectively to their guests. The Year of Homecoming in 2009 will also play an important part in stimulating growth, as will major events such as the Ryder Cup in 2014.</p>

  <p>We want to support tourism businesses which share that ambition to grow tourism revenues. They will be supported by VisitScotland and the enterprise agencies working very closely together to attract more visitors to come to Scotland through world class marketing and innovative product development, and to encourage them to come back by ensuring that they are delighted by the warmth of the welcome they receive. That is why tourism has been incorporated into my Energy, Enterprise and Tourism portfolio, demonstrating our recognition that tourism is a major growth area in Scotland&rsquo;s economy.</p>
