  <p>The breast screening early recall rate has reduced from 1.2% in 1993 to 0.2% in 2001. This has been achieved by investments in improved technology and in the expertise of screening staff. Image Guided Biopsy, for example, has allowed staff to make definitive diagnosis in a larger number of cases, reducing the number of women required to be placed on early recall. Scotland&#146;s recall rate is substantially better than the target rate of less than 1%.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for development and management of the curriculum, including timing of delivery, rests with education authorities. To assist with this, 5-14 National Guidelines are available which offer a framework setting out attainment targets throughout primary and secondary school.</p>

  <p>The framework for drug education is contained within the Health Education 5-14 National Guidelines. The suggested attainment targets, appropriate to drug awareness, begin in early primary school with simple ways of keeping safe, e.g. safe use of medicines, and build through primary and secondary school to looking at harmful substances, their effects on the body and strategies to help decision making on healthy choices surrounding substance misuse. At all points education authorities and schools consider the age, understanding and maturity of the pupils.</p>

  <p>Research, carried out by the Training and Employment Research Unit at Glasgow University, has identified an emerging skills gap in construction.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Welfare to Work Task Force has established a group to develop a New Deal construction sector pathway in Scotland. Working with the industry this group is focusing on disadvantaged groups and long-term unemployed, and is working to develop short, modular courses which could lead to a full Modern Apprenticeship. The Executive will also work through Future Skills Scotland and Careers Scotland to promote employment and training opportunities in construction.</p>

  <p>The Glasgow Construction Forum was launched on 1 May by Glasgow City Council. The forum will be working with Scottish construction firms primarily on skills issues arising from the housing stock transfer.</p>

  <p>The Housing and Employment Working Group has examined key issues affecting the industry by involving individuals from the construction sector, employment initiatives, the voluntary sector, public sector and trade unions.</p>

  <p>Vocational education programmes are already available through further education colleges and Local Enterprise Companies. Additionally, the recently established Careers Scotland provides a one-stop shop for careers advice and guidance to all ages. Careers Scotland is aligned within the two Enterprise Networks alongside Future Skills Scotland and is therefore well placed to understand employment issues at both national and local level. However, our approach to this area will be considered again in the context of the Education and Lifelong Learning Committee&#146;s forthcoming report on lifelong learning.</p>

  <p>On 25 April 2001, Wendy Alexander announced in the Parliament that the Scottish Executive was setting aside up to &#163;10 million to help fund the Motorola Task Force&#146;s action plan. On 20 December 2001, Wendy Alexander further announced that the Scottish Executive would provide &#163;6 million (from the &#163;10 million which had been set aside) to the West Lothian Strategic Action Plan, a three-year programme for the economic development of the area.</p>

  <p>Expenditure reports from Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothians (SEEL) for the financial year 2001-02 show costs of &#163;3.3 million. SEEL&#146;s projected costs for the financial year 2002-03 are &#163;150,000. The total costs from both the financial years amount to &#163;3.45 million.</p>

  <p>For 2001-02: Business Start-up training costs were &#163;119,800; employee wages were &#163;728,174; expenses were just under &#163;5,000; advertising costs were &#163;27,455, and training costs just over &#163;2 million.</p>

  <p>There has been no subsidised employment. The task force has directly assisted 1,646 people through a variety of training initiatives in the period up to 28 February 2002. All training programmes and strategies formulated as part of the Motorola Action Plan gave consideration to individuals&#146; benefit entitlement.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has estimated the costs to it and local government of adjournments of a criminal trial on the date of the trial, including the costs associated with the abstraction from their duties of social workers, fire officers, NHS employees, police officers and civilians.</p>

  <p>We have not attempted to quantify the costs in this manner, as appropriate data is not centrally available. However, we are aware of the disruption and inconvenience caused by adjournments to criminal trials and are keen to see them reduced. We did in fact commission research into the causes of adjournments in sheriff court summary criminal cases in 1999 and the research report was published on 19 July 2001. A summary of the main findings of the research can be found on the Scottish Executive website and the full report on the Scottish Executive Central Research Unit website.</p>

  <p>The reviews being carried out by Lord Bonomy and Sheriff Principal McInnes, of the High Court and summary justice respectively, are focusing on how the criminal justice process might be made more efficient and effective. Both reviews will be making recommendations to reduce the frequency of unnecessary adjournments.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-17791 by Mr Jim Wallace on 21 September 2001, whether the elements of restorative justice which appear in various current initiatives include restorative cautioning and, if not, whether it is being considered as a future initiative.</p>

  <p>Cautioning is not used as an alternative to prosecution in Scotland. However, a number of mediation and reparation schemes are operating locally as part of the Executive funded national roll out of diversion from prosecution schemes.</p>

  <p>&#163;2 million has been made available to expand mediation and reparation schemes for under 16s across Scotland as part of the Scottish Executive&#146;s <i>Action Plan on Youth Crime</i>.</p>

  <p>The report by SNH, as the reporting body under section 3 of the National Parks (Scotland) Act 2000, was submitted to Scottish ministers on 21 August, 2001. We have considered this report very carefully.</p>

  <p>We are satisfied that the Cairngorms area meets the criteria for designation as a National Park. We are, therefore, publishing today a draft Designation Order for consultation, as required under section 6 of the National Parks (Scotland) Act. This consultation document will be widely distributed and copies have been made available to the Parliament's Reference Centre. The Executive's consultation closes on 22 August 2002, after which the draft Order will be amended as required in light of comments received, before being submitted to the Scottish Parliament for approval in the autumn.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is taking action to progress two of the top priority trunk road projects contained within NESTRANS&#146; transport strategy, the Modern Transport System (MTS).</p>

  <p>1. A multi-modal STAG assessment of the Balmedie to Tipperty stretch of the A90 north of Aberdeen is to be undertaken. This will explore the impact of city and inter-urban park and ride sites in order to assess the case for the propsed scheme. The report is due before the end of 2002.</p>

  <p>2. In partnership with NESTRANS a feasibility study on the provision of stacking lanes on the A90 Scotstown Road to Ellon Road will be undertaken. As well as having safety benefits through assisting vehicles with right turns, the proposal will assist in mitigating the congestion that may arise from the closure of Grandholm Bridge in July.</p>

It currently handles in the region of 5,000 calls per week and a series of improvements to the service are planned over the next 10 months to give more pertinent and accurate information to travellers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Compact commits the Scottish Executive to ensuring that, in the process of policy-making, the impact of changes in policy and procedure on voluntary organisations, volunteering and community groups is considered and taken fully into account. This commitment is supported by a <i>Good Practice Guide</i> , published in June 2000. Implementation of the compact is monitored jointly with the voluntary sector on an annual basis.</p>

  <p>The Media Strategy Action Group last met on 10 May 2002, when it discussed how to take forward publicity campaigns for the Active Communities Initiative, the themes and messages for these campaigns and how to extend the capacity for volunteering through publicity.</p>

  <p>In addition to the work of the group, the Scottish Executive is promoting the Active Communities Initiative through the publication of a newsletter. The next edition is due to be published in early June, to coincide with Volunteers Week 2002. The newsletter, which like Volunteers Week will focus on volunteering in the arts, will be sent to public, private and voluntary agencies across Scotland. Around 16,000 copies of the newsletter will be distributed.</p>
