  <p>The Scottish Government is aware that release of non-native red legged partridge was implicated in damage to a SSSI (Craig Leek) near Braemar. The birds were released at a location adjacent to but not within the SSSI and started to roost in concentrated numbers on rock ledges within the SSSI leading to nutrient enrichment of the ledges through the accumulation of droppings.</p>

  <p>In the wider environment, the inappropriate siting of game bird release pens may have localised impacts on habitats (such as damage to ground flora) within the release pens or in areas adjacent to the pens. Some researchers have expressed concern about the risks of transfer of parasites and diseases from concentrations of non-native game birds to wild bird populations and over the impact large numbers of non-native game birds may have on the availability of food for native birds, although we are not aware that these concerns have been substantiated evidentially.</p>

Scottish Government seeks feedback on the experiences of advice line users from the Project&rsquo;s National Advisory Group on which kinship carers are represented. In addition, an independent evaluation in 2009 by MORI of the service found that 94% of clients would recommend it to others.</p>

  <p>I have asked Willie Pretswell, Interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>It is possible for prisoners to attempt to circumvent procedures put in place to prevent unwanted letters being sent out to victims. The SPS take their public protection responsibilities very seriously and will take whatever legal steps are available to uphold these responsibilities. The Prisons and Young Offenders Institutions (Scotland) Rules 2006 enable governors to intercept and open mail from and to prisoners where it is suspected, or reported to the establishment, that a prisoner is seeking to send mail to someone who has requested this not to happen.</p>

  <p>NHS boards in Tayside, Grampian, Ayrshire and Arran, and Western Isles are currently connected to eCare, for the sharing of information with their partner agencies. These agencies are at different stages of implementation of its usage with front line staff.</p>

  <p>Five other health board areas are moving towards connection to eCare: NHS boards in Fife, Highland, Forth Valley, Borders, and Dumfries and Galloway.</p>

  <p>NHS Lanarkshire already take part in multi-agency information sharing, using locally developed eCare technology solutions, which will interact with the national eCare, in the future.</p>

  <p>NHS Greater and Glasgow and Clyde are involved in pilot proof of concept work for eCare.</p>

  <p>NHS Lothian are considering their options following the award of the national Patient Management System (PMS) contract, to Intersystems TRAK, which is a system which NHS Lothian already use. The PMS contract includes connection to eCare as a core component.</p>

  <p>NHS Shetland have plans in place to procure a community health system, which will be able to connect to eCare.</p>

  <p>NHS Orkney have a joint-working solution with their council partner, and are currently evaluating the need to connect this to the national eCare system, based on local business requirements.</p>

  <p>There have been some delays in health engaging with eCare, for two main reasons: lack of community-based health systems to support the electronic recording of Single Shared Assessments, and a perceived divergence of eCare&rsquo;s functionality from local business needs.</p>

  <p>The emergence of systems like NHS Tayside&rsquo;s MiDIS have served to address the first point, and work is currently underway across the eCare Programme to address the second.</p>
