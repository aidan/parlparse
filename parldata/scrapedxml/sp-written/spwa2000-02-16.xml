  <p>The precise amounts of agrimonetary compensation available to UK milk producers as well as other agricultural sectors have yet to be determined. These will not be known until the European Commission publishes a regulation later this month. Payments must be made on a UK wide basis. I am therefore liaising liaison closely with other UK Agricultural Ministers and there is a clear understanding of the issues involved. I will inform the Parliament of the decision on payment at the appropriate time.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has received copies of the report, published on 15 February. Copies have been placed in SPICe. Copies of the report or of the Executive Summary, as appropriate, are being sent by the Scottish Executive to relevant statutory agencies including local authorities, the police and health bodies, and to other interested organisations including providers of residential care.</p>

  <p>The report examines evidence in respect of the behaviour of many individuals. This will be drawn to the attention of those to whom the report is circulated. The Scottish Executive will also be examining recommendations on policy and practice, taking into account action already being taken in response to Roger Kent's report on <i>Children's Safeguards</i>. In doing so, Scottish Ministers will liaise with the Government and with the Welsh Assembly and will set out conclusions after this. The Tribunal's report requires serious and considered attention.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is actively engaged in the application of the ISI in Scotland. Officials are in regular dialogue with the ISI team at the Department of Trade and Industry, and work to ensure that Scottish policy on related matters, such as the promotion of e-commerce, takes account of UK initiatives.</p>

  <p>The ISI is a UK-wide initiative, and consequently there have been no ISI programmes launched solely in Scotland.</p>

  <p>ISI Centres in Scotland have received almost &pound;1.5 million in UK Government grant-aid. Total grant expenditure on the ISI Centre programme across the UK is about &pound;10 million.</p>

  <p>The ISI is a UK-wide initiative and statistics are not generally available on a territorial basis for individual ISI programmes. The ISI Centre programme is an exception, and the figures for the Scottish ISI Centres are as follows:</p>

  <p>May 1998 &#8211; December 1999</p>

  <p>(a) 14,620 client throughput (organisations)</p>

  <p>(b) 6,330 businesses assisted</p>

  <p>(c) 634 seminars/events delivered</p>

  <p>These figures represent activity levels of ISI Centres covering the Local Enterprise Company areas of Ayrshire, Borders, Dunbarton, Fife, Forth Valley, Glasgow, Grampian, Lanarkshire, Renfrewshire and Tayside, as well as the Highlands and Islands, and Edinburgh. The ISI Centres covering Dumfries and Galloway and West Lothian were only opened in January 2000 and therefore are not included in the figures.</p>

  <p>I announced last November that we are considering evidence from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency indicating elevated levels of nitrate in several water courses including the Eye Water and Eden Water in the Scottish Borders. Assessment of that evidence is not yet complete. Any proposals for Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) will be the subject of public consultation.</p>

  <p>It is premature to provide details of any package of measures that might be available to assist farmers. However, the Scottish Executive provides funding through grant-in-aid to the Scottish Agricultural College for the production of some farm nutrient budget plans with the aim of promoting more efficient use of nitrate and reduction of leaching.</p>

  <p>The eligibility of organisations to apply directly for European Structural Funds supports depends on a number of factors, including legal status, the terms of any memorandum and articles of association, the activities which the organisation normally engages in and the nature of the project itself. Potential applicants therefore have to be considered on an individual basis, and they should approach the Scottish Executive Development Department for more definitive guidance.</p>

  <p>The main source of European funding for skills training in local areas will be the Objective 3 Programme. In line with the terms of the EU Regulation, any additional assistance from the European Social Fund which could be contained within any Objective 2 Programme should be of sufficient size to justify its separate management and not amount to less than 5% of the total Structural Fund contribution. It is too early to detail exactly the level of funds which may be directed for the purpose since the plans for the Objective 2 area in West, East and South Scotland are still in preparation. I expect the Plan Teams to publish consultation drafts in the next few weeks.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to do so. Decisions regarding the content of individual courses are a matter for individual further education colleges, subject to the requirements of courses leading to particular qualifications.</p>

  <p>Full-time GSVQ and Higher National courses in Food Production and Professional Cookery include nutrition and menu planning. This is not a compulsory element of shorter, work-based courses in catering. As part of the new Scottish Group Awards in Hospitality, nutrition and healthy eating are mandatory components at intermediate level 1 and 2 and Higher.</p>

  <p>In 1995, guidance about new drugs for multiple sclerosis and clinical advice from the Scottish Medical Advisory Committee was issued to all health boards.

  <p>In five of the 32 cases recorded above, the applicant&#8217;s solicitor informed the Board that the applicant could not afford the contribution assessed. Four of these five applicants were female. The Board received no communication in the remaining 27 cases.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is evaluating the effectiveness of the 20mph pilot projects implemented in a number of local authority areas throughout Scotland in 1998. The pilot projects are testing the effectiveness of 20mph schemes which do not include the use of relatively expensive engineering measures to force down the speed of traffic. The final results will be available in September and the final report will be published as soon as possible thereafter. It will be distributed to all local authorities in Scotland and other interested parties and copies will be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>I refer Ms Elder to the reply I gave her to question S1W-3820.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have power to introduce 20mph speed limits on local roads in their areas. It is, therefore, for Glasgow City Council to consider the introduction of a 20mph speed limit in the Gorbals.</p>

  <p>Not at present. The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body is the formal client responsible for the project. We have issued three reports to MSPs and a fourth is in preparation and will be available at the end of the month. I am considering how best MSPs might question and comment on that report.</p>

  <p>I refer Ms MacDonald to my answer of 10 December 1999 to her question S1W-3026. The SPCB will shortly report to MSPs as appropriate about progress on the Holyrood Project including aspects of Queensberry House.</p>

  <p>There has been a continuing dialogue between the Design Team and the Royal Fine Art Commission for Scotland, and one meeting with the SPCB, about the plans from initial concept through to detailed design. Further meetings will be held as required.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer when the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body expects the Holyrood Project to be in a state of readiness for business and when it expects the Project to be finally completed.</p>

  <p>We are awaiting the outcome of the Design Team&#8217;s feasibility work on our requirements for additional space. It would be inappropriate to speculate on expected completion dates until the result of this work is known. The SPCB&#8217;s Report to MSPs of 1 December 1999 stated the Body&#8217;s intention to report again to MSPs at an appropriate stage, and this will be done at the end of the month.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer by how many weeks the making of concrete moulds and pouring of concrete foundations in the Holyrood Project are behind schedule.</p>

  <p>The work package, which includes the fabrication of concrete moulds and pouring of concrete foundations, is 12 weeks in delay. This is primarily to prevent nugatory expenditure while the feasibility of meeting the Parliament&#8217;s extra accommodation requirements is being investigated. <br /></p>
