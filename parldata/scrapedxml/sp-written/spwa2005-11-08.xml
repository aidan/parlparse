  <p>At the time of its creation in November 2001, Communities Scotland was set a series of strategic objectives relating to: the delivery of the national housing investment programme; supporting community regeneration; regulating and inspecting social landlords, and supporting local authorities and others to develop effective planning systems.</p>

  <p>These high-level objectives have been underpinned by specific annual targets set for the agency by ministers. Since 2001, particular achievements of the agency include:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>Funding the construction of around 20,000 affordable homes across Scotland to support regeneration and tackling under-supply issues;<br />
              Delivering almost &pound;1 billion of housing investment, which attracted more than &pound;500 million of private sector funding;<br />
              Funding the installation of around 40,000 central heating systems and funding the insulation of over 50,000 homes;<br />
              Developing the Scottish Housing Quality Standard as it applies to 650,000 houses in the social housing sector, and working with social landlords to help them deliver the Standard by the 2015 target date;<br />
              Helping to deliver the transfer of over 100,000 former local authority houses into community ownership, which will lead to over &pound;2 billion of additional housing investment;<br />
              Funding local authorities to tackle disrepair in the private sector housing stock;<br />
              Integrating the Social Inclusion Partnerships Funding and Better Neighbourhood Services Fund into a single Community Regeneration Fund primarily focussed on Scotland&rsquo;s 15% most deprived communities;<br />
              Assisting local authorities to develop Regeneration Outcome Agreements which provide the strategy and framework for community regeneration;<br />
              Developing and implementing new mechanisms to help with the long-term development of Scotland&rsquo;s social economy sector;<br />
              Supporting local adult literacy and numeracy partnerships to help over 100,000 individuals access adult literacy learning;<br />
              Developing and promoting new ways to ensure full and meaningful community engagement;<br />
              Using its regulatory powers to improve the quality of housing and homelessness services delivered by local authorities and registered social landlords to tenants and others, and ensuring that the RSL sector is well governed and financially viable, and<br />
              Improving the quality of the strategic housing planning process through the on-going development of local housing strategies.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>I am delighted with the contribution that Communities Scotland has made and continues to make. However, ministers fully recognise that addressing long-standing issues of housing quality and housing supply, as well as tackling the problems of communities suffering from multiple deprivation, will require a sustained effort from all of the agencies involved, Communities Scotland included.</p>

  <p>The corporate plan for Communities Scotland for 2005 to 2008 that was published in April this year sets out the targets and policy objectives that I have set for the agency for the short, medium and longer terms.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s International Strategy, published in 2004, sets out strategic goals for the Executive&rsquo;s international activities. Our cultural agencies are all aware of this strategy and work hard to promote Scotland&rsquo;s culture abroad. The UNESCO Convention on the Protection of the Diversity of Cultural Contents and Artistic Expressions has no direct bearing on these activities.</p>

  <p>The Convention&rsquo;s focus is on encouraging developed countries to assist poorer, less developed nations to develop their means of cultural expression. It is also potentially a means for all nations to protect cultures within their own borders, especially minority cultures.</p>

  <p>The Convention has not yet entered into force.</p>

  <p>The statutory Debt Arrangement Scheme came into force on 30 November 2004. There have been 74 debt payment programmes approved, all in 2005. The scheme does not require a court application, and numbers are not therefore available by sheriff court district.</p>

  <p>The Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Act 2001 never came into force as it was repealed by the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Act 2002, which came into force on 30 December 2002.</p>

  <p>The Accountant in Bankruptcy (AiB) maintains the Register of Insolvencies in Scotland. Details of the numbers of bankruptcies awarded by Sheriffdoms by financial year are compiled by AiB and included in the annual report.</p>

  <p>The table below gives the number of bankruptcies for the financial years 2003-04 and 2004-05, and for the financial year 2005-06 up to 31 October 2005.</p>

  <p>Further information on bankruptcies is available in the Accountant in Bankruptcy&rsquo;s Annual Report which is available at <a href="http://www.aib.gov.uk/" target="_blank">www.aib.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what funds its Health Department has allocated to NHS boards to cover the costs incurred by primary care services in adjusting their premises and practices in order to comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, in particular (a) how much and (b) what percentage of this funding has been allocated to providers of primary care and over what period of time.</p>

  <p>There have been no general allocations in respect of the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (the DDA) and compliance in Primary Care.</p>

  <p>There have been three specific DDA related allocations. The first was &pound;1.5 million from the Primary and Community Care Premises Modernisation Programme for 2004-06 &pound;1.5 million to promote good practice by Primary Care Contractors in the promotion and fulfilment of the requirements of the DDA. The second was a series of programmes over the period 2001-06 to a total value of &pound;2 million to support premises improvements in community pharmacy including improving DDA access. The third was for Dental Practice Improvement Funding which enables independent general dental practitioner&rsquo;s to upgrade their practices, particularly including addressing the DDA. Over the past four financial years we have made available over &pound;13 million for dental practice improvement. In the current financial year (2005-06) a further &pound;5 million has been made available to NHS boards to support local initiatives and dental practice improvements within general dental services, including decontamination.</p>

  <p>In addition, there has been a significant on-going programme of investment in a range of new and improved premises including better access for patients through the Primary and Community Care Premises Modernisation Programme (PCCPMP) and locally by NHS boards through investment in GP premises and through local capital programmes.</p>

  <p>&pound;52 million was invested under the PCCPMP between 1999 and 2004 and a further &pound;24 million is being invested over the period 2004-06. Full details of locally funded investment programmes are not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Angus Council receives additional support of &pound;0.79 million in 2005-06 as a result of a redistribution of the Primary School Teaching Staff Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) allocation which is based on the 9.0% of Angus pupils who are educated in small schools i.e. where the pupil roll is 70 or less. In 2006-07 and 2007-08, this redistribution reallocates &pound;0.783 million and &pound;0.809 respectively, based on a percentage of 8.2%. Any current or future changes to this percentage will not now be made until the next spending review, currently scheduled for 2007.</p>

  <p>These GAE allocations are neither budgets or spending targets. They are a component of the more complex local government funding formula which is used to calculate a single revenue grant figure for each council. It is then a matter for each individual council to decide how best to deploy these resources based on local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>The Executive provides funding for flood protection only to local authorities, as they are best placed to assess the local need. Funding is in the form of specific capital grants for confirmed flood prevention schemes and revenue support for other operations to protect non-agricultural land. However, local authorities can contribute towards the costs of anyone carrying out flood prevention measures, that the local authority is empowered to do, under the Flood Prevention (Scotland) Act 1961. Such contributions are entirely a matter for the local authority concerned.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. Scottish people may be given emergency treatment, or within the European Economic Area any necessary treatment, abroad under the reciprocal health care agreements which the United Kingdom has with other countries, or individuals may be referred for treatment in other European Economic Area countries under arrangements known as the E112 system. The Executive has no plans to arrange for NHS patients to be sent abroad for treatment in any other circumstances.</p>

  <p>Reciprocal care treatments are managed and paid for in the country where they take place, in return for the UK giving nationals of that country emergency or necessary treatment free of charge, and the Executive has no information on the medical establishments involved. E112 referrals are made by NHS boards or other UK health authorities on a case-by-case basis, usually for some form of treatment which is not available in the UK, and are approved by the English Department of Health, so again the Executive does not hold records.</p>

  <p>The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service (SNBTS) has confirmed that blood plasma products manufactured by them during 1980-88 were not derived from imported plasma.</p>

  <p>However, demand for blood plasma based products, mainly Factor VIII for the treatment of haemophilia A patients, exceeded available supplies from SNBTS and some products were imported during the period. Responsibility for the purchase of imported products lay with local health boards and, consequently, the Executive does not hold this information centrally.</p>

  <p>Blood plasma products are &quot;Prescription Only Medicines&quot;. Authorisation for marketing/distribution of imported blood plasma products within the UK was (and remains) the responsibility of the Medicines Control Agency (now MHRA). Further information on imported plasma products authorised for use in UK during this period may be obtained from Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency.</p>

  <p>Information is not held centrally in the form requested. An estimate derived from information collected under NHS National Services&rsquo; Information and Statistics Division&rsquo;s Practice Team Information system suggests that over the whole of Scotland in the 12 months ended in December 2004 approximately 116,750 people with allergies were seen by GPs, practice nurses, community nurses and health visitors. These figures are based on the activity of 46 Scottish general practices with a combined patient population of 289,020.

  <p>In September 2000, the Scottish Medical and Scientific Advisory Committee (SMASAC) produced a detailed and comprehensive report on immunology and allergy services in Scotland. The report set out the provision at that time of services in Scotland for the diagnosis and management of patients with immunological and allergic disorders, identified current deficiencies in service provision and made a number of recommendations for their improvement. The report was widely distributed to NHS boards and individual clinicians with an interest in allergy and immunology, with a view to informing future decisions on services in these fields.

  <p>The Patient Claims Team of NHSScotland Counter Fraud Services (CFS) undertake a national programme of checks of patient entitlement to exemption from NHS charges. Penalty charges may be imposed by the CFS where patients are found to have evaded NHS charges. Patients are given the opportunity to produce evidence of exemption from NHS charges to the CFS before a penalty charge is imposed. Where patients who are not exempt realise, after initial contact by the CFS, that they have made a mistake and pay back the charge, the CFS will not impose a penalty charge. If payment is difficult, the CFS will accept staged payments. The CFS will also provide information on how to apply under the NHS Low Income Scheme for full or partial help with NHS charges.</p>

  <p>The aim of penalty charges, and all of the work of NHSScotland Counter Fraud Services (CFS), is deterrence - to make people who should pay for their NHS prescriptions, dental treatment or other services but try not to do so think twice about evading charges in future.</p>

  <p>The CFS adopt a common sense approach. Penalty charges are only imposed when patients have not provided proof of exemption to the CFS or have confirmed that they have made a mistake but not paid back the charge evaded. Where a penalty charge notice has been issued and there is subsequent contact which indicates that there are personal circumstances which should be taken into account, the charge will not be pursued. Each case is judged on its merits. The CFS will also provide information on how to apply under the NHS Low Income Scheme for full or partial help with NHS charges and undertake publicity campaigns to clarify and raise public awareness of the categories of people who are entitled to Family health services free of charge.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action is being taken to train cognitive behavioural therapists.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-11-08.36.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80064" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa1108.htm#20">

  <p>Since 2003 the Scottish Executive has provided additional funding, through NHS Education for Scotland (NES), to support the expansion of pre-registration training capacity for psychological care. This has particularly been aimed at Masters level training, and has focussed primarily on cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and NES recognise that there is a wide psychological skills base available from graduates that could deliver primary care support to adult patients not requiring specialist treatment. Scotland has pioneered modernisation of the training pathways to meet changing health service needs, establishing flexible paths for multi-professional training in CBT for graduate psychology students, nurses and occupational therapists. This modernisation programme is unique to Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition to a Masters level course in CBT in Glasgow, NES has developed, together with Stirling and Dundee Universities, a 1 year MSc in Psychological Therapy. This equips graduates of the Masters with the competencies to deliver interventions for common mental health problems presenting in adults in primary care using cognitive-behavioural therapy. This means that patients and the service benefit early from increased investment in training: for example, 26 new graduates will enter the workforce in January 2006.</p>

  <p>NES are addressing further gaps in psychological care provision by developing a parallel training development designed to address the need for early interventions in psychology services for children and young people with a view to a first intake by January 2007.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive also sponsors the &quot;Doing Well by People with Depression&quot; Programme. The programme builds capacity in the use of cognitive behavioural therapy in the treatment of people affected by depression. The programme is working in partnership with 10 NHS boards on delivering CBT to appropriate patients and has undertaken staff training in CBT on a pilot basis, in each area to enable this service to be delivered. In addition the programme is developing web-based training packages for practitioners.</p>

  <p>2. Immunisation information is sourced from the Standard Immunisation Recall System (SIRS) and from the Grampian Immunisation.</p>

  <p>3. Children who have received at least one dose of any childhood primary vaccination.</p>

  <p>4. Men C was introduced into the childhood vaccination programme in the autumn of 1999 and therefore is only included in the analysis from 2000 onwards.</p>

  <p>5. Hib was introduced into the childhood vaccination programme in 1992 and therefore is excluded from the analysis prior to this date.</p>

  <p>6. Information shown includes children born from 1991 to 2002 i.e. up to the age of 13 years. Figures include children moving in/out of Scotland.</p>

  <p>7. Information is based on children resident in Scotland as at 31 December 2004 and vaccination history at that time.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Volunteering Strategy sets out our way forward to embed a robust culture of volunteering across Scotland, including volunteering by disabled people. This includes the provision of resources for Volunteer Development Scotland and the network of volunteer centres to provide advice and support to all volunteers and volunteer-involving organisations. Volunteer Development Scotland has recently undertaken and published a report on <em>Volunteering and Disability: Experiences and perceptions of volunteering from disabled people and organisations</em> , which will help raise awareness of this issue and provide a platform to address barriers.</p>

  <p>I understand that SNIFFER&rsquo;s UK research programme prioritisation meeting on 27 September placed the project on &quot;Environmental impact of using sewage sludge on forestry and for restoration of derelict land&quot; as first priority for the 2006-07 programme. The provisional programme must, however, be discussed by the Corporate Management Team of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the main board of the Environment and Heritage Service for Northern Ireland before being finalised in early 2006.</p>

  <p>The views of its corporate management team, and the status of its research proposals, are a matter for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>

  <p>Prior to his replacement by the Water Industry Commission on 1 July 2005, the commissioner&rsquo;s performance in regulating Scottish Water led to Scottish Water delivering operational savings of around &pound;2 million per week, easing the burden of charges to customers.

  <p>No. My officials have been in touch with the former commissioner and I understand that there was a breakdown in communication at his office with the series of correspondence to which you refer. His office accepts full responsibility for the breakdown and he has written to you personally to apologise and to seek to address any outstanding issues.</p>
