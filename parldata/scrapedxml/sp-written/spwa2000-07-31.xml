  <p>Crime and the fear of crime reduce the quality of life for many older people although they are less likely to be victims. We have established partnerships led by local authorities and the police to tackle crime and community safety at local level and we encourage older people and their representatives to be part of that process.</p>

  <p>In May, the Deputy First Minister announced that he was providing Scotland&#8217;s police forces with an extra &pound;8.9 million to enable them to recruit more than 300 extra police officers. This and our ongoing commitment to the funding of CCTV and other community safety projects will contribute significantly to making our communities safer for everyone including older people.</p>

  <p>District courts are responsible for collecting and enforcing fixed penalties, including fiscal fines. To enforce these fines, the court may use all the methods of enforcement available for court imposed fines, except imprisonment. In practice, this means that the court can allow the defaulter to pay by instalments, deduct from income support, seek to recover the amount by civil diligence or remit the fine.</p>

  <p>Section 74(2) of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 ensures that council tax payers obtain value for their assets, affords a measure of protection to the authority against charges of discrimination between purchasers and precludes the award of hidden subsidies. Our usual policy has been to grant applications for dispensation under section 74(2) if the intending buyer or lessee is performing some kind of charitable or public service function and where it could reasonably be argued that the buyer could not afford the full market price. The criteria we usually consider for each case is:</p>

  <p>Summary of the proposal</p>

  <p>To whom the land/asset is to be leased/disposed</p>

  <p>Details of this organisation:</p>

  <p>- Aims and objectives</p>

  <p>- Board of Members</p>

  <p>- Involvement of local people/service users</p>

  <p>- Whether the organisation is funded by the council (if so, details)</p>

  <p>- Is it a charitable organisation (if so, Inland Revenue details)</p>

  <p>- Previous year&#8217;s accounts (if available)</p>

  <p>What the organisation intend to do with the land/asset</p>

  <p>Market Value of land/asset/lease</p>

  <p>Size of land to be disposed/leased</p>

  <p>Plan with area of land marked</p>

  <p>Length of lease and details of any conditions</p>

  <p>Justification of the proposal &#8211; how does it provide public benefit?</p>

  <p>Details of the current use of the asset/land</p>

  <p>Clarification of whether there is any alternative use for the land/asset</p>

  <p>Whether there is any community opposition or support for proposal</p>

  <p>If there is opposition what is the council&#8217;s view on this</p>

  <p>Where the disposal is to a local authority trust or company, the criteria we consider are:</p>

  <p>Capital value of assets to be transferred</p>

  <p>How the Trust/Company is configured &#8211; does it comply with the CoSLA and Accounts Commission Guidance, <i>Following the Public Pound</i>?</p>

  <p>Contractual basis between the council and the Trust/Company (especially where the Trust/Company is delivering council services/functions), particularly performance monitoring arrangements</p>

  <p>Benefits of Trust/Company arrangement</p>

  <p>If the Trust is to deliver a council service/function, how will the provision of the service, in terms of cost and quality, be improved</p>

  <p>Funding/Subsidy arrangements &#8211; is it intended to provide a deficit grant; if so, how much is the grant and what is the estimated annual expenditure of the Trust/Company?</p>

  <p>Section 94 implications of Trust &#8211; will the Trust borrow capital themselves or will the council act as guarantor and how will any major capital investment be funded?</p>

  <p>Where is the existing debt for Trust held?</p>

  <p>Details of Trustees</p>

  <p>Involvement of public/service users in the Trust/Company and the development of the proposal</p>

  <p>Similar criteria are used for disposal of Housing Revenue Account housing/land at less than best price. Such disposals are, in the main, for the provision of housing for affordable rent by registered social landlords or for low cost home ownership.</p>

  <p>This criteria is not set in stone and the main point considered is whether the public benefit being gained from the disposal outweighs the loss of a public asset.</p>

  <p>The Executive is taking active steps to ensure that advocacy services are independent and that users and carers are involved in all aspects of these services.</p>

  <p>The good practice guide on advocacy, <i>Advocacy: A Guide to Good Practice</i>, which was published in 1997 at the same time as the <i>Mental Health Framework</i>, makes it clear that all advocacy services commissioned by health service bodies and their planning partners, should be independent.</p>

  <p>Earlier this year when addressing Advocacy 2000&#8217;s conference, I announced that we would shortly be issuing further guidance to service commissioners aimed at ensuring that independent advocacy services are available to mental health users as well as everyone else who needs such support.</p>

  <p>Both of these guides also encourage the full participation of service users and carers in every stage of the development and management of advocacy services.</p>

  <p>Under Schedule 5 of the Scotland Act 1998, the provision and regulation of railway services, which includes railway safety, is a reserved matter. This reservation applies to appointments to and supervision of relevant bodies.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive of course attaches importance to transport safety, and is therefore in regular contact with the Department of the Environment, Transport and Regions, the Health and Safety Executive, Her Majesty&#8217;s Railways Inspectorate, the Rail Regulator, the British Transport Police and the railway industry on matters relating to rail safety in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The number of children in residential accommodation is almost 25% less than it was a decade ago. At the same time, provision of holiday or respite care has increased. Both trends are welcome.</p>

  <p>We are keen to ensure there is a community placement for every child who might benefit from one. Through the Children&#8217;s Services Development Fund, we have increased funding for community placements from &pound;2.2 million in 1999-2000 to &pound;4.7 million for the current year. We are also working with local authorities and the voluntary sector to increase recruitment of foster carers and will be commissioning research into local authority adoption practices.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether there will be a Scottish equivalent of Her Majesty's Government&#8217;s 10-year plan for transport, or whether the UK strategy will have a Scottish component; when it expects any such Scottish strategy to be published, and whether the railway aspects of any Scottish strategy, or Scottish component of a UK strategy, will be produced by Scottish Ministers or the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority.</p>

  <p>The contents and publication of the UK Government&#8217;s 10-year plan are matters for that Government. The plan will not cover devolved transport matters but would apply to Scotland insofar as it relates to reserved matters, including rail. Scottish Ministers have various functions in relation to railways in Scotland; these are exercised within the context of the GB regulatory framework. Before giving directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority on the Scottish rail franchise we will consult on the strategic priorities which will underpin those directions.</p>

  <p>On completion of the review of their spending, Scottish Ministers will announce their proposals for investment, including on transport.</p>

  <p>The information that you have requested is not available at this time. Audit Scotland is currently auditing the accounts of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body. It is proposed that Summarised Accounts will be published within the Corporate Body&#8217;s Annual Report, which is due for publication in September.</p>

  <p>Contracts for the &quot;soft landscaping&quot; at the Holyrood site will be let in accordance with current EC procurement directives which ensure free and open competition in all member states. It is hoped and expected that Scottish companies will participate in this competitive tendering process. <br /></p>
