  <p>The targets set out in the Board&#146;s annual Corporate Plan are the subject of monthly monitoring by the Board. Recently the Board has fallen seriously behind the targets on the payment of criminal legal aid accounts, and slightly behind in other areas. The Board has recently had a drive for improved quality in accounts assessment, and this, combined with staff turnover, has led to delays. The Board has put in place measures to tackle the backlog including additional staff and is now starting to recover the position. I am being kept fully informed of the developing situation.</p>

  <p>The basis for costing abolition of the tolls is stipulated in the contract for procuring the bridge. The Scottish Executive has no plans to initiate any negotiations about abolition with the concessionaire. Its policy is to freeze tolls at 1999 cash levels for the remainder of the contract. This will benefit all users of the bridge.</p>

  <p>I announced on 20 May 1999 the appointment of a Principal Special Adviser and a Spokesman with effect from 17 May. These are personal appointments, accountable to me, and were made under the authority of the April 1999 Civil Service Order in Council. In due course I will announce the appointment of further Special Advisers to provide specialist and political advice and assistance complementing that of the civil service.</p>

  <p>The UK Government published in March a consultation paper setting out proposals for improving local bus services. Comments were invited by 25 June. Our Transport Bill will propose changes</p>

  <p>in the way bus services are organised emphasising improvement in quality and the development of partnership.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Office and Locate in Scotland are making every effort to assist Volvo to find a buyer with a view to ensuring a continuing manufacturing presence on the Irvine site. The Scottish Executive is equally committed to securing a continuing future for the facility and the skilled workforce there. We are hopeful that these efforts to retain the maximum number of existing skilled jobs will prove successful, however it is premature to speculate on when any announcement of a buyer might be made.</p>

  <p>Warrant sales act as an ultimate sanction within a range of remedies available to the creditor for all types of debt. The system of warrant sales was reformed by the Debtors (Scotland) Act 1987. These reforms removed the most resented and harsh aspects of the procedure. The results of a study into the effectiveness of the working of the procedures introduced by the 1987 Act, including those for poinding and warrant sale, has just been published. The Executive will give consideration to the study reports and, in particular, will consider whether any further legislation is desirable. <br /> <br /></p>

  <p>It is appropriate that that there should be a Gaelic element in the opening ceremony. That is why the Inverness Gaelic choir have been asked to sing in the courtyard of the Assembly Hall to welcome MSPs and The Queen to the ceremony in the Chamber. <br /></p>
