  <p>The Scottish Executive currently has no specific plans to collate information on the number of employee owned businesses in Scotland.</p>

  <p>However, data were published in a Scottish Office Statistics Bulletin in November 1998 on the number of enterprises operating in Scotland in 1997 broken down by industry and employee sizeband. These data give a clear estimate of the number of enterprises run by self-employed people with no employees and those run by partnerships who don&#8217;t have any employees (199,555 in total). This data will be updated for 1998 at the end of this year by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Student Awards Agency for Scotland is currently processing the vast majority of properly completed applications within its target of 28 days from the date of receipt and is passing the necessary information on loans to the Student Loans Company Limited. Neither the Agency nor the Company is aware of any particular problem relating to students attending the Galashiels Heriot-Watt campus, although some recently received applications will still be in the course of being dealt with.</p>

  <p>If there are individual cases of particular difficulty, the Chief Executive of the Agency will be happy to make enquiries on receipt of the relevant details.</p>

  <p>Students who are experiencing financial difficulty because their loan cheque is not available can seek temporary help from the University&#8217;s Access Funds.</p>

  <p>I have considered the 3 submissions carefully. Although I appreciate the information provided by each Council, I am still not persuaded that the level of spending above guideline by the 3 councils is justified. It has already been announced that no council will be capped this year; any future capping decisions will be taken following consideration of all the relevant factors which obtain at that time. However I have today indicated to Aberdeenshire and Perth and Kinross Councils that I will expect them to return to their expenditure guideline within the next year. I have indicated to East Dunbartonshire Council that I will expect them to return to their guideline within at the latest the next 2 years.</p>

  <p>Our <i>Partnership for Scotland</i> statement aims for steady improvements in water quality, targeting all Scotland&#8217;s beaches to meet clean water standards by 2005.</p>

  <p>On environmental water, we are considering, with Scottish Environment Protection Agency, measures to tackle agricultural and industrial pollution. Over the next 3 years the Scottish water authorities will oversee investment in water and sewerage infrastructure of around &pound;1.7bn. A substantial part of this will be aimed at waste water treatment, in particular to comply with the EU Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive.</p>

  <p>The new EU Drinking Water Directive sets tight standards for drinking water the majority of which are required to be met by December 2003. Under certain circumstances the Directive allows for the derogation of standards for up to 3 years. The Scottish Executive will obtain legally binding undertakings from the Scottish water authorities to ensure that they meet the new standards by the required dates. <br /></p>
