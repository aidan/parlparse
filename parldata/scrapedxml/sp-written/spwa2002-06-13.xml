  <p>In light of the responses received to the recent consultation exercise on changes to improve the operation of existing agri-environment schemes in the short-term, the Executive is considering early reforms to these schemes. As indicated in the consultation paper, we will be consulting also on longer term options, including what to do when current Environmentally Sensitive Area Scheme agreements come to an end.</p>

  <p>The police already have powers to deal with the playing of loud music, including the power to confiscate sound equipment for up to 28 days if a person fails to stop the noise on being asked to do so by a police officer. We have a range of other measures in place to address the problem of anti-social behaviour more generally. New legislation should not be considered unless there is evidence that existing provision is inadequate.</p>

  <p>Statutory responsibility for local libraries lies with local authorities. Each local authority is responsible for determining the level of resources allocated for the library service which they provide for the residents of their area. This includes the purchase of materials to address the needs of blind and partially sighted people.</p>

  <p>I understand that annual expenditure by local authorities on audio-visual material, such as talking books, has increased from &#163;1.0 million to &#163;1.6 million over the last 10 years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Library and Information Council, which receives core funding from the Scottish Executive, issued guidance to local authorities on book selection policies two years ago and over 30% of local authorities now have a policy in place with all the other local authorities working to develop their policies. A book selection policy aims to deliver user-led services to meet the needs of communities. The policy should be based on a profile of the needs of the community, including the needs of blind and partially sighted people, and could allow for the provision of a wide range of book and non-book materials.</p>

  <p>Noise problems in buildings are dealt with by a variety of measures, including building standards regulations and environmental health provisions.

  <p>One new oncologist started work on 10 June, another starts work in July. A further recruitment campaign is currently under way and it is hoped that at least two medical oncology posts will be filled. Clinical oncology posts may prove more difficult against the recognised national shortage in that specialty. Posts may also be filled on a locum basis pending substantive appointments.</p>

  <p>The Community Safety Partnership Award Programme referred to in the previous answer was introduced on 1 April 2002. Prior to the introduction of this programme funding for CCTV and other community safety initiatives was awarded to specific projects through challenge funding competitions, rather than directly to local authorities. Since 1996, &#163;10.3 million has been awarded to 161 CCTV projects across Scotland. From 2000 community safety projects have also received funding. The following tables show funding awarded to community safety initiatives by local authority area from 2000-01 onwards:</p>

  <p>Under the new funding programme a total of &#163;4 million per annum will be made available in financial years 2002-03, 2003-04 and 2004-05 - &#163;1 million more than the combined annual awards for the CCTV and Community Safety Challenge Competitions in previous years.</p>

  <p>The Community Safety Partnership Award is made up of two elements - the formulated award allocated according to size of population and the percentage of crimes per head of population, and the variable award allocated on a points system based on the quality and detail of the annual application submitted.</p>

  <p>The breakdown of award funding by local authority led community safety partnership for 2002-03 is shown in the following table:</p>

  <p>The agenda for the Fisheries Council in Luxembourg comprised the following main items: discussion of proposals for the introduction of TACs and a licensing scheme to regulate deep-water fisheries; a policy debate on the Commission&#146;s cod and hake recovery proposals, and a presentation of the Commission&#146;s proposals for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>

  <p>Agreement was reached by qualified majority on proposals for the regulation of deep-water species involving the establishment of a licensing scheme, and of TACs for a number of stocks. The UK opposed the proposals on the grounds that the measures were not likely to prove effective in conserving these endangered stocks.</p>

  <p>The debate on the Commission&#146;s proposals for recovery plans for cod stocks in the North Sea, to the west of Scotland and in the Irish Sea was constructive, recognising the parlous state of these stocks and the need for effective responses and for full examination of the options and of the scientific and socio-economic issues. The UK acknowledged the urgency of the situation and called for serious and informed debate on the proposals.</p>

  <p>The Commission gave a presentation of its proposals for the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy issued on 28 May and member states offered initial reactions. As expected there were divergent opinions on some aspects of the proposals. The UK welcomed the broad thrust of the proposals and the need for further consultation and discussion. The Commission aims to secure agreement on the reforms by the end of the year.</p>

  <p>Appropriate arrangements are already in place in Scotland, which recognise that general practitioners and other health professionals are best placed to advise and inform patients, and to refer to a specialist in appropriate cases. Though the immediate and long-term effects of acute organophosphate poisoning - which is rare in Scotland - have been well understood for some time, diagnosis can be difficult as the signs and symptoms are non-specific to the cause. Because of this, general practitioners in Scotland were advised by the Chief Medical Officer in July 1999 of the need to be particularly vigilant for this possibility. The Scottish Poisons Information Bureau provides advice to the NHS on treatment.</p>

  <p>Rent arrears management is a matter for individual housing associations and the question of recoverability of rent arrears in any case will depend very much on the facts and circumstances of that case.</p>

  <p>The interpretation of statute is a legal matter which is ultimately for the courts.

  <p>The Yellow Card Scheme has a proven track record in identifying new drug safety hazards, and in identifying possible risk factors for some reactions. Adverse reactions known to be associated with combined measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) vaccines and contraindications for MMR are listed in the product information for the MMR products. These are also described <i>in Immunisation Against Infectious Disease</i> and are detailed in materials for parents, such as &quot;The MMR discussion pack&quot;. However, in many cases, as with most medicines and vaccines, the risk factors for the development of adverse reactions to MMR vaccine are not known.</p>

  <p>The safety of MMR vaccines is kept under continuous review by the UK Medicines Control Agency (MCA) and the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM). Any new research that may emerge in relation to possible pathogenic risk factors for adverse reactions to MMR vaccines would be carefully reviewed by the MCA and CSM.</p>

  <p>There are over 900 mental health officers working in Scottish local authorities, an increase of 300 since 1997. In addition, approximately 75 social workers are presently undertaking training to become mental health officers.</p>

  <p>The Adult with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 and the forthcoming mental health legislation introduce a number of new statutory duties for mental health officers. In anticipation of this, the Social Work Services Inspectorate is undertaking a survey of local authority mental health officer service structures and activities to assess how best to meet these new demands.</p>

  <p>Existing training takes different forms. Basic mental health officer training courses are approved by the Scottish Social Services Council and are run by five local authority fora on a yearly basis. To assist local authorities in carrying out their duties under the Adults with Incapacity Act, the Social Work Services Inspectorate recently produced 1,800 training packs of specific relevance to mental health officers and backed this up with four national seminars for those who will be delivering the training locally to become familiar with the material.</p>

The Improving Regulation in Scotland Unit continues to have an important contribution to make, to secure delivery of the Executive&#146;s commitment to simplicity and fairness in policy and regulations impacting on business.</p>

  <p>My predecessor, Ms Wendy Alexander, was unable to give evidence at the committee due to Cabinet business. However, she provided the committee with comprehensive and relevant evidence in the form of the recently published report of the Clyde Shipyards Task Force. This has provided the basis for evidence by other witnesses, a significant number of whom were members of the task force.</p>

  <p>The issue of the balance between naval and commercial contracts was considered by the Clyde Shipyards Task Force which my predecessor, Ms Wendy Alexander, chaired.</p>

  <p>The task force recognises, in its report published in February 2002, that &quot;BAE SYSTEMS Marine is predominantly a warship builder &#133; the Govan, Scotstoun and Barrow yards employ approximately 80% of the UK&#146;s warship design, build and integration skills base. However, given BAE SYSTEMS Marine&#146;s current business strategy, the success of this nationally important business is almost completely dependent upon continued success in winning warship design and build contracts.&quot;</p>

  <p>The task force&#146;s report also includes a recommendation that &quot;BAE SYSTEMS Marine should continue to pursue commercial work where this is compatible with warship capacity demands and a sound business case can be made.&quot;</p>

  <p>The Govan and Scotstoun yards now have a healthy order book for naval orders and are well placed to win a significant proportion of the work on the MoD&#146;s two future aircraft carriers.</p>
