  <p>Information on the number of self-funding residents in care homes is available annually from the <i>Residential Care Homes Census</i> (Scottish Executive) and the <i>Nursing Homes Census</i> (Information and Statistics Division, Scotland).

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-08-19.5.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80178" speakername="Cathy Jamieson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0819.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>We do not, as yet, have reliable data on the number of childcare places in Scotland. Our current monitoring arrangement (through the annual census of Children's Daycare and Pre-School Education Centres) provides data on numbers of children attending these services. However, the 2002 census data, which will be published on 10 September, will provide information on the number of places for the first time.</p>

  <p>Counting available places does not necessarily give a useful indication of whether needs are being met, for example breakfast club, after school and holiday provision will all be included as separate places, but each is satisfying a different requirement. Furthermore, one &quot;place&quot; may be used by more than one child, since many parents do not require formal childcare full-time. Our view is that although data on both numbers of children and places is required, we need to supplement that with updated research into parent's needs.</p>

  <p>From the 2001 Census of Children&#146;s Daycare and Pre-School Education Centres, we estimate that one-in-five of 0- to 14-year-olds in Scotland were attending pre-school or daycare provision in January 2001. This is broadly the same as the rate in England.</p>

  <p>We are also examining the scope for setting clearer targets for Childcare Partnerships. These might include specific increases in the level of provision across different types of childcare, which would help to identify the level and type of provision available and where the gaps are.</p>

  <p>Childcare provision is being expanded through Childcare Strategy funding. &#163;16.75 million this year and next is being channelled through local authorities who, with their Childcare Partnerships, are expected to address and meet local childcare needs. In addition, the New Opportunities Fund current and third round childcare programmes (totalling &#163;46.3 million) are designed to support both new and existing childcare projects.</p>

  <p>No. However, as part of Project ATLAS, Scottish Enterprise has carried out a benchmarking study comparing prices for a range of broadband services in Scotland with the UK. Its findings support the concepts being developed and implemented within Project ATLAS, which aims to increase competition, provide a wider choice of services and minimise barriers to market entry.</p>

  <p>Asymmetrical digital subscriber line technology deployment is a commercial decision for the providers, usually related to demand. The Scottish programme under the UK Broadband fund addresses the need to stimulate demand through the development of a number of broadband demonstration centres and a broadband information website managed by the enterprise networks.</p>

  <p>ADSL deployment will be a matter for the commercial providers.</p>

  <p>The UK Government has set a general target on broadband which is to &quot;have the most extensive and competitive broadband market in the G7 by 2005&quot; and the Scottish Executive&#146;s broadband strategy is designed to contribute to this overall objective.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not carried out research into the effect of composite classes on attainment as such. There has been some international research into multi-grade classes that suggests that such classes have no consistent effect upon attainment but there is no consensus on this issue. We intend as part of the Scottish Executive research programme to conduct research into the effect of class organisation on attainment in 2003 and that project will also consider the effect of class size and composite classes.</p>

  <p>The Schools (Scotland) Code 1956 as amended by the Schools (Scotland) Code (Amendment No. 1) Regulations 1972 established minimum staffing levels.

  <p>All students returning to higher education to undertake a second properly designated full-time course are entitled to living cost support in the form of a student loan and non-repayable supplementary grants, regardless of study previously undertaken. Tuition fee and bursary assistance are, however, dependent upon previous study. Such support is available for the duration of the longer of the two courses less the number of years previously supported (withdrawal during an academic year is counted as a full year). This rule does not apply to those who withdraw during the first year of their first course.</p>

  <p>Students returning to further education to undertake a properly designated full-time course are eligible for funding for their second course provided they have not received more than the equivalent of 129 weeks of full-time support within the last six years and have not received support within the last four years unless (a) they were registered as a job seeker for a continuous period of at least three months immediately prior to enrolling (in which case support can have been received within the last two years) or (b) they last received support for a course which enabled them to progress towards the course for which they now require support. The four year rule can be breached by a student for other reasons, but not if they have already done so within the previous four years.</p>

  <p>All full-time students in either further or higher education will be able to receive full support to repeat a year of study which they have been unable to complete because of medical reasons (this concession is also awarded on compassionate grounds). All students are also expected to meet the standard residence criteria.</p>

  <p>The Management Statement issued by the Scottish Executive to Scottish Enterprise requires that they submit statements twice a year to the Executive showing performance against each of the key operating targets identified in their annual operating plan. In addition, on a quarterly basis, Scottish Enterprise prepares a statement of performance against operating plan targets for its board, which is copied to the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise plays an important part in achieving social justice objectives. The Executive was satisfied that the current operating plan includes outputs relating to inclusion across a range of activities including business starts and skills and learning. Scottish Enterprise reports to the Executive on performance against these targets. While no numerical target was set in the operating plan for 2002-03 for support to social economy organisations, Scottish Enterprise will provide business development and training support services to those who have reached or have the potential to reach a degree of commercial development and trading maturity.</p>

  <p>Closing the opportunity gap for Scotland&#146;s children is a key policy for the Executive. Through Sure Start Scotland we provide resources to give every child the best possible start in life. This supports joint-agency integrated service provision, which is often provided through children&#146;s centres. The Changing Children&#146;s Services Fund is a further source of resources to act as a catalyst for better integration of health, education, social work and voluntary sector services to improve outcomes for vulnerable and deprived children. All these resources are weighted heavily by local authority area to reflect deprivation levels.</p>
