  <p>The figure for 2007 is provisional. The final figure will not be published formally until after the appearance of <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Population 2007</em> (the Registrar General&rsquo;s Annual Review of Demographic Trends), which is scheduled for August 2008.

  <p>It is a question of determining, in each case, the insulin regime best suited to the individual&rsquo;s circumstances. Children with type 1 diabetes should be considered for insulin pump therapy as a treatment modality, bearing in mind the criteria set out in the NICE Health Technology Appraisal No. 57, <em>Guidance on the use of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for the treatment of diabetes</em> , issued by the National Institute for health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) in 2003. This guidance is currently under revision.</p>

  <p>The information is not collected centrally, but the <em>Executive Summary of the National Overview Follow-up Report</em> on performance against diabetes standards, published by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland the Diabetes UK Scotland in March 2008 suggests that treating diabetes and its complications uses about 10% of the total NHSScotland budget every year, which would amount to &pound;1 billion.</p>

  <p>Information on the number of people diagnosed with Korsakov&rsquo;s syndrome during an inpatient stay at an acute, general or psychiatric hospital can be derived from national data returns. A copy of this information broken down by NHS board of residence and age group for the financial years 1998-99 to 2005-06 has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 45406).</p>

  <p>The most recent assessment of the cost of alcohol misuse in Scotland comes from work carried out in 2004-05 by the Scottish Executive. They estimated the cost to society of alcohol misuse in 2002-03 as being in the region of &pound;1.1 billion. This assessment updated the costs and methodology developed in the 2001 Scottish Executive report <em>Cost of Alcohol Misuse in Scotland Trends and Costs</em> . The 2001 report estimated the cost of alcohol misuse to be &pound;1 billion.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently updating these earlier estimates. It is anticipated that the full updated estimates will be published soon. A copy will be sent to the member on publication.</p>

  <p>The most recent assessment of the cost of smoking to the economy and the NHS was published in a report commissioned by the Scottish Executive, <em>Reducing Smoking and Tobacco-Related Harm </em>(2003)<em>. </em>It is estimated that the annual cost of smoking-related time off work in Scotland is &pound;40 million and total productivity losses are put at &pound;450 million. Smoking is estimated to cost NHS Scotland &pound;200 million a year in hospital care. There has been no assessment of the costs of smoking to primary care services.</p>

  <p>Robust estimates of the economic and social impacts of illicit drugs in Scotland are not currently available, but based on research from England and Wales the total costs to society are likely to amount to around &pound;2.6 billion per annum. A research project is currently in progress to produce an initial estimate of the size and value of illicit drug markets in Scotland, and of the economic and social costs associated with illicit drug use. The research will also consider the value of extending the estimates to cover alcohol abuse and tobacco consumption, and is due to be completed later this year.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>This table does not include &pound;2 million per annum for tackling smoking, which is now part of NHS boards&rsquo; unified budgets; NRT prescribing (costs approx &pound;7 million per annum) or NHS Health Scotland&rsquo;s tobacco programme budget (approx &pound;1 million per annum).</p>

  <p>From 2008-09 the budget for enforcing smoke-free (&pound;2.5 million in 2007-08) is provided by means of a block grant.</p>

  <p>The alcohol misuse funding within this table is that made specifically available for this purpose by the Scottish Government. Significant additional resources are likely to have been made available by NHS boards and local authorities.</p>

  <p>The 2007-08 figure for tackling illicit drug use is not directly comparable with 2008-09. In addition to the funding available for tackling drug misuse in the Justice portfolio, a number of other budgets also provide resources for tackling drug misuse including local government, the police and NHS boards&rsquo; unified budgets.</p>

  <p>The eHealth strategy has reached the stage of a final draft with NHS boards and other stakeholders for comment. Organisations consulted mainly comprise NHS boards, and the principal individuals consulted are those listed in the answer to question S3W-11189 on 14 April 2008. In addition, a workshop is being scheduled for patients and organisations who represent patient interests related to long-term conditions.</p>

  <p>The main goal of the new eHealth strategy will be to support the aims of <em>Better Health Better Care</em> . While the strategy is not yet finalised, two key areas on which eHealth&rsquo;s contribution are likely to focus are reducing waiting times to 18 weeks and integration across patient journeys.</p>

  <p>A conference in partnership with the Scottish Health Council and the UK Patient Information Forum (PiF) is being planned to further develop this work. The conference will also provide an opportunity to measure progress against this commitment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government have made a range of representations to UK ministers, which have included discussions about the new points-based system, including how it will impact on Scotland and Scottish interests, and how we can get the best deal for Scotland from the new system.</p>

  <p>Representations have been supported by meetings, exchanges and correspondence at both ministerial and official level. Scottish ministers have been in correspondence with Home Office ministers about the scope for Scottish flexibilities within the system; a reduced qualifying period for settlement in Scotland; the criteria for Tier One - Post Study (the successor to the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland Scheme), including retaining Scottish HNDs as an eligible qualification; Scottish representation on the migration advisory committee and the migration impacts forum; and the potential impact on Scotland&rsquo;s cultural festivals and sports events, the Asian restaurant trade and Japanese investment (as a result of the English language requirement).</p>

  <p>Other representations have been made to the Home Office on immigration rules and legislation including; skilled migrants, migrants and citizenship, asylum seekers and the rights of children, academic visitors to Scotland and policing issues.</p>

  <p>No. The Postgraduate Medical Education and Training Board (PMETB) is the independent UK statutory body responsible for overseeing and promoting the standards of postgraduate medical education and training for all specialities. The role of PMETB is to prospectively approve specialty training programmes and to ensure their delivery through postgraduate deans is to agreed national standards. Operational responsibility for ensuring the delivery of these same standards in Scotland lies with NHS Education for Scotland (NES).</p>

  <p>As indicated in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s consultation document on Professor Sir John Tooke&rsquo;s report into Modernising Medical Careers (MMC)<em> Aspiring To Excellence</em> dated 8 January 2008, it is proposed that PMETB will merge with the General Medical Council (GMC). Similarly, the consultation document also confirmed that NES is planning an internal review of their Medical Directorate, particularly around roles and responsibilities within/across Deaneries to meet PMETB standards, and a project board has been established and work streams are being developed to be rolled out throughout 2008.</p>

  <p>In the light of the reduction of prescription charges on 1 April 2008, we have introduced new arrangements for partial refunds of Prescription Pre-payment Certificates (PPCs). The National Health Service (Charges for Drugs and Appliances) (Scotland) Regulations 2008 sets out the conditions under which PPC holders may be entitled to claim for a partial refund, following the reductions in prescription charges. Partial refunds are available to certificate holders who bought a PPC before 1 April, and whose certificate remains valid for at least one complete month following that date.</p>

  <p>The same regulations also set out the conditions under which a refund may be available on certain other grounds, for example if a certificate holder becomes entitled to free prescriptions on age or health grounds.</p>

  <p>The regulations will require to be amended in 2011 when prescription charges are abolished.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3M-11613 by Kenny MacAskill on 16 April 2008, whether it will now seek the views of the Scottish Prison Comission on the review of community penalties.</p>

  <p>The Prisons Commission has been set up to look specifically at the purpose of prison. However, the Scottish Government will of course give careful consideration to any views on community penalties that the Prisons Commission may express in its final report. Meantime, work is underway in taking forward the findings of the report of the Review of Community Penalties published last November.</p>
