  <p>In 2007, up to 8 June, there have been 44 apiaries diagnosed with varroa. Unfortunately this information has not yet been broken down by region. All figures may include an element of double counting as a number of beekeepers submit samples on a regular basis, some of which may have already been diagnosed earlier in the year or in a previous year.</p>

  <p>There is widespread support for the objectives of our national parks and in the first few years since they were designated both Scottish National Parks have achieved significant progress. Following on from the recent adoption of the two National Park Plans, I propose to initiate a review in the near future which will provide an opportunity to examine the operation of the park authorities as well as any questions about park boundaries.</p>

  <p>The Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 removed the statutory distinction between residential care homes and nursing homes. All such services are now registered as care homes, as defined in that act.</p>

  <p>The National Care Standards for care homes for older people require care home providers to have a written policy and procedure on the conditions under which restraint is used, and that staff are fully trained and supported in the use of restraint. Providers should also include in a resident&rsquo;s personal plan any measures of restraint which staff may have to use for their own safety or the safety of others. Restraint should only be used when it is necessary and after other forms of intervention have been thoroughly tried and found to be unsuccessful, or where there is a specific legal requirement.</p>

  <p>The Regulation of Care (Requirements as to Care Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2002 require care home providers to ensure that no resident is subject to restraint unless it is the only practicable means of securing the welfare of that or any other service user and there are exceptional circumstances. Providers are also required to keep a record of any occasion on which restraint or control has been applied to a resident, with details of the form of restraint or control, the reason why it was necessary and the name of the person authorising it.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission regulates care homes against the requirements in the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 and its associated regulations, taking account of the National Care Standards. It has a wide range of enforcement powers at its disposal should a provider fail to meet these requirements.</p>

  <p>The National Care Standards for Care Homes for Older People say that the care home service will have policies and procedures in place for the administration of medication. They also state that staff will know how to put these policies and procedures into practice and will have regular training to review this and learn about new guidance.</p>

  <p>The Regulation of Care (Requirements as to Care Services) (Scotland) Regulations require the care home to keep records of medicines kept on the premises for the use of residents.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission regulates care homes against the requirements in the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 and its associated regulations, taking account of the National Care Standards.

  <p>The Regulation of Care (Requirements as to Care Services) (Scotland) Regulations require providers to ensure that at all times sufficient numbers of suitably qualified and competent persons are working in the care service as are appropriate for the health and welfare of service users.

  <p>The Scottish Government is continuing to take a number of steps to ensure that the mainstreaming of equality is undertaken systematically across policy areas, these include:</p>

  <p>Continuing to implement the public sector equality duties, as both an employer and in terms of our policy and delivery work (the government&rsquo;s Race, Disability and Gender Equality Schemes set out our commitments to mainstreaming equality and are available on the Government&rsquo;s website).</p>

  <p>Continuing to promote the government&rsquo;s Equality Impact Assessment Tool (EQIA), which was launched in December 2006. The tool is available to all staff via the intranet, and completed impact assessments will be published on the government&rsquo;s website. We are conducting EQIAs across six strands (gender, race, disability, sexual orientation, age and faith) across all relevant policy areas (new policies and reviews of existing policies). We are also providing regular &quot;drop in EQIA surgeries&quot; for staff regarding how to best take forward EQIA effectively for different policy areas.</p>

  <p>Continuing to collect, analyse, disaggregate and disseminate analytical data (social research and statistics); provide focussed analytical support for the EQIA process; providing written and oral briefing across policy areas, and providing guidance and practical support to policy makers and analysts (for example, in March 2007 the Scottish Government published <em>A Gender Audit of Statistics</em>, which is available on the Executive&rsquo;s website and we are currently reviewing the guidance provided to bill teams and also working to embed equalities in the business planning process).</p>

  <p>Continuing to support the work of Equality Proofing the Budget and Policy Advisory Group and the Equality in Audit and Inspection Working Group.</p>

  <p>Continuing to take forward the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Diversity Strategy, &quot;Positive about You&quot; which was launched in November 2000 and reviewed and re-launched in December 2004. The revised Strategy has a focus on the mainstreaming of diversity across the organisation and aims to consolidate the substantial progress that has been made so far.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also published its <em>Departmental Diversity Delivery Plan</em>, in July 2006. This supports the wider Cabinet Office initiative, <em>Delivering a Diverse</em> <em>Civil Service - a Ten Point Plan</em>. The plan sets out how we plan to change the culture of our organisation and reap the benefits that having a diverse organisation brings. Its progress is overseen by its Diversity Forum: a group of key diversity policy leads from across UK Government and is chaired by its Diversity Champion. It also is monitored by the Cabinet Office Diversity Champions&rsquo; Network.</p>

  <p>Continuing to engage with our external stakeholders to harness their expertise and support in promoting and embedding mainstreaming equality across policy and practice.</p>

In order to achieve this urgent attention needs to be focused on the growth, the usage and the status of the Gaelic language.

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Local investment priorities are agreed jointly by Scottish Borders Council (as the strategic housing authority) and Communities Scotland. These investment priorities are based on the local housing strategy and evidence of housing need that is compiled locally.</p>

  <p>Both organisations are currently working to develop a longer term three year indicative investment programme for the Scottish Borders.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland and Scottish Borders Council have also been working with a local registered social landlord to establish a land-bank strategy, taking into consideration land that may be released once the new local plan has been approved. This will allow longer term planned investment activity.</p>

  <p>Over the 18 month period between January 2007 and June 2008, affordable housing developments are either on site, or are scheduled to go on site in Ancrum, Cardrona, Duns, Eyemouth, Galashiels, Hawick, Innerleithen, Jedburgh, Kelso, Melrose, Tweedbank, Selkirk, Sprouston, Stow and West Linton. These site starts will provide a minimum of 184 affordable homes for rent with a further 38 being made available through Communities Scotland&rsquo;s &quot;Homestake&quot; shared equity scheme.</p>

  <p>Homestake is aimed at helping people on low incomes who wish to become homeowners but whose financial resources are insufficient to meet their needs because of local housing market prices. Further details on Homestake are available at:<br /> <a href="http://www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/webpages/cs_008156.hcsp#TopOfPage" target="_blank">http://www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/webpages/cs_008156.hcsp#TopOfPage</a>.</p>

  <p>Additionally, last year Communities Scotland increased its allocation by 100% for Rural Home Ownership Grants (RHOGs). RHOGs aim to sustain rural communities by making it easier for local people on lower incomes to own their own homes. Communities Scotland will make eight grants available for successful applicants in 2007-08 and will consider increasing this should the allocation be met with appropriate demand.</p>

  <p>In 2007-08 Communities Scotland has allocated a record &pound;7.2 million investment in the Scottish Borders, an increase of over 9% compared with the 2006-07 allocation and an increase of nearly 50% on the allocation to the Scottish Borders in April 2005.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland, in partnership with local housing associations, has worked with Community Self-Build Scotland (CSBS) on a number of projects and has also published guidance (with input from CSBS) to help in planning community self-build projects.</p>

  <p>In Abbeyview, Dunfermline, Communities Scotland are presently working with CSBS, in conjunction with Fife Council and Fife Special Housing Association (HA), to develop a low carbon demonstration house on a site where another four houses for affordable rent are being developed by Fife Special HA. For this whole project, a total of around &pound;0.4 million of housing association grant funding is being proposed by Communities Scotland. Fife Council agreed to make the development site available to Fife Special HA, and, as the strategic housing authority, has also determined the tenure balance to best meet local affordable housing and regeneration needs in the area.</p>

  <p>Additionally, in connection with the project, Abbeyview Communities Scotland has part funded CSBS through Wider Role grant funding of &pound;0.03 million to build a low carbon office for use by CSBS and local groups. Communities Scotland has also supported CSBS through a further &pound;0.05 million of Wider Role grant funding to support sustainable construction training for women within Abbeyview and the local Dunfermline area.</p>

  <p>Monitoring the effectiveness of NHS Health Scotland&rsquo;s disbursements of funding is by way of the organisation&rsquo;s performance management system.</p>

  <p>Internal processes to monitor effectiveness are driven by quarterly business plan delivery reviews which involve budget holders and other staff tasked with project delivery, and staff from policy and planning and finance. These reviews lead to the production of reports on business plan delivery for consideration and, where necessary, action by the Corporate Management Team, the Audit Committee and the board.</p>

  <p>External processes to monitor effectiveness include periodic reviews with organisations receiving funding, and reviews by external and internal audit. The annual delivery plan is agreed with the Scottish Executive. Overall organisational effectiveness is reviewed annually by the Scottish government, through the annual review process.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Health Council was established as part of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland but with its own distinct identity. The Chief Executive of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland is therefore the accountable officer for the Scottish Health Council and is personally answerable to the Parliament for regularity, propriety and value for money in the management of the organisation. The council&rsquo;s staff are responsible for complying with the requirements of NHS QIS systems of internal financial control and the board&rsquo;s standing financial instructions.</p>

  <p>The Annual Review of the Scottish Health Council, which I will lead, also provides a mechanism for the monitoring and review of expenditure.</p>

  <p>As I outlined in my statement in the Chamber on 6 June 2007, I have instructed the board of NHS Ayrshire and Arran to review their original plans and to produce revised proposals that will enable accident and emergency services to continue at both sites in Ayrshire. I am clear that, as far as possible within the resources available to the board, I want them to retain their primary care and community development programmes.</p>

  <p>I recognise that there are many issues to address, for example relating to clinical workload and staffing. I want these challenges to be faced up to in a way that puts patients first and is innovative.</p>

  <p>It is now a matter for the board to determine how best to deliver these services and to produce proposals. I would expect the board to ensure that any proposals were fully informed by local clinical opinion. The Independent Scrutiny Panel, which will then fully consider the board&rsquo;s proposals, will have access to expert clinical advice. I will carefully consider all the available information before coming to a final decision.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps are being taken to ensure that small firms bidding for PFI/PPP contracts, particularly in the waste industry, are not disadvantaged by the process and that what they have to offer in the way of sustainability, particularly in relation to transport impacts on the environment, is taken fully into account and whether any instructions are being given to local authorities to investigate alternatives to PFI/PPP procurement.</p>

  <p>We said before the election that it will be open to local authorities and other public bodies to choose between PFI and Scottish Futures Bonds for planned and future projects. Work has already started on the detailed design aspects of the Scottish Futures Trust and a further announcement will be made when we are ready to explain it in more detail. We will ensure that replacement arrangements are robust and taken forward with the confidence of both public and private sectors.</p>

  <p>Until the Scottish Futures Trust is introduced, we are considering the scope to move to Non-Profit Distributing (NPD) forms of PPP where NPD surpluses are returned to the community providing a better balance of public/private interests.</p>

  <p>PPP projects are advertised in accordance with EC Procurement Directives. PPP projects tend to be large projects requiring main contractors to have experience of organising large and complex work programmes, and requiring significant balance sheets, therefore there is limited opportunity for small and medium-sized companies to become directly involved in the PPP consortium, although a few Scottish regional companies have successfully developed into that market. Small and medium-sized companies are more likely to be involved at sub-contractor level in PPP projects. There are likely to be new opportunities for small firms arising from processing of recyclable and compostable materials.</p>

  <p>The EC Procurement Directives provide scope for reflecting environmental considerations in procurement, where it is relevant to the subject matter of the contract or based upon environmental objectives of the public body concerned. This is a matter for the public sector procuring body itself.</p>

  <p>We have no such plans.</p>

  <p>I should explain there is no fixed definition of a &quot;public holiday&quot; in Scotland but it is normally held to include both bank and local holidays. Bank holidays are set out in statute under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971 or appointed by Royal Proclamation and it follows that they are the same across Scotland. Local holidays are part of the rich tradition of our cities and regions and the dates are for local authorities to determine, working with their partners, and are not subject to statute.</p>

  <p>Initially, we will enter into dialogue with all the major supermarkets operating in Scotland to learn more about their sourcing policies and their current relationships with Scottish suppliers. I will also be speaking to primary producers and processors to gain a more complete picture of how effectively the food chain works in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is responsible for policy on waste in Scotland and the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Regulations 2006 were made after consultation with the Executive and with the consent of the Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>The regulations include provision for appeals to the Scottish ministers in respect of the following decisions by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency:</p>

  <p>(a) refusal to approve a proposed compliance scheme;<br /> (b) withdrawal of approval of a compliance scheme;<br /> (c) refusal to approve an authorised treatment facility;<br /> (d) refusal to approve additional treatment sites used by an exporter, and<br /> (e) suspension or cancellation of approval of an authorised treatment facility.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) and the Forestry Commission Scotland have the lead responsibilities for delivering measures to promote conservation of red squirrel populations in Scotland.</p>

  <p>SNH currently employs two grey squirrel controllers in the affected area in south Scotland. These were immediately re-deployed to intensify removal of grey squirrels in and around the affected location near Lockerbie when the first infected red squirrel was found.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland (and its agency Forest Enterprise Scotland) is following an approach which was recommended in the Scottish Red Squirrel Action Plan 2006-11.</p>

  <p>The plan recommended that targeted control of grey squirrels to contain the spread of the squirrelpox virus should be carried out by Grey Squirrel Control Officers, undertaking control on both the national forest estate and private woods. Two such officers are already in place in the area affected by squirrelpox.</p>
