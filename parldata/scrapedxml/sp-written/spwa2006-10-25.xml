  <p>Bans on alcohol consumption in specific public places are dealt with by local authority byelaws. Where a local authority wishes to put such a byelaw in place, detailed proposals are discussed and agreed with the Scottish Executive. This part of the process is designed to ensure consistency and general compatibility with Scots law and that there is support for the proposal from the police and Procurator Fiscal&rsquo;s office. Once the proposed byelaws have been agreed they are then advertised by the local authority for 30 days. If there are public objections to the proposed byelaws these will be considered and addressed as necessary. Ministers are then invited to confirm the byelaw. Once the byelaw is confirmed by the Scottish ministers, the local authority is then able to set a date for implementation.</p>

  <p>Swing bridges are located on the A82, A83 and the A830 trunk roads. In total there are six locations where swing bridges carry the trunk road over canals. The locations are as follows:</p>

  <p>A830 at Mallaig Road at Banavie - just north of Fort William</p>

  <p>A82 at Laggan - between Loch Lochy and Loch Oich</p>

  <p>A82 at Aberchalder - just north of Loch Oich</p>

  <p>A82 at Fort Augustus</p>

  <p>A82 at Tomnahurich - just south of Inverness</p>

  <p>A83 at Ardrishaig - over the Crinan Canal.</p>

  <p>The first five bridges on the list carry the trunk road over the Caledonian Canal.</p>

  <p>Since January 2006 the other parties involved in the action have declined to discuss any form of resolution of the matter and the Executive is pursuing its legal action against the parties responsible for the damage to the Erskine Bridge. A legal hearing to determine liability and the amount of damages has been fixed to take place in the Court of Session commencing on 22 January 2008. Due to the number of parties involved in the action and the complexity of the case it is expected that the hearing will continue until March 2008.</p>

  <p>In the event that total reimbursement payments for 2006-07 were, in the opinion of Transport Scotland, likely to clearly exceed the agreed budget then capping powers may be invoked. This would however be a pro-rata cap applicable to all 300 or so participating bus operators rather than on a selective basis against individual operators.</p>

It also includes representatives of patients, primary care, NHS management, NHS staff, the Scottish Ambulance Service, Board Medical Directors and NHS Quality Improvement Scotland.</p>

  <p>Patients&rsquo; interests are represented by the Scottish Neurological Alliance, in view of the fact that the service being developed relates to the whole of Scotland.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how the decrease in local authority grants, identified by Professor Arthur Midwinter in a briefing note for the Finance Committee on 12 September 2006, will impact on delivery of Scottish pre-school and school education, given that 85% of the education budget comes from local authority grant aided expenditure.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-10-25.42.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80013" speakername="Robert Brown" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa1025.htm#15">

  <p>Professor Midwinter&rsquo;s briefing note to the Finance Committee refers to grant funding which is outwith and additional to grant aided expenditure (GAE) which forms part of the local government finance settlement for core local authority services, including education. There has been no reduction in GAE so there is no impact on funding of services supported from GAE including pre-school and school education. Resources from the local government finance settlement will have increased by almost &pound;3 billion by the end of the current Spending Review period compared to 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>The Draft Budget 2007-08 document includes a summary of this additional specific grant funding but it is inappropriate to compare budget figures for 2006-07 with plans for 2007-08 and then to conclude that there is a reduction in Executive funding. There are several reasons why the 2007-08 figures appear lower than in 2006-07.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when it will respond to the recommendations made by the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-10-25.47.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa1025.htm#18">

  <p>The Executive is responding today to the report from the Committee on Radioactive Waste Management (CoRWM). Similar responses are being made in Westminster and the National Assembly for Wales. I thank the chair, Gordon MacKerron, and the members of the committee for the effort which they have put into producing their unanimous report.</p>

  <p>CoRWM was asked to recommend the option, or combination of options, for the long-term management of the UK&rsquo;s higher activity radioactive wastes, which provides protection for people and the environment. CoRWM&rsquo;s report, together with the decisions that I, and my fellow ministers in Westminster and Wales, are announcing today, will complete the second stage of the Government&rsquo;s Managing Radioactive Waste Safely (MRWS) programme, which we announced in July 2002.</p>

  <p>Government (note that in this answer &quot;Government&quot; refers to the UK Government and the devolved administrations) believes that CoRWM&rsquo;s report provides a sound basis to move forward and we will continue to work together as we enter the next stage of the MRWS programme.</p>

  <p>We accept CoRWM&rsquo;s recommendations that the UK&rsquo;s higher activity legacy wastes, and those arising from existing nuclear activities, should be managed in the long-term through geological disposal, and the continuing need for safe and secure interim storage from which material will be retrievable until geological disposal is available. We also agree with CoRWM that we must continue to build on the momentum that it has helped to establish.</p>

  <p>As CoRWM&rsquo;s report observes, geological disposal is the approach being adopted in many countries, including in Belgium, France, Finland, Germany, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and the US. Nevertheless, securing geological disposal represents a major challenge and will require a commitment over many decades.</p>

  <p>We accept CoRWM&rsquo;s recommendations that the process for developing a geological disposal option should be undertaken on a staged basis, with clear decision points. This approach will allow Government to review progress, assess costs and value for money and environmental impact before decisions are taken to move to the next stage.</p>

  <p>Planning and development of the geological disposal option must be based on four key pillars:</p>

  <p>first, a strong and effective implementing organisation, with clear responsibilities and accountabilities;</p>

  <p>second, strong independent regulation by the statutory regulators - the Health and Safety Executive, the environment agencies and the Office for Civil Nuclear Security;</p>

  <p>third, independent advice to Government on implementation, and</p>

  <p>fourth, a partnership with the host community.</p>

  <p>Safe and secure storage of radioactive wastes already falls within the remit of the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority (NDA) established under the Energy Act 2004. We have decided that responsibility for securing geological disposal of these higher activity wastes should also fall to the NDA, so as to create one organisation able to take a strategic view through all stages of the waste management chain, accountable in a clear and transparent way to regulators and to Government.</p>

  <p>The NDA is already subject to statutory safety, environmental protection and security obligations, and its contractors are subject to regulation by the environment agencies, the Health and Safety Executive and Office for Civil Nuclear Security. Its strategy and annual plans are subject to approval by Government.</p>

  <p>We will ensure that the longer term radioactive waste management interests of Government are appropriately represented in the NDA&rsquo;s strategy and that it has governance arrangements to reflect its increased responsibilities.</p>

  <p>In order to enable the NDA to begin to undertake its increased responsibilities as soon as possible, Government proposes to augment the NDA&rsquo;s capabilities by incorporation of skills and technology from United Kingdom Nirex Ltd (Nirex).</p>

  <p>The second pillar is robust regulatory arrangements. The independent environment and nuclear safety regulators believe that this proposal will provide a framework that they can regulate in a strong and effective manner. They are content that the NDA will be responsible for implementing the geological disposal programme, as part of which a contractor with responsibility for delivery will be appointed as soon as practicable. The regulators&rsquo; support is of major importance, as strong independent regulation is key both to ensuring the safety of people and the environment and securing confidence and trust in the delivery arrangements.</p>

  <p>We remain committed to the need for independent advice, which is the third key pillar of our approach. A successor independent committee will be appointed to give advice on the plans for the long-term management of radioactive waste.</p>

  <p>CoRWM has set the standards for open and transparent advice that not only takes into account the best available scientific and other expert input but also the views of the public and stakeholders. It has also built up support and brand-recognition.</p>

  <p>The new committee will therefore maintain the current name, but its membership will be reconstituted to reflect its role in the next stage of the MRWS programme. CoRWM will be sponsored by the UK Government and the devolved administrations.</p>

  <p>The committee&rsquo;s primary function will be to advise Government on the delivery of a geological disposal programme. It will make its advice available to the UK Parliament, the Scottish Parliament and the National Assembly for Wales, as has been done by CoRWM.</p>

  <p>The circumstances surrounding the long-term disposal of radioactive waste are unique. We have made it clear that we are not seeking to impose radioactive waste on any community. In this context, we are strongly supportive of exploring the concept of voluntarism/partnership arrangements with the local authorities serving communities who might be affected. However, as CoRWM recognises, there is a need to consider further how such arrangements could work in practice.</p>

  <p>This is our fourth key pillar and we will be looking to further develop what is meant by a voluntarist/partnership approach including:</p>

  <p>the stages and decision points;</p>

  <p>how communities would be involved;</p>

  <p>the role of democratically elected bodies,</p>

  <p>and the potential for Involvement and Community Packages as suggested by CoRWM.</p>

  <p>Disposal facilities will only be built in a geologically suitable area, and we will also consider how geological and scientific considerations will be meshed with other societal considerations as, for a successful programme, all criteria will need to be met.</p>

  <p>To inform this consideration, we shall be discussing with key stakeholders how a voluntarism and partnership arrangement could work in practice. I invite any local authority, or group of local authorities, in Scotland who wishes to be involved in these discussions to contact me, or my officials, directly. UK and Welsh ministers are making similar offers.</p>

  <p>It must be stressed that any future geological disposal programme will be a wholly new process, divorced from the historical Nirex process. Lessons have been learned from that. We are also determined that the new approach will be carried out from the beginning in an open and transparent way with appropriate opportunity for public and stakeholder, as well as expert, involvement.</p>

  <p>In light of this further work, Government will produce an implementation framework and publish it for consultation as soon as practicable next year.</p>

  <p>Government accepts that ultimately it is responsible for the safe disposal of the current stocks of waste and waste which will arise from existing nuclear activities, and it will have to provide for its long term management through the funding of the NDA.</p>

  <p>This reply, and the more detailed response which I am publishing today - copies of which have been placed in SPICe - completes Stage 2 of the Managing Radioactive Waste Safely programme. We are now entering Stage 3 - planning for implementation.</p>

  <p>We aim to be able to move to Phase 4 - the final implementation Stage - in 2008, confident that the sharing of information and viewpoints and the transparency of the CoRWM process has been maintained.</p>

  <p>I believe that our responses today demonstrate Government&rsquo;s commitment to taking forward this important and long-term task to ensure the safe and secure management of our radioactive waste.</p>

No further funding has been allocated from the Executive to support the piloting of commercial medical innovation.

  <p>The consultation on the Scotland Rural Development Plan 2007-13 attracted 259 written responses, which have been analysed by the Scottish Agricultural College (SAC) on behalf of the Scottish Executive. The final report has since been finalised and published on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>For data protection reasons, it would not be proper for me to release personal information on individuals. Table 1: <em>SRDP Consultation List</em>, provides details of the organisations to whom the Executive sent the consultation to in that first phase, and is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 40741).</p>

  <p>Copies of the responses themselves, including contact details where the consultee has agreed that their response can be made public, are available from the Scottish Executive library.</p>

  <p>The results of the consultation are helping to inform our consideration of the future content of the SRDP and will be a major factor as we develop the Programme in advance of its formal submission to Brussels. In addition to placing the report of the consultation on the Scottish Executive website, my officials have circulated it to the SRDP and LMC stakeholder group in advance of finalising the proposals for submitting the SRDP to the European Commission.</p>

  <p>No ministerial announcement was made specifically about the Rural Transport Fund allocations for 2006-07.</p>

  <p>The Rural Transport Fund comprises three elements: - the Rural Public Passenger Transport Grant Scheme, the Rural Community Transport Initiative and the Rural Petrol Stations Grant Scheme. &pound;8.7 million and &pound;8.9 million were allocated to the Fund for 2006-07 and 2007-08 respectively and have been distributed as follows:</p>

  <p>The Rural Transport Fund comprises three elements:- the Rural Community Transport Initiative (RCTI), the Rural Petrol Stations Grant Scheme (RPSGS) and the Rural Public Passenger Transport Grant Scheme (RPPTGS). Scottish Borders Council received no funding under RCTI or RPSGS as these grants are paid to voluntary organisations and petrol stations respectively. However, the Council has received RPPTG as follows:</p>

  <p>1999-2000 - &pound;0.158 million</p>

  <p>2000-01 - &pound;0.167 million</p>

  <p>2005-06 - &pound;0.276 million</p>

  <p>2006-07 - &pound;0.285 million.</p>

  <p>The allocation for 2007-08 will be &pound;0.356 million. The amount of funding for 2008-09 and future years has still to be considered.</p>
