  <p>Legislation relating to asbestos is dealt with by the Health and Safety Executive and is a reserved matter. The Scottish Government is aware of the risks of those exposed to asbestos while working in the building and maintenance trades, and for those involved with asbestos removal. The Control of Asbestos Regulations 2006 were introduced to place obligations on any person responsible for managing the maintenance and repair of a non-domestic building to manage asbestos within it.</p>

  <p>The Clostridium difficile organism is naturally present in the gut of a large percentage of children. However, it is rare for this to develop into an infection in this age group, and thus the numbers of patients aged 14 and under who become ill from Clostridium difficile are very low.</p>

  <p>Testing methods and diagnosis of Clostridium difficile Infection (CDI) in children can also be unreliable and it is therefore not appropriate to carry out routine national mandatory surveillance for this age group.</p>

  <p>There are no plans at present to widen the age range below 15 years of age. Health Protection Scotland do, however, continually review the surveillance programme and will extend it should this becomes appropriate.</p>

  <p>Such an understanding of future assessment is incorrect. There will be accountability at classroom, school, education authority and national level for the achievements of children and young people at all stages against the standards and expectations in Curriculum for Excellence.</p>

  <p>Benchmarks at education authority and national levels will be based on a range of valid and reliable information including that provided through the National Assessment Resource and moderation practices.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Survey of Achievement will be refocused on numeracy and literacy in alternate years, beginning with numeracy in 2011. This will provide national performance information on literacy and numeracy at primary and early secondary stages.</p>

  <p>As stated by Ken Cunningham, General Secretary, School Leaders Scotland (SLS), in <em>The Sunday Post</em> on 14 June 2009 &quot;We need a robust education system to meet the challenges of the modern world and this is just another step in a series of improvement to that system standard grades and intermediates are being replaced by a new qualification, to the same standards, but better reflecting what will be taught and better reflecting all we know about best assessment&quot;.</p>

  <p>Curriculum for Excellence has received continual support from SLS and the other teacher representative organisations and we will continue to work with them and our other partners on its full development. SLS is a member of the Curriculum for Excellence management board and its sub-committees. In particular, SLS was a member of the management board sub-committee which helped to develop the model for the new qualifications. SLS is one of eight members of the Qualifications Governing Group, which is overseeing on behalf of management board the development of the new qualifications. SLS is also a member of the National Assessment Resource Content Group, the Achievement, S3 Profile and Reporting Group and the Curriculum for Excellence Stakeholder Communications Group.</p>

  <p>Head teachers have a critical leadership role in raising educational standards and ensuring children and young people in their schools fulfil their potential. They are responsible for the implementation of Curriculum for Excellence within their school, in partnership with their local authority. School Leaders Scotland (SLS) plays an important and valuable role in representing their views and interests as a member of the Curriculum for Excellence management board and of its sub-committees. In particular, SLS was a member of the management board sub-committee which helped to develop the model for the new qualifications. SLS is one of eight members of the Qualifications Governing Group, which is overseeing on behalf of management board, the development of the new qualifications. SLS is also a member of the National Assessment Resource Content Group, the Achievement, S3 Profile and Reporting Group and the Curriculum for Excellence Stakeholder Communications Group.</p>

  <p>Indeed, it was as a result of the professional advice from SLS as a member of the management board sub-committee on the model for the new qualifications that the new qualification National 4, to be introduced in 2013-14, will not have an external examination.</p>

Every major policy development for Curriculum for Excellence has been developed and supported by the board.

  <p>The new National 4 and National 5 qualification will be introduced from session 2013-14. Detailed assessment arrangements for the new qualification are being developed and I am confident that the concerns of the retired President of School Leaders Scotland will be addressed during the development process. The retired president has said that she was reassured that future assessment would not involve unit assessments and coursework in every subject. School Leaders Scotland is actively involved in developing the new qualification and Curriculum for Excellence as a whole. For example, School Leaders Scotland is a member of the Curriculum for Excellence management board and the Qualifications Governing Group which is overseeing on behalf of management board the development of the new qualifications.</p>

  <p>The decision to refer for adult respiratory extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) treatment is based upon individual clinical need. Where clinicians consider ECMO is necessary, patients from throughout the UK, including NHS Grampian, are referred for treatment to the UK&rsquo;s nationally-commissioned centre for adult respiratory ECMO at Glenfield Hospital in Leicester, following discussion and agreement with clinicians there.</p>

  <p>In the event that capacity at Leicester has been reached, there are robust arrangements in place to ensure that patients can be treated at the UK&rsquo;s additional commissioned H1N1 surge capacity centres at the Royal Brompton and Papworth Hospitals or at the European ECMO centre in Stockholm, Sweden. Only when current UK and European capacity has been reached, and with the agreement and ongoing advice and support of the clinicians in Leicester, would a patient be treated at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary.</p>

  <p>The reasons why people do not attend their GP appointments are many and varied. The priority is to improve systems to make them more user friendly and encourage patient responsibility.

  <p>While GP practices, health boards and the Scottish Government are working together to minimise the impact of those who do not attend for their appointment, it is up to the patient to act responsibly and either keep or cancel any appointments they make.</p>

This approach ensures that staff, patients and visitors are taking every precaution possible to reduce the risk of the spread of all avoidable infections. Hand gels are also available at hospital bedsides as a quick and effective way to protect patients and staff in between hand washing routines.</p>

  <p>We recognise that tackling healthcare associated infection (HAI) is everyone&rsquo;s business - staff, visitors and patients - and all have a part to play in driving down infection rates in hospitals. That is why a public awareness raising campaign involving TV and radio adverts ran earlier this year to educate the public on the importance of hand hygiene in reducing the spread of infections. I also launched a further awareness raising campaign aimed at NHS staff, consisting of posters and other supporting materials, in March this year. This is being widened out next year to include the community setting.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards have implemented the requirements of CEL 30(2008): Prudent Antimicrobial Prescribing: The Scottish Action Plan for Managing Antibiotic Resistance and Reducing Antibiotic Related Clostridium difficile Associated Disease. This, along with many other related healthcare associated infection actions led by the Scottish Government, has resulted in Clostridium difficile cases for the April to June 2009 quarter falling by 42% on the same quarter last year with rates in Scotland now at a record low, almost halving over the previous 12 months.</p>

  <p>Antimicrobial pharmacists are specialised senior staff. As part of actions flowing from the Scottish Management of Antimicrobial Resistance Action Plan (ScotMARAP), funding has been provided for the recruitment of antimicrobial pharmacists within each NHS board. I understand these pharmacists are now in post in all NHS boards with the exception of Western Isles who obtain antimicrobial advice from NHS Highland.</p>

  <p>In response to concerns over anecdotal reports regarding recruitment and retention issues with junior hospital pharmacists, Scottish health boards for the first time took part in the Pharmacy and Establishment Vacancy Survey conducted by the NHS Pharmacy Education and Development Committee on a UK-wide basis. The survey results showed no significant recruitment or retention difficulties for the majority of pharmacist grades. However, a higher level of vacancies were reported at the more junior pharmacist grades. We are currently analysing the survey data for Scotland in detail and will take appropriate steps to address any recruitment or retention issues identified.</p>

  <p>Our strategy to tackle healthcare associated infections (HAI) in Scotland is set out in our three year <em>HAI Task Force Delivery Plan for 2008-2011</em> , which was published on 7 March 2008. The delivery plan can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/03/07110818/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/03/07110818/0</a> .</p>

  <p>The delivery plan was informed by the findings of the HAI Point Prevalence Survey (PPS) published in July 2007, which identified the type and prevalence of infections in Scottish hospitals. It describes the areas where action will be taken to reduce HAI and includes, for example, catheter related urinary tract infections, ventilator associated pneumonia and central venous catheter infections.</p>

  <p>The delivery plan is, therefore, an extensive and wide-ranging programme aimed at tackling a range of conditions which can cause a HAI.</p>

Local health boards and national NHS organisations work together to ensure a contract delivery that best suits the requirements of the NHS in Scotland.

  <p>Seasonal flu vaccination uptake amongst those aged 65 and over continues to be in excess of the 70% national target (and in the last three years has been around or in excess of the 75% World Health Organization target).</p>

  <p>Although we are currently exceeding our target for this group, we are not complacent and will continue to use a national call-up letter for all those over the age of 65 as well as ensuring that marketing materials are distributed as widely as possible to reach this audience.</p>

  <p>Increased uptake of the seasonal flu vaccine amongst the at-risk groups remains a priority for the Scottish Government and in recent years we have made good progress in increasing uptake of the vaccine amongst this group.</p>

  <p>As in previous years, we have delivered an extensive marketing and awareness raising campaign to support the seasonal flu vaccination programme. Leaflets and posters have been widely distributed to GP surgeries, community pharmacies, NHS boards as well as to charitable organisations and local libraries to ensure that as many people as possible are made aware of the seasonal flu vaccination programme. Additionally, GPs locally have been encouraged to write to those under the age of 65 with clinical risk conditions to encourage them to attend for vaccination.</p>

  <p>This year, we have also deployed local advertising in areas where vaccination uptake has initially appeared to be lower than other areas.</p>
