  <p>We have made no commitment to continue to fund BNSF pathfinder schemes after the programme ends in 2003-04. We are considering how the regeneration resources identified in the 2003-06 budget can be used to take forward our commitments in the Community Regeneration Statement and further announcements will follow in due course.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is taking forward the implementation in Scotland of the UK obligations under the Convention on Biological Diversity as part of our commitment to sustainable development. We intend to ensure that the Nature Conservation Bill establishes a new duty on Scottish ministers and all public bodies to further the conservation of biodiversity in the exercise of their functions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Biodiversity Forum has developed, at the request of my colleague Allan Wilson, a draft strategy for biodiversity in Scotland which will be an important contribution to meeting the objectives agreed at the World Summit on sustainable development in Johannesburg last year.</p>

  <p>In addition, Scottish Natural Heritage are spending &#163;20 million in the current year on biodiversity related work and local biodiversity initiatives are developing action on the ground.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive announced yesterday that it is investigating claims in relation to the contract for the delivery of its central heating programme by the Eaga Partnership. The Eaga Partnership has offered its full co-operation with this investigation and the programme will continue to be delivered as normal. The company has also assured the Scottish Executive that the programme is on track and on target. The Scottish Executive target is that 8,500 elderly households in the private sector should receive central heating by 31 March 2003 and by 31 March 2006 a total of 40,000 households should benefit.</p>

  <p>On 24 February 2003, the Scottish Executive announced allocations to local authorities totalling &#163;7.5 million that will ensure that all local authority stock which lacks central heating should have it by 31 March 2004, with the exception of Glasgow, where the programme will be completed by Glasgow Housing Association within four years of the stock transfer. All housing association stock which lacks central heating should have it during 2004 under that part of the programme which is administered by Communities Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive is already taking action to support the needs of families with disabled children.</p>

  <p>Sure Start Scotland delivers support to very young children with disabilities and their families. Guidance emphasises that services should &quot;provide inclusive support which is both culturally appropriate and sensitive and takes account of any special needs of children and parents&quot;.</p>

  <p>Funding through the Executive&rsquo;s child care strategy supports the provision of child care to meet local needs, including those of families with disabled children. Sitter services provide child care in the parent's home, and existing services support some families with disabled children. A development worker is being funded to take forward the promotion and development of sitter services across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Information on households with children in temporary accommodation, having being placed there by the local authority under the homelessness legislation, has been collected centrally since June 2000. Information on the position (numbers and proportions) within each local authority area is available at the end of June, September, December and March each year since 2000. This information has been published in various Scottish Executive Statistical Bulletins/Statistics Releases, as shown in the table, which are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>These publications may also be found on the Published Data section of the Housing Statistics Branch Reference Website (<a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/housing/hsbref" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/stats/housing/hsbref</a>).</p>

  <p>Homeless households with children may be placed in temporary accommodation for a variety of different reasons. In the main, this will be an interim short-term measure on the route to permanent accommodation. The Executive is concerned to ensure that the temporary accommodation provided for homeless households with children is of a satisfactory standard and is committed to ending the use of bed and breakfast (B&amp;B) for this purpose. To this end, funding has been provided to the authorities with most children in B&amp;B to provide alternative forms of temporary accommodation for homeless families, of which &#163;289,000 was allocated to Argyll and Bute. All authorities have also received funding to increase the availability of suitable temporary accommodation more generally, following the implementation of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001.</p>

  <p>Guidance issued on the development of homelessness strategies also makes clear that these strategies should clearly identify which forms of non-permanent or intermediate accommodation are appropriate, and emphasises that the use of B&amp;B provision for families should be eliminated. Strategies are due to be submitted by the end of March 2003.</p>

  <p>It is for the individual partnership to determine the level of involvement of people with learning disabilities or other special interest groups. In July 1999 we produced comprehensive guidance <em>Safer Communities in Scotland</em> to assist Community Safety Partnerships to create the framework necessary to develop strategies and action plans. The guidance recommends that as a minimum partnerships should involve at a senior level, the local authority, police, health board and/or trust and the fire service. It also stresses that partnerships should consider the role of the private and voluntary sectors, housing associations and racial equality/community relations councils either as members of the core partnership group, or by being involved in specific working groups etc.</p>

  <p>In preparing a community safety strategy, partnerships are encouraged to undertake a community safety audit and to consult the community to enable them to be actively involved in setting priorities.</p>

  <p>Practice nurses are employees of general practices. As such, the NHS does not directly employ them. It is the responsibility of individual practices to determine appropriate staffing levels. The number of practice nurses has increased from 900.9 whole-time equivalent (WTE) in 1997 to 1,123.5 WTE in 2001 (ISD 2002).</p>

  <p>The extension of independent nurse prescribing, for which courses began in Scotland last year, and supplementary prescribing, which is currently being incorporated into courses, both represent a substantial widening of the prescribing powers of all nurses, including practice nurses. Of the 300 plus nurses who are currently in training, have recently completed training, or will be starting training shortly, to widen their prescribing powers, around 40% are practice nurses. A further &#163;2 million is allocated over the next three years to continue the expansion of nurse prescribing and introduce supplementary prescribing for pharmacists.</p>

  <p>West Dunbartonshire Council received a total of &#163;190,357 in Rough Sleepers Initiative (RSI) grant in the years 1997-98 to 2001-02 to provide a range of support services for people who slept rough, or were at risk of doing so. Argyll and Bute Council received &#163;397,360. A further &#163;104,347 per annum has been transferred to West Dunbartonshire's Revenue Support Grant and a further &#163;114,480 per annum to Argyll and Bute's Revenue Support Grant to ensure the continuation of these services.</p>

  <p>In May 2001 there were no people identified as sleeping rough in West Dunbartonshire in the two-week period covered by the study; in the same two-week period in 2002 there were three people who identified themselves to RSI services as having slept rough. In May 2001 the total number of people identified as sleeping rough in Argyll and Bute in the two-week period covered by the study was eight. In the same two-week period in 2002 the number was four.</p>

  <p>Both councils are currently preparing Homelessness Strategies, and revising their RSI local outcome agreements. In doing so, both councils have taken into account the findings of earlier research to ensure the wider availability of services and accommodation across their areas and the fact that they now have a statutory duty to provide, at minimum, temporary accommodation, advice and assistance for anyone assessed as homeless.</p>

  <p>Following the member's business debate on 4 December, NHSScotland regional planning groups have been asked to consider the benefits of providing joint admission services for postnatal depression on a shared, regional basis.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not been approached for financial assistance for the Edinburgh Marathon or the Loch Ness Marathon and, therefore, has no plans to support either event.</p>

  <p>It is for VisitScotland to consider the various approaches it receives for support against its objectives and priorities.</p>

  <p>I understand that VisitScotland decided against providing financial support for promotion of the Loch Ness event in both 2002 and 2003, but VisitScotland did promote the Loch Ness Marathon in its Active Scotland news release in 2002 and plans to do likewise this year.</p>

  <p>I suggest that any further questions on this particular issue be taken up directly with VisitScotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive continue to fund the agreement, <em>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</em> , <em> </em> in full.</p>

  <p>Additional funding towards full implementation of the agreement was announced in December 2002 as part of the Local Government Finance Settlement and is being distributed to local authorities using established and agreed arrangements.</p>

  <p>Further resources to fund specific elements of the agreement, including Continuing Professional Development and the placement of probationers will be distributed separately through specific grant allocations.</p>

  <p>We have made progress in many areas. This week alone, we have awarded over &#163;3 million to 55 projects under the Rural Community Transport Initiative, and agreed a joint investment programme with the Strategic Rail Authority to build longer platforms at 23 Scottish railway stations, to accommodate longer trains.</p>
