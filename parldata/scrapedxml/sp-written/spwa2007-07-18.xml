  <p>The Executive has no plans to introduce legislation to make micro-chipping of dogs compulsory. There is existing legislation which makes it compulsory for dogs, when in a public place, to wear a collar with the name and address (including postcode) of the owner engraved or written on it, or engraved on a tag. This is aimed to ensure that lost dogs can be returned to their owners.</p>

  <p>Micro-chipping has no adverse implications on the health of dogs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has received a number of representations concerning the conservation of sharks, skates and rays.</p>

  <p>As regards spurdog, I do not believe that a zero total allowable catch is the most effective measure to protect this stock. I would prefer to see the 5% bycatch limit that currently exists in the North Sea applied across all waters in the North East Atlantic. This would avoid unnecessary discarding whilst preventing any targeted fishery on this stock.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) collect data about mental health costs under the generic category of &quot;Mental Health&quot;. Accordingly, the levels of expenditure provided by SLAB cover all mental health issues, although a significant amount of that cost will cover Advice and Assistance (A&amp;A) and/or Assistance by Way of Representation (ABWOR) for compulsory treatment orders or their precursors under the Mental Health (Scotland) Act 1984 (1984 Act). SLAB do not hold separate figures for compulsory treatment orders and do not split legal costs by NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The following is the A&amp;A and ABWOR legal costs for &quot;Mental Health&quot; provided by the Scottish Legal Aid Board. Legal costs for compulsory treatment orders are covered from date the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 came into effect (5 October 2005) to 31 March 2006. The period prior to 5 October 2005 provides mental health legal costs that occurred under the 1984 act.</p>

  <p>Advice and Assistance - Mental Health - &pound;783,000.</p>

  <p>ABWOR - Mental Health - &pound;807,000.</p>

  <p>In 2004-05:</p>

  <p>Advice and Assistance - Mental Health - &pound;604,000.</p>

  <p>The EU does not permit imports of beef from countries permitting the use of hormones. Random testing for hormones is undertaken at Border Inspection Posts when animal products are imported into the EU. The Food Standards Agency also undertakes monitoring at point of retail. I have discussed this with the other UK Agriculture Ministers and the UK will be making representations to the EU Commission. I shall also be writing to the Commission.</p>

  <p>The Tribunal&rsquo;s best current estimate for period 5 October 2005 to 3 July 2007 for proportion of Compulsory Treatment Order applications processed to completion by way of:</p>

  <p>(a) first hearing is 51%;</p>

  <p>(b) second hearing is 35%;</p>

  <p>(c) third hearing is 13%, and</p>

  <p>(d) fourth hearing is 1%.</p>

  <p>We have been monitoring implementation of the act in conjunction with the Mental Welfare Commission, the Mental Health Tribunal for Scotland and others. I recognise that there are concerns in respect of the processes required under the act and the degree to which they result in multiple hearings, a tendency towards a greater focus on legal process rather than quality of care and the range of participants who may be engaged in each hearing. I am therefore planning to initiate a limited review of the act focussing on the efficiency and quality of the processes in respect of the making of civil orders in the context of the Millan principles. My letter of 17 July 2007 to the Convener of the Health and Sport Committee and placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 43178) provides draft terms of reference for this limited review.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. NHS 24 was introduced to NHS Borders residents in April 2004. Figures in italics are for the years following introduction.</p>

  <p>2. This is a count of all emergency episodes at Borders General Hospital; excluding transfers.</p>

  <p>3. Population is taken from GRO mid-year estimates of NHS Border Residents</p>

  <p>4. Crude emergency admission rates should be interpreted with caution. Episodes occurring at Borders General Hospital will include a small proportion of patients resident outside of NHS Borders health board area.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why there is a delay in national consistency checking for the 1,260 staff of NHS Tayside who have been assimilated on account and when this situation will be resolved.</p>

  <p>The implementation of Agenda for Change has taken longer than had been anticipated but the volume and complexity of the task of assessing pay for over 140,000 plus staff should not be underestimated. In addition, it was agreed in partnership that the assessment process put in place should be very deliberate and robust, which includes checking outcomes at local level to ensure consistency and then reviewing them at national level to ensure that the job evaluation system is being correctly applied. There was and remains a consensus of view across the health service that key to the successful delivery of Agenda for Change pay was consistency and accuracy of assessment, rather than speed of process.</p>

  <p>Normally, staff would have to go through both the local and national checking processes before they could be assimilated to the new pay bands. However, in order to help conclude implementation of Agenda for Change, in March of this year it was agreed in partnership that staff could assimilate after the local process was completed, with the national process carried out with retrospective effect.</p>

  <p>The national review process continues at a significant pace, and I am pleased to say that we are close to completing the movement of staff to the new pay bands. In this respect, the great efforts that health boards and the trades unions have put in should be acknowledged.</p>

  <p>In terms of NHSScotland as a whole, there are approximately 6,000 postholders still awaiting national review. In the case of NHS Tayside, 929 postholders have been reviewed recently, and the reports on these will be sent to NHS Tayside within the next seven to 10 days. This leaves a total of 98 postholders awaiting national review, and this will take place over the coming weeks.</p>

  <p>Scottish Borders Council are currently working with the Scottish Executive to extend their current award from the Strategic Waste Fund for recycling beyond 2009-10 to 2019-20. More generally, we are considering the future resources required for recycling as part of the Strategic Spending Review.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has instructed, or intends to instruct, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) not to permit losses in electricity generation when reviewing hydropower abstraction authorisations under section 18 of the Water Environment (Controlled Activities) (Scotland) Regulations 2005.</p>

  <p>When conducting any licence review under the Water Environment (Controlled Activities)(Scotland) Regulations 2005 (CAR), SEPA must comply with the procedural requirements established by that regime. It is these due process arrangements that will ensure that an appropriate balance is struck in any particular case between our targets to promote renewable energy (such as hydro-power) and for Scotland&rsquo;s water environment to be protected for future generations. As such, it would not be appropriate to instruct SEPA not to permit losses in electricity generation when exercising its functions under CAR.</p>
