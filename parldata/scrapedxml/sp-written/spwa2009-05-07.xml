  <p>The 2014 Commonwealth Games will result in the provision of a range of new facilities in addition to the seventy per cent of venues that are already in place.</p>

  <p>Four new permanent venues are scheduled to be built: the National Indoor Sports Arena, the Sir Chris Hoy Velodrome, Cathkin Braes Mountain Biking Course and the SECC Cultural and Entertainment Arena. In addition to the new venues, permanent enhancements will be made to several existing venues which are in public ownership. The new and enhanced venues will leave a permanent legacy of excellent facilities for use by schools, clubs and the community after the games. In some cases venues are scheduled to be ready for use by the public before the games - Cathkin Braes in 2009 and the NISA and Velodrome in 2012. Our legacy ambitions for the games include increasing participation in physical activity and sport. However, this is not solely reliant upon the provision of new facilities as we will also make the best use of a wide range of existing indoor and outdoor facilities, including sports centres, pitches, parks, cycle-paths and natural resources such as woodlands, waterways and our rural environment. This broad approach will allow us to improve links between existing local clubs, to encourage the creation of new clubs and groups and provide more opportunities for people to take part in different physical activities and sports and, indeed, encourage play amongst young people. Thus, we will seek to ensure that there is something to suit people of all ages, abilities and interests. In partnership with COSLA and sportscotland we will develop a network of community sport hubs that build on existing good practice. Community sports hubs will aim to strengthen multi-sport provision, coach development and local clubs and will work to bring clubs in the community together across Scotland. This is a very flexible model which can be shaped to suit local circumstances in both urban and rural environments and is underpinned by quality support services and access to affordable facilities, either on-site or within easy reach by public transport.</p>

  <p>A task force to look at the urban gull problem in Dumfries was set up following the Urban Gull Summit held in Dumfries in June 2008. One of the group&rsquo;s recommendations was to trial the flying of a falcon over the town centre to deter nesting and breeding attempts by gulls. Funding of &pound;76,340.15 (plus VAT) has been awarded from the Contract Research Fund to engage the Central Science Laboratory (CSL) to carry out this trial and assess its effectiveness as a deterrent measure.</p>

  <p>The nesting and breeding success of gulls during 2009 will be evaluated and compared with data for the previous nine years to inform a cost-benefit analysis of the trial. This will determine whether an application for a further two years funding from the Contract Research Fund should be progressed. The Scottish Government will not be funding the use of a falcon as a deterrent in other areas. However, the findings of the Dumfries project will be available to other local authorities and may potentially assist them in formulating local approaches to dealing with urban gull problems.</p>

The group includes Scottish Enterprise and its Chief Executive, Jack Perry, attended the meeting. That group is tasked with developing the operational delivery of the Creative Industries Framework Agreement.</p>

  <p>As I said in my statement to the Parliament on 2 April 2009, the way in which support is provided to artists and creative practitioners in Scotland must be modernised. The detail of this work will be an operational matter for Creative Scotland who will explore additional funding models to improve the way in which the cultural sector is supported as well as maintaining grant funding facilities.</p>

  <p>The wording of the Creative Scotland provisions in the Public Services Reform Bill will be made available to the Parliament on the Bill&rsquo;s introduction. As previously indicated, the use of the word &quot;artist&quot; could lead to difficulties of legal interpretation but the intention will be to enshrine creativity and the place of the creative individual at the heart of cultural policy.</p>

  <p>The branding of Creative Scotland will be an operational matter for the organisation to decide on. As I said in my statement to Parliament on 2 April 2009, Creative Scotland should, will and must be a highly successful and recognised brand, and all our efforts should go into making it so while not looking backwards but forwards.</p>

  <p>In common with other types of agricultural activity the dairy sector is subject to market movement. Global economic factors are impacting on farmgate prices which are a concern to many dairy producers.

  <p>Notes: X &ndash; Denotes the reconfiguration of NHS Argyll and Clyde into Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Highland. 1. This data relates to dental treatment carried out under the Community Dental Service and excludes the NHS general dental service, hospital dental service and private dental treatment. 2. Community Dental Service data (SMR13) for some NHS board areas may be incomplete for the years 2004-05 to 2006-07. SMR13 recording ceased to exist from 1 April 2007. A new clinical system, R4, is currently being rolled out to the Community and Salaried dental Services. 3. The data above relates to the number of teeth extracted, not the number of patients who received such treatment. A patient may have had multiple teeth extracted on one occasion or more. 4. NHS Board is based on the location code as recorded on the SMR13 form. <strong> Ross Finnie (West of Scotland) (LD):</strong> To ask the Scottish Executive how many people aged (a) under five, (b) five to 18 and (c) over 18 had teeth extracted under (i) general and (ii) local anaesthetic in 2007-08.</p>

The data above relates to the number of individual patients who have had teeth extracted, not the number of teeth extracted. 3.

It is not possible to distinguish between orthodontic and non-orthodontic extractions. 4.

For Hospital Dental Services, tooth extraction is defined as OPCS4: F09 (surgical removal of tooth) or F10 (simple extraction of tooth). SMR01 can capture up to four operations in each discharge summary; data in the table are based on the presence of a relevant OPCS4 code in the discharge summary, regardless of primary/secondary operation. 3.

Whilst local authority and court areas are not co-terminous, this provides the best available approximation to local authority information. However, as there is no sheriff court based in North Ayrshire, it is not possible to provide an estimate of the number of prosecutions for offences in this local authority.</p>

  <p>Mixing cocaine with alcohol not only makes people difficult to deal with, it is also very dangerous for the individuals concerned.</p>

  <p>We will be running new <em>Know the Score</em> campaigns on cocaine later this year. We will work with key stakeholders to develop messages for the campaigns that are credible and accurate. In developing them we will also consider the issue of poly-drug use. We are also updating our suite of <em>Know the Score</em> materials, website and helpline. Last year we held three cocaine awareness weekends in selected Scottish regions. These helped to forge useful links with third parties including the licensed community, the police and partner networks such as Alcohol and Drugs Action Teams (ADATs) and local organisations operating in the field. The issue of mixing cocaine with alcohol was also highlighted in the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse (SACDM) Psychostimulant report. We will publish a response to that report shortly.</p>

  <p>A key element of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s approach to tackle violence is to work closely with the national Violence Reduction Unit and other partners in order to better understand the nature and true extent of the problem. Injury surveillance systems at accident and emergency departments help us do so and, building on the success of the Cardiff model, there are now injury surveillance projects running in Edinburgh and Fife, with another due to begin shortly in Lanarkshire which we are helping fund. The information gathered through these schemes is shared with the police to inform their tasking and coordinating meetings in an attempt to prevent future incidents and we hope that it can have a positive impact. All of the schemes will be evaluated in due course and we hope that successful systems can be replicated in other parts of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Note: *The emission estimates within this table are forecast increases in carbon dioxide emissions with the project compared to without the project in a given future assessment year. These estimates have been calculated using a variety of methodologies and, consequently, it is not statistically valid to aggregate the individual figures or directly compare them with one another. Environmental impacts from infrastructure projects are taken from the latest published estimates. In most cases, this will be the carbon estimate contained in the specific Environmental Statement (ES). Some projects may not yet have undergone a formal Environmental Statement; where this is the case the carbon estimate is taken from the environmental chapter of the STAG Appraisal report.</p>

Funding provided to local authorities through the local government settlement to support the provision of money advice is not included because the Scottish Government does not hold details of which organisations were funded.

  <p>There are mechanisms in place to review the future of listed buildings; these take into account wider community benefits. The listed building consent process in particular exists to allow appropriate alteration, re-use and, in certain circumstances, demolition of the building. The tests by which a building can be demolished were most recently set out in the Scottish Historic Environment Policy, published in October 2008. One such circumstance is where it can be demonstrated that the demolition of the building is essential to delivering significant benefits to economic growth or the wider community.</p>

  <p>There is, in addition, an appeal process against the refusal of listed building consent which can be pursued where an applicant is unsatisfied with the decision.</p>

  <p>In light of consultation responses to our proposal to raise the minimum legal purchase age for off-sales to 21, and the difficulties of carrying such a measure through Parliament, the Scottish Government has decided not to pursue a blanket approach across Scotland. Our revised approach will provide local flexibility by encouraging and facilitating licensing boards to develop local solutions to local problems. This is consistent with the general approach of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 which already allows for conditions to be tailored to particular premises or particular types of premises.</p>

  <p>Should a decision by one licensing board to raise the minimum purchase age for off-sales purchases to 21 result in displacement of a problem to neighbouring boards, those boards will have the opportunity to review their own policies as they see appropriate. Chief constables and the local licensing forum will also have powers to request their local licensing board to consider increasing the minimum purchase age for off-sales at any time.</p>

  <p>Improving the mental health and wellbeing for children and young people is a priority for the Scottish Government. We continue to encourage NHS boards to consider Child &amp; Adolescent Mental Health Services (CAMHS) workforce development within their workforce plans.</p>

  <p>Workforce Planning is well established in NHSScotland and a National Workforce Planning Framework is in place to support and assist NHS boards in planning their future workforce needs, taking into account current supply and future demand. A nursing workforce planning model is in place at national level to determine the need for student nurses, including mental health nurses, to meet future demand and takes into account the workforce characteristics of the current nursing supply. NHS boards should also factor changes to services and their likely impact on staff groups into their own workforce planning processes. Based on this information the Scottish Government Health Directorates commissions a nationally agreed number of student nurses and midwives to the six higher education providers of nursing and midwifery education. As part of this commissioning process, the Health Directorates will ensure that the future need for CAHMS nurses is taken into account. NHS Education for Scotland, on behalf of the Scottish Government Health Directorates, is working with both education providers and NHS boards to maximise the exposure of both mental health and children&rsquo;s nursing students to Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services as practice placements.</p>

  <p>Transport services will vary within each NHS board area across Scotland. Community and Demand Responsive Transport services play a vital role in providing access to NHS facilities in areas where public transport services are limited.</p>

  <p>Under the Transport (Scotland) Act 2004, Regional Transport Partnerships have a legal requirement to develop Access to Healthcare Strategies and address the issues for their areas. Regional Transport Partnerships continue to work with local authorities and health boards to mainstream travel plans and work with local partners to promote more active and sustainable travel. The Scottish Government is providing local government with record levels of funding over the period 2008-11. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it (including those provided under the Enhanced Demand Responsive Transport Initiative) on the basis of local needs and priorities.</p>

The service tries to ensure that resources are used in the most cost effective and efficient way possible.

  <p>The Regulation of Investigatory Powers (Scotland) Act 2000 provides a framework for the authorisation and regulation of the use of investigatory powers by public authorities in Scotland. It seeks to balance the protection of individual civil liberties with the safety of the wider public and we have no current concerns with its operation.</p>

  <p>The arrangements in relation to prescription forms issued in England and dispensed in Scotland are set out in the National Health Service (Charges for Drugs and Appliances) (Scotland) Regulations 2008, and have therefore been given full consideration by the Scottish Parliament. The arrangements in relation to prescription forms issued in Scotland and dispensed in England are set out in the relevant Regulations in England.</p>

  <p>These Regulations provide that all prescriptions written in England and presented in a pharmacy in Scotland, and <em>vice versa</em>, will be dispensed in the normal way. However, the charge applied per item will be the equivalent of the charge applied in England, which is currently &pound;7.20, unless patients are exempt under the relevant Regulations. This includes exemption through presentation of a valid Prescription Pre-payment Certificate (PPC), which are particularly beneficial to patients with long-term conditions. A small number of residents of Scotland are registered with a GP practice based in England and will therefore be issued with an English prescription form. Those patients can apply for an Entitlement Card which entitles them to pay the reduced Scottish charge, currently &pound;4.00, if they present their prescription form, along with their Entitlement Card, in a pharmacy in Scotland.</p>

  <p>(a) The gross cost of dispensing prescriptions to patients across Scotland from April 2008 to December 2008* was approximately &pound;834 million. This includes drug costs and related dispensing fees. Costs for 2009-10 and 2010-11 will depend upon various factors including future decisions by prescribers and future changes in drug costs. These are not forecast centrally but, as responsibility for meeting prescribing costs is devolved to NHS boards, each board sets its own prescribing budget.</p>

  <p>(b) The income from prescription charges** from April 2008 to December 2008* was &pound;26 million and we estimate that income for the full financial year 2008-09 will be more than &pound;33 million. We currently estimate income in 2009-10 and 2010-11 of &pound;27 million and &pound;21 million, respectively, but this will depend upon a number of factors including future decisions by prescribers. Notes: * full financial year data will not be available until later in the year. **including prescription charges for single items as well as income from sales of Prescription Pre-payment Certificates.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government and COSLA agreed in July 2008 that it was important to review the assets held by local authorities and Scottish Enterprise which relate to the delivery of local regeneration.</p>

  <p>In line with that agreement, meetings have taken place between senior officials from South Lanarkshire Council and Scottish Enterprise, and by pooling local knowledge and expertise, officials are developing a jointly agreed plan for the future use of assets, whether that will be development, disposal or retention. This is, of course, an on-going process and regular meetings are held to keep the joint plans under review. No assets have transferred to date. The key issue for national and local government is not so much the physical ownership of assets relating to the delivery of local regeneration but an assurance that they will be used in a way that maximises the benefits to local communities.</p>

The first tranche of &pound;12.5 million a year, which Scottish Enterprise (SE) had committed to local regeneration projects, will transfer directly to local authorities over the next few years. The agreement recognises that SE has existing commitments in respect of these projects but enables transfers to local authorities as these commitments are completed and where SE has been unable to meet expenditure plans, for example due to project delays or slippage. The second tranche of &pound;12.5 million, Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s contribution to URCs, will be made available in the longer term. These funds will remain with Scottish Enterprise but will be ring-fenced for projects identified by Community Planning Partnerships. Under the agreement, around &pound;4.4 million was transferred to local authorities recently, in respect of 2008-09, and South Lanarkshire Council&rsquo;s share of that amounted to some &pound;290,000.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the <em>Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings</em> , which was ratified by the UK Government on 17 December 2008, where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that an individual is a victim of trafficking for any purpose, he or she must be offered support for a reflection period of at least 30 days. In the UK the reflection period has been set at 45 days. During that time the individual will not be subject to deportation proceedings.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is working with the UK Government, statutory agencies and the third sector to ensure that victims of trafficking are identified and supported. The Scottish Government has provided funding to the Trafficking Awareness Raising Alliance (TARA), which provides specialist support to adult female victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation. In addition, the Scottish Government has entered into an agreement with the Migrant Helpline to provide support to all other adult victims of trafficking, including adult males trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation. Local authorities have a duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children in their area who are in need regardless of their status and this would include victims of trafficking.</p>

The Honours of Scotland sculpture, commissioned by the Incorporation of Goldsmiths of the City of Edinburgh and made by silversmith Graham Stewart, symbolises the importance of the three honours of the Scotland; the Crown, the Sword and the Sceptre, in the history of the Scottish Parliament. The sculpture was presented by The Queen to mark the opening of the Scottish Parliament building on Saturday 9 October 2004.</p>
