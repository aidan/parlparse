  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive (a) what information it has received about (i) any fixed Sheep Annual Premium (SAP) to be agreed by the Agriculture Council of the European Union on 20 November 2001 and (ii) the year in which any such SAP would first be payable, and (b), should any such SAP not be payable in 2002, what plans it has to compensate crofters and farmers for hardship caused by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease.</p>

  <p>I attended the Agriculture Council on 20 November in the expectation that changes would be agreed to the EU sheepmeat regime. Unfortunately, negotiations foundered but there were positive elements contained in the latest Presidency proposal which I have supported and which I hope can be agreed soon in order for changes to come into effect from next year.</p>

  <p>A very important element for Scottish producers was the proposed move to a flat rate premium payable from the year 2002. The rate proposed was 21 euros per eligible ewe, plus seven euros for LFA producers. A national envelope would also be established payable at one euro per ewe which might be targeted to suit particular Scottish needs.</p>

  <p>The move away from a deficiency based calculation will provide producers with more financial certainty about the level of income accruing from this particular source, and it is estimated that SAP payments will increase by around &#163;24 million in respect of 2002 compared with 2001.</p>

  <p>Data is not collected centrally on the allocation of responsibilities within services or on an educational psychologist&#146;s professional levels of specialist expertise. However, educational psychologists will have an understanding of autism and those dealing particularly with autism will have appropriate training.</p>

  <p>NHS Boards are responsible for planning service provision to meet the assessed needs of their resident populations.</p>

  <p><i>Cancer Scenarios: an aid to planning cancer services in the next decade</i> was published by the Scottish Executive in May of this year. It is available on www.scotland.gov.uk and www.show.scot.nhs.uk.</p>

  <p>First year national and regional cancer investment plans to implement <i>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change</i> were launched on 6 November 2001. These are also available from the above websites.</p>

  <p>This year, West of Scotland cancer services will see additional investment of more than &#163;5 million, of which &#163;2.4 million is going directly to services in Glasgow.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive review has been undertaken of the current role of Community Learning Scotland (CLS). This review has included responses from key stakeholders including CLS.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is fully committed to community learning and development as a means of engaging with young people, promoting social inclusion, developing individuals and communities and promoting lifelong learning.</p>

  <p>All of the functions currently undertaken by CLS are required to support delivery of the Scottish Executive&#146;s policy. Strengthening of the youth dimension of community learning is required to reflect its place as one of our priority areas.</p>

  <p>Ministers have decided that CLS&#146;s community learning, adult learning and training, validation and endorsement functions will transfer to Communities Scotland. The youth remit and Eurodesk will transfer to the non-governmental organisation Youthlink Scotland. CLS will cease to exist as an Executive non-departmental public body with effect from 1 April 2002.</p>

  <p>I will work together with the Minister for Social Justice and the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning and other colleagues to ensure we co-ordinate and actively promote all aspects of community learning and development.</p>

  <p>The adult and community learning functions that are transferring to Communities Scotland will be central to the work that the new agency, as part of the Scottish Executive, will be doing to empower communities and to build the capacity of communities to be directly involved in local decisions and the management and delivery of services in their area.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers are committed to raising the profile of youth issues with emphasis on effective support to practitioners in the field. The remit given to Youthlink is a challenging one and will require the strengthening of links between the statutory and voluntary sectors. I will be seeking views soon on priority areas for development of youth work in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Wendy Alexander, Iain Gray and I are also pleased to announce that a &quot;Development Engine&quot; to help drive forward the Executive&#146;s new initiative to raise levels of adult literacy and numeracy will be created in line with the recommendation in the recent report <i>Adult Literacy and Numeracy in Scotland, </i>within Communities Scotland.</p>

  <p>This will provide a new specialist focus on research and development in adult literacy and numeracy while ensuring effective co-ordination with national developments on community learning in general. Communities Scotland will work closely with a range of bodies and organisations in this regard. Raising levels of adult literacy and numeracy is crucial to promoting community learning and development, and wider goals on social justice and a competitive economy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not collate the level of detail requested. However, each local authority is required to publish a community care plan which takes a broad view of the needs of vulnerable adults in their area and how they are going to be met. These plans are a matter of public record.</p>

  <p>Community Care Plans link to children&#146;s plans. They cover the transition between adult and children services by taking into account the future needs assessment of children who will turn 18 during the life of the Community Care Plan.</p>

  <p><i>An Action Plan for Dental Services in Scotland</i> , launched in August 2000, outlined a number of proposals to improve oral health in Scotland, including the health of older people. A number of these have now been carried forward as part of the implementation process. Proposals for oral cancer screening have been submitted to the Chief Scientist Office and are currently under consideration.</p>

  <p>The Chief Medical Officer&#146;s Expert Group on the Healthcare of Older People has completed a review of the issues associated with the health of older people, including oral health. The oral health sub-group has reported to the Chief Medical Officer&#146;s Expert Group.

  <p>Two-year postgraduate training in dentistry, known as General Professional Training (GPT), has been the subject of discussions with the profession on several occasions in the past. It is also regularly discussed with representatives of the dental profession at meetings of the national Dental Committee of the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education (SCPMDE) and also of the regional Dental Committees of that organisation.</p>

  <p>Postgraduate medical and dental education in Scotland is organised on a regional basis along the lines of the postgraduate medical deaneries. Each region covers several NHS Board areas. All regions in Scotland except one have formal GPT schemes.</p>

  <p>This information is not yet available. The Scottish Executive has recently undertaken a statistical survey to collect data on the number of children who are educated outwith school. The results will be published later this month and will provide data by local authority area on two groups of children &#150; (1) those for whom education is provided outwith school because they are unable, due to certain circumstances, to attend school, and (2) those educated at home as a result of parental choice. This is the first time that data has been collected on the latter group of children. Age and gender data has not been collected and will therefore not be available.</p>

  <p>No specific guidance has been issued. General queries on this topic are received from time to time, from both individuals and organisations, and information is provided to enquirers as required.</p>

  <p>Local authorities already have powers to take action where knotweed poses a threat to the local amenity of an area. Action may also be taken by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) in pursuance of its general duty to &quot;secure the conservation and enhancement of &#133; the natural heritage of Scotland&quot;. SNH has recently completed <i>An Audit of Alien Species in Scotland</i> (Review No. 139, SNH, 2001) which provides an assessment of the threat posed by knotweed. The Scottish Environmental Protection Agency has a role in providing guidance on the use of herbicides and the disposal of waste contaminated with knotweed.</p>

  <p>Partnerships involving the above statutory bodies, the owners and occupiers of affected property and other interested parties are therefore the most appropriate mechanism for dealing with specific knotweed problems at a local level. Advice issued by the Executive reflects that position.</p>

  <p>Funding for agri-environment schemes is set out in the Rural Development Plan for Scotland which was approved by the EC in December 2000. Any additional funding for measures within the plan, whether state-aided or co-financed, would require the approval of the EC.

  <p>There are currently two Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs) in Scotland, the Balmalcolm NVZ in Fife designated in 1996 and the Ythan NVZ designated in May 2000. However, the UK was been found to be in breach of the directive by the European Court of Justice (ECJ) in December 2000. The UK had taken the view that this directive applied to surface freshwaters and groundwaters only where necessary to protect drinking water sources. In the course of proceedings culminating in the ECJ judgement, the UK admitted that this interpretation was wrong and that the directive applied to the protection of all freshwaters on the surface and underground. Work is currently in hand to identify any areas which need to be designated as new NVZs.</p>

  <p>The EC Nitrates Directive requires that all land draining to waters which are polluted by nitrates must be designated as Nitrate Vulnerable Zones (NVZs). An action programme of management measures, such as periods when certain fertilisers cannot be applied, must be followed by farmers in NVZs to limit pollution of surface and groundwaters by nitrates from agricultural sources.</p>

  <p>The first action programme in Scotland came into force in December 1998 in the Balmalcolm NVZ in Fife. A further NVZ was designated in May 2000 in the Ythan catchment. A proposed action programme for the Ythan NVZ, based on the recommendations from the Scottish Agricultural Pollution Group, was put out to consultation on 5 February 2001. A copy of the consultation document has been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17496).</p>

  <p>The proposed Ythan action programme represents a significant improvement of the first action programme. For example, it includes extensions to the periods when slurry manure must not be applied to sandy or shallow soils and requires a fertiliser and manure plan to be prepared and used each year. We have been in discussion with stakeholders about modifications to the detail of these proposals. I expect to make the regulations shortly to bring the action programme into force.</p>

  <p>Written guidance on how to comply with the action programme rules will be provided for all farmers including guidance on CD-ROM for those who wish it.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why the number of clients seen by Health Visitors has reduced by 49,800 between 1997 and 2000, as detailed on page 7 of the <i>Scottish Community Care Statistics 2000</i> .</p>

  <p>The nature of health visiting work has changed and will continue to change in line with the recommendations in <i>Nursing for Health</i> which will involve a more targeted programme of health visiting alongside a wider range of community focused activity.</p>

  <p>Starting Well is delivering a very intensive programme of health visiting within two deprived areas of Glasgow. The impact of that and the implications in terms of additional staff to replicate it remain to be evaluated. In the meantime, it is important to note that much of the intensive activity being delivered in the Starting Well Project is being delivered by community development workers, support workers and nursery nurses. All of this activity would not show up in recorded statistics in health visiting.</p>

  <p>The figures refer to the number of home visits made by health visitors and district nurses. This represents only part of the work that they do. Recent changes in practice has included increased activity in clinical based settings rather than home visits and this is not reflected in the figures. The figures also do not reflect an increasing shift in health visiting practice towards community and group based activities or that district nurses are increasingly working jointly with social work. The increasing complexity and intensiveness of activity carried out by district nurses and health visitors is not reflected in these numbers. The numbers of district nurses and health visitors have continued to increase year by year. There were 21.9 more whole-time equivalent health visitors in 1999 than in 1997. The number of district nurses rose by 141 during the same period. In <i>Nursing for Health</i>, we acknowledged that the current methods of recording activity are inadequate and do not reflect changing practices. Work is on-going to develop a more meaningful means of reflecting community nursing activity based on the development of an electronic primary health care patient record. Further details of proposals will be made public soon.</p>

  <p>We are not aware of any policy of this kind and we would not support its adoption. There will be occasions where it may be clinically appropriate to test for pregnancy, however we would expect this to be conducted overtly in line with the guidance <i>A guide to consent to examination, investigation, treatment or operation</i> , <i> </i> which was issued to the NHSScotland in 1992.</p>

  <p>This guidance sets out that a patient has a right under common law to give or withhold consent prior to a procedure being carried out. This is a basic principle of health care and covers all procedures. The guidance does, however, give examples of where a procedure may be undertaken without first obtaining the patient&#146;s consent, for example; for lifesaving procedures where the patient is unconscious and cannot indicate his or her wishes.</p>

  <p>The number of qualified radiographers in post in NHSScotland has increased by 4% since 1997. The vacancy rate for qualified radiographers has also increased marginally to 1.1% at 31 March 2001 for posts vacant for three months or more.</p>

  <p>We have made clear that clinicians should be alert to those at higher risk of sudden death because of a significant family history of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. GPs should refer those patients to a cardiologist for investigation.</p>

  <p>Recent scientific evidence suggests that implantable defibrillators may help prevent sudden death in high risk patients, but these findings need to be confirmed. This new evidence has led the National Screening Committee, which advises the UK Health Departments on screening programmes, to commission further work. We will consider the committee&#146;s advice in due course.</p>

  <p>I gave a commitment in the members&#146; debate on 14 November that we would investigate ways of increasing awareness of the condition within primary care. For those families in which a particularly serious form of the disease occurs, the Scottish Molecular Genetics Consortium is considering the possibility of including tests in its molecular genetics service.</p>

  <p>The clinical guidelines produced by Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN), which are based on the most up-to-date published evidence, are of international renown. One of the accepted strengths of SIGN guidelines, apart from their technical excellence, is the wide professional ownership that follows from the intercollegiate nature of SIGN. So far SIGN has published 54 guidelines.</p>

  <p>Local NHS organisations and clinicians are expected to take the advice in the guidelines and adapt them as local protocols. This advice is also being built into integrated care pathways and managed clinical networks and into the standards developed by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland.</p>

  <p>SIGN Guidelines therefore make a significant contribution to improving the quality and effectiveness of patient care by ensuring that Scottish clinicians have ready access to a single source of high quality, up-to-date evidence-based advice.</p>

  <p>Article 3 of the European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage (Revision) recently signed by the UK Government seeks to ensure that archaeological excavations and prospecting are undertaken in a scientific manner by qualified, specially authorised persons. The most recent summary of the Government&#146;s view was that expressed in reply to a House of Commons Parliamentary Question on 13 July by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport:</p>

  <p>&quot;In broad terms, current measures in place in the UK already meet the Convention&#146;s requirements. The Government does not believe that additional legislation, requiring a licensing system, is necessary to fulfil Article 3. Much archaeological work is already controlled through existing mechanisms. There may be scope for developing a voluntary Code of Conduct for those who wish to undertake archaeological work outside the existing systems of control.&quot;</p>

  <p>The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) (Scotland) Order 1997 (the 1997 Order) specifies in Class 9 that, among other things, changes in the level of occupancy of a house between the following groups: a single person, people living together as a family and up to five residents living together, do not constitute development and do not, therefore, require planning permission. Class 9 of the 1997 Order does not, however, apply to flats.</p>

  <p>Beyond the specific provisions of Class 9 of the 1997 Order, it is for planning authorities to consider whether an application for planning permission is required for an increase in the level of occupancy. Determination as to whether an increase in the level of occupancy of a dwelling constitutes a material change of use amounting to development which requires planning permission depends on the impact of that increase on the amenity and environment of the surrounding area. Planning authorities may specify their policies in relation to multiple occupancy in their local plans.</p>

  <p>The vacancy was filled by Mrs Anne Smith, who had appeared before the ad hoc Selection Board, which met in June 2001. The board considered that Mrs Smith was fitted for appointment. In accordance with the procedure laid down by section 95 of the Scotland Act 1998, acting as First Minister I decided to recommend her when this vacancy arose.</p>

  <p>We will introduce a rates relief scheme for small businesses with effect from 1 April 2003. This scheme has been devised after careful consideration of the responses received to the consultation paper we issued earlier this year.</p>

  <p>An estimated 70% of Scotland&#146;s businesses will benefit from rates relief. For those businesses, rates are a higher proportion of costs than for larger businesses. Our aim is to spread the burden of rates more fairly.</p>

  <p>Rate relief will be available to businesses, occupying a single property with a rateable value up to and including &#163;10,000 as outlined in the table.</p>

  <p>Businesses occupying properties with rateable values greater than &#163;10,000, and up to and including &#163;25,000, will pay the standard poundage rate. Businesses occupying properties with rateable values above &#163;25,000 will pay a slightly higher poundage.</p>

  <p>We will also introduce rate relief measures for rural communities which address commitments made in the Scottish Executive&#146;s <i>A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture</i> document and recommendations made in the Scottish National Rural Partnership&#146;s Report <i>Services in Rural Scotland</i>. In particular, a new rate relief scheme for farm diversification projects; an extension to the existing rural (village shops) relief scheme to singly owned pubs, singly owned garages and shops selling mainly food; extension of agricultural exemption to farm buildings used for machinery rings, contract and share farming enterprises; and exemption of Automatic Telling Machines (ATMs) located in designated rural areas from non-domestic rates. Implementation of these rural rate relief measures will require primary legislation but it is our intention to include provisions in the next Local Government Bill.</p>

  <p>The figures refer to the number of home visits made by health visitors and district nurses. This represents only part of the work that they do. Recent changes in practice has included increased activity in clinical based settings rather than home visits and this is not reflected in the figures. The figures also do not reflect an increasing shift in health visiting practice towards community and group based activities or that district nurses are increasingly working jointly with social work. The increasing complexity and intensiveness of activity carried out by district nurses and health visitors is not reflected in these numbers. The numbers of district nurses and health visitors have continued to increase year by year. There were 21.9 more whole-time equivalent health visitors in 1999 than in 1997. The number of district nurses rose by 141 during the same period. In <i>Nursing for Health</i> , we acknowledged that the current methods of recording activity are inadequate and do not reflect changing practices. Work is on-going to develop a more meaningful means of reflecting community nursing activity based on the development of an electronic primary health care patient record. Further details of proposals will be made public soon.</p>

  <p>It is for NHS Boards to determine the services which are required to meet the needs of their local population within available resources. Guidance to help boards devise their strategies for osteoporosis was issued by the Health Department in 1997 in the form of a Scottish Needs Assessment Programme report. This gave the conclusions of a group of experts drawn from within the NHS on suitable measures for the prevention, detection and management of osteoporosis.</p>

  <p>As agreed at the debate on this issue on 24 May, an audit of current levels of swimming provision is under way. A questionnaire seeking a wide range of information has been sent to local authorities and will provide an up-to-date picture of opportunities available for school pupils.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not issued any such guidelines but the then Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions issued general guidance in 1998 on the risks of using a mobile phone while driving, which makes it clear that, if using a mobile phone results in careless or dangerous driving, it can lead to prosecution.</p>

  <p>At present, any proposals for new railways in Scotland require parliamentary approval at Westminster using either a &quot;light railways Order&quot; under the Light Railways Acts 1896 and 1912 or the powers of the Private Legislation Procedure (Scotland) Act 1936.</p>

  <p>As part of the package of measures for railways devolution, it was agreed that the Scottish Parliament should have legislative competence over the approval of the promotion and construction of new railways in Scotland. To achieve this, the Scottish ministers and the Secretary of State for Transport, Local Government and the Regions have instructed the preparation of a draft Order under section 30 of the Scotland Act 1998. This will involve creating an exception to the reservation of rail transport in the Scotland Act.</p>

  <p>Once the Scottish Parliament has legislative competence over the promotion and construction of new railways in Scotland, parliamentary permissions will be granted using the Parliament&#146;s Private Bill procedure. Guidance for promoters wishing to bring a Private Bill before the Scottish Parliament has been issued and can be viewed at <a href="../../bills/billguidance/gprb-c.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/official_report/cttee/private-01/gprb-c.htm.</a></p>

  <p>Arrangements for cross-border projects are already provided for under section 24 of the Transport and Works Act 1992. In these circumstances, railway projects which cross the border are likely to be subject to Private Bill procedure before Westminster.</p>

  <p>Approximately 100 individuals, representing 42 organisations, were present at the &quot;Ready for Winter &#150; Winter Maintenance on Scotland&#146;s Roads&quot; conference on 25 September 2001.</p>

  <p>Forums to enhance liaison and communications between the Scottish Executive, Operating Companies, local councils and the police have recently been held at Victoria Quay for each of the four trunk road operating company areas.

  <p>The role of the Adventure Activities Industry Advisory Committee (AAIAC) is to provide advice to the Health and Safety Commission and guidance to the industry and it does not make recommendations direct to schools. Given this, there is no role for anyone within the Executive to monitor or advise on their implementation.</p>

  <p>The Health and Safety Executive (HSE), who provide the secretariat function, publish the AAIAC advice and literature. If that guidance is followed then the industry, and schools, will be complying with the health and safety legislation. It is the role of the HSE to ensure health and safety legislation is complied with.</p>

Securing better outcomes and life chances for all children is a key priority for the Executive. We have recently announced the establishment of a new Cabinet Sub-Committee on Children&#146;s Services, to be chaired by the First Minister. In addition, the Scottish Executive announced on 26 November 2001 a &#163;250,000 boost to breakfast service provision in Scotland&#146;s most disadvantaged areas. Breakfast is important for children to help them to concentrate and learn in school as well as meeting their physical needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans specifically in relation to the Befriending Network (Scotland). However, national voluntary organisations are free to seek financial support from the Scottish Executive&#146;s direct grant schemes. Details of how voluntary organisations can apply for funding can be found in the leaflet <i>A Guide for the Voluntary Sector to Scottish Executive Grants</i> , which is available from the Scottish Executive and the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. General advice on funding for the voluntary sector is available from the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not carried out research into the benefits of befriending and mentoring and does not have a specific strategy to ensure the future of befriending and mentoring in the voluntary sector. However, the Executive recognises that befriending and mentoring are key components of the volunteering opportunities that are available in Scotland. The Executive&#146;s Active Communities Initiative seeks to support and promote volunteering and community involvement generally.</p>
