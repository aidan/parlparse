  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how a performing company aspiring to &quot;national performing company&quot; status, as referred to in <em>Scotland&rsquo;s Culture: Scottish Executive Response on the Cultural Review</em> , can qualify for such status and when the set of qualifying criteria will be published.</p>

  <p>The exact criteria for national performing arts company status are still being developed. The criteria will be used to assess both new applicants and, periodically, existing national performing arts companies. Once these criteria have been finalised and published it will be open to other performing arts companies which feel that they meet the criteria to apply. We expect the criteria to be published and to invite applications in 2007.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. A dentist is counted once for each NHS board in which he/she was working. General dental practitioners (GDPs) enter into a contract with their local NHS board. A GDP may have more than one contract with an NHS board if he/she has more than one practice, and a contract with more than one NHS board if he/she practises in more than one NHS board area. As a result, the sum of the number of dentists in each NHS board area exceeds the number of dentists practising in Scotland.</p>

  <p>2. &quot;Orthodontic specialists&quot; here are defined as dentists (including salaried dentists) working in the NHS general dental service whose list numbers are limited to the practice of orthodontics. Any NHS dentist may provide orthodontic treatment if he/she has the appropriate dental qualification.</p>

  <p>The Executive has not issued any specific guidance to local authorities in relation to their obligations under equal pay. General advice and guidance on such matters has, however, been published by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). The Executive is working closely with the EOC on the Code of Practice and accompanying guidance for the gender duty, which will be published in the summer of 2006.

  <p>It has recently come to light that, due to an administrative oversight, a file of statements that was available to all parties to the Dunblane Inquiry, is not currently included within the documents held at the National Archives of Scotland. Extensive enquiries have been made to determine how this happened. It appears that at some point between the transmission of the files from the Inquiry Office to the National Archives of Scotland at the end of the Inquiry, and the cataloguing of the files at the National Archives of Scotland, the file was either inadvertently not included or mislaid. The file was therefore not part of the papers which were passed to the Crown Office in 2003 when consideration was being given to making inquiry documents available to the public and was not made available to the public in October 2005.</p>

  <p>The external evaluation of the Doing Well By People with Depression programme will report in June 2006 and will provide a solid information base on which to make decisions on the recommended initiatives for roll-out.</p>

  <p>The programme has aimed to increase access to treatment for mild to moderate depression in primary care and also provide increased choice of treatments for patients. The programme did not set targets for the reduction in the prescribing of anti-depressant medication. The evaluation will comment on the impact of providing guided self help services on increasing access and choice to a range of treatments and will draw out any learning about anti-depressant prescribing rates, along with other issues if this is available through the data gathered.</p>

  <p>The roll out of the learning from Doing Well By People with Depression will focus on sharing the evidence base to support service development, ensuring that effective approaches are incorporated into the NHS QIS Integrated Care Pathway for depression and also supporting service change as part of the Delivering For Health, Mental Health Delivery Plan.</p>

  <p>Such referral information is not available centrally. Treatment options are a matter for Clinicians in consultation with all relevant professionals and the individual. Relevant care options will be considered as part of care packages designed to offer the best outcomes for the individual.</p>

  <p>NHS boards do not use an independently administered, standard evaluation tool for Doing Well by People with Depression initiatives. However, an external evaluation of the programme has been commissioned and is due to report its findings in June 2006. The pilot sites involved in the projects have provided data according to a nationally agreed dataset.</p>

  <p>In August last year, we published the <em>National Workforce Planning Framework</em> to introduce a new annual workforce planning cycle for NHSScotland, aligned with service and financial planning. It sets processes in place at local, regional and national levels for strategic planning across the range of staff groups, including consultants, that contribute to our NHS services. National decisions affecting workforce supply will be made on the basis of NHS board and region projections of demand.</p>

  <p>We have already increased the number of Specialist Registrar training places by 375 since 2001, to improve the available supply of specialists for consultant posts. A scheme has also been developed with NHS Education for Scotland to help improve the retention of this increased supply of Specialist Registrars after successful completion of training. The scheme involves establishing the career aspirations of specialist registrars at an early stage and alerting them to current and potential consultant vacancies across NHSScotland. At the same time, NHS boards will be alerted to Specialist Registrars about to gain their Certificate of Completion of Training.</p>

  <p>The Executive has been in correspondence with all NHS boards regarding the filling of vacant consultant posts and is fully committed to increasing the numbers of consultants in post and reducing vacancy levels.</p>

  <p>NHS boards have drawn up detailed business plans setting out the actions they plan to take to fill current vacancies and these have been agreed with the Executive. Additional funding of &pound;2.5 million has been allocated to boards to assist them in taking forward the actions contained in their plans. Other actions being taken by the Executive include placing an advert in the British Medical Journal referring to consultant vacancies in Scotland and introducing a scheme to match current Specialist Registrars to consultant vacancies. We are also in the process of developing a scheme to allow the advance appointment of Specialist Registrars into consultant posts.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the average waiting time for a hip replacement was in each of the last five years, broken down by (a) NHS board and (b) hospital.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-04-19.47.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0419.htm#19">

  <p>The majority of patients who require in-patient and day case treatment, including hip joint replacement surgery, are treated quickly. Over 53% of patients treated in NHSScotland hospitals receive immediate treatment and never join a waiting list. Of those who wait, over 40% are admitted within one month and almost 70% within three months.</p>

  <p>For those patients who wait longer, the current national maximum waiting times is six months. This guaranteed waiting time will be reduced to 18 weeks from the end of 2007. On 31 December 2005, no patient with a guarantee had waited more than six months for hip joint replacement surgery.</p>

  <p>Median waiting times for hip replacement surgery are derived from information on patients treated during the year. This data includes patients who have had an Availability Status Code (ASC) applied, for example because they were medically unfit or had asked for their admission to be deferred for personal or social reasons. Periods of unavailability are therefore included in the calculations of median waiting times, which means that the waits are systematically over-stated.</p>

  <p>The median waiting times for hip joint replacement surgery, by NHS board of residence and by NHS hospital of treatment, for each of the last five years, is provided in the following tables.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available. Waiting times data is collected centrally only for first out-patient appointments at consultant-led out-patient clinics, following referral by a General Medical or Dental Practitioner, and for hospital in-patient and day case treatment.

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-04-19.49.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0419.htm#19">

  <p>The information requested is given in the following table.</p>

  <p>The distribution of waiting times for new out-patient appointments and in-patient/day case discharges is highly positively skewed. The arithmetic mean is an inappropriate statistical measure for such distributions because a very small number of long waiting times can have a disproportionate effect on the mean waiting time.</p>

  <p>The mean is not a target for NHSScotland; it is only a summary measure for patients who waited for a first out-patient appointment or in-patient/day case hospital care. Reducing maximum waiting times is the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s priority for NHSScotland. The current national maximum waiting time for a first out-patient appointment and for in-patient and day case treatment is six months. This will be reduced to 18 weeks by the end of 2007.</p>

  <p>The in-patient/day case data in the table includes patients to whom an Availability Status Code (ASC) has been applied, for example because a patient has refused a reasonable offer of admission or whose medical condition prevents treatment. The recording of ASCs on in-patient/day case discharge data is not mandatory and patients with these codes cannot therefore be excluded from this analysis.</p>

Where voluntary arrangements fail, the Planning etc. (Scotland) Bill provides ministers with powers to direct that one of the constituent authorities assigns someone to manage the preparation of the SDP with others assigned to assist.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-23994 by Cathy Jamieson on 16 March 2006, how this answer indicates whether or not it has discussed with Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government the briefing paper sent by the Foreign Office to the Prime Minister&rsquo;s Office stating that people captured by British forces could have been sent illegally to interrogation centres to establish whether there are any links between these reports and the allegations that US agencies have used Scottish airports as refuelling stops for flights engaged in the process of &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has regular discussions with the UK Government on a variety of issues and across a variety of portfolios. However, all such discussions are subject to an established undertaking of mutual confidentiality so as to allow for the free and frank discussion of policy between the two administrations.</p>

  <p>As Senator Marty&rsquo;s inquiry is still on-going, it is too early to speculate whether Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government will require a contribution from the Scottish Executive to any response.</p>

  <p>I therefore cannot add to the answer I gave to question S2W-23834.</p>

  <p>Each year the Care Commission selects five core standards for each type of care service on which all inspections in that year are based. The inspection process also gives the Care Commission the flexibility to cover non-core standards where that is appropriate or necessary. In both 2002-03 and 2003-04, the first two years of the commission&rsquo;s existence, standard 13 of the National Care Standards for Adult Care Homes, which covers nutrition, was one of the core standards and all adult care homes were inspected against it.</p>

  <p>One of the core standards for adult care homes in 2004-05 was standard 14 on health care, which addresses staff awareness of residents&rsquo; nutritional needs and keeping those needs under review. In addition to inspecting against the core standards for that year, the commission also inspected against standard 13 in at least 13% of care homes. This was done for a variety of reasons, for example where the Care Commission Officer was following up recommendations from the previous report, or where something had come to light during the inspection.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission will be inspecting against standard 13 again in 2006-07, when improving nutrition in care homes will be an inspection theme.</p>

<ques id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-04-19.76.q0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80068" speakername="Maureen Macmillan (Highlands and Islands) (Lab)" spid="S2W-24654" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0419.htm#32">

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what arrangements are being made to support community environment groups whose funding will be spent by the end of March but whose follow-on funding from the Strategic Waste Fund, INCREASE or similar sources will not be available for some months.</p>

  <p>We have received a number of bids to the Strategic Waste Fund (SWF) from local authorities which include support for community sector groups in their area. As with any bid to the SWF we will need to ensure that value for money criteria are met before an award is made.</p>

  <p>In the meantime groups can apply to the INCREASE Programme for support (<a href="http://www.increase-programme.org.uk" target="_blank">www.increase-programme.org.uk</a>) or approach their local authority for assistance.</p>
