  <p>Children with autism spectrum disorder are most likely to be diagnosed in an outpatient clinic and managed in the community or general practice. Diagnostic information for patients attending outpatient clinics is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>On-going research in molecular genetics and development of the brain should help to establish the nature of the association between fragile X and autism. A SIGN guideline for assessment, diagnosis and clinical interventions for children and young people with autism spectrum disorder was recently published, which identifies and recommends areas for further research.</p>

  <p>There are currently two projects on the islands being funded through the Efficiency and Reform Fund. They are Joint Working in Orkney and the Comhairle nan Eilean Siar Integrated Service Delivery.</p>

  <p>The overall aim of the Orkney project is to improve the efficiency of public sector services in Orkney, in particular in the management and delivery of support services in the Orkney Islands Council, NHS Orkney and other partner agencies, by means of closer working and/or integration of selected services.</p>

  <p>The Western Isles Project - The Outer Hebrides Community Planning Partnership (OHCPP) wishes to maximise the positive impact of the SE agendas relating to Integrated Service Delivery and Efficient government through the development of a service delivery model and governance arrangements that will secure the future of locally delivered and accountable public services in the islands.</p>

  <p>The projects are both at the defining and scoping stage and will give us options for governance of a single public body which we will need to consider carefully before taking forward in line with our objective of smaller simpler government.</p>

  <p>Prior to August 2007, training to be a general practitioner was either through the General Practice Vocational Training Scheme or through a self-construct approach. Both routes required a final year as a General Practice Registrar (GPR). From August 2007, the training programme comprises three years, the final year of which remains as a GPR. The number of places is therefore given for the final GPR year only. Prior to and including 2003-04 the number of GPR training places remained constant at 250. From 2004-05 to 2006-07 there were 280 places. In 2007-08 this has increased to 300 places.</p>

  <p>I have asked David Mulhern, Chief Executive of the Scottish Police Services Authority, to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The length of time taken to analyse a sample will vary according to the quality of the sample and the circumstances in which it was obtained. After a sample has been analysed and a DNA profile developed from it, the process of identifying whether that DNA profile matches a DNA profile that is already on the database is almost instantaneous.</p>

  <p>Veteran&rsquo;s issues such as commemorative events are a reserved matter for the Westminster government and to the Ministry of Defence, including the striking and awarding of military campaign medals which is in the preserve of Her Majesty The Queen. Scottish Ministers however are open to consider formal applications for funding from groups and organisations on a case-by-case basis.</p>

  <p>Between 1999-2000 and 2001-02 our records show that the Government received no formal applications for funding for either war memorials or commemorations. In 2002-03 an application for funding for a war memorial from the Normandy Veteran&rsquo;s Association was received but was declined. In 2003-04 the Executive received no formal applications for funding.</p>

  <p>In 2004-05 the Government received two applications for funding. The McCrae&rsquo;s Battalion Trust received a contribution of &pound;5,000 for the Great Hearts War Memorial at Contalmaison in Northern France, and the 51st Highland Division Veterans Pilgrimage Association received &pound;1,000 towards the erection of their memorial in Normandy.</p>

  <p>In 2005-06 the Government provided funding totalling &pound;34,168.10 to Veterans Scotland for a series of commemorative celebrations marking the 60<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the end of World War II. In 2006-07 the Government contributed &pound;9,910.93 to the Dundee Combined Ex-Services Association for the inaugural National Veterans Day commemorations and this year has made up to &pound;5,000 available to the Association.</p>

  <p>In addition, in 2007-08 the Government&rsquo;s European Office agreed to a contribution of &pound;5,000 towards the commemorative events to take place in Zonnebeke, Belgium in August this year to mark the contribution of Scottish soldiers during the First World War.</p>

  <p>In addition, as part of their regular programme of repair and maintenance of historic monuments, Historic Scotland have carried out works and repairs during this period to the Scottish National War Memorial at Edinburgh Castle and to the Argyll and Sutherland Memorial at Stirling Castle totalling approximately &pound;70,000.</p>

  <p>Veterans&rsquo; issues, including commemorative events and paying for memorials, are a reserved matter for the Westminster Government and the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence. Consequently the Scottish Government has no dedicated budget for commemorative events or memorials. However, all requests for funding are considered on their own merits and in recent years the Scottish Government has made significant contributions to events commemorating Scottish veterans, including National Veterans Day and the commemoration of the 60 <sup>th</sup> anniversary of the end of the Second World War.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) and its agency Forest Enterprise Scotland are helping SNH and the Red Squirrels South Scotland project to develop and implement a response plan. FCS is helping to monitor the incidence of squirrelpox virus in the populations of grey and red squirrels in the affected area, and it has trained the project trappers and some private estate trappers to enable them to carry out grey squirrel control.</p>

  <p>FCS and the Executive&rsquo;s Rural Directorate have also proposed measures under the Scottish Rural Development Plan for new targeted grants for grey squirrel control to help red squirrel conservation.</p>
