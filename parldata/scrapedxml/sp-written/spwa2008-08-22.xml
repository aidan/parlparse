  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what percentage of GDP is invested in universities; how much this is in cash terms, broken down by (a) government funding and (b) other funding, and how this compares with other OECD countries.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-08-22.S3W-15189.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80330" speakername="Fiona Hyslop" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0822.htm#1">

  <p>There are various methods to calculate what percentage of GDP is invested in universities and in particular how &quot;public&quot; and &quot;private&quot; spending is defined and what is included in the calculation. This means that results may differ and will not be directly comparable with other countries. My officials are in discussions with the Scottish Funding Council and Universities Scotland regarding this matter.</p>

  <p>Using the latest data available, figures from the Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) show that higher education institutions (HEIs) in Scotland received monies from all sources totalling &pound;2.26 billion in 2006-07. This was split by government-related funding of &pound;1.47 billion, and other funding of &pound;0.79 billion.</p>

  <p>According to the Office for National Statistics, Scottish GDP (GVA at basic prices) in 2006 totalled &pound;91 billion. Therefore, spending on this basis on Scottish HEIs was 2.50 per cent of GDP.</p>

  <p>OECD data on a comparable basis are not currently available as their method for categorising different types of post-compulsory education is different to that used in Scotland. In addition, the methodology adopted by the OECD is unclear in terms of what they include as investment and how this is split between public and non-public.</p>

  <p>Using the same HESA data, Scotland compares favourably on a UK basis, with England, Wales and Northern Ireland spending less as a proportion of GDP at 1.8 per cent, 2.3 per cent and 1.7 per cent respectively. The data show that the comparable UK rate is 1.9 per cent.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not set a specific target for IM&amp;T expenditure but has committed to fund future growth in eHealth in the Strategic Spending Review. The national eHealth budget will progressively increase from under &pound;40 million in 2005-06 to a forecast &pound;140 million in 2010-11.

  <p>The functionality of SCI store has an important role in the eHealth strategy. SCI Store is a key product in the national eHealth Strategy. All territorial NHS boards and the Golden Jubilee National Hospital have implemented SCI Store. Implementation started in the lead board in 2001; the last board to implement did so from 2006. One board, NHS Tayside, has a compatible system to SCI store with integration links</p>

  <p>SCI Index is a working title for a project to replace the Community Health Index (CHI) technical infrastructure and improve the patient identification service. The eHealth strategy 2008-11, launched in June 2008, identifies the replacement of the CHI technology as a priority over the next three years. Work to date has been in the area of defining functional requirements and examining technical options. It is expected that the next stage of development will be commissioned by the end of 2008.</p>

  <p>- Procurement of Patient Management System (contract in place spring 2009, roll-out thereafter, live in three NHS Boards by 2011)</p>

  <p>- Complete the business case and take decisions around the proposed national HR system (by September 2008).</p>

  <p>The EDIS system is a nationally procured system which is available to all boards. The boards currently using the accident and emergency (A&amp;E) system (EDIS) are:</p>

  <p>Borders Dumfries and Galloway Forth Valley Grampian Greater Glasgow (North and Clyde) Highland Lanarkshire Shetland Western Isles</p>

  <p>The following NHS boards use an alternative A&amp;E system:</p>

  <p>Tayside uses Ascribe which has the same base functionality as EDIS and is integrated with local hospital systems and the SCI Store.</p>

  <p>Ayrshire and Arran uses Ascribe and are currently upgrading sites. The new system will have links to SCI Store for patient demographics and results.</p>

  <p>Fife uses Oasis which meets the core requirements of the national system and is fully integrated with local systems.</p>

  <p>Greater Glasgow (Yorkhill, Southern General, Victoria) uses HIS Meditech which has the same base functionality as EDIS and is integrated with local hospital systems and the SCI Store.</p>

  <p>Lothian uses a module of its Patient Management System (Trak Health) which is fully integrated with Lothian applications at all sites.</p>

  <p>Orkney is planning to use Adastra&rsquo;s out-of-hours system to support A&amp;E activity.</p>

Over 1,000 GPs (180 GP practices) have moved away from Gpass to a third party system over the last three years and a number of other practices have flagged their desire to move from Gpass.</p>
