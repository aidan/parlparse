  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, in the case of a transfer of engagements from a housing association which is not a charity to a housing association which is, tenants who held assured tenancies with the previous non-charitable association and who are now tenants of the charitable housing association will have a right to buy under the Housing (Scotland) Bill as passed by the Parliament.</p>

  <p>Section 61(4) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987 (as it will be amended by section 43(5) of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001) provides that section 61 of that Act (which gives the right to buy) does not apply where the registered social landlord (RSL) was, at Royal Assent of the Act, "a recognised body within the meaning of section 1(7) (Scottish charities) of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1990". We are currently considering what further provisions may be required in secondary legislation under the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 to protect any existing entitlement to the right to buy on the part of tenants whose houses are transferred to a registered social landlord which is exempt from the right to buy as a result of its charitable status.</p>

  <p>However, most assured tenancies of housing associations do not currently have the right to buy and, following commencement of the relevant provisions of the 2001 Act, they will in any event be subject to the operation of section 44 of the Act which provides for a 10-year exemption from the right to buy.</p>

  <p>The Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland encourages mental health agencies to ensure that people who use services, and their families and carers, receive the necessary support to enable them to participate effectively in planning their care. Access to relevant information, advice, advocacy and other support assists people to make informed decisions about their care.</p>

  <p><i>The Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland</i> provides a template for agencies designed to ensure that people who use services and their families and carers receive the necessary support to enable them to participate effectively in their own care. Access to relevant information, advice, advocacy and other support can all help informed decisions about individual care plans. This modernisation and responsive care agenda is continued in the forward programme of change and improvement set out in <i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change.</i></p>

  <p>How that change is delivered and how people who use services are kept involved and engaged with their own care planning requires joint working between the local authorities, the NHS and other relevant organisations. The Mental Health and Well Being Support Group will continue its review of agency progress with this modernisation agenda, including the user and carer dimension and will feed into the overall assessment and accountability process announced in <i>Our National Health</i>.</p>

  <p>The Executive will not approve new Water Orders or amendments to existing Water Orders for the abstraction of water for public water supplies unless the water authority can demonstrate that it has achieved the economic level of leakage for that supply. The Executive has no plans to set any targets for leakage reduction; it is considered that the overall drive for operational and capital efficiencies should provide the right incentives to achieve economic levels of leakage. <br /></p>
