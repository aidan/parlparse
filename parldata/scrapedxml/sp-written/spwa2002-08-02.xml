  <p>The number of dentists working in Scotland has increased constantly over the last 30 years and by 300 in the last eight years. We are committed to increasing numbers further. The Scottish Advisory Committee for the Dental Workforce (SACDW) advises on the most effective way to achieve this, and increasing the student intake is only one of the various options that the committee considers.</p>

  <p>SACDW increased dental student numbers in 2000, to set a target graduate output of 120 per annum. There are currently no plans for a further increase, though SACDW will consider issues of recruitment, retention and supply when it next meets on 23 August 2002.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has convened the meeting between the forestry industry and COSLA representatives to discuss timber transport and rural roads issues as agreed by the Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development on 30 May 2002 ( <i>Official Report</i> c 12540) and whether increased investment in rural roads is in the interests of the forestry industry.</p>

  <p>I understand that the Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development has written to COSLA regarding a meeting, but no date has been arranged as yet.</p>

  <p>On investment, the Executive's Scottish Forestry Strategy identifies the development of timber transport infrastructure as a priority for action. However, it remains a matter for councils to determine their priorities on the maintenance of local roads used by timber transport, in terms of all the resources for which they are responsible, and to allocate resources to individual projects accordingly.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the exercise of powers by local authorities to impose weight restrictions on roads may lead to areas of forest becoming isolated and whether any such action should be the subject of consultation with the Executive before it is taken.</p>

  <p>Decisions on the management of local roads, including the imposition of weight restrictions, are a matter for local authorities. Consultation with the Executive on individual cases would not be appropriate. Wider issues concerning transport infrastructure and access to forest areas are being taken forward by the Timber Transport Forum.</p>

  <p>The Executive is aware of difficulties which can arise where areas of forest can become isolated or landlocked. In such circumstances, local authorities work closely with the forestry industry to identify alternative haulage routes, wherever possible.</p>
