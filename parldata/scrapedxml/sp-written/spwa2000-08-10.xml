  <p>It is for the local authorities and health boards to decide how best to meet their statutory duties in relation to children&#8217;s health and education. The Executive has issued guidance and advice including the Special Educational Needs Manual of Good Practice. The Executive will also support the Scottish Society for Autism, and the National Autistic Society, in the creation of a national service network for autistic spectrum disorders, as recommended in the recently published Review of Learning Disability Services Report. The network will help to improve awareness and understanding of autism and provide access to specialist knowledge, expertise and training.</p>

  <p>An education authority has a statutory duty to establish which children or young persons in their area have pronounced, specific, or complex special educational needs which require continuing review. This duty applies to children of school age or who are at least two years of age and have come to the attention of the authority as having or appearing to have special educational needs. An authority is required to open and keep a Record of Needs for such children and young people.</p>

  <p>If an authority fails in its duty an individual can complain to Scottish Ministers under section 70 of the 1980 Act; or complain to the Local Government Ombudsman; or, if they have title and interest, take action through the courts by Judicial Review.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to building a Scotland in which every family is able to support itself and where every child has the best possible start in life.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to identify separately all funding which benefits families but specifically we have introduced targeted initiatives such as Sure Start Scotland which provides support for families with very young children. We have allocated funding of &pound;42 million over three years to this initiative, including &pound;9 million in 1999-2000 and &pound;14 million in 2000-01. We have allocated &pound;7 million in 1999-2000 and &pound;21 million in 2000-01 to developing a Childcare Strategy for Scotland and are committed to providing a free part-time nursery place for every three-year-old whose parents want it by 2002. We also provide funding to a number of voluntary organisations who support families.</p>

  <p>Families benefit from a range of Executive policies including those which address the needs of individual members of the family and the communities they live in. This Executive funding, and broader funding for relevant areas such as health, education, children&#8217;s services and lifelong learning, complements the support for families provided under policies of the Government.</p>

  <p>It is not correct that the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions announced a second GM crop trial at Daviot on 20 July 2000. An application to undertake the farm scale evaluation of genetically modified winter-grown oilseed rape in Scotland was lodged with the joint regulatory authority on 7 July 2000 and the Scottish Executive was made aware of the application at that time. In line with the requirements of the legislation, the application identified one location where the evaluation would take place and a public notice to this effect was placed in the Press &amp; Journal on 15 July. In the interests of openness, the joint regulatory authority also routinely place details of the location on the public website.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers will not consider the application until advice is received from our statutory scientific advisors, ACRE, which is expected shortly.</p>

  <p>It is a priority of the Scottish Executive to ensure that genetically modified crops and foods do not endanger human health or the environment. Before GM crops and foods can be approved for marketing or wider commercial use they must be rigorously assessed for safety.</p>

  <p>This is an issue with an international dimension and the rigorous regulatory regime which we have in place at European level is designed to protect human health and the environment while simultaneously providing a strategic framework for the development of GM technology. This technology could bring significant benefits; not least in the field of medical biotechnology, where Scottish science is in a leading position. However, the technology will only be given the opportunity to demonstrate its potential within the security which the science-based regulatory regime provides for us.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has still to receive the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority&#8217;s Full Business Case for the Larkhall to Milngavie Rail Route project. I understand this is now expected in September.

  <p>*for 1996-97 and 1997-98 the NoSWA and WoSWA chairmen&#8217;s salaries relate to two and a half days per week and ESWA&#8217;s to one and a half days per week. Since April 1998 all three relate to one and a half days per week.<br /></p>
