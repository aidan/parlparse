  <p>The Scottish Government has been working hand in hand with industry to gain concessions and minimise the impact of these rules being imposed by Europe. That is why we have already invested &pound;3 million in a large scale electronic research pilot aimed at finding workable and affordable systems for Scotland. The pilot, currently in phase two, is focussing on reducing costs, ensuring the use of critical control points in the most appropriate manner and assessing the options available towards the introduction of an individual animal database.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, we have also made funding available of up to &pound;1,000 per farmer under the SRDP Land Managers Options that will assist farmers with the cost of funding electronic reading equipment. We continue to work with the sector on all aspects of EID and explore all options available to help reduce the EID implementation challenge.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has had various discussions with farming organisations regarding financial support to assist farmers, in relation to the introduction of compulsory electronic sheep tagging. These discussions have taken place both during and prior to the public consultation, as well as being part of the Scottish electronic research pilot considerations. The Scottish Government is also currently considering correspondence received on this issue which were received as part of the formal consultation responses.</p>

  <p>We consider the introduction of a minimum price per unit of alcohol will have a positive effect on employment and the economy as a whole.</p>

  <p>The results of the modelling that was undertaken by the University of Sheffield on behalf of the Scottish Government shows that the introduction of a minimum price is estimated to lead to a reduction in workplace harms in the form of fewer days absence from work and fewer people unemployed.</p>

  <p>For a 40p minimum price, around 11,600 fewer days absence and around 800 fewer people unemployed.</p>

  <p>For a 50p minimum price, around 34,600 fewer days absence and around 1,700 fewer people unemployed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Grant Offer Letter to the Energy Saving Trust is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre (Bib. number 49351).</p>

  <p>It shows an agreed range of costs, of between &pound;5.26 million and &pound;5.80 million (average &pound;5.5 million), for the delivery of services to almost 100,000 homes by the scheme&rsquo;s managing agent.</p>

  <p>Direct local marketing started in October, after the grant offer letter issued. We can therefore update you that up to around &pound;700,000 has been earmarked within the local services costs for publicity material, local press advertising and website links and community events in each of the 10 separate areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has delivered significant improvements in broadband access throughout Scotland though various initiatives, including successful completion of the Broadband Reach Project in May 2009. The project has made available an affordable service to the (less than) 1% of the population previously unable to access broadband due to distance from the exchange. The project, which will continue (while funding remains) until March 2010, has delivered broadband to over 2,200 premises, including numerous land-based businesses in rural areas.</p>

  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s rural communities will thereafter benefit from &euro;2.9 million funding from the European Economic Recovery Package. The Scottish Government aims to ensure that all households and businesses in rural areas can access, as a minimum, a reliable basic broadband service.</p>

  <p>Funding will be made available to applicants for new or enhanced broadband infrastructure provision; it is anticipated that individuals or local communities will be invited to establish their service requirements and identify a provider prior to submitting a funding application. Discussions are ongoing between officials and others, including LEADER local action groups, to identify the most effective mechanism to deliver these benefits.</p>

  <p>Yes. Within Curriculum for Excellence progression up to the end of S3 will be through curriculum levels early, first, second, third and fourth, paving the way for work towards qualifications in the senior phase at the SCQF level appropriate to the needs and achievements of each young person. Learning will be assessed against the standards and expectations set out in the curriculum guidance and in line with the strategic vision for assessment published on 24 September. The levels are spaced in a way which will allow teachers to plan for greater depth, enrichment and consolidation of learning, ensuring well planned progression based on secure, well established learning. The expectations of learning at each level described within the curriculum guidance were signed off by the Curriculum for Excellence management board, which includes representatives from the Educational Institute of Scotland, School Leaders Scotland, Scottish Secondary Teachers&rsquo; Association, Association of Scotland&rsquo;s Colleges and the Association of Heads and Deputes in Scotland.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of local authorities, schools and headteachers to support the implementation of Curriculum for Excellence by identifying priorities and providing opportunities for parents to learn about the changes to the education system.</p>

  <p>We are also working with the local authority parental involvement network, parent councils and parent bodies, through seminars and newsletters, so that they have the information and advice they need to keep parents informed of the developments in Curriculum for Excellence. This will include a toolkit to support practitioners in the New Year.</p>

  <p>Learning and Teaching Scotland&rsquo;s Parents as Partners in Learning website has examples of good practice on how to tell parents what they need to know about the changes to their child&rsquo;s education:</p>

  <p>The UK Government, through HM Treasury, was fully involved in these discussions with the EC and both banks.

  <p>It is not possible to move funding from the European Fisheries Fund to the LEADER measure within the Scottish Rural Development Programme. The two funding streams are distinct and separate entities.</p>

  <p>We are currently redesigning the delivery of Axis IV in a way which is realistic to the levels of funding involved and which does not involve an overly bureaucratic process.

  <p>The current level of access for Icelandic vessels to EU waters and for EU vessels to Icelandic waters is regulated both by the bilateral agreement between the EU and Iceland and by coastal states agreements made under the auspices of the North-East Atlantic Fisheries Commission (NEAFC).</p>

  <p>The future level of reciprocal access by EU vessels to Icelandic waters and vice versa is a matter for consideration in the wider context of Icelandic accession negotiations, which remain at a very early stage. Within the framework of the Common Fisheries Policy, access to fisheries has historically been based on demonstration of a track record of fishing entitlement. Arrangements for granting fishing opportunities in the waters of any member state by another member state is decided on by the European Council of Ministers.</p>

  <p>With respect to whaling, all cetaceans (e.g. whales, dolphins and porpoises) are fully protected in EU waters. Iceland would normally be expected to adopt existing Community legislation upon accession (the &quot;Acquis Communautaire&quot;). Within the context of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), EU policy is to support the IWC moratorium on commercial whaling outwith Community waters. We would expect the EU to object to any possible request from Iceland for a derogation from the IWC moratorium.</p>

  <p>The stakeholders&rsquo; working group established to develop an accreditation scheme for property managers has met on a monthly basis since March 2009 and has made substantial progress, particularly in developing core standards, identifying effective options for third party redress and considering the potential for raising public awareness. This work has included ensuring that the core standards are applicable to land maintenance companies (including the land owning model).</p>

  <p>I have asked the working group to review the approach being taken in the light of information and evidence gathered to date, to ensure that it remains the most appropriate for achieving the desired objectives for the property management industry. This matter will be considered at the next meeting of the working group.</p>

  <p>The &pound;7.5 million allocation covers two financial years (2009-10 and 2010-11). We have made no payments to local authority areas, because we are funding activities which are either Scotland-wide or cover more than one authority area, rather than local projects. The Scottish Government is continuing discussions with COSLA and other key stakeholders on how to best utilise the remaining funding to implement the commitments set out in the framework.</p>

  <p>The following table illustrates the number of suspected drug finds recorded since <br /> 1 January 2005 to 23 November 2009 broken down per establishment. The SPS does not carry out analysis on substances found, and is not always advised of the outcomes of such analysis, it is, therefore not possible to provide information on the nature of the substance.</p>

  <p>As has been publicised, the intention is to begin to pay annual recurrent claims for Rural Priorities in early 2010, as soon as possible after the end of the scheme year. This in line with arrangements for previous agri-environment schemes, where such payments were also made after the end of the scheme year, which is January to December for Rural Priorities.</p>

  <p>The timing is also informed by the need to comply with European requirements for all inspections for land-based activities to be carried out before payments can be made.</p>

  <p>My officials will of course make every effort to ensure payments are made as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>Following on from my earlier announcement to Parliament (S3W-27721, answered on 28 September) I am pleased that all 32 councils will be benefiting from support for a school project as part of the first phase of the new school building programme. We have engaged with COSLA and individual councils to identify the 21 school projects and have used the same criteria for selection as were used for the first 14 secondary schools, based on information which councils have themselves provided. We have taken into account the distribution of needs throughout Scotland; the best available information about schools&rsquo; condition and unsuitability to deliver the curriculum for excellence; additionality; and authorities&rsquo; plans and priorities and readiness to proceed.</p>

  <p>All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what capital investment was made by the Scottish Agricultural College in its Thurso Disease Surveillance Centre in (a) 2008-09 and (b) 2009-10 and will be made in 2010-11; what work was or will be carried out in each case, and what proportion of the funding came or will come from the Scottish Government funding to the Scottish Agricultural College for its animal disease surveillance work.</p>
