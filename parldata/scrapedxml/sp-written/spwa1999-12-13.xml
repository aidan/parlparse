  <p>As I indicated in the debate on Older People on 2 December we are already taking forward many of the recommendations of the Royal Commission, for example on the Care Commission, joint working, carers and direct payments. I will be chairing a Joint Future Group involving CoSLA and the NHS to look, among other things, at the balance between residential and home-based care and at charging for personal care delivered at home. The needs of older people, including those funding their own care, will be a key issue to address during the Spending Review next year.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>The above Figures are compiled from 1998 data prepared by the Office for National Statistics <i>(Primary Production Mineral - Extraction in Great Britain - PA1007).</i> The figures show the number of persons employed directly and indirectly during the week ended 5 September 1998 (or in the nearest normal working week) who were subject to the provisions of the Mines and Quarries Acts 1954 and 1969.</p>

  <p>The table includes a Scottish total of 76 employed in peat extraction, 34 employed in ore and other minerals extraction, and 53 in extraction of clays and shale. The totals employed include drivers of internal and external haulage and other vehicles, and contractors employed in drilling, blasting and plant installation. The figures do not include employment associated with the coal industry.</p>

  <p>While the above figures relate to employment in all types of quarrying, not all material quarried will be subject to a potential aggregates tax.</p>

  <p>The latest figures available as at 30 September 1999, indicate that nine acute NHS Trusts are forecasting a year end deficit. It is not possible to present the information on a hospital by hospital basis as NHS Trusts are managed on an overall Trust basis and information on individual hospital units is not routinely collected.</p>

  <p>Those Trusts forecasting a deficit are being closely monitored and have been asked to consider how their financial position can be rectified as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to introduce such legislation.

  <p>The Executive believes that the time is now right to consider carefully whether the current procedures enable Ministers to meet fully and effectively the objectives of transparency and equal opportunities in post-devolution Scotland, and if not, what changes should be made. We are therefore planning to publish a wide-ranging consultation paper early in the New Year. The consultation paper will both provide detailed information about how the current system works, and invite views on the current system and on possible options for change.</p>

  <p>The consultation paper will in particular seek views on the following:</p>

  <p>should the Parliament be involved in appointments made by the Executive and if so at what stage and in what way? We are examining the experience in legislatures in other countries to see what lessons can be learned;</p>

  <p>whether a separate Scottish Commissioner for Public Appointments should be established &#8211; if so, what powers, responsibilities and reporting arrangements might he/she have?</p>

  <p>the role and appointment of independent assessors &#8211; including consideration of whether the composition of appointments panels should vary according to the nature/type of appointments;</p>

  <p>whether the targets inherited from the Scottish Office for achieving greater representation in public appointments are relevant; and</p>

  <p>more generally what more can be done to encourage women, disabled people and people from ethnic minorities to apply for public appointment?</p>

  <p>Any changes to the appointments system will affect large numbers of people across Scottish society. Arrangements will be put in hand therefore to ensure that the consultation exercise is widely publicised and that MSPs, public bodies and members of the public are able to make their views known before any final decisions on changes to the system are reached.</p>

  <p>The negotiation of International Trade Agreements, including World Trade Organisation talks is a reserved matter and consultations with interest groups, including industry, is a matter for the UK Parliament. The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with DTI on Trade issues and the WTO talks and how these may impact on the Executive&#8217;s responsibilities.</p>
