  <p>National planning policy on open space is set out in <em>National Planning Policy Guideline 11: Sport, Physical Recreation and Open Space</em> . This is currently under review and will shortly be replaced by <em>Scottish Planning Policy 11: Open Space and Physical Activity (SPP 11).</em></p>

  <p>Allotments can be of great value to the community and can create opportunities for local food production, physical activity, healthy eating and biodiversity. <em>SPP 11</em> recognises this and will require local authorities to take a strategic, long-term approach to managing open space, including allotments, within their areas, objectively assessing community needs and protecting open spaces which can help to meet those needs.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-2152 by Adam Ingram on 9 August 2007, whether it is confident that communication procedures between police, NHS boards and local authorities are now in place to enable them to share information on children at risk through exposure to drug misuse.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-11-08.10.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80331" speakername="Adam Ingram" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa1108.htm#6">

  <p>The guidance on inter-agency co-operation <em>Protecting Children: A Shared Responsibility</em> (1998: paras 2.14-24), the <em>Framework for Standards</em> (2004: Standard 4), and the <em>Guidance for Child Protection Committees</em> <em>(2005: section 3:12</em> ) set out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s requirements on agencies to establish and maintain suitable communications procedures for sharing information about children at risk.</p>

  <p>The government&rsquo;s confidence in how well this is being done is founded principally on two evidence bases. The first is that Child Protection Committees are required to prepare and submit to the Scottish Government their Annual Reports which feed into local Integrated Children&rsquo;s Service Plans. On a routine basis, we expect these reports to evidence developments in joint working and information sharing.</p>

  <p>The second and more focused source of evidence is provided by the Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education-led joint inspection of child protection services across Scotland. Nine joint inspection reports (out of 30) have so far been published. The scoring for the indicator &quot;information-sharing and recording&quot; shows that eight of those nine reports rate well under this measure - six are scored as &quot;good&quot;, two as &quot;adequate&quot; and one as &quot;weak&quot;.</p>

  <p>Based on this evidence, the Scottish Government is broadly confident that inter-agency communication procedures are in place and working adequately well, although there is continued scope for improvement in this area. That is why the government has recently sought a wide range of views on a draft <em>Code of Practice for Sharing Information</em> when there are concerns about a child. The 87 responses are currently being analysed and will inform a redrafting of the code in coming months.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3W-5455 on 8 November 2007. This highlights the requirements for effective information-sharing set out by the Scottish Government in guidance, the sources of evidence used by the government to assess the extent to which those requirements are being delivered in practice and refers to work on a draft <em>Code of Practice for Sharing Information</em> when there are concerns about a child.</p>

It should be noted that figures are published only for those Youth Music Initiative projects which are delivered to the target group. These do not include, for example, attendances at Youth Music Initiative projects which are aimed at older children.

  <p>1. Based on patients whose registration status indicated &quot;withdrawn&quot; between the dates considered. This occurs when there is a request for the registration record to be withdrawn (made usually by the dentist, and subsequently approved by the NHS board). The numbers also include withdrawals carried out where more than one active registration exists for the same patient as part of data cleansing. Some patients whose registration has been withdrawn may register with another NHS dentist elsewhere. There may also be retrospective additions to these data.</p>

  <p>2. If a patient has been withdrawn from more than one dental practice, they will be counted each time this happens. It is also possible for a patient to be counted in more than one NHS board if they have moved to a dentist in a different NHS board area and have been withdrawn from practices in each NHS board where they have received NHS general dental services.</p>

  <p>Tackling domestic abuse is a priority for the Scottish Government and we have worked closely with our staff networks, trades unions and internal and external partners to raise awareness of the issue and to create and implement an effective domestic violence policy.</p>

  <p>We will publish our policy for staff during the week commencing 26 November 2007, to coincide with National Domestic Violence Week. It will provide guidance for both staff and managers in identifying and dealing with domestic violence and will also signpost internal and external support organisations that can help those who have experienced, or are experiencing, domestic abuse.</p>

  <p>In addition, key staff within our Human Resources function have been trained in identifying domestic abuse and providing support for staff and line managers.</p>

  <p>Since May 2007 I have actively redeployed resources already allocated to the budget for Education and Lifelong Learning in order to both align expenditure with the government&rsquo;s priorities and to better serve the people of Scotland. Examples include funding for an extra 300 teachers in our schools and 250 teacher training places and &pound;40 million of additional investment in the fabric of Scotland&rsquo;s schools.</p>

  <p>There has been one addition to the budget since May 2007: the extra &pound;100 million of capital funding for universities and colleges across Scotland announced on 26 October 2007.</p>

  <p>I wrote to the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs on 27 September 2007 explaining the urgent need for a sheep welfare scheme and reiterating our view that it should be funded by the UK Government. The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth wrote to the Chief Secretary to the Treasury on 24 October 2007 with details of the full &pound;25 million package that I announced in Parliament that day. The letter stated that financial support from the UK Government would be appropriate to address the specific issues which emerged from the Pirbright outbreak of foot and mouth disease.

  <p>While we have considerable sympathy with the case put forward by NFU Scotland requesting funding for Scottish farmers following the recent outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease, it does not fully reflect recent developments (such as the reopening of export markets and availability of Private Storage Aids for pig meat). We discussed the matter of compensation with the NFU Scotland and the wider industry, taking into account NFU Scotland estimates of need. We also took account of funding available to the Scottish Government. The package of measures that I announced on 24 October 2007 provides immediate relief to those most hard pressed as a result of foot-and-mouth disease while supporting the long term viability of the industry.</p>

  <p>The numbers of officers deployed on community policing is an operational matter for Chief Constables, and may vary due to other daily policing challenges. The Scottish Government is committed to working with Chief Constables and Joint Police Boards to deliver 1,000 additional officers into our communities through increased recruitment of officers; redeployment of officers to front line tasks, and improved retention of skilled and experienced officers. Our aim is to ensure that every community in Scotland has a clear understanding of the levels of visible, identifiable and accessible policing they have a right to expect; how communities will know whether those levels are being met, and how communities&rsquo; views will be taken into account in setting policing priorities.</p>

  <p>Under the tripartite arrangement for the accountability for the police service in Scotland, Scottish ministers retain overall responsibility for setting strategic priorities and national policing policy. Police authorities are responsible for securing the maintenance of an efficient and effective police force, overseeing the work of the chief constable and holding him/her to account for the policing of the force area. Chief constables are responsible for the enforcement of the law and for operational aspects of policing in their force area.</p>

  <p>There are currently no plans to change these responsibilities.</p>

  <p>The full programme of improvements proposed to rail travel between Edinburgh and Glasgow is anticipated to cost between &pound;500 and &pound;1,000 million in 2006 prices, as set out in the STAG report <em>Strategic Transport Projects Review &ndash; Edinburgh to Glasgow Improvements, </em> which can be found on the Transport Scotland website at <a href="http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk">www.transportscotland.gov.uk</a> . Within this total, the cost of providing the Dalmeny chord and a new station at Gogar linked to the tram network (as an alternative to the EARL project) is estimated at around &pound;200 million.</p>

  <p>Further design and development work will now be undertaken to define particular work structures necessary for delivery of the programme.</p>

  <p>The reply to question S3W-5455 on 8 November 2007 sets out the requirements on child protection agencies for effective information-sharing set out by the Scottish Government in guidance documents since 1998 and refers to work on a draft <em>Code of Practice for Sharing Information</em> when there are concerns about a child.</p>

  <p>Between September 2005 and March 2007, the Scottish Government has made available over 2,500 training places under Children at the Centre &ndash; a national training programme for social workers in child care and protection. An evaluation of the effectiveness of this programme and consideration of next steps is under discussion.</p>
