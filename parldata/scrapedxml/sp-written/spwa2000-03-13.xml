  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S1W-3702 and S1W-3706 by Henry McLeish on 27 January 2000, how the &pound;12 million Business Growth Fund will be administered, whether copies of the application forms will be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, whether Local Enterprise Companies (LECs) will have total responsibility for determining applications and whether not giving LECs total responsibility will result in unnecessary delay and bureaucracy in applications to the fund.</p>

  <p>The Business Growth Fund is administered by Scottish Enterprise (SEn) and Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE). Copies of the application forms for the fund have been placed with SPICe although any applicant should be encouraged to discuss the fund with their local LEC in the first instance. The LEC will be able to provide scheme details, as well as general advice on applying. Final decisions are taken centrally by SEn and HIE, taking account of advice from the LEC dealing with each application. This ensures a consistent approach in delivering this national programme across the SEn and HIE areas.</p>

  <p>The Treasury have made, and laid before the UK Parliament, The Scotland Act (Designation of Receipts) Order 2000 (SI 2000/687). This Order replicates the current position as set out in article 8 of The Scotland Act 1998 (Transitory and Transitional Provisions) (Finance) Order 1999 (SI 1999/441). This, in turn, reflects the position that applied prior to devolution and the funds in question do not form and have never formed part of Scotland&#8217;s assigned budget.</p>

  <p>The report of the Audit Committee of the Scottish Parliament, <i>Scottish Further Education Colleges: Managing Costs</i> , which was published on 9 February, identified 13 colleges with particular financial health problems.</p>

  <p>The report also summarises the status of the recovery plan for each of the 13 colleges. The components of these plans are specific to the circumstances of each college and reflect realistic options to address the college&#8217;s future income and expenditure profiles in order to eliminate the deficit and restore financial health. The plans have to be agreed with the Scottish Further Education Funding Council but their implementation is the responsibility of the college Board of Management.</p>

  <p>Another measure, which will assist colleges with large deficits to address their problems, is a review of management within the further education sector. The Funding Council expects to report to Scottish Ministers by May with recommendations on what range and mix of management skills will best serve colleges, and how the best management practice can become the norm.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Land Fund, which is an initiative established within the Lottery funding channelled through the New Opportunities Fund and unrelated to the National Heritage Memorial Fund, will complement new land reform legislation by contributing to funding for land purchase by rural communities, in addition to providing funding for feasibility studies and for community land management and development projects and community-based business and management training and support. It is, therefore, not a suitable vehicle for funding retiral schemes. Accordingly I will not be making any proposals for such modifications to the directions to the New Opportunities Fund in respect of the Scottish Land Fund. Directions in respect of initiatives which apply only in Scotland would be a matter for the Scottish Executive, subject to the agreement of Her Majesty&#8217;s Government.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Police College does not operate an exchange training programme. Officers, mostly at Chief Inspector/Superintendent rank or equivalent are accepted by the college for training but no Scottish police officers are trained in other countries. Human rights matters are to the fore in all such training.</p>

  <p>The college has an agreement with Germany and Western Australia to offer training to their police officers. Additionally, in the last two years, the college has provided training, on request and at cost, to officers from Hong Kong, Zimbabwe, Bermuda, Holland and China.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not hold the information requested. The Larkhall to Milngavie project is the responsibility of Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority as the public transport body for the area.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-2858 by Sarah Boyack on 12 January 2000, when and by whom the decision to abandon the Crossrail project was made; whether it made a unilateral decision to withdraw its support from Crossrail, and whether it has advised the promoters of Crossrail, including Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive, of its decision.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that a feasibility study on Glasgow Cross Rail was completed in 1995 by Railtrack on behalf of Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority. I understand it is still being evaluated by the authority. The Scottish Executive has made no unilateral decision to withdraw its support from the project since its support has never been sought.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">(a) what is the definition of a trunk road and what attributes a road must have to be classified as a trunk road; (b) what trunk road route or routes there are to the north from Edinburgh and the Lothians; (c) why the whole of the A9 is a trunk road with exception of the Cramond Brig to the Forth Road Bridge and the Forth Road Bridge to Rosyth, A985 turn off; (d) why the A8000 does not qualify as a trunk road being used by east coast traffic; (e) why no trunk roads are connected to the original toll bridges, including the Forth Road, Tay and Erskine Bridges, although these bridges are used as trunk routes and (f) why the A8000 is not receiving national funding for its upgrading.</a></p>

  <p><i>Shaping the Trunk Road Network</i> , a consultation paper published by the then Scottish Office Transport Minister in 1994, identified the following criteria for determining a trunk road:</p>

  <p>provide the road user with a coherent and continuous system of routes which serve destinations of importance to industry, commerce, agriculture and tourism;</p>

  <p>define nationally important routes which will be developed in line with strategic national transport demands; and</p>

  <p>ensure that these roads which are of predominantly local importance are managed locally.</p>

  <p>Neither these criteria nor the network established from 1 April 1996, following the consultation, have been reviewed subsequently. This means that:</p>

  <p>the M9/A8 route provides the trunk road connection from Edinburgh and the Lothians to the north. There are other trunk road links from this route to areas such as the Western Highlands and the north-east;</p>

  <p>the trunk road section of the M90/A90 to the north-east starts at the commencement of the motorway to the north of the Forth Road Bridge;</p>

  <p>the A90 between this point and the Cramond Bridge, the Forth Road Bridge, the Tay Bridge and the A8000 remain part of the local network; and</p>

  <p>the Erskine Bridge forms an integral part of the trunk road linking the M8 to the A82 across the Clyde Estuary. As to funding any upgrading of the A8000, I refer to my answer of 10 December to Mrs Margaret Smith (S1W-2528).</p>
