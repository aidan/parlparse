In this context, we will take stock of current provision before taking a view on individual geographical areas and we will also consider these issues within the context of the Skills Strategy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish government provides a number of funds which support what might be called &quot;community investment&quot; around Scotland. The largest of these is the Community Regeneration Fund, &pound;108 million in 2007-08, which is allocated to Community Planning Partnerships (CPP). Each partnership appoints an &quot;accountable body&quot; to receive the grant and ensure that funding is used in line with the terms and conditions. These are available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/webgraphics/finalcrftermsandconditions.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/webgraphics/finalcrftermsandconditions.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>A national Performance Management Framework (PMF) provides the basis for monitoring and auditing success against each CPP&rsquo;s Regeneration Outcome Agreement. These agreements set out how the CRF, other relevant funding streams and the related resources of partners will be used to achieve specific outcome targets for the most disadvantaged communities. The core element of the PMF is an annual report from each CPP focusing on outcomes, key performance indicators, equalities information and community engagement. A copy of the PMF is available at</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/webpages/cs_010595.hcsp#TopOfPage" target="_blank">http://www.communitiesscotland.gov.uk/stellent/groups/public/documents/webpages/cs_010595.hcsp#TopOfPage</a>.</p>

  <p>More broadly, Audit Scotland ensures that all organisations who spend public money in Scotland use it properly, efficiently and effectively. It does this by carrying out financial audits which check how local authorities and public bodies manage their finances and funding programmes to the highest standards and how they achieve the best possible value for public money. In addition, a rolling programme of Best Value audits ensure that the duty of local authorities to secure continuous improvement, which is set out in the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003, is monitored and reported on.</p>

  <p>If the member wishes more detailed or specific information on particular funding streams I would be happy to provide it.</p>

  <p>The abuse suffered by children and young people in Kerelaw over such a lengthy period should not have happened and the Government is determined to learn the lessons from this dreadful situation.</p>

  <p>I have taken the following actions to respond to the Glasgow review of its management of Kerelaw School.</p>

  <p>A letter will be issued this week to all providers of residential care, local authorities and independent bodies, reminding them of their obligations, both for the protection of children in their care and for the provision of effective measures to enable children to make complaints safely.</p>

  <p>Local authorities will also be reminded of their responsibilities as corporate parent to ensure that the children who they place in these establishments are cared for and supported effectively and that children feel safe to report any concerns. Similarly, in their role as commissioners of residential services, they will be reminded of their responsibility to satisfy themselves fully that the establishments where they place children are safe.</p>

  <p>I will meet with Glasgow City Council to discuss its report in more detail.</p>

  <p>I will write to all regulatory bodies asking them to identify what further measures they need to put in place to ensure that the current inspection and regulatory regime can identify and respond to concerns of abuse quickly.</p>

  <p>I will meet with residential providers, the Association of Directors of Social Work and others to identify what further improvements may be needed to protect children from abuse in residential care.</p>

  <p>In addition to these measures, by September 2007 I will have received the independent report of the in-care historic abuse systemic review 1950-95. I will then consider what further action is required to ensure a comprehensive approach.</p>

  <p>Freight and livestock tariffs are charged on the basis of the lane meterage used per journey and the agreement between Scottish ministers and NorthLink Ferries Ltd provides for annual index linked increases to those tariffs. The charge per head of livestock shipped will depend on how effectively the container space is used. As the new system will incorporate provision for some &quot;double decking&quot;, average charges per head should fall, again assuming that container space is used effectively.</p>

  <p>The core local government finance settlement is distributed using a needs-based formula that takes account of the circumstances of each local authority. The main reasons for the differences in the shares of funding between Orkney Islands Council and Eilean Siar and Shetland Islands Councils can be attributed to the level of funding to support debt, their allocations of Special Islands Needs Allowance and the effects of the &quot;floor&quot; which guarantees a minimum year-on-year increase in grant. The allocations attributable to expenditure-based service assessments, such as ferries and planning, also contribute to some of the difference in funding levels.</p>

  <p>The funding differential remained constant between 1999-2000 and 2005-06, although the gap has narrowed slightly in the last two years.</p>

  <p>The distribution methodology is kept under constant review and this will inevitably have some effect on each council&rsquo;s share of future funding allocations. The four areas identified above, for example, are all being reviewed as part of this work and any changes will be implemented in time for the next local government finance settlement.</p>

  <p>Development plans are drawn up in consultation with infrastructure providers.

The act provides a new framework which will help to deliver up-to-date, relevant development plans. The new provisions include action programmes for the implementation of the policies and proposals within each plan, to be delivered where appropriate in conjunction with developers, and enhanced performance management of the development planning system. The provisions of the act are expected to come into force in autumn 2008, following the preparation of related secondary legislation.</p>

  <p>At a national level the National Planning Framework (NPF) sets out a strategy for Scotland's long-term spatial development and identifies key strategic infrastructure needs so that we can plan for the right investment in the right places.

  <p>The provision of local bus services is a matter for bus operators and local transport authorities. Beyond the commercial decisions of individual operators, it is the responsibility of the relevant transport authority to identify where there is a need for socially necessary bus services and to subsidise these at its discretion. The Scottish Executive provides funding to local authorities through Grant Aided Expenditure arrangements to support socially necessary bus services. In 2007-08 this amounts to &pound;29.1 million for all local authority areas, of which &pound;3.325 million was allocated to Glasgow City Council.</p>

  <p>There is no specific review planned for the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route. We have asked Transport Scotland to examine it as part of a review of all strategic transport projects. We continue to monitor all projects to ensure proper financial control and management as well as to deliver value for money for Scottish taxpayers. That is all part of the normal natural and necessary business of good Government.</p>

  <p>The Spending Review is on-going and as a part of this we will establish the detail of our efficiency programme for 2008-11; this will include the setting of baselines for the programme. We will expect public services across Scotland to deliver cash-releasing recurrent efficiency gains of at least 1.5% per annum across that period.</p>
