  <p>The Scottish Government welcomes the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007 and we are now focused on working closely with the UK Government to support its successful implementation in Scotland. We consider that this legislation addresses the identification problem identified by the Transco case. It also sends a robust message to organisations that failures to meet their duty of care to employees and the public will not be tolerated.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive currently funds Repect<em>me</em>, the national anti-bullying service for Scotland. One of Respect<em>me</em>&rsquo;s main objectives is to look at all forms of bullying including new forms of text and cyber bullying. The service already has guidance for practitioners and parents on cyber bullying. This year&rsquo;s national anti-bullying competition will raise awareness of these forms of bullying.

  <p>The Accountant in Bankruptcy maintains the Register of Insolvencies in Scotland. Details of bankruptcies and Protected Trust Deeds are compiled by financial year. Partnerships and other unincorporated associations, which are declared bankrupt in Scotland, are registered as personal bankruptcies under Scottish law. Figures on these are not available separately from other personal bankruptcies.</p>

  <p>The Accountant in Bankruptcy maintains the Debt Arrangement Scheme Register which records the number of approved debt payment programmes made under The Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Act 2002, which came into force on 30 November 2004.</p>

  <p>The following table gives the number of bankruptcies and Protected Trust Deeds for the financial years 1999-2000 to 2006-07 and the number of debt payment programmes from 30 November 2004.</p>

  <p>Details of the age of the debtor are not required as part of the registration process for Trust Deeds, therefore, a breakdown by age is not available for Protected Trust Deeds registered in Scotland since 1999.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of bankruptcies, broken down by the debtor&rsquo;s age at the date they became bankrupt, in each year since 2002-03. The information requested on bankruptcies registered between 1999 and 2002 could only be obtained at a disproportionate cost as the debtor&rsquo;s age is held only on a case by case basis.</p>

  <p>The age of the debtor is not held for every case as it is not required for the Register of Insolvencies. Information is only recorded where the Accountant in Bankruptcy is the trustee and the debtor has provided their date of birth. Partnerships and other unincorporated associations that are registered bankrupt will not have an age classification.</p>

  <p>Details of the current position on the reviews of antisocial behaviour strategy and community sentences are set out in the following table. We propose that the review on retention of DNA will consider options for enhancing the operational effectiveness of provisions governing the destruction of DNA data in specific circumstances.

  <p>Education authorities are responsible for provision of school transport and for setting the terms and conditions of any contracts to provide school buses. It is for authorities themselves to monitor contract performance, assisted as appropriate by the police and the Vehicle and Operator Services Agency where the roadworthiness and safety of the vehicles, in compliance with road traffic legislation, are concerned.</p>

  <p>The Cabinet Secretary for Justice has overall lead responsibility for the co-ordination of the government&rsquo;s drive to tackle sectarianism in Scotland. Individual Cabinet Secretaries retain responsibility for the initiatives which are being taken forward in relation to their own portfolio areas.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive takes the issue of religious intolerance very seriously and is committed to achieving a Scotland free from bigotry, intolerance and religious discrimination. Working at both government and community level we will engage with all faith communities to build forums for positive engagement and ensure that needs of the diverse minority communities which make up modern Scotland are being heard and understood.</p>

  <p>The law in relation to child sex offenders is kept under review as part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s sex offender strategy, and we will continue to take whatever further steps are necessary and appropriate to improve public protection.</p>

  <p>Scotland has developed a coherent framework of legal measures, initiatives and programmes to improve the monitoring and management of sex offenders, to enhance public protection and community safety - particularly for our children.</p>

  <p>We now have a strong commitment across Parliament to protect our communities from sex offenders. That work has been assisted by a range of experts including Professor Irving and more recently the Justice 2 Sub-Committee.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Law Commission is currently undertaking a review of the law on rape and sexual offences in Scotland, including sexual offences against children. The commission is expected to submit its final report to the Scottish ministers later this year. We will determine how best to take forward the Scottish Law Commission&rsquo;s work when we receive their report and draft bill.</p>
