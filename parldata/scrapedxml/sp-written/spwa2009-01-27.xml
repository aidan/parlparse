  <p>The Scottish Government published guidance for commissioners of health and social care services in 2008 recommending that local authorities and health boards should work together to identify and keep a record of people on the autism spectrum in their area. The eSAY project has been developed to ensure information about people with learning disabilities or autism spectrum disorders is recorded and measured in the same way across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The cost of the council tax freeze in 2008-09 is &pound;70 million. A further &pound;70 million is available in each of the next two years to extend the freeze up to 2010-11. The total cost of the council tax freeze over the full spending review period will depend on the decisions of individual councils.</p>

  <p>The projected cost of the Small Business Bonus Scheme in 2008-09 is currently estimated to be around &pound;70 million. A final figure will not be available until later this year. The total cost of the scheme over the full spending review period will not be known until after the end of the period.</p>

  <p>I have to advise that I am not in a position to interpret the legislation that covers Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) in Scotland. Interpretation in the first instance is the responsibility of the local authorities and ultimately could be a matter for the courts to decide. I am in a position to provide informal advice on the intention behind the legislation and my response should be viewed with that in mind.</p>

  <p>The Energy Performance of Buildings (Scotland) Regulations 2008 require an EPC for the building and reference a definition. The definition of building is the same as in the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2002/91/EC), as &quot;a roofed construction having walls, for which energy is used to condition the indoor climate; a building may refer to the building as a whole or parts thereof that have been designed or altered to be used separately.&quot;</p>

  <p>EPCs are required for all individual dwellings. In the case of other buildings, the EPC covers the entire building. However, where the building is divided into units that are &quot;fire separated&quot; units, the EPC can either cover the entire building, depending on the heating system arrangements, or, alternatively, separate certificates can be carried out for each individual unit. In some instances, the fire separated units could be single rooms which are occupied by different tenants.</p>

Interpretation in the first instance is the responsibility of the local authorities and ultimately could be a matter for the courts to decide. I am in a position to provide informal advice on the intention behind the legislation and my response should be viewed with that in mind.</p>

  <p>Due to the disparate nature of the public building stock in Scotland, it is not possible to provide a definitive list of exemptions. The Energy Performance of Building (Scotland) Regulations 2008 define a public building as &quot;a building with a floor area of more than 1,000m<sup>2</sup>, which is occupied by a public authority or by an institution providing public services and which can be visited by the public.&quot; Guidance on the requirement to display an EPC is given as:</p>

  <p>The requirement to display a certificate applies only to buildings which meet all of the following criteria:</p>

  <p>the conditioned (heated/cooled) area of the building is over 1,000m<sup>2</sup>;</p>

  <p>the building is occupied by public authorities or provides public services to a large number of persons;</p>

  <p>the building is frequently visited, at least weekly, by members of the general public;</p>

  <p>the public have a right of access to the building, or parts of the buildings providing services directly to the public, and</p>

  <p>public funding, including part funding, is used to operate, for general upkeep, or to fund staff costs.</p>

  <p>Examples include colleges, community centres, libraries, hospitals, benefit offices and crematoria.</p>

  <p>Evidence is being gathered, including from discussions with a range of stakeholders, on the practicality, cost and impacts of different insulation and energy efficiency measures for different types of housing. This will inform ministers&rsquo; choice of the measures to be included initially in the Energy Assistance Package, likely to be finalised around the end of February.

  <p>We announced in November that &pound;55.8 million will be available for delivering the Energy Assistance Package for 2009-10, and in the Budget Bill in January that an additional &pound;5 million will be allocated to tackling fuel poverty.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-18203 by Stewart Maxwell on 3 December 2008, whether a decision has been made on including the issue of top-up funding, low interest loans or equity release schemes, as a way to augment the Energy Assistance Package in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s forthcoming consultation of issues related to the energy efficiency of housing and when it expects to launch the consultation.</p>

  <p>The issue of loans or equity release schemes goes wider than the Energy Assistance Package and involves a number of issues requiring detailed consideration. Thought is being given to how best to proceed in time for the forthcoming consultation. The consultation paper will be published later in the year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-18994 by Fiona Hyslop on 8 January 2009, how much discretionary funding was returned to Student Awards Agency for Scotland for redistribution in each of the last five years, broken down by institution.</p>

  <p>The following table lists the funds returned each year by each institution. Information for year 2007-08 is still in the process of being gathered and will be available at the end of February.</p>

  <p>As stated in the answer to question S3W-18994 on 8 January 2009, these returned funds are then redistributed on the basis of application from institutions in the following academic year.</p>

  <p>The returned funds have been re-distributed each year from 2005-06. For example, funds returned for 2005-06 are made available to institutions in 2006-07 as additional funding. Institutions are required to make requests for this additional funding.</p>

  <p>Prior to 2005-06, any returned funds resulted in an underspend against allocation.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what recourse to arbitration or appeal permanent residents of caravans and chalets located on holiday-home sites with 12-month licences have against increases in pitch fees.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-01-27.S3W-19917.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80349" speakername="Stewart Maxwell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0127.htm#7">

  <p>The rights of permanent residents of sites with residential licences, which can include holiday-home sites, are governed by the Mobile Homes Act 1983. This allows mobile home owners to have an agreement with the site owner allowing them to occupy their home on the site as their main residence. A site owner must give each resident a written statement setting out the terms of the agreement between them. The agreement will normally include express terms which fix the pitch fee the resident has to pay the site owner, when it is to be paid and how it is to be reviewed each year.</p>

  <p>A resident who is unhappy with an increase in pitch fees should ask the site owner if they are prepared to make changes to that part of the agreement. If the site owner refuses, the resident can apply to the sheriff court, or to an arbiter, to ask for the changes to be made. In addition, residents who are in dispute with site owners who are members of either of the relevant trade bodies representing the parks industry &ndash; the British Holiday and Home Parks Association and the National Caravan Council &ndash; can seek conciliation from either body. If this fails the trade bodies may suggest reference to the Independent Consumer Redress Service (ICRS) which is an independent mediation or arbitration process allowing access to low cost and speedy consumer redress using standard models of conciliation and arbitration.</p>

  <p>The 1983 act does not apply to sites which have a licence for holiday use only. This means that people who live on such sites, even if occupying a caravan or mobile home as their main residence in breach of a site&rsquo;s licence or planning permission, do not have the statutory protection of the act. People who rent pitches on holiday sites for accommodation rather than leisure purposes will have certain rights under common law. However, common law does not impose any restrictions on the amount of rent the site owner can charge for the mobile home and/or pitch, or restrict how often the site owner can increase these charges.</p>

  <p>A holiday caravan owner&rsquo;s rights will be contained within a licence agreement agreed with the site owner. The trade bodies have also agreed a joint code of practice for holiday homes, which covers pitch fees and offers a complaints procedure for objecting to increases. If complaints arise that cannot be resolved between the parties then the trade bodies will offer conciliation and if this fails suggest reference to the ICRS.</p>

  <p>As part of the concordat between the Scottish Government and COSLA, it was agreed that the Improvement Service would be governed wholly by local government, through COSLA and SOLACE. Scottish ministers resigned from membership of the Improvement Service company in March 2008. Information on board meetings since that date is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Student Loans Company (SLC) cannot distinguish whether a student enters repayment of their loan because they have graduated or because they have left higher education (HE) without graduating. The table below therefore shows the average student loan debt for Scottish domiciled full-time higher education leavers from institutions in the Lothians Scottish parliamentary region. The figures do not include debt added by the graduate endowment fee. On average around two thirds of students who were liable for the graduate endowment fee would add all or part of their fee to these figures.</p>
