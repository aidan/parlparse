  <p>Patient satisfaction depends primarily on the quality of care they receive. The Executive has introduced a system of standards, including those for cleaning services and hospital food, designed to ensure that patients receive a high quality service throughout the NHS in Scotland. The Clinical Standards Board for Scotland will monitor the achievement of these standards, but surveys of patient or user views will continue to be important.</p>

  <p>The <i>Patient Focus and Public Involvement</i> framework, which I launched in December, indicated that the Executive will shortly be publishing guidance to the NHS on the use of surveys. This guidance will provide information on current practice, identify key features of effective surveys and suggest ways the NHS can improve the value of surveys.</p>

  <p>An on-going national audit of hip fracture patients, provides regular feed back to participating centres and to annual professional meetings. An annual report is to be published within the next two months. This will be linked with the evidence based SIGN Guideline on the prevention and management of hip fracture in older people which was published in January 2002.</p>

  <p>CRAG Clinical Outcome Indicators will be published in May 2002. These will include survival rates for 30 days and for 120 days after admission for hip fracture for every trust in Scotland (as defined before reorganisation on 1 April 1999). Complete trend data for every year from 1991 to 2000 will be presented.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Trauma Audit Group (STAG) also collects data on all major trauma cases including orthopaedic trauma. This is fed back to local teams, but is not published.</p>

  <p>There are no national audits into the provision of orthopaedic services, but the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (CSBS) has accepted that the management of fractured hip is a tracer condition for the provision of acute services to older people. CSBS will be monitoring all Scottish acute services for older people later this year and will publish their report in 2003.</p>

  <p>Candidates to become justices of the peace are nominated to ministers by local Justice of the Peace Advisory Committees (JPACs). JPACs are required to ensure firstly, that candidates are personally suitable in terms of character, integrity and understanding. They are also encouraged to nominate candidates from across the spectrum, so that the body of justices in the area is broadly representative of all sections of the community which they serve.</p>

  <p>The role and function of justices is to be considered as part of the wide-ranging review of summary justice being conducted by an independent committee chaired by Sheriff Principal McInnes:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/summaryjusticereview/" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/summaryjusticereview</a>.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to alter the current system of appointments until the committee has submitted its recommendations to ministers, but I have no doubt the committee will welcome any comments on current appointment arrangements.</p>

  <p>These estimates were produced from the results of the International Passenger Survey. This involves interviews with about 0.2% of travellers, so some of the apparent year-to-year fluctuations may be due to sampling variability. Those who took more than one package holiday would be counted once for each visit abroad.</p>
