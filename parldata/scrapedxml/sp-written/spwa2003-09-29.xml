  <p>There was no Scottish Executive budget for developing credit union activity prior to 2001. Since 2001-02, the Executive has provided financial support for credit unions, through implementation of the credit union Action Plan, Unlocking the Potential. Spending under this programme totalled &#163;458,000 in 2001-02, and &#163;193,000 in 2002-03.</p>

  <p>As I announced on 3 September 2003 in an answer to a written question S2W-2332, the Executive is allocating &#163;400,000 to support credit unions in 2003-04, and &#163;500,000 per annum in each of 2004-05 and 2005-06.

  <p>The marketing campaign to generate awareness of the implementation of the Dog Fouling (Scotland) Act 2003 will begin on 16 October and run for approximately two weeks.</p>

  <p>The first stage of the campaign will comprise the placing of advertisements in regional and national press and over 100 local newspapers, which will alert people to the change in legislation. The advertising activity will be supported by other marketing activity to generate further media coverage and public awareness.</p>

  <p>Campaign messages will also be broadcast by Scottish Radio Holdings&#8217; stations on all of their AM and FM stations across Scotland, starting on the day of the launch and running for five days.</p>

  <p>We are also working closely with local authorities to ensure that the message is distributed widely in all localities across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The budget for the advertising element of the campaign has been reduced from the previously announced &#163;100,000 to &#163;82,000 as a result of the review of Scottish Executive advertising expenditure, which I announced in August of 2002.</p>

  <p>Japanese knotweed is listed in Schedule 9 to the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. It is therefore an offence under the act to release the species into the wild, accidentally or deliberately.</p>

  <p>Action to be taken in relation to problems caused by Japanese knotweed is a matter for individual local authorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently assessing key recommendations of the GB-wide <em>Review of non-native Species Policy</em>, published earlier in 2003, which considered the threats posed by invasive non-native species such as Japanese knotweed.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress has been made on developing a national strategy to tackle issues associated with seagulls in urban settings, as undertaken by the Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development during the Members' Business debate in the Parliament on 7 November 2002 ( <em>Official Report</em> , c15170); what the timetable is for the finalisation of such a strategy, and whether local authorities will be consulted during the strategy's formulation.</p>

  <p>During the Member's Business debate, I agreed to the proposition that the Scottish Executive develop best practice guidance on how to tackle the problems associated with seagulls, as proposed by David Mundell. As a result, my officials have already met with a number of Directors of Environmental Health from local authorities, including East Ayrshire Council to discuss their current methods of dealing with this issue.</p>

  <p>In addition to considering local authority best practice measures to contain the gull population, we are exploring potential research opportunities to assist in developing a range of solutions. It is intended that the research will be completed in 2004.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what contribution it is making to the development of a UK government position on the forthcoming European chemical regulation, the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) and what plans it has to consult on REACH and carry out a study on the effects of chemical and radiation hazards similar to that announced for England and Wales by the Health Protection Agency.</p>

  <p>The Executive alerted stakeholders in Scotland to the eight-week internet consultation on the workability of the proposed system for the Registration, Evaluation and Authorisation of Chemicals (REACH) held over the summer months by the European Commission.</p>

  <p>There will be a full consultation by the UK Government in co-ordination with the Scottish Executive and other devolved administrations following the publication of the Commission&#8217;s formal legislative proposals. The Executive will play a full part in developing the UK policy position and the consultation document.</p>

  <p>The Executive has commissioned the National Radiological Protection Board, which is to become part of the Health Protection Agency, to map levels of radon across Scotland and to provide advice on the significance of the levels found. That work is about to get under way. The Executive has no plans at present to commission additional work on the effects of chemicals and radiation hazards, but will follow the progress of all such research closely to assess implications for Scotland.</p>

  <p>I am advised on this issue by the Food Standards Agency and I consider that maximum limits should be set at levels which protect public health, but neither unnecessarily limit consumer choice nor unduly restrict trade.</p>

  <p>The Food Standards Agency has also advised that a full review to inform the setting of maximum safe upper levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements has recently been completed by the UK&#8217;s Expert Group on Vitamins and Minerals (EVM). The EVM&#8217;s report was published on 8 May 2003.</p>

  <p>Article 5 of the Food Supplements Directive sets out the principles for setting maximum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements, although no such levels have yet been set. The European Commission will make a separate legislative proposal in future. The Food Standards Agency, which is responsible for negotiations on this issue, takes every opportunity to press this stance on limits bilaterally with other member states. The EVM&#8217;s advice will form the basis of the UK&#8217;s position when substantive discussions on setting maximum limits at EU level take place.</p>

  <p>We are not aware of any criteria for classifying land as a forest or woodland croft; therefore Forestry Commission Scotland does not hold records for such a classification. However, last month I asked Forestry Commission Scotland to undertake a review, including a public consultation, of the long-term role of Scotland&#8217;s national forest estate, making recommendations to ministers about changes that can improve its ability to deliver the priorities set out in the Scottish Forestry Strategy, together with other Scottish Executive policies. This will provide an opportunity for those with an interest in developing the concept of forest or woodland crofts to set out their ideas.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland is also in discussion with Communities Scotland and local planning authorities about the possibility of identifying sites on land it manages, that could be made available for the construction of low-cost housing.</p>

  <p>The two projects referred to in question S1W-8966 on 11 December 2000, were not directly related to endometriosis but to other disorders of the endometrium. One of those research projects has now been completed and an executive summary of the findings can be found on the Chief Scientist Office&#8217;s (CSO) website, http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/cso, under Publications-Executive Summaries-October 2001-Health Services Research, project reference number K-OPR-2-2-D360. This project deals with microwave endometrial ablation, a treatment under investigation in mild cases of endometriosis. A further CSO project on this topic is now also about to commence.</p>

  <p>The second research project looks at a genetic predisposition to endometrial cancer and is of relevance to the wider issue of mismatch repair genes in benign (endometriosis) and malignant endometrial tumours. The final report is due in the next two months. A copy of the executive summary for this project will be placed on the CSO&#8217;s website in due course.</p>

  <p>The police have a duty to uphold the law. Possession and supply of illegal drugs, including cannabis, is illegal under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971. Cannabis will remain an illegal drug following its reclassification from Class B to Class C.</p>

  <p>In England and Wales, it is normally the police who decide whether or not to start criminal proceedings for cannabis possession. In Scotland, this is a matter for procurators fiscal. Procurators fiscal have a range of options, including alternatives to prosecution, such as issuing a warning, a fiscal fine or diversion to treatment agencies. Guidance is available regarding the treatment of cases involving the misuse of controlled drugs, and this is kept under review by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.</p>

The port authority is examining possible options for re-instating the damaged quayside and related measures to restore berthing capacity.</p>

  <p>A harbour development would normally be pursued through a Harbour Order under the Harbours Act 1964 to convey the powers to create, operate and regulate a harbour. The conditions and criteria that apply to Harbour Orders are set out in sections 14 to 18 of that act. Section 34 of the Coast Protection Act 1949 also provides for consents to be given to certain marine operations and works in relation to the safety of navigation.</p>

  <p>Harbour authorities, along with other statutory undertakers, have permitted development rights under The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (Scotland) Order 1992. A non-statutory harbour development would normally require planning permission, which would be a matter for the planning authority in the first instance.</p>

  <p>Harbour development pursued through a Harbour Order, permitted development rights or an application for planning permission would be subject to the regulations on environmental impact assessment as appropriate.</p>

  <p>The action which the Executive or local authorities can take to prevent the creation of artificial or fixed harbours is not prescribed in statute. The Executive and local authority concerned would have to consider any specific case in the light of the legislation which might apply in the circumstances, and how the term artificial or fixed harbour was defined.</p>

  <p>Any regulations which can be put in place following the creation of such a harbour would depend on how the facility was defined in statute, and on whether the developer of any facilities had powers to make such regulations. Any regulation by the Executive would have to come within its devolved functions for ports and harbours, and fall within ministers&#8217; powers in the relevant legislation.</p>

  <p>Consideration of the effect on adjacent harbours before granting any authorisation for the creation of a harbour would depend on what authorisation or consent was being sought, and the criteria in the relevant part of the legislation which applied.</p>

  <p>: The production of cow beef, that is beef from cattle aged over 30 months, has been banned since May 1996 following the introduction of the Over Thirty Months Scheme (OTMS). This means that in 1997, 1999 and 2002 the level of cow beef production in Scotland was zero. The through-put to OTMS in Scotland of what previously would have been classified as cow beef in 1997 was 116,000 head of cattle, 129,000 in 1999 and 103,000 in 2002.</p>

  <p>The last full year that there is cow beef production information available is 1995 and in that year 119,000 head of cattle were produced. We are unable to provide figures on the percentage of these cows that went to export markets for each of these years since these figures are not recorded.</p>

  <p>The Deputy Minister for Social Justice launched a &#163;2 million fund to develop post offices in deprived urban areas on 30 December 2002. The objective of this fund is to contribute to the regeneration of deprived urban areas by sustaining and improving post office branches, on the margins of viability, that provide socially important services and facilities and that can act as an anchor for other retail activity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is represented on Department of Trade and Industry&#8217;s (DTI) interdepartmental group convened to examine strategy for supporting rural post offices after April 2006. This group has been convened to help DTI prepare options and advice for their ministers who have responsibility for postal matters.

  <p>The Executive will continue to monitor post office developments in both urban and rural contexts and work together with the DTI and Royal Mail to identify options for action that the Executive can pursue within its devolved powers.</p>

  <p>The Arrive Alive Road Safety Programme was launched in 1997 by the Driving Standards Agency (DSA). The programme involves driving examiners visiting schools and colleges, and other organisations connected with the 16- to 19-year age group, and delivering road safety information. Every member of the audience at a presentation is issued with an information booklet about the programme, and comprehensive folders are sent to any organisation that expresses an interest in hosting a presentation. There is a dedicated Arrive Alive website and the DSA also regularly issues press releases about the programme and places articles in its <em>Despatch</em> magazine for the driver training industry and others with an interest in road safety.</p>

  <p>In the last five years, the number of presentations throughout Great Britain has increased substantially as shown in the table.</p>

  <p>The Pass Plus scheme has been developed by the Driving Standards Agency (DSA), which chairs a board that promotes the scheme throughout Great Britain.</p>

  <p>The Pass Plus scheme provides a structured course of post-test training for newly-qualified drivers, and those who complete the course can benefit from discounted insurance rates from participating insurance companies. Pass Plus courses are provided by Approved Driving Instructors, registered by DSA, and the scheme is administered by the agency, with support from the motor insurance industry.</p>

  <p>Publicity for the scheme is carried out in a number of ways. The scheme is promoted in a DSA leaflet which is sent out with the 800,000 provisional driving licences which are issued annually. The benefits of the Pass Plus scheme are covered in DSA&#8217;s Arrive Alive Road Safety Programme for young people. The scheme is promoted in DSA&#8217;s <em>Drive On</em> magazine, a copy of which is handed to successful driving test candidates by their examiner. There is also a dedicated Pass Plus website, and local Road Safety Officers are encouraged to promote the scheme. Some of the insurance companies involved in the scheme have taken their own steps to promote the benefits of Pass Plus.</p>

  <p>The table is based on the departmental structure prior to April 2003.</p>

  <p>Restructuring of departments in the Scottish Executive over the period affects some of the year-on-year comparisons.</p>

  <p>The figures relate to the core staff of departments and do not include the costs related to executive agencies. Over the period the relevant staff numbers have increased from 3,824 to 4,346. The figures in the table therefore represent a 4.5% reduction per member of staff over the period.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has in place two licensing agreements with Microsoft which provide significant levels of discount on published list prices for Microsoft software.</p>

  <p>We have a Select Agreement which offers participating organisations volume discount on Microsoft list prices for their software licences. In addition, we have signed, in February 2003, a three-year Enterprise Agreement with Microsoft which entitles us to receive all upgrades for a defined list of software products (mainly MS Office) issued in the agreement period. The terms of both agreements were negotiated by the Office of Government Commerce on behalf of all government departments.</p>

  <p>The questions raised are of an operational nature. I have therefore asked the Chief Executive of Scottish Water to reply. His response is:</p>

  <p>Scottish Water is expecting to raise &#163;14.5 million from domestic customers in Dumfries and Galloway in 2003-04. The equivalent figure for business customers is not available, as these are not identified by local authority region. Charges schemes for the next four years have not yet been agreed. However, the revenue cap for all Scottish Water customers has been set to increase by 4.6% in 2004-05 and then to fall by 1.3% in 2005-06.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water has announced that, as part of the &#163;1.8 billion capital investment programme, they will spend over &#163;60 million by March 2006 in Dumfries and Galloway.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will not be providing financial assistance to local authorities in order for them to follow the HM Treasury guidelines issued in June 2003. Costs incurred by local authorities in this regard are staff time involved in euro preparations planning and inclusion of euro compatibility in new or upgraded IT systems. The staff time spent is incidental to other duties, and the cost of including euro compatibility in IT system upgrades is marginal to the cost of each upgrade.</p>

  <p>None. Probationer teachers have always required support and mentoring, and this has traditionally been a responsibility of all teachers. Since the introduction of the teacher induction scheme, with its more formalised mentoring regime, the Executive has made additional funding available to local authorities towards the cost of mentoring. Local authorities receive 10 per cent of a probationer teacher&#8217;s salary for each probationer they employ specifically to contribute to mentoring costs.</p>

  <p>We have recently issued in the autumn of last year to all teachers and schools, guidance on the Professional Review and Development process. This document, that was prepared in collaboration with local authorities and other key stakeholders, describes the types of professional development opportunities that teachers should expect to be exposed to throughout their career. It provides an exemplar framework in which to place such opportunities which schools and teachers should consider and which reflects on what development activities are appropriate at different stages in a teacher&#8217;s career. The Professional Review and Development document is one of the elements that come together to make the National Framework for Continuing Professional Development (CPD) of teachers. In addition to the guidance prepared with our partners, the Executive has distributed &#163;13.45 million in 2002-03 and &#163;14 million in 2003-04 for CPD to local authorities.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have a common interest with the UK Government in the introduction of the new police radio communications system Airwave which uses Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA) technology. Scottish Police Forces are part of the Home Office-led research programme, which includes a detailed study involving 150 officers to determine whether Airwave signals have any effect on the well-being of users and a national 15-year health monitoring programme involving up to 100,000 police Airwave users.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory is carrying out a study into the possible biological effects of TETRA. An objective of the programme is to determine whether TETRA pulse modulated radio frequency fields can affect calcium levels and signalling in neurones and other cells.</p>

  <p>There is no research looking specifically at the possible effects of Airwave use on people who come into random contact with the system.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland has taken account of studies into the effects of mobile phones and TETRA on medical devices. The Scottish Healthcare Supplies Safety Action Note SAN(SC)01-10, 12 April 2001, &quot;Medical Devices, TETRA (Terrestrial Trunked Radio System) and outside media broadcasts from hospital premises: risk of interference with medical devices&quot; concluded that &quot;The risk to medical devices from the use of TETRA handsets is comparable to that from GSM cellular phones.&quot; It went on to advise that, &quot;All personnel using TETRA handsets on hospital premises should therefore be made aware of, and follow, the local policy guidelines applicable for cellular phone systems.&quot;</p>
