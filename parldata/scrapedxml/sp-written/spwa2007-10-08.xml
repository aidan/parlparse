  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many emergency ambulance staff have been injured at work (a) accidentally or (b) as a result of assault in each year since 1999, broken down by Scottish Ambulance Service division.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-10-08.S3W-4540.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa1008.htm#1">

  <p>Information on the number of emergency ambulance staff who have been injured at work accidentally or as a result of assault is not collected in the format requested. The Scottish Ambulance Service began capturing information on the numbers of incidents of violence and aggression towards staff in August 2004 when it issued guidance to staff about the need to report such incidents. There were 265 incidents reported in 2005 and 299 in 2006. In 2007 to 31 July, there were 117 incidents reported.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many petrol forecourts have sold biodiesel in each of the last four years, broken down by parliamentary constituency, and what measures are in place to encourage the use and promotion of biodiesel over the next four years.</p>

  <p>Figures for biodiesel sales by forecourt are not held by the Scottish Government or the UK Government.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when two hours of quality physical education by specialist PE teachers will be provided in schools across Scotland.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-10-08.S3W-4524.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80400" speakername="Maureen Watt" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa1008.htm#3">

  <p>Local authorities are working towards a target of two hours of good quality physical education for each child every week by the end of the school year 2007-08. Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) have been monitoring the move towards providing two hours PE per week and tell us informally that they are seeing a positive move towards two hour PE target within their inspections.</p>

  <p>Since April 2006 Learning and Teaching Scotland has seconded a PE development officer to work with schools, education authorities and HMIE on gathering and disseminating examples of good practice in PE.</p>
