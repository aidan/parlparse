  <p>Source: June Agricultural Census.Notes:1. The arable sector consists of cereal, general cropping and horticulture holdings.2. The &quot;other&quot; sector includes pigs, poultry and holdings with mixed activity.3. There are a large number of small holdings that do not report any labour in the June Agricultural Census. These have not been included in the results above.4. As the holding classification is updated every year, individual holdings can move between sectors depending on agricultural activity reported on the June Agricultural Census. This should be noted when considering trends within specific farm sectors.</p>

  <p>Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s (FCS) spending is subject to the same scrutiny as other departments of the Scottish Executive. Every two years its planned activities are examined in detail in the Spending Review to ensure that it is meeting the agreed objectives and wider priorities of the Executive. The results of the Spending Review are presented in the FCS Corporate Plan which includes analysis of spend by objective. Annual FCS spend is approved by Parliament through the Budget Bill and it reports the effectiveness of its activities against the agreed objectives in its Annual Report and Accounts. FCS is subject to annual examination by Audit Scotland and plays an active part in the Executive&rsquo;s Efficient Government Initiative, delivering over &pound;4 million of efficiency savings over the period 2004-05 to 2007-08.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, independent reports have been commissioned over the last few years to look at the effectiveness of how FCS is meeting its social, economic and environmental objectives. The reports and responses are shown as follows, with an appropriate weblink reference:</p>

  <p>Current evidence on the causation of Crohn&rsquo;s disease suggests it would not be appropriate to include it in the list of specified infectious diseases notifiable under the Public Health (Notification of Infectious Diseases) (Scotland) Regulations 1988.</p>

  <p>The suggestion that Crohn&rsquo;s should be made a notifiable disease may refer to the suggestion that it is caused by the organism Mycobacterium Avium subspecies Paratuberculosis (Map), which it is claimed may be present in milk and drinking water. The Department of Health&rsquo;s Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens, which advises all the UK Health Departments, has however concluded on two occasions (1992 and 1998) that a link between Map and Crohn&rsquo;s disease could not be established on current evidence.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. In 2003-04, this information was not available for Argyll and Bute, Dumfries and Galloway, East Renfrewshire, Eilean Siar, Fife and Stirling. North Ayrshire could not provide data on the value of these fixed penalties received since the information could not be separated from the value of fixed penalties received for non-endorsable (mostly moving) traffic offences.</p>

  <p>2. In 2004-05, information was not available for Argyll and Bute, Dumfries and Galloway, Eilean Siar, Fife and Stirling. West Dunbartonshire could not provide this data since the information could not be separated from the values for other types of fixed penalty.</p>

  <p>3. Excludes the value of penalty charge notices which are collected through decriminalised parking enforcement schemes under the Road Traffic Act 1991. Revenue from penalties collected under these schemes is retained by the local authority. Decriminalised parking enforcement is in operation in Aberdeen City, City of Edinburgh, Dundee City, Glasgow City, Perth and Kinross and South Lanarkshire.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in contact with Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) on whether the proposed ship-to-ship transfers of crude oil in the Firth of Forth would be likely to disturb a European Protected Species, or damage or destroy its breeding sites or resting places. If it were established that the proposed transfer would be likely to affect a European Protected Species in one of these ways, a licence would be required from the Scottish Executive as the licensing authority under regulation 44 of the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp; c.)

  <p>In preparation for the Coastal and Marine National Park roadshow permission was sought where necessary for the siting of the vehicles at the venues to be visited.</p>

  <p>Contact was made with local interests in Mallaig and my officials have also been in correspondence with the Mallaig and North West Fishermen&rsquo;s Association (MNWFA) about the timing of the Mallaig visit. I can confirm that MNWFA requested that an alternative date to 10 October be considered for Mallaig.</p>

  <p>The proposed start and finish time of the roadshow at Mallaig was changed to allow fishermen to visit in the evening and the visit took place on 17 October.</p>

  <p>Information about the incidence of asbestos in schools is not collected centrally. Local authorities are responsible for school buildings under their management.</p>

  <p>The Control of Asbestos at Work Regulations 2002 place a duty on those with legal responsibilities for maintenance of buildings to manage the risk from asbestos. This includes assessing whether there is asbestos in buildings, and, depending on its condition, removing it or managing it. These regulations were made under the Health and Safety at Work etc Act 1974. The Health and Safety Executive provides advice and guidance on the management of asbestos.</p>

  <p>The extent to which information is made available to victims, their families, or identified adults targeted by an offender, is an operational matter for the police to determine and on a case-by-case basis. In all circumstances, the police assess the risk of harm an offender poses and disclose relevant information where it the most appropriate way to protect the public generally or any individuals in particular. That assessment is kept under review particularly when an offender fails to comply with requirements placed upon them.</p>

  <p>Professor George Irving in his report <em>Registering the Risk</em>, published last autumn, recommended that the existing disclosure powers be strengthened by the introduction of a warning system to regulate the activities and behaviours of registered sex offenders. The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland has acted upon that recommendation and is putting in place a system of controlled disclosure as part of operational guidance to support consistency and effective management of registered sex offenders.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Since 2001, the proportion of grants provided under the Warm Deal Programme to households with children, is as shown in the table below. This relates to work undertaken by Eaga Partnership. The table also shows Warm Deal installations carried out by local authorities in their own stock.

</table></p>

  <p>Note: work undertaken by Eaga Partnership was across all sectors of the housing stock. No data is available regarding the proportion of households with children, improved under the local authority part of the programme.</p>

  <p>Research has assessed the impact on fuel poverty of the central heating programme, which includes warm deal measures, but not the impact of warm deal measures on their own. However, the most recent annual report on the central heating programme and warm deal shows that over 2004-05 the warm deal achieved a predicted reduction in average annual fuel bills ranging from &pound;109 for tenants of private landlords to &pound;19 for tenants of housing associations and &pound;168 for local authority tenants. This figure is not broken down by household composition.</p>

  <p>The predicted reduction in housing association properties reflects the fact that these properties tend to start from a higher level of thermal efficiency due, for example, to the presence of cavity wall or loft insulation. The potential gains are therefore more modest than in other sectors.</p>

  <p>Mortality rates are not available on a yearly basis. Twenty-six of the 42 individuals released (62%) were known to be alive at the end of 2005. This should not be seen as a definitive survival rate as it would be incorrect to assume that most of the other birds are dead. However, the known survival rate is very good, similar to Scottish survival rates and, although data is incomplete given that the project is still at a very early age, it is my understanding that survival is well within the expected range, and sufficient to achieve the project&rsquo;s aims.</p>
