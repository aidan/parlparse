  <p>Information in the format requested is not available. However, Scottish Government statisticians have been working with COSLA and local authorities on developing a new data collection system that records the eligibility criteria and waiting time of clients receiving a new free personal and nursing care service. The first data from this new collection will be released as &quot;Data under development&quot; on 29 March 2011.</p>

  <p>The data under development will provide a breakdown of new applicants for free personal and nursing care services by local authority where this information is available.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the 2011 National Planning Framework Monitoring Report is to keep the National Planning Framework under review, so the weight attached to it in decision-making and development plans will be for the decision maker. The second National Planning Framework remains the Scottish Government&rsquo;s spatial plan for Scotland and policy until it is replaced.</p>

  <p>I understand that Scottish Natural Heritage plans to publish an update on its Natural Heritage Indicator, <em>Visual influence of built development and land use change</em> by the end of January 2011. This will confirm that the area of Scotland from which no built development is visible reduced from 31% in January 2008 to 28% in December 2009. This is in the main caused by wind turbine development and its associated visual influence which is greater than development at ground level.</p>

  <p>The Leeds University, Wildland Research Institute report <em>Review of the Status and Conservation of Wild Land in Europe</em> is a useful contribution to the debate on wild land following on from the European Parliament resolution of February 2009 calling for special status and stricter protection for wilderness zones in Europe and the Natura 2000 network. The research examined approaches to the management of wild land elsewhere in Europe comparable to that found in Scotland with a view to identifying lesson from their experiences relevant to the future care of wild land in Scotland.</p>

  <p>A key recommendation of the report is for the identification of wild land areas so that these may be safeguarded. Scottish Natural Heritage&rsquo;s (SNH) wildness mapping project will give a more detailed view of the extent and location of relative wildness than the current indicative search areas of wild land. The new maps will inform revisions to SNH&rsquo;s guidance and advice regarding wild land in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland and Department for Transport officials meet regularly to discuss cross-border rail freight links. Discussions are taking place on proposals to improve rail infrastructure on the East Coast Main Line across the Anglo-Scottish border which could benefit freight movements.</p>

  <p>Regular dialogue is also maintained on the administration of Freight Mode Shift Grant applications which involve cross-border flows.</p>

  <p>The freight facilities grant (FFG) is a state aid and the scheme required the approval of the European Commission. The scheme rules are the same across Great Britain. We, the Department for Transport and the Welsh Assembly Government held a joint review of the Freight Mode Shift Grant schemes over the period from summer 2007 to summer 2009. No changes were made to the freight facilities grant scheme as a result.</p>

  <p>Freight facilities grant (FFG) is a state aid. The scheme was therefore notified to the European Commission (EC) in 2001 and notice was received of the scheme&rsquo;s compliance with the state aid rules later that year. The EC approval noted that the aid as proposed was proportional and that it did not unduly distort competition. We have ensured that funding distributed under the scheme has been consistent with the terms of the approval given by the EC. The application process obtains information about sources of financial assistance so that any additional state aid issues can be addressed during the application assessment process.</p>

  <p>There were some 2,700 Justices of the Peace (JPs) in November 2007, of whom some 2,200 demitted office on 10 December 2007, leaving about 470 remaining JPs in January 2008. This decrease in the number of JPs was a result of reforms to the summary justice system, which saw judicial office being limited to those JPs who sat on the bench, as opposed to merely exercising signing responsibilities. These reforms, unanimously approved by Parliament, formed part of the Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007.</p>

  <p>The JP register held by the Scottish Government is configured in such a way that it cannot provide a historical snapshot of the make-up of the JP population. Furthermore, no ethnicity information on JPs was held centrally prior to December 2007. Since December 2007, however, information on ethnicity and disability has been collected and monitored, particularly in relation to recruitment exercises.</p>

  <p>All applications for planning permission for national and major developments require pre-application consultation (PAC). National developments are those specified in the annex to the second National Planning Framework (NPF2) and major developments are categorised in the Town and County Planning (Hierarchy of Developments) (Scotland) Regulations 2009, links provided below.</p>

  <p>NPF2: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/07/02105627/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/07/02105627/0</a>.</p>

  <p>The Hierarchy Regulations specify that development for the extraction of minerals where the area of the site is or exceeds two hectares is a major development. This threshold relates to the area where extraction is proposed. Where an extension is proposed to an existing operation, the threshold only applies to the proposed extension.</p>

  <p>The statutory requirements for PAC are the same for all national and major developments. Prospective applicants are required to:</p>

  <p>consult every community council whose area, or part of, is within or adjoins the land where the proposed development is situated;</p>

  <p>hold at least one public event for members of the public where they can make comments to the prospective applicant proposals. The event must be advertised at least 7 days in advance in a newspaper circulating in the locality of the proposed development. That advert should also specify a timescale and address to which written comments on the proposal can be sent to the prospective applicant, and</p>

  <p>serve a proposal of application notice on the planning authority.</p>

  <p>In addition to these mandatory steps, the planning authority can require the prospective applicant to carry out additional pre-application consultation.</p>

  <p>A report on the pre-application consultation must accompany applications for national and major developments. If an applicant has not complied with the statutory requirements for PAC, or any additional requirements specified by the planning authority, the planning authority cannot process the planning application.</p>

  <p>Further information on PAC can be found in Circular 4/2009 on Development management Procedures at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/07/03153034/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/07/03153034/0</a>.</p>

  <p>On 17 December 2010, the UK Government announced its proposals to enable convicted prisoners sentenced to terms of four years or more to be automatically barred from registering to vote.

  <p>When giving prior notice of this announcement to the Scottish Government, the UK Government undertook to consult the Scottish Government about how the policy will operate in practice.

  <p>As I confirmed in the Members&rsquo; Business debate in the Chamber on the A9 on 20 January 2011, although it would clearly never have been possible to design, authorise, procure and complete major dualling of the A9 in the lifetime of this Parliament, the Scottish Government has committed to dualling the A9 from Perth to Inverness and have put the project into the Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR), so that it is on record as one of our priorities.</p>

  <p>I also confirmed that dualling this section involves approximately 87 miles of new carriageway and, as the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth made clear during the debate, that requires in-depth planning and design to ensure we deliver the right scheme, taking into consideration all the factors, including environmental constraints, such as the protected Cairngorms National Park.</p>

  <p>Once these stages have been completed, we can then finalise the timescales for the upgrading of the A9 which will be undertaken in the context of overall affordability and our commitments to the STPR recommendations.</p>

  <p>As part of normal procedures, a road safety audit of the A9 Moy improvement was carried out shortly after opening and this identified some driver behaviour which could produce a potentially dangerous situation. The overtaking lane was closed to protect safety and Transport Scotland is currently considering options for resolving the issues identified.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to planning for the dualling of the whole of the A9 between Perth and Inverness and has already announced further improvements. The detail for this work, in terms of design, costs or programmes will be defined in the context of the development of the Strategic Transport Projects Review intervention relating to the upgrading of this trunk road from Dunblane to Inverness and wider funding and resource commitments.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government welcomes the discussion and debate in the European Parliament about the contribution that Europe&rsquo;s wild areas make to safeguarding biodiversity. In contrast to Scotland&rsquo;s wilder landscapes, some of which show the imprint of past generations, some continental areas are wilderness in the true sense of the word &ndash; including relatively pristine forests in Eastern Europe. A Scottish approach to the issues raised by the resolution is therefore appropriate.</p>

  <p>We have commissioned research exploring approaches to the management of wild land elsewhere in Europe and are considering the results of this study. In the meantime, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) is currently undertaking further work on the definition and mapping of wildness and wild land areas. We will consider the results of this when it is completed.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will keep under review progress on the resolution in discussion with SNH.</p>
