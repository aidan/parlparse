  <p>As West Dunbartonshire took part in the pilot phase of EMAs, information is available for each of the pilot years (2001-02 onwards). As East Dunbartonshire did not participate in the pilot, information is only available from the first year of national roll-out (i.e. academic year 2004-05).</p>

  <p>The source of registered unemployment is the claimant count, which is the number of people claiming unemployment benefits.

  <p>The proportion of total claimants by these age bands in October of each year from 1999 to 2005 is given in the tables of <em>Claimant Count by Parliamentary</em> <em>Constituencies 1999-2005</em>, a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 38276).</p>

  <p>There are two measures of unemployment used in the UK. Unemployment (previously known as International Labour Organisation (ILO) unemployment) and the claimant count. The ILO measure of unemployment is estimated from the Labour Force Survey (LFS), whereas the claimant count is simply a count of those claiming unemployment benefits.</p>

  <p>Unemployment obtained from the LFS using the ILO definition is the Executive&rsquo;s preferred measure of unemployment. However, for the specific age group requested, the ILO measure is not reliable for detailed geographical areas. Therefore the following table shows claimant count figures which are based on administrative records and are thus more reliable at local authority level.</p>

  <p>Proportions for the parliamentary constituency area of West Renfrewshire are not available as population estimates for West Renfrewshire have not been produced by the General Register Office for Scotland (GROS).</p>

  <p>The Executive has not measured directly any financial shortfall. The labour market has been improving since around 1997 and we now have one of the highest employment rates in the EU and the OECD. Our <em>Framework for Economic Development in Scotland </em> is clear that economic growth is a pre-requisite for all in society to enjoy enhanced economic opportunities and it sets the right priorities for achieving such progress.</p>

  <p>1. The LFS questions on health and disability reflect the provisions of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995. The LFS broadly classifies disabled into three categories records: DDA disabled (current disabled) only - who have a current disability which includes people who have a long-term disability which substantially limits their day-to-day activities; work-limiting disabled - people who have a long-term disability which affects the kind of work or amount of work they might do, and a third category where respondents have both.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Community and Householder Renewables Initiative (SCHRI) was established in 2002 primarily to promote the development of new community and household renewable energy projects in Scotland, therefore no formal assessment has been carried out on its impact on fuel poverty. However, a number of community housing projects supported by SCHRI will have had an impact on fuel poverty.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to meeting its target to eradicate fuel poverty as far as reasonably practicable by 2016, and has invested over &pound;200 million in the central heating programme and the Warm Deal. Through these initiatives we have put central heating systems into more than 60,000 homes and insulated over 218,000 and early indications are that nine out of 10 people participating in these programmes are being lifted out of fuel poverty.</p>

  <p>The Executive monitors earnings in Scotland through the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings produced by the Office for National Statistics. The latest publication showed that median earnings in Scotland had increased at the second highest rate out of the 12 standard UK regions between 2004 and 2005. Also the gender pay gap had reduced from 13.9% in 2004 to 11.9% in 2005 compared to a gender pay gap of 17.1% in the UK.</p>

  <p>As highlighted in the report from the Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland earlier this year, there are a number of financial support mechanisms for biomass plant and bio-energy schemes. These include the Department of Trade and Industry&rsquo;s Bio-Energy Capital Grants Scheme, which will part-fund the planned new biomass electricity plant at Lockerbie. The Scottish Community and Householder Renewables Initiative, which is sponsored by the Scottish Executive and managed jointly by the Energy Savings Trust and Highlands and Islands Enterprise has funded over 30 biomass related projects to date. Also, the Highlands and Islands Woodfuel Development programme, funded by a partnership including Forestry Commission Scotland and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, can provide capital grants for boiler installation.</p>

  <p>We remain committed to the provision of support for biomass and we are currently considering ways in which we might support and accelerate a range of renewables developments, including biomass heat and power.</p>

  <p>The Highlands and Islands Development Programme is stimulating considerable interest in woodfuel supply. With funding from the Programme, work is already underway in five areas to develop woodfuel clusters and supply chains. The recent increase we announced to the Forestry Commission Scotland&rsquo;s grant for short-rotation coppice, now up to &pound;1,000 per hectare will also help in this respect.</p>

  <p>Grant offers are also being made by Forestry Commission Scotland under the Bio-energy Infrastructure Scheme to help develop the supply chain required to harvest, store, process and supply biomass to energy end users. Along similar lines, the commission is also now trialling a farm woodland energy scheme. Other sources of aid include Regional Selective Assistance which is delivered by the Executive, working closely with partners such as the local enterprise companies. In addition to financial support, information and advice is available from the Woodfuel Information officers appointed by the commission.</p>

  <p>There are three schemes which provide aid for growing crops as energy crops. Under CAP Reform, farmers can claim aid on industrial crops, including energy crops, grown under contract on set-aside land. Also under CAP Reform, a flat rate supplement of 45 Euros, or around &pound;30, per hectare can be claimed for any crops, except sugar beet, grown under contract for energy purposes on any land other than set-aside land. In addition, the Forestry Commission Scotland provides grant aid to farmers to establish short rotation coppice, willow or poplar as an energy crop under the Scottish Forestry Grants Scheme.</p>

These arrangements are subject to a rolling programme of monitoring by Audit Scotland.</p>

  <p>To support local authorities in meeting their statutory responsibilities for local roads, the Spending Review 2004 provided them with an additional &pound;60 million per annum to help meet their calls for more support in improving the condition of Scotland&rsquo;s local roads from 2005-06.
