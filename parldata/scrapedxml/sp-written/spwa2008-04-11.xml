  <p>The ability of ministers and officials to instruct or direct non-departmental public body (NDPB) delivery partners is part of the long established governance framework between government and the bodies they sponsor.</p>

  <p>Within this delivery relationship, there is a wide range of terminology used to describe instructions that can be given to NDPBs and this is normally contained in enabling legislation or other relevant corporate documentation underpinning the governance framework. The scope of instruction and direction can also vary considerably, ranging from simple accounting matters to issues of substance and can cover procedures and timescales where ministers believe there is a public interest. Whether of a general or specific nature, &quot;powers of direction&quot; allow government to exercise the degree of control necessary to ensure parliamentary, ministerial and public accountability for bodies in receipt of government funds.</p>

  <p>The way in which the Scottish Government discharges these core functions is not recorded separately or given prominence over other issues of sponsorship activity. In addition, the way in which directions can be invoked and communicated will vary depending on the individual circumstances or context.</p>

  <p>The governance framework which confers NDPB status provides for a degree of ministerial judgement in deciding the most appropriate level of interaction between body and government.</p>

  <p>NDPB sponsorship guidance is contained on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s public bodies website at: <br /> <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/public-bodies" target="_blank"> http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/public-bodies</a>.</p>

  <p>As a statutory public body SEPA is responsible for ensuring that it carries out its functions in accordance with its statutory powers and duties, taking account of any other relevant guidance, policies or regulations. Scottish ministers are responsible for setting the policy framework within which SEPA carries out its functions, and strategic oversight of SEPA&rsquo;s performance, through approval of SEPA&rsquo;s Corporate Plan, scrutiny of SEPA&rsquo;s performance indicators, and through regular liaison with the chair and board. Any question about how SEPA carried out its functions in relation to an individual case should be directed to its chief executive.</p>

  <p>The Environment Act 1995 establishes SEPA and defines its main statutory powers and duties. Additional statutory duties have been given to SEPA by legislation enacted since the formation of SEPA. SEPA is responsible for the operational exercise of these powers. The Act also gives ministers certain functions in relation to SEPA, including the power to make appointments to the board of SEPA, give directions to SEPA, give guidance to SEPA with respect to the agency&rsquo;s aims and objectives, and approve SEPA&rsquo;s charging schemes.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the preparation and adoption of local plans lies with the planning authority for the relevant area. The planning authority is responsible, where necessary, for appointing a reporter to hold a public local inquiry. The reporter&rsquo;s report and recommendations are for the planning authority to consider, not Scottish ministers. It is for the planning authority to decide whether to accept or reject the reporter&rsquo;s findings and recommendations.</p>
