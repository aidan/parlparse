  <p>Yes. Support for heather moorland management is available through the Argyll Islands, Cairngorms Straths, Shetland Islands, Stewartry, Breadalbane, Loch Lomond, Central and Western Southern Uplands Environmentally Sensitive Area Schemes (ESAs), which were open to new entrants until 31 December 2000. Support is also available through the Countryside Premium Scheme (CPS), which covers all land outwith the ESAs and was open to new entrants until 31 July 2000, and the Rural Stewardship Scheme (which, for new entrants, has now replaced the ESAs and the CPS). Support was also available under the Heather Moorland Scheme which closed to new applications in 1996.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will be developing a national strategy for public records by building on work conducted already by the Keeper of the Records of Scotland and the Scottish Records Advisory Council. The strategy will also be informed by the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Bill, passed by the Scottish Parliament on 24 April, which contains a number of provisions relating to public records and archives and a requirement for the Scottish to issue a code of practice as to the keeping, management and destruction of records.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to identify all the one-stop clinics which provide cancer diagnosis, as many of them cover a wide range of conditions which are treated by general surgeons, dermatologists and urologists.</p>

  <p>Information from NHSScotland indicates that it is currently operating 300 one-stop clinics, all of which provide a full diagnostic and, where appropriate, treatment service at a single visit. A patient referred to one of these one-stop clinics will typically receive a specialist consultation, undergo the appropriate diagnostic tests, receive results and undergo treatment where necessary. Where immediate treatment is not feasible, the patient should receive a date to attend for treatment.</p>

  <p>The diagnosis and treatment of patients with breast cancer involves a wide range of highly skilled staff from different medical specialties. We are already taking vigorous action to respond to specialist shortages in this field. In 2001 the numbers of higher specialist training posts available in Scotland were increased for cancer and cancer-related specialties by 29% in medical oncology, 26% in radiotherapy, 15% in histopathology and 16% in radiology. The specialities of general surgery and plastic surgery also saw increases of 9% and 25% respectively.</p>

  <p><i>Cancer in Scotland: Action for change</i> was launched last year with a new investment and planning process, to ensure that decisions for cancer services are taken locally, to meet the needs of the people served by healthcare services. Recruitment and retention of specialist staff is central to this strategy. First year Implementation/Investment Plans are available at:</p>

  <p>Women with breast problems are most often referred to specialist breast clinics, where they are normally seen by breast surgeons or general surgeons with a special interest in breast cancer. The term &quot;breast physician&quot; does not refer to any single recognised clinical specialty.</p>

  <p>There are no specific plans to establish specialist training centres for breast surgery. <i>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change</i> sets out the Scottish Executive&#146;s cancer strategy. Backed up by &#163;60 million additional investment, implementation is progressing through annual investment plans prepared by the three Regional Cancer Advisory Groups and overseen by the Scottish Cancer Group. <i>Cancer in Scotland</i> and the 2001-02 investment plans are available at:</p>

  <p>Allocations for local authorities and housing associations have not yet been finalised for this year because they are still completing the programme for 2001-02. It is therefore not possible to provide the information requested for the West Dunbartonshire local authority area.

  <p>The School Cultural Co-ordinators pilot programme was launched by Mike Watson on 2 May. All local authorities have been invited to apply for funding of &#163;1.75 million available over this year and the next. The pilot will identify ways of maximising the potential contribution of culture to young people&#146;s education, developing their self-confidence, their skills and creativity, and exploring opportunities to widen the range of experiences available to children.</p>

  <p>The Executive, in common with the UK Government, has not set targets for business spending on research and development over this period. The UK is signed up to the Lisbon Conference target of 3% of GDP to be spent on research and development by 2010. This target includes both Government and business spending.</p>

  <p>Business research and development spend is a matter for business but government can help to create a climate which encourages investment in research and development and innovation. The announcement in UK Budget 2002 of the extension to large firms of the existing research and development tax credit for SMEs will provide an estimated &#163;400 million a year support for investment in new technology by UK industry.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive is working directly with Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise to improve the quality and consistency of support for business start-ups and small businesses throughout Scotland. A number of measures have been introduced including the Small Business Gateway providing consistent support and advice to start-ups, existing, and growing businesses across the Scottish Enterprise Network. Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) provide similar access to information and advice to businesses in the HIE area through its Business Information Source. Further improvements will be introduced as a result of the recent review of Scottish Enterprise&#146;s Business Birth Rate Strategy.</p>

  <p>The most recent data on new businesses is the number of new VAT registrations in 2000. In Scotland the rate was 28 per 10,000 adults while for the rest of the UK the figure was 40 per 10,000 adults. The most recent information on survival rates show that 64.3% of businesses that registered in 1997 survived three years while the figures for the rest of the UK was 65.2%. Both of these are higher than for businesses that registered in 1996 but the increase was greater in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise have a target of 70% survival after three years for start-up businesses assisted by the Enterprise Networks.</p>

  <p>As previously explained, the Fisheries Departments in the UK operate a restrictive licensing system, whereby anyone wishing to replace an existing vessel, or introduce a new vessel into the fleet, has to acquire an existing licence, or licences for aggregation, of an appropriate type and capacity to cover the incoming vessel. No new licences, other than to replace existing licences used in this way, have therefore been issued since the decommissioning scheme began. Indeed, as at 1 May, 46 licences have been surrendered and cancelled, as a result of operation of the scheme to date; and the number of licences within the system in the UK will have further reduced, as a result of transactions involving the aggregation of existing licences.</p>

  <p>The Executive believes that complementary or alternative therapies may offer relief to some people suffering from a wide variety of conditions. There is no legislative bar to prevent practitioners of such therapies from offering their services, subject only to some general restrictions, such as those on prescribing and supplying medicines and giving injections. A GP or hospital clinician may refer a patient for alternative treatment, but would require to be satisfied of the value of the treatment and the competence of the practitioner, and would remain responsible for the patient&#146;s medical care. It is also open to NHS boards to provide complementary or alternative therapies.</p>

  <p>The convention offers an excellent opportunity to promote new ideas and gain consensus on practical measures that can encourage best practice in tackling health care associated infection. It will build on work already under way and help ensure a more prominent place for infection control on the NHS agenda.</p>

  <p>Planning for the convention is in hand and an announcement about arrangements will be made in due course.</p>

  <p>This is a question for Scottish Water. The Chief Executive&#146;s response is:</p>

  <p>Three agreements were signed between the West of Scotland Water and Thames Water.</p>

  <p>On 3 August 2001 Stirling Water Ltd was appointed by West of Scotland Water as one of four Strategic Partners to help West of Scotland Water deliver its Capital Investment Programme in the period 2002-06. The constituent parties of Stirling Water are MJ Gleeson, Thames Water and Montgomery Watson. The Form of Agreement for this contract was signed on 20 March 2002 with full agreement by the prospective management of Scottish Water.</p>

  <p>As part of West of Scotland Water&#146;s drive to achieve efficiencies in its working practices, two consultancy agreements were entered into with Thames Water in April 2001. These agreements were in relation to the management services and technical services elements of our Capital Efficiency Project.</p>

  <p>The contract for the Katrine Water Project was signed between the West of Scotland Water and the MJ Gleeson Group Ltd, the lead member of the Stirling Water consortium, on 18 October 2000.
