  <p>In March 1999 there were 1204 primary schools (53%) and 320 secondary schools (82%) with access to the Internet. This information comes from the Improvement Plans prepared by local authorities under the Excellence Fund arrangements. The School Census in September 1999 will provide updated figures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not had specific meetings with such organisations although there has been full consultations on the recent legislative changes on labelling. In due course it will, however, be important to obtain views from all Scottish interests in genetically modified food &#150; including consumer, environmental and industry interests.</p>

  <p>The proposals for the Food Standards Agency, including those for Scotland, have been subject to thorough consultation at the White Paper and draft Bill stages and during pre-legislative scrutiny. The Scottish Executive has also consulted MSPs by means of a formal debate in the Scottish Parliament asking for approval to the policy of a UK-wide agency and for legislation to be taken forward in the UK Parliament. Approval was confirmed.</p>

  <p>Food labelling legislation is agreed at EC level and prescribed by Council Directive 79/112/EEC. The Directive is implemented in Great Britain by the Food Labelling Regulations 1996. Catering establishments are exempt from most of the general food labelling requirements.</p>

  <p>Discussions are ongoing at EU level to amend the Directive to require labelling of those ingredients which are known to affect allergy sufferers. In addition to food containing nut or nut oil contents it is also important to identify other specific ingredients (eggs, milk, fish, cereals containing gluten and their products) which are also recognised as causing hypersensitivity to allergy sufferers. This is a devolved matter and the Scottish Parliament has powers to legislate in this area - within the parameters laid down in EU legislation. Legislation on this issue will be considered following the outcome of EU discussions.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to review the funding of remote medical practices. General Practitioners are independent contractors and not NHS employees. They do not receive a salary but are paid through a system of fees and allowances designed to deliver an average income and cover practice expenses. In the most remote areas, some practices, including the one mentioned, are covered by the Inducement Scheme. This is a scheme to underwrite the income of a practice to ensure practitioners can earn a guaranteed level of income each year. There are no current plans to review this scheme.</p>

  <p>The nearest NHS Dexa Scanner to residents of the Highland Council area is located at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. There are 5 NHS Dexa Scanners in Scotland, 2 of which are in Aberdeen. The range and type of health services made available in any area are most appropriately decided at a local level.

  <p>Nine responses were received, 2 from candidates who were later unsuccessful in the elections. On the question &quot;Do you have a need for nursery provision?&quot;, the remaining seven responded as follows:</p>

  <p>Yes &#150; 3 : of these, one wanted cr&#232;che facilities for a baby, either in Edinburgh close to the Parliament, or in Glasgow; one preferred/needed support for childcare/nursery provision close to home in Glasgow (she could not commute with children to Edinburgh); and one preferred to keep her child in the existing nursery although might consider placing her in a nursery closer to the Parliament building at a later date.</p>

  <p>Possibly &#150; 1: emergency out-of-school care on site</p>
