  <p>Amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP) is caused by domoic acid, a water-soluble, amino acid which is produced by species of Pseudonitzschia phytoplankton, and accumulated in shellfish. Poisoning by ASP can cause severe and potentially fatal irreversible neurotoxic effects in humans. Toxic Pseudonitzschia species are regularly found in Scottish coastal waters throughout the year and are monitored regularly by the Food Standards Agency phytoplankton and algal toxin monitoring programmes.</p>

  <p>The <em>Review of the Planning, Allocation and Management of Resources in the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service</em> , published on 4 March, made recommendations which are intended to improve the quality of the service delivered to the public across the board. Implementation of these recommendations has begun under the direction of the recently appointed Chief Executive and Crown Agent Designate and has reached the stage at which appointments to the new post of Area Procurator Fiscal are presently being made. Additional prosecutors and administrative staff are being recruited and technology which will permit more effective management of work is being introduced.</p>

  <p>Legislation (for example, the Criminal Procedure (Intermediate Diets) (Scotland) Act 1998) to enhance the use and effectiveness of intermediate diets and to reduce the need to lead oral evidence at trial have led to a reduction in such abstractions. A study in 1998, for example, showed that the number of police officers attending court in Scotland on any given day had reduced by more than 41% since 1991. The current reviews of the court system being taken forward under the direction of Lord Bonomy and Sheriff Principal McInnes should also have an impact.</p>

  <p>The cost of acquiring a site is not included in any option as is made clear in Paragraph 1.3. Actual design and subsequent costs are dependent on the shape and size of site.

  <p>The Executive's Flag Flying Guidelines were first issued in June 2001, following consultations with the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (who were responsible, pre-devolution, for guidance on flags). The Executive's guidelines are revised from time to time to reflect changed circumstances, such as the recent sad deaths of members of the royal family. These guidelines cover all properties under the full control of the Scottish Executive and its agencies. They are freely available to managers of other public buildings, such as local government offices: they reach their own decisions on flag flying on special days.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland apply the Executive guidelines with some minor modifications to reflect the use of their house flag for marketing and branding purposes and also the presence on certain sites of British Army flag stations. Of the agency's 330 properties, 46 are equipped with flagpoles.</p>

  <p>Since their inception the guidelines have provided for the flying of the Saltire alongside the Union flag on all main Executive buildings and agency sites equipped with two or more flagpoles. The recent change means that Historic Scotland sites with only one pole will also fly the Saltire on St Andrew's Day.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer what due diligence was carried out on Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) Ltd prior to it being given a contract for the Scottish Parliament and what indemnity arrangements were put in place.</p>

  <p>Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) was subject to the same due diligence procedures as other successful tenderers. Their ability to perform the contract was based on the professional and financial standing of the parent company, Flour City International, and, for this reason, a Parent Company Guarantee was sought and obtained.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer when it was discovered that there was an issue with mice in the Parliament Headquarters building; what action has been taken to deal with the issue; when staff were, or will be, informed of the situation, and whether other parliamentary accommodation is also experiencing difficulties with mice and, if so, which accommodation.</p>

  <p>A pest control contract has been in place since the Parliament moved into the Parliament Headquarters building (PHQ). This was necessary, as part of planned preventative maintenance, due to the number of restaurants in the surrounding area and the mouse problem in Edinburgh itself. Bait boxes are placed in the most appropriate areas and the contractor visits regularly to check and replenish as necessary.</p>

  <p>There have been few reports of mice within PHQ, the most recent being on the 28 May on the second floor. The contractor attended the following day and installed bait boxes to the affected area. Steps are also being taken to ensure that all waste kept in the garage until uplift is appropriately stored to prevent any encouragement to mice.</p>

  <p>No information has been sent to staff specifically on the subject of mice, but notices have been sent regarding the cleanliness of tea point areas and fridges.</p>

  <p>The FM Helpdesk received a report of a possible sighting of a mouse in Cannonball House on 6 <sup></sup>June. This is the first incident reported within this building and the pest control contractor has been asked to investigate and install bait boxes as required.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer whether a breakdown of foreign trips which the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body has funded in each of the last two years can be provided, detailing the cost of each trip, its purpose and whether reports on the outcome of each trip have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>Details are set out in the attached table of visits in 2000, 2001 and 2002, funded by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB), outwith the United Kingdom by:</p>

  <p>the Presiding Officer, the Deputy Presiding Officers;</p>

  <p>cross-party delegations of members of the Parliament ;</p>

  <p>members travelling abroad on Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) business;</p>

  <p>members nominated to the Council of Europe, the Committee of the Regions and the British Irish Interparliamentary Body, and</p>

  <p>members of committees of the Parliament.</p>

  <p>Travel outwith Scotland by members in an individual capacity is funded through either the Members' Support Allowance or the Members' Travel Allowance, depending on the destination. Information about expenditure under the Allowances scheme is published in the SPCB's Annual Report. Travel by parliamentary staff, other than when accompanying delegations noted in the attached table, is funded from individual directorate staffing budgets. Details are available of the total costs incurred by parliament staff in respect of such travel.</p>

  <p>The External Liaison Unit, in partnership with the Research and Information Group, is continuing to develop the information and communication aspects of the Parliament's external links. Ensuring that reports of parliamentary engagement abroad are as widely available as possible is a key objective.</p>

  <p>Reports of many visits are already available, as marked with an asterisk on the attached table. It has become normal practice for a report to be posted on SPEIR (at Programs/The Intranet/Services/External Liaison Unit/Events Reports) after external visits by the Presiding Officer, by Deputy Presiding Officers, by cross-party delegations of members and after British-Irish Interparliamentary Body Plenary meetings. The aim is that reports on all such forthcoming visits will be posted on SPEIR.</p>

  <p>Reports are made available via SPEIR following most visits involving the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association too. In all cases details are summarised in the CPA branch Annual Report which is circulated to all MSPs.</p>

  <p>Consideration is being given to how information about work done by MSPs nominated to the Committee of the Regions and the Council of Europe can be disseminated more widely in the Parliament.</p>

  <p>There is no practice of providing reports of visits by committees or their members. Such visits, both within and outwith Scotland, are generally related to inquiry work and the results feed into committee reports or discussions.</p>

  <p>The Senior Management Team has recently agreed that reports of external visits or activity by staff should be made widely available and this information will now also be posted on SPEIR.</p>
