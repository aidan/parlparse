  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1O-3292 by Iain Gray on 26 April 2001, whether the asylum liaison officers appointed by Strathclyde Police were in addition to the existing staff complement and what information has been gathered to date through the monitoring of racial incidents by these officers.</p>

  <p>Decisions about the deployment of police officers are for the Chief Constable, but I understand that Strathclyde Police&#8217;s asylum liaison officers have been appointed from the force&#8217;s existing complement of officers. The Scottish Executive does not hold the information gathered by these officers. However, I have asked that the Chief Constable write to the member about this subject.</p>

  <p><i>The same as you?</i> recommended that the Scottish Society for Autism, supported by the National Autistic Society, should bring together all those with an interest, to set up a national service network for children and adults with autistic spectrum disorder.</p>

  <p>The report identifies local and national priorities to improve support for people with an autistic spectrum disorder. These include continuing improvement in early diagnosis; quick access to information, specialist knowledge and training for professionals providing local services, and widening the range and accessibility of specialist services locally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Society for Autism was awarded &#163;16,400 to carry out a mapping exercise to collate information on services currently provided in health, education and social work throughout Scotland. The exercise is due for completion by the end of December 2001.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Public Health Institute for Scotland is carrying out a Scottish Needs Assessment Programme, to look at the role of current services across Scotland, and to identify gaps in provision and development needs. Their report is due in the autumn.</p>

  <p>Following completion of these reports, the remit and membership of the network will be a matter for the Scottish Society for Autism, the National Autistic Society and their partner organisations, in consultation with the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive considers that section 1 (1) (b) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 fully implements the provisions of Article 5 (b) of Council Directive (79/409/EEC) on the Conservation of Wild Birds, in relation to the deliberate destruction of, or damage to, nests and nest sites outwith the breeding season.</p>

  <p>The Executive has not received specific advice from Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) on this subject. However, SNH is currently preparing its response to Scottish Ministers on the implications for Scotland of the recommendations contained in the report of the UK Raptor Working Group (RWG), which calls for an investigation of the legal status of nests outside the breeding season and consideration of any changes to national legislation to protect them.</p>

  <p><i>The Nature of Scotland</i> proposes new offences of reckless disturbance of nesting sites of specially protected species and reckless damage or destruction of nests and eggs.</p>

  <p>All areas in Scotland have structured programmes of oral health education. In Dumfries and Galloway this programme is co-ordinated through the Health Promotion Department. Annually these services contact pre-school, nursery and primary school children. In addition they contact key groups such as carers, general dental practitioners, health visitors to ensure consistent information. Dumfries and Galloway has numerous other programmes highlighting the importance of oral health including a toothbrushing programme which involves over 2,300 children in 24 nursery classes and 48 primary schools.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise are charged with promoting e-business. Both agencies have developed a range of initiatives that encourage businesses to, amongst other things, purchase and sell goods online. A network of ICT local support centres, operating under the UK Online branding, provides support to businesses and aims to help achieve the UK-wide target of having 1 million micro, small and medium-sized enterprises trading online by 2002.</p>

  <p>To help stimulate online purchasing, the Executive is currently considering how adoption of e-procurement methods across the wider Scottish public sector can be facilitated and how they can help drive collaborative procurement.</p>

  <p>For individuals, the Executive is committed to universal access to the web by 2005 and is currently considering what further action is necessary to ensure this is achieved.</p>

  <p>Guidance has been issued to all Scottish Executive staff on their role and conduct during the UK General Election campaign. The guidance emphasises that civil servants should not undertake any activity which could call into question their political impartiality and that they should ensure that public resources are not used for party political purposes. These requirements apply to any information published by the Scottish Executive during the General Election campaign, whether on the Scottish Executive website or otherwise. The guidance has been posted on the Scottish Executive website and copies are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>*The Highlands and Islands Enterprise Area of Operation (Scotland) Order 2001 amended the boundary of Highlands and Islands Enterprise with effect from 1 April 2001. As a result, responsibility for Moray, Badenoch and Strathspey Enterprise (MBSE) now lies solely with Highlands and Islands Enterprise. Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s allocation for MBSE will therefore be transferred to Highlands and Islands Enterprise as part of this year&#8217;s Autumn Budget Review.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has established an Economic Impact Assessment Group to identify the effect which foot-and-mouth disease is having across sectors and areas. The Executive is continuing to seek information on the implications of the outbreak on fundraising activities of voluntary organisations. Whilst the Executive is concerned at any implication the outbreak may have had on the voluntary sector, it has no plans to introduce a compensation scheme.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises that the voluntary sector is playing an important role in helping those most affected by the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak. The Minister for Environment and Rural Development announced on 8 May details of the scheme to match donations by members of the public to voluntary organisations engaged in alleviating distress caused by foot-and-mouth disease in Scotland. The scheme will be administered by Scottish Community Foundation on behalf of the Executive.</p>

  <p>Legislation to introduce a new offence of corporate homicide would be a matter for the Scottish Parliament. However any such legislation is likely to have implications for matters which are reserved such as health and safety and Crown immunity.</p>

  <p>The Home Office published a consultation document last year which proposed the introduction of an offence of corporate homicide, together with the abolition of the common law offence of involuntary manslaughter and its replacement by a hierarchy of three offences of reckless killing, killing by gross carelessness and involuntary homicide. I understand that the Home Office is conducting further analysis of the responses received and working with other government departments to agree the policy for England and Wales.</p>

  <p>We are satisfied that the three offences proposed for England and Wales are adequately covered by the Scottish common law offence of culpable homicide. A complementary approach to the prosecution of companies for corporate homicide throughout the UK would be desirable. Scottish Ministers will therefore await the outcome of the Home Office analysis before considering any proposals for change in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Qualifications Authority has issued 32,263 group award, including HNC and HND, certificates to candidates completing their course of study by 31 July 2000, the end of the academic year. It is not possible to provide a figure for candidates who have not yet received certificates, for two main reasons.</p>

  <p>First, a data matching process to reconcile differences between data held by the SQA and by FE colleges has to be completed. That process is now virtually complete: only one college is outstanding, and the processing of its data has been made a priority.</p>

  <p>Second, SQA has identified a number of cases in which college candidates&#8217; reference numbers, which are intended to be unique, have been at least duplicated. The possibility therefore arises that different elements of group awards for a candidate may be held on different reference numbers. A means of merging such duplicated candidate records is being developed urgently with priority given to cases where a group award may be merited, in order that outstanding certificates may be issued.</p>

  <p>FE colleges will, in most cases, have been able to provide students with their results and with provisional confirmation of their award, if needed by prospective employers or other educational institutions.</p>

  <p>Space restraints within the Parliament Shop ensure that only small selections of any product can be stocked. There are a number of other excellent bookshops in the vicinity and book sales make up less than 5% of total Parliament Shop sales. As a result, the current range is restricted to a limited selection of popular titles.</p>

  <p>As with all shop products, the Retail Manager makes the final decision on which titles are stocked with regard to overall retail suitability within the core market. The general public and visitors make the majority of book purchases from the shop and the range of titles in stock has been selected to appeal mainly to this market. It covers Scottish history, modern political writing, a children&#8217;s section and some fiction. Scottish history is the most popular section. The shop offers a book ordering service to internal customers which can provide most popular titles on any subject within 24 hours of ordering.</p>
