  <p>Under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (DDA), service providers and public authorities are required to make reasonable adjustments to allow access for disabled people. The Scottish Government will ensure that the services that it provides, and the public functions that it delivers, meet the requirements of the DDA. We expect other organisations to do the same.</p>

  <p>Work to ensure disabled people can readily access buildings where the Scottish Government is a major occupier has been on-going for a number of years. Access Audits have been performed for all of our properties and a range of works carried out to improve access for visitors with a disability. A further range of works have been identified to be carried out during the current financial year.</p>

  <p>We also recognise the role that local access panels can play and have provided support to develop their capacity over recent years.</p>

  <p>As indicated in my answer to question S3W-1486 on 19 July 2007, consequential funding is agreed biannually and is dependent on confirmation from HM Treasury that any additional funding announced by departments is new money and has not been reallocated from existing resources. Where consequential funding is received, it is held centrally. Funding is then allocated by the Scottish Government in light of all competing pressures and the government&rsquo;s priorities.</p>

  <p>At the present time there has been no indication of the status of this announcement on support for disabled children.</p>

  <p>The Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Act 2007 will provide a modern, streamlined, efficient and effective vetting and barring system. People who work or volunteer with children and/or protected adults will apply to join the vetting and barring scheme once. Thereafter, their scheme record will be kept up-to-date so that they no longer have to undergo a time-consuming disclosure check each time they change posts. This will be beneficial for the individuals and the organisations they work with including churches, voluntary and charitable organisations. Implementation of the new scheme is on-going with full stakeholder engagement including a Voluntary Sector Issues Group on which churches, voluntary and charitable organisations are represented.</p>

  <p>In the interim, organisations now have the option of applying to Disclosure Scotland direct for free disclosure checks for volunteers in the voluntary sector working with children, young people and vulnerable adults at risk.</p>

  <p>There is no single or commonly agreed definition of dyslexia across Scotland.

  <p>The Scottish Executive is actively working with the European Commission in the development of the European Qualifications Framework (EQF) which aims to be implemented across Europe by 2009. The EQF aims to improve the mobility of individuals and their qualifications by acting as a translation device. By mapping national qualification frameworks to the EQF individuals and employers will be able to understand and compare qualifications across Europe. The Scottish Executive hosted a conference in September 2005 to launch the consultation on the EQF which was instrumental in shaping the proposal. Since then, the Scottish Executive has continued to work alongside the Commission and is currently involved in a number of projects designed to test the EQF.</p>

  <p>Scotland has its own qualifications framework, the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF). The SCQF is one of the leading operational frameworks across Europe and we are well placed to map the SCQF against the EQF once the Recommendation is approved.</p>

  <p>Scotland also takes an active role in the Bologna Process which aims to create greater coherence across the European Higher Education Area (EHEA) by 2010. To facilitate mobility within the EHEA all 46 participating countries have agreed to produce a national qualifications framework. Scotland is one of only two countries that have so far successfully self-certified their Framework for Qualifications of Scottish Higher Education Institutions against the overarching Framework for Qualifications of the EHEA.</p>

  <p>I would refer the Member to the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment&rsquo;s opening speech to the Greener Scotland debate on 13 June 2007. He acknowledged the good work that is being done throughout the public sector but made it clear that we are not doing enough or going forward fast enough. He announced that the Scottish Government will work with its partners to develop and publish a detailed programme to improve the Scottish public sector&rsquo;s environmental and sustainability performance. Cabinet Secretaries and ministers are fully committed to that programme for action both personally and in terms of how they develop their portfolios.</p>

  <p>The public sector duty to promote equality of opportunity for disabled people, which came into force in December 2006, provides an opportunity for public bodies to focus on the needs of disabled people and develop work on independent living. Other recent initiatives also support independent living such as the new national guidance on self-directed support, which was issued in July, and tasks local authorities with developing local infrastructures in order to increase uptake.</p>

  <p>However, the Scottish Government recognises the specific references to independent living in work carried out by the Disability Rights Commission and by the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Equal Opportunities Committee and is currently considering what further steps need to be taken to advance independent living in Scotland and we will announce our plans later in the year.</p>

  <p>We currently support the work of a number of national disability organisations to help us to improve the flow of information to disabled people and disability organisations. For example, the Scottish Government funds a number of organisations to publicise the availability of direct payments for self-directed support including UPDATE, (Scotland&rsquo;s National Disability Information Service), the Scottish Personal Assistant Employers Network (SPAEN) which provides information and support to those individuals interested in employing personal assistants, the Scottish Consortium of Direct Payment Support Organisations (SCDPSO) which provides a forum for direct payments support organisations throughout Scotland to work together, and Contact a Family Scotland for a direct payments information service.</p>

  <p>If there is appropriate justification, licences can be issued for shooting geese outwith the open season. Any change to the shooting season would need to be justified on the basis of evidence and would need to be compatible with the requirements of the EU Wild Birds Directive. Scottish Natural Heritage have agreed to undertake a population assessment of the Western Isles which will provide an essential input to considering whether changes to the season or to other management approaches are necessary or appropriate.</p>

  <p>The official sources for those aged 16 to 19 not in employment, education or training are the Labour Force Survey (LFS) and the Annual Population Survey (APS). However, in a research report carried out by the Training and Employment Research Unit of Glasgow University on behalf of the Scottish Executive it was recommended that a combination of School Leavers Destinations Statistics and Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) benefits information are used to monitor the change at a local level. It is recognised that this measure underestimates the true number of 16 to 19-year-olds not in employment, education or training however it provides a reliable and consistent measure below the national level. Table 1 shows the number of 16 to 19-year-olds entering negative destinations combined with the number of 18 to 19-year-old benefit claimants by local authority.</p>

  <p>Information on school leavers destinations and DWP benefits are not available by Local Enterprise Company. Therefore table 2 shows the estimated number of 16 to 19-year-olds who are not in employment, education or training by local enterprise company taken from the LFS/APS. Data from the LFS/APS are only available by local enterprise company from 2003 onwards. Please note that these estimates are subject to a degree of error.</p>

  <p>Data on the number of people who are aged 16 to 19 and not in employment, education or training by postcode area are not held centrally.</p>
