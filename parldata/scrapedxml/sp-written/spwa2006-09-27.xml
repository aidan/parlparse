  <p>A number of laboratories have the type of equipment necessary to carry out real-time PCR including the Scottish Agricultural Science Agency, which is part of the European Network of GMO Laboratories. The European Commission has circulated a list of private laboratories that the industry has indicated are able to carry out tests for LLRICE601 in the European Union. Three of these are in the UK, although none is in Scotland. Other laboratories may also be in a position to carry out testing. In addition, enforcement authorities across the UK have access to the tests via the public analyst network.</p>

  <p>The provision of adult intensive therapy unit services is a matter for individual health boards. Each board must ensure that an appropriate number of ITU beds is available; however, if all the ITU beds become full, there are arrangements in place for neighbouring boards to offer ITU care. Boards also have contingency plans for the event of large scale emergencies. We expect that good governance and risk management planning should ensure that these services and plans are in place. We consider the current provision to be adequate, and we have no plans to issue guidance on average occupancy rates.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to supporting the Scotch whisky industry&rsquo;s work to protect its reputation and integrity around the world, and will assist where possible in protecting Scotch whisky against all forms of unfair competition. The Scottish Executive and Scotch whisky industry are currently working together on proposals to enhance the protection of Scotch whisky and consumers. The new EU Spirit Drinks Regulation will also improve the protection of Scotch whisky.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers the compulsory registration and ringing of those species of birds listed in Schedule 4 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and the use of this mechanism to confirm that individual birds in captivity have been captive-bred, to be useful means to protect Scotland&rsquo;s wild bird populations from illegal capture and collection.</p>

  <p>The bird registration scheme has generally been regarded as a means of contributing to conservation objectives and has operated on this basis for the past 25 years.</p>

  <p>We propose to issue a consultation paper on the scheme in the near future which will enable respondents to express their views on this and other issues related to the scheme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been involved in discussions with the other UK Administrations following publication of a report from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee with their recommendations for amendments to the list of species included in Schedule 4 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when it expects there to be an announcement by the UK Government on the conclusions of the review of Schedule 4 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 relating to the species of birds which must be registered and ringed if kept in captivity in England and Wales and what plans it has for a similar announcement in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not expect an announcement by the UK Government on the conclusions of the review of Schedule 4 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 until there has been an opportunity for public consultation on the recommendations contained in the report from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee. I expect that a public consultation will be published shortly.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to alter the species listed in, and operation of, Schedule 4 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 relating to the species of birds which must be registered and ringed if kept in captivity in Scotland and whether any such proposals will be subject to consultation with the public or Parliament.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, together with the other UK administrations, has received recommendations from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee regarding possible amendments to Schedule 4 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. These proposals will be subject to public consultation. The Executive will decide in the light of the responses to that consultation whether to bring forward any amendments to Schedule 4 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981.</p>
