  <p>Health boards and NHS Trusts have to plan and deliver services which meet the needs of their local population within the resources allocated to them and taking account of national and local priorities. A patient may require an ultrasound examination or barium x-ray for various clinical reasons, and the priority attached to each case is a matter for the clinical judgement of the doctor concerned. The impact on patient outcomes from differing waiting times for these investigative/diagnostic procedures would depend on the nature of the patient&#8217;s condition at the time of referral.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to improving waiting times, addressing all stages of a patient's care pathway through the Health Service, and to creating greater equity of access across the country.

  <p>There has been record investment in the Health Service in Scotland this year. From &pound;300 million extra allocated to health in Scotland, each health board received a substantial increase above inflation to meet the health care needs of their resident population including any pressure on services which might emerge throughout the year but especially during the winter. A further &pound;2 million was invested in a flu vaccination programme so that the most vulnerable groups, such as the elderly, could be immunised against the flu.</p>

  <p>The Trust reconfiguration process was a managed one and is expected to save &pound;100 million for investment in patient care. Annual savings of &pound;8 million are expected as a direct consequence of the reduction in the number of chief executives and executive directors resulting from the reconfiguration of Trusts from 46 to 28. Early retirement was given to 17 individuals and the redundancy payments made to the chief executives in that group are set out in the table. These payments have been made in accord with the General Whitley Council regulations. The chief executives would also be entitled to immediate payment of pension and lump sum calculated under the NHS Superannuation Scheme regulations. The process has been audited and found to provide value for money.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in the light of the recent publication of reports and recommendations from the NHS Pay Review Body (PRB) and subsequent announcements regarding pay rises for staff covered by the PRB, how it intends to address the issues of recruitment, retention and morale associated with pay settlements for those biomedical scientists within the NHS not covered by the PRB.</p>

  <p>There is no evidence held centrally to suggest any widespread recruitment and retention issues surrounding this staff group.</p>

  <p>However, the recent pay offer to biomedical scientists, if accepted, will mean increases of up to 26% from 1 April 1999 for Trainee MLSOs, 7.1% for MLSO1s and 7.1% for MLSO2s with a further 3.25% for all these groups from April 2000.</p>

  <p>Health boards and NHS Trusts prepared contingency plans, including opening more beds, to increase capacity to cope with extreme seasonal pressures and ensure those who needed emergency care received it. NHS Trusts have been managing the situation by re-scheduling elective surgery to concentrate resources on those most in need. I am aware that Fife Acute Hospitals NHS Trust postponed elective appointments due to the pressure of emergency admissions but I understand elective surgery recommenced on 7 February 2000.</p>

  <p>Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (ME) is a complex condition, which unfortunately is not fully understood, and has, as yet, no definitive diagnostic test to identify it. The difficulties surrounding diagnosis and treatment of ME were recognised in the establishment in 1999 of a Working Group on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) by the Chief Medical Officer at the Department of Health in England. The Working Group has a remit to review current management and clinical practice of CFS/ME with the aim of providing best practice guidance for professionals, patients and carers to improve both the recognition and the quality of care and treatment. The Scottish Executive Health Department has observer representation on the group and is closely monitoring its progress.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will give full and careful consideration to the Report of the Working Group when it becomes available to determine what changes/guidance might be appropriate to current clinical practice and treatment of those with ME in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The figures in the table show those doctors registered with the GMC who at the end of September one year had a contract with the NHS and at the end of September in the following year did not.</p>

  <p>2. There is an element of double counting because some career hospital and community doctors are also GPs, and if they give up one type of work to concentrate on the other they are recorded as leavers.</p>

  <p>3. The figures for GPs are for principals only. Principals who decide to take up non-principal posts are recorded as leavers.</p>

  <p>4. The figures include retirements and deaths in service.</p>

  <p>5. Data generated in this way for doctors in the training grades is not appropriate for this question. It includes the many doctors who leave the NHS temporarily to take up work such as research contracts and work experience in other countries during their development as a doctor for the NHS. The Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education estimates the annual <i>net</i> loss of doctors from the training grades as approximately 200, or 5% of the total number of training grade doctors.</p>

  <p>The report provides a robust evidence base for the management and delivery of infertility services in Scotland. It will also provide equity of access to services and treatment. The report has issued to all health boards and NHS Trusts in Scotland who have been asked to work towards implementation of the report as resources permit.

  <p>Early in 1999, the Government announced the introduction in academic year 2000-01 of a scheme of loans for part-time students in higher education which was welcomed by the Cubie Committee. Scottish domiciled students on low incomes will be able to apply for a loan of up to &pound;500 to cover course expenses. The detail of the scheme will be published shortly. Also, higher education students with a disability are now eligible to apply for the Disabled Students&#8217; Allowance. Since academic year 1998 part-time students in further and higher education who may face particular financial difficulty have been able to apply to their institution for help from the Access Funds. In addition, during 1999-2000, the further education colleges have been provided with additional funds to target at the most needy students, part-time as well as full-time.</p>

  <p>The computer system of the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) already has the capability to handle the changes to tuition fee arrangements. However, some adaptation is needed to cope with the changes to loan entitlement. This work will be included with other system changes which were already planned and designed to enhance service to the public. At this stage the costs of activating the tuition fee payment arrangements cannot be separately identified but are expected to be low. System change costs are met from the Higher Education Vote.</p>

  <p>(v) It is estimated that Scottish residents make a total of around 75 million taxi trips per year, of which about three million are "linked to rail trips" (4% of the taxi trips in the sample were part of a journey for which rail was used as the main mode of travel).</p>

  <p>The NTS's Scottish sample provides information about travel by Scottish residents. It cannot provide information about the use of taxis by others, like tourists from abroad: such information is unavailable.</p>

  <p>Because the NTS's Scottish sample size is not large, and because only a small proportion of journeys involve the use of a taxi, the NTS's Scottish samples for seven years had to be combined in order to obtain a sample of taxi trips which was large enough to produce these statistics. As with all surveys, the results could be affected by factors such as sampling variability and non-response bias.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and the UK Government will shortly be publishing a road safety strategy for the period to 2010. The strategy will underpin new and challenging targets for casualty reductions which will build on the progress already made. Fatal and serious casualties in Scotland have halved since the early 1980s.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will continue to provide funds to the Scottish Road Safety Campaign for the development of road safety education and publicity materials, including the current &quot;Foolspeed&quot; campaign. It will also continue to fund the operation of the Children&#8217;s Traffic Club in Scotland, to ensure that road safety education is available free to all three- and four-year-old children in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive reviews annually accidents on trunk roads and investigates clusters of accidents at particular locations and routes with high accident rates. This enables necessary remedial measures to be carried out.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether water and sewerage charges for domestic customers in the North of Scotland Water Authority area will increase in 2000-01 and, if so, by how much; whether it considers any such increases to be excessive, and what steps it will take to protect the public from such increases.</p>

  <p>I announced my decisions on the strategic review of charges to Parliament on 26 January 2000. As I made clear then, the larger increase for the north is based on a fundamental reassessment by the authority of the investment that it needs to meet its statutory obligations. Both the Commissioner&#8217;s advice and my determination on charges were published then. It is now for each authority to submit its annual charges scheme to the Water Industry Commissioner for approval.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will set up a public inquiry, convened in Inverness, to inquire into the North of Scotland Water Authority&#8217;s financial planning, in particular relating to projected revenue and expenditure, and whether it will guarantee that all information relevant to any such inquiry will be made publicly available.</p>

  <p>These matters have already been reviewed. At my request, NoSWA commissioned a review of its corporate planning process. The Authority published the report of the review in January 2000 and is implementing its recommendations. In addition, the Water Industry Commissioner has carried out a strategic review of charges in all three water authorities for the period 2000-02, which encompassed their projected capital investment programmes and revenues. This advice and the Executive&#8217;s decisions on charges were also published in January 2000.</p>

  <p>In my statement on 26 January, I announced the results of the strategic review of water charges for the period April 2000 to March 2002. I also announced that I have asked my officials to consider whether we can improve on the protection already given to many low-income households through the linkage between water charges and Council Tax banding.</p>

  <p>The Local Consultation (New Water and Sewerage Authorities) Direction 1998 requires the water authorities to consult statutory and other bodies that represent interests in the local communities affected by the authorities' operations. It came into force on 24 August 1998 and provides the basis for local consultation and accountability by the authorities. The Executive has not judged it necessary to supplement the Direction with any additional guidance. <br /></p>
