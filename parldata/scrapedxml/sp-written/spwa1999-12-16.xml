  <p>I attended the Council of Agriculture Ministers in Brussels on 14 December as part of the United Kingdom delegation. The Council discussed a number of issues of significance to the Scottish agriculture industry.</p>

  <p>The Council decided on a 12 month postponement of the introduction of compulsory labelling of beef in the light of information that the majority of Member States were not yet able to implement the measure effectively. The precise legal form of the measure will depend on the terms of the European Parliament&#8217;s Opinion on the Commission proposal, which is expected to be available later this week.</p>

  <p>The Council also decided unanimously to defer for six months implementation of a 1997 Decision on Community-wide measures controlling specified risk material, pending agreement on a new Decision.</p>

  <p>The Council discussed changes to the level of export refunds for processed agricultural products and agreed that in future changes required to meet budgetary and WTO limits should be governed by a strategic and targeted approach rather than by across the board cuts in refund rates. It is intended that this strategy should be developed so that it can be adopted by March 2000 at the latest. UK Agriculture Ministers endorsed the Council&#8217;s proposed approach and expressed regret at the decisions taken so far by the Commission to apply across the board refund cuts.</p>

  <p>In addition, Commission Byrne reported to the Council on food safety matters, including the response to the dioxin crisis and the Commission&#8217;s plans for food safety more generally. Commissioner Fischler reported on the recent WTO Ministerial meeting in Seattle and on new Commission proposals for reform of the CAP cotton regime.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, following the lifting of the beef on the bone ban and in the light of remarks made by Sir David Carter, the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland, to the Rural Affairs Committee on 5 October 1999, it now intends to end the requirement for the spinal cords to be removed from ewe carcasses.</p>

  <p>The requirement for spinal cords to be removed from ewe carcasses is one of a range of precautionary public health measures introduced in the wake of the emergence of BSE in the UK cattle herd. The requirement will be relaxed only when expert scientific advice indicates that it would be safe to do so. The current advice is that this measure should remain in place for the time being. The Executive will continue to be guided by such advice.</p>

  <p>We are closely involved with the development of the EU Directive on this matter which was discussed at the EU Environment Council which I attended in Brussels earlier this week. Many of the key elements of strategic environmental assessment will be taken forward by my Ministerial Group on sustainable development about which I shall make a fuller statement to Parliament in the New Year.</p>

  <p>The Council reached a common position on a proposal for a<i> </i>Directive for the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment (commonly known as Strategic Environmental Assessment). This would seek to provide a high level of protection of the environment and through integration of environmental considerations into plans and programmes with a view to promoting sustainable development. This Directive is compatible with our Programme for Government commitment to introduce strategic environmental assessment for our Government programmes. We succeeded in ensuring that the scope of the proposed Directive is as clearly defined as possible.</p>

  <p>Two other common positions were reached. On a proposal for a second air quality Daughter Directive which will set limit values for benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air to ensure a high level of protection for human health. We supported this proposal whose limit values are close to the targets we have already set in the UK&#8217;s draft Air Quality Strategy. Also, on a proposal for a Council recommendation to set minimum criteria for inspection tasks carried out at Member State level to ensure consistent application and enforcement of Community environmental legislation. The criteria were accompanied by guidance on ways in which their practical application could be monitored by Members States. We supported the proposal which will enable Scotland to continue a risk-based approach to inspections, raising the standard of environmental inspections whilst ensuring bureaucracy is minimised.</p>

  <p>Council conclusions were agreed on the Global Assessment of the Fifth Environmental Action Programme (which has been the framework of EU environmental policy over the last six years) and a set of Headline Indicators. The Assessment will inform the development of the Sixth Environment Action Programme which will set out the environmental priorities over the next decade. We conveyed our view that the Sixth Action programme should set future environmental policy within a wider context, where environmental, social and economic objectives are pursued in a mutually reinforcing way.</p>

  <p>A progress report was considered on the proposed National Emission Ceilings Directive which aims to limit emissions of acidifying and eutrophying pollutants and ozone precursors, by setting national emission ceilings (NECS) not to be exceeded after 2010.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Council received a Commission report on a chemicals strategy, following a review of the existing EU regulatory framework which has become increasingly complex. The aims of the strategy are to maintain a high level of protection of human health and the environment, to raise the confidence of the public in chemicals management and to ensure compliance with the regulations of the internal market. A Communication will be presented next summer setting out the options for a new comprehensive regulatory system and, to ensure a smooth transition, to speed up the current system for assessing chemicals currently in use.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Inshore Fisheries Advisory Group (SIFAG), agreed at its recent meeting to convene a meeting devoted to the ASP issue, early in the new year. In addition to the Marine Laboratory Aberdeen, the Sea Fish Industry Authority, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and fishing industry interests, which are all members of SIFAG, invitations will be sent to the Scallop Association, the Association of Scottish Shellfish Growers, the Live Shellfish Traders Association and the Scottish Fish Merchants Federation. The meeting will look at issues such as the current ASP testing and monitoring regime, research into the causes of ASP, and future means of securing the long term sustainability of those businesses that have been affected by the ban.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) of the Scottish Executive Health Department is currently funding two research projects on asthma treatment with a total value of nearly &pound;0.6 million. Details of these studies are available from the National Research Register (NRR), a copy of which is in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>The CSO also allocates some &pound;29 million annually to the NHS in Scotland for research and some of this will be used for asthma-related research.</p>

  <p>The main focus of the section on children's health in the 1998 Scottish Health Survey was on asthma.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department maintains contact with the National Asthma Campaign (Scotland), which receives grant support under section 16B of the NHS (Scotland) Act 1978, and from time to time issues general guidance on the treatment of asthma. Strategies for the day-to-day treatment of asthma are however a matter for health boards, which are funded to meet the health needs of all people in their areas.</p>

  <p>I will be meeting representatives of the National Asthma Campaign (Scotland) soon to discuss asthma issues with them.</p>

  <p>Discharge planning is a matter primarily for Health Boards, NHS Trusts and Local Authorities to ensure that people who no longer require acute treatment and care can be discharged into more appropriate settings. The NHS and Local Authorities work jointly to ensure that all continuing care needs are addressed before discharge. This joint working approach is the most effective means of achieving safe and appropriate discharges. Delays can arise for a variety of reasons and most NHS Trusts will experience delayed discharges. A key aim of the planning process is also to provide care and treatment to people in their own homes, where appropriate, to avoid admission to hospital.</p>

  <p>In the current financial year, the total value of contracts for lung transplants and combined heart and lung transplants for Scottish residents at transplant centres in England is &pound;826,000. This includes the costs of assessment and follow-up visits for patients who have previously received transplants at these centres. The number of patients receiving lung or heart and lung transplants varies from year to year, but on average about 20 patients would be expected to receive transplants each year. The average cost of the agreements per transplant is &pound;41,300. However, it should be noted that this includes the cost of assessment and follow-up visits for previous transplant patients.</p>

  <p>Patients and relatives who accompany them can claim travel and subsistence costs which will be reimbursed by their health boards if they are on income support. However, we do not have figures centrally for the expenditure by health boards on these costs.</p>

  <p>Primary responsibility for ensuring the public health of the people of Shortlees rests with Ayrshire &amp; Arran Health Board, who keep the matter under continuing review.

  <p>Section 21 of the Disability Discrimination Act requires that people with disabilities are given reasonable access to goods and services and this includes all NHS services.</p>

  <p>A good practice guide to support the implementation of section 21 within the NHS in Scotland was issued to all Health Boards and NHS Trusts by the Deputy Minister for Communities under cover of a Management Executive Letter of 10 September 1999.</p>

  <p>This provides essential background and guidance for senior NHS managers with specific responsibility for advising on access for disabled patients to services and includes a section on deaf and hard of hearing people.</p>

  <p>A copy of the guide entitled <i>Equality for disabled people in the NHS in Scotland</i> and a training video about the needs of deaf and hard of hearing people using hospital services, which also issued with the guide, have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>We plan to review the implementation of the Sex Offenders Act next year, with a view to amending and strengthening its provisions. The issue of extending the requirement to register to sex offenders who commit and are convicted of offences abroad, together with sex offenders convicted here who travel abroad, will be considered as part of the review. We intend to consult the agencies involved in operating the Act, which includes the courts, the police, the prison service, local authorities, housing and health authorities. Consideration will also be given to wider consultation. As this is a United Kingdom Act, we will also be consulting the Home Office, who have commissioned a research report into the effectiveness of the Act in England and Wales which is due to be completed by the end of this year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s expenditure plans for 1998-99 and 1999-2000 provided for an increase in staff numbers in its core Departments of somewhere around 250 staff, depending on grade mix. The increase in business relating to parliamentary proceedings, including parliamentary questions, is being handled by staff working in the relevant policy areas: additional staff have not been employed solely to prepare answers to parliamentary questions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ministers have decided to refuse consent for Fife Electric&#8217;s application. This decision has been taken after careful consideration of the Report of the public local inquiry into the application. It is founded on the Reporters&#8217; recommendation that consent be refused, and particularly on their unresolved concerns about visual amenity and about the lack of environmental information available to the inquiry on the availability of process water, road and rail access, noise, potential safety hazards and decommissioning, which they considered could have direct, indirect and cumulative local effects on the environment. A copy of my Department&#8217;s decision letter will be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>Scotland&#8217;s prison population will vary in line with crime rates, convictions and the sentences imposed by the courts. The Scottish Executive does not directly control prison population numbers, but does aim to provide a range of non-custodial sanctions for those whose offences do not merit imprisonment.</p>

  <p>As outlined in my statement of 7 December, my officials are now in the process of writing to every cattle producer in Scotland with outline details of the new beef schemes introduced under Agenda 2000. Full details of all new schemes will be provided as soon as they are made available by the European Union. My Department is about to go to consultation on the introduction of the Rural Development Regulation.</p>

  <p>I refer you to my answer to your previous question, and my statement of 7 December. Guidance had not previously been issued because final details of the various schemes had not been provided by the European Commission. However, outline details of the new beef schemes are now being distributed to all beef producers in Scotland, and final details of all new measures will be issued as soon as they are available.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government over a range of matters, including those relating to the Post Office. As Rural Affairs Minister, I am well aware of the importance of local post offices for many rural communities throughout Scotland. I have made it clear that I support the maintenance of an extensive rural post office network.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will confirm that the discounting of the tolls collected on the Skye Bridge at double the rate of inflation will mean that the length of the concession will be extended by at least three years, and will give Skye Bridge Ltd an extra profit of &pound;10 million.</p>

  <p>The contract signed in 1991, properly separates discounting and inflation. It provides that toll revenue collected each year is adjusted to 1991 prices using the actual change in the Retail Price Index and is discounted at 6% in real terms. Discounting is necessary so that the costs and benefits of a project are assessed on a constant basis. Six per cent is the Government&#8217;s standard rate of discount (serving as both a cost of capital and a rate of time preference for expenditure).</p>

  <p>The concession will end when the sum of &pound;23.64 million (in 1991 prices, discounted as detailed above) has been collected in tolls, or after 27 years, whichever is sooner. Based on current usage the concession is expected to end between 2009 and 2013. The actual end date depends on income generated by future traffic levels.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is not currently in negotiations with the two local authorities who are leading the projects. Level Playing Field Support will be given provided that in each case a contract is signed before 31 March 2002 and the project is approved as a PPP scheme for capital consent purposes in terms of Section 94 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973. The latter will be dependent on the local authority providing the Executive with a full business case and confirmation from their external auditor that the project is off the authority&#8217;s balance sheet.</p>
