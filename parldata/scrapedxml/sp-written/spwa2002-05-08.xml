  <p>I refer to the information sent to the Public Petitions Committee on 29 August 2001, which indicated, by health board area, the location of pain management clinics and the range of services provided. I am not aware of any significant change since this information was produced. No specific information is available on how services for chronic pain sufferers address the needs of carers.</p>

  <p>The Breathing Space helpline provides confidential advice and support, as well as suggestions of services which callers may find useful in their own locality. The helpline operators have access to an extensive database of statutory and voluntary services, which is updated regularly so that, where necessary, callers can be referred to agencies and organisations best suited to their particular needs. Breathing Space does not provide counselling services, but some of the wide range of bodies, to which callers can be referred, do provide counselling.</p>

  <p>The group was set up to implement the recommendations in the Lord Advocate&#8217;s working group&#8217;s report. It has set up three sub-groups examining, respectively, support for child witnesses through the investigative and criminal justice processes, the pre-trial gathering of evidence from child witnesses, and the development of guidance on the questioning of child witnesses in court. Our recently published consultation paper on vulnerable witnesses will be very relevant to the work of the last of these sub-groups. Each sub-group is working to a particular timetable and will consult as required on its developing conclusions.</p>

  <p>Overall, the work of the implementation group should be completed early in 2003 and we will provide a further report to the Parliament at that stage.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to review sections 51 and 52 of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982. We have not received any indication from either the police or Crown Office that the current legislation is causing difficulties. However, the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill will increase the maximum penalties available to the courts to 10 years for taking and distributing indecent images of children and to five years for possession, which are both offences under the 1982 act.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-24633 on 23 April 2002. I also wrote to the Minister for Europe, Peter Hain, on 23 April seeking close working arrangements between the UK government and the devolved administrations on the matter of representation. The Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Service was also able to raise the matter with Mr Hain in London on 25 April.</p>
