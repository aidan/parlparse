  <p>The Scottish Executive monitors the projections of three independent economic forecasters: Cambridge Econometrics, Fraser of Allander Institute and Experian Business Strategies. We work closely with each of these organisations in sharing information and assessments of Scottish, UK and global economic activity. We feel that the most appropriate role of the Scottish Executive is to concentrate our resources on producing the most robust and timely estimates of Scottish economic activity and these, in turn, feed into the independent forecasters models and projections.</p>

  <p>The powers of the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament are defined in the Scotland Act. The Executive&#8217;s overarching approach to economic development is set out in the <em>Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</em> , published in June 2000. My reply to S2W-5814 on 9 February 2004 sets out current developments in this area, but one of the key underpinning principals to the framework is to recognise the impact policies in all areas of the Executive&#8217;s competence have on economic development.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive at what point in the negotiations at the December EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council the UK delegation ceased to make the requirement that the 10% reduction in the west of Scotland nephrops quota, introduced at the December 2000 Council, be reinstated and why this was not pursued as a key requirement.</p>

  <p>We believe that there is a credible scientific argument for restoring the 10% cut in the West of Scotland nephrops total allowable catch (TAC). However, our arguments were hampered because the scientific advice from the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) does not currently support such an increase and associated catch statistics suggest that the industry does not catch its existing quota in full.</p>

  <p>Data on the total number of retirements to local authority pension schemes has been collected by the Scottish Executive since 1998-99. Data on the number of retirements due to ill-health is only available at the Scotland level from 2000-01. The table below presents figures from these years to 2002-03, the latest year for which data are available.</p>

  <p>Note: These figures exclude teachers, police service and fire service staff as they have separate pension schemes.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that some employees of Scottish local authorities may not be members of a local authority pension scheme. Data on all retirements from local authorities are not held centrally.</p>
