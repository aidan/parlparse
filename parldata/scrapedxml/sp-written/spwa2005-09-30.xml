  <p>The EU Directive on biofuels (2003/30/EC) requires member states to set indicative targets for biofuel sales by 2010, with a reference value of 5.75% of all petrol and diesel sold for transport purposes. A target has not yet been set for the UK.</p>

  <p>With the Department for Transport, we are currently considering how best to meet the requirements of the Directive. This includes liaison with them on the consideration of a possible introduction of a Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO). A RTFO could provide a mechanism to ensure the gradual substitution of fossil fuels for biofuels - and other renewable transport fuels - over the long-term. However, no decisions have been taken on this as yet.</p>

  <p>The stocking of biofuels is a commercial matter for fuel manufacturers and retailers. However, the Scottish Executive has provided funding of &pound;1.2 million through a Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) grant towards the construction near Motherwell of Scotland&rsquo;s first large scale biodiesel plant by the Argent Group. The plant became operational earlier this year and produces biodiesel from a variety of raw materials, including used cooking oils and animal fats - material previously considered waste. The plant is now fully operational, and we expect that this will lead to increased availability of this fuel in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, we expect the 20 pence per litre fuel duty differential for biodiesel, introduced by the UK Government in July 2002, and a similar differential for bioethanol, introduced in January this year, will help to stimulate sales of biofuels in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Crofters Commission does not have a duty to impose a tenant on any croft owner. The commission may require any croft owner (whether or not the owner is an absentee) to submit proposals for re-letting a vacant croft. If the owner fails to do so or the commission refuses to approve these proposals then the commission may re-let the croft. As a matter of policy, the commission has exercised it&rsquo;s discretion by not asking for re-letting proposals where the croft is occupied by either the former croft tenant or any successor in title to that former tenant.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has ordered approximately 1.3 million courses of oseltamivir (known as Tamiflu), an antiviral medicine (not a vaccine) which may reduce deaths and complications from flu, as part of the UK contract for delivery over the next two financial years. This will enable us to treat one in four of the population &ndash; the proportion which the WHO recommends we plan for. If there are insufficient supplies, anti-virals will be provided according to the same priorities as for vaccination, as set out in the Influenza Pandemic Contingency Plan.</p>

  <p>As stated in the plan, the effectiveness of anti-viral treatment in a pandemic is not known.</p>

  <p>Plans have been in place since 1997, and a newly updated UK Health Department&rsquo;s UK Influenza Pandemic Contingency Plan, taking into account the latest available information, was published on the 1 March 2005. A version reflecting organisational arrangements in Scotland was published on the Scottish Executive website at the same time.</p>

  <p>Measures in the plan include informing the public about the likely risks of a pandemic and what they should do and being prepared to take steps to reduce the risk of spread such as advising against certain travel, possibly closing schools and cancelling events where large crowds gather.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive wants to keep people informed about the risks of a pandemic and what is being done to minimise the impact it would have. That is why the contingency plan has been published. The Scottish Executive recognises that improving preparedness is an on-going process. Issuing the plan and seeking feedback is an important step in this work. Plans will continue to be updated as appropriate.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working closely with Health Departments across the UK to prepare for pandemic influenza.</p>

  <p>Until the pandemic influenza strain is identified, it will not be possible to produce a vaccine. However, the Scottish Executive has decided, on the advice of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, the expert group which advises the UK Health Departments on issues relating to immunisation and vaccination, that it would be prudent as a precautionary measure to purchase a small quantity of a vaccine against the current H5N1 strain. 270,000 doses are being ordered for priority groups, such as NHS workers.</p>

  <p>The Executive is working closely with the UK Government and the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) to develop a comprehensive adaptation strategy to ensure Scotland as a whole is prepared for the threats posed by climate change. More specific research, including on wave heights, has been carried out by The Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research with the involvement of the University of the Highlands and Islands. One of the focus areas considered in this study was the west of Scotland, including the Western Isles. The report is available at:</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises that the coast of Scotland is a complex environment where many of the interactions between natural processes and human activities are not always well understood.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage consider the use of dune fencing as one of a wide range of coast protection methods. These are reviewed in <em>A guide to managing coastal erosion in beach/dune systems </em>(SNH 2000), available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.snh.org.uk/publications/on-line/heritagemanagement/erosion/index.shtml" target="_blank">http://www.snh.org.uk/publications/on-line/heritagemanagement/erosion/index.shtml</a>.</p>

  <p>This manual has been distributed to local authorities and other interested parties in Scotland, to assist them in their management of dune systems.</p>

  <p>The Executive provides support to participants in agri-environment schemes for the provision of temporary fencing to assist the management of areas of conservation interest on their land. This includes dunes and areas planted with marram grass. Electric fencing is used where grazing animals are believed to be causing damage to dune-building plants to encourage their regeneration.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S2W-19383 on 30 September 2005. which outlines the existing arrangements for the provision of coastal flood warning schemes. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search engine for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>As far as improvements to the system are concerned, the Executive, in conjunction with the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), is considering a review of coastal flood risk arrangements and the value of additional coastal flood warning schemes for all Scottish coastal areas. SEPA recently met with the Environment Agency&rsquo;s Tidal Forecasting User Group following which it was confirmed that there would be a benefit to including Scotland in the Storm Tide Forecasting Service alerts currently issued for England and Wales. SEPA is now part of a pilot scheme to trial this service for Scotland.</p>

  <p>It is for Scottish local authorities to identify areas at risk from high sea levels. Where such areas are identified, the local authority can ask the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) to consider installing a flood warning scheme.</p>

  <p>To date SEPA has installed one formal coastal flood warning scheme, for the Firth of Clyde. Warnings for this area are issued to the Police, Fire Brigade, Marine Coastguard Agency and to some or all of the relevant local authorities depending on the areas forecast to be affected by the high sea levels. On receipt of a flood warning, the emergency services and local authorities implement their flooding response plans.</p>

In addition, meetings were held in Orkney and Shetland to allow for detailed discussion with key interests and stakeholders, and further meetings were subsequently held with livestock interests about the draft service specification, in particular with the Northern Isles Livestock Transportation Working Group. A report on the consultation exercise was published on the Executive website in September 2004.

  <p>In general, the development of such coastal shipping services is a commercial matter for shipping operators to consider. We do, however, have a role in circumstances where financial support is necessary to maintain essential lifeline services to island communities, which is why we are currently re-tendering the Northern Isles ferry contract and tendering for a new Northern Isles lift-on lift-off freight contract.</p>

  <p>We have had no discussions with any shipping operators about shipping services from Scotland to Iceland or the Faroes.</p>

  <p>New and improved ferry links to Europe have the potential to increase trade and tourism and take lorry traffic off busy Scottish routes. However, such services must prove commercially viable if they are to succeed as our ability to offer financial support is limited. We shall be considering all possible means of encouraging new developments, in line with our Partnership Agreement commitment to improve ferry links to Europe, including the possibility of Freight Facilities Grant or the Waterborne Freight Grant, where a new service would reduce lorry miles.</p>

  <p>The Management Plan for the Old and New Towns of Edinburgh World Heritage Site was launched in July. It was prepared by Edinburgh World Heritage, which is charged with taking forward the implementation of the Management Plan with the support of key partners, including Scottish ministers and the City of Edinburgh Council. Archives and data collections are important tools in recording, managing and understanding any historic site and their maintenance has been recognised as an important objective in promoting an understanding of the Site in the Management Plan. For the Edinburgh World Heritage Site, these are held by a number of bodies including the City of Edinburgh Council, Historic Scotland, RCAHMS and the Edinburgh World Heritage Trust. Edinburgh World Heritage is currently preparing the first action plan, which will identify how the objectives set out in the management plan are to be addressed. Scottish ministers, through Historic Scotland, will be consulted on the action plan.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what measures are being implemented to increase the conviction rate of individuals who have committed rape and how the effectiveness of the measures will be assessed.</p>

  <p>The role of the prosecution in criminal proceedings is to ensure that all relevant and admissible evidence is presented to the court. It is for juries in solemn proceedings to determine the verdict in individual cases and conviction statistics are not, therefore, a measure of the success or otherwise of the quality of the prosecution.</p>

  <p>In order to ensure that the prosecution fulfils its role effectively, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) embarked on a review of the investigation and prosecution of rape and other sexual offences at the end of last year. The principal aim of the review is to make recommendations for the improvement of prosecution policy and practice to ensure that the prosecution deliver a high standard of service in these cases.</p>

  <p>The COPFS review is working closely with experts in this field and in close liaison with the Scottish Law Commission's review of the law in this area and a parallel review being conducted by the Association of Chief Police Officers of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The review will report to the Lord Advocate and, subject to consideration by him, the implementation of appropriate recommendations will commence in 2006. Measures to assess the effectiveness of changes to policy and practice will be identified in the implementation programme. Whether conviction rates in rape cases will increase will ultimately be determined by juries.</p>

  <p>Feedback has been gathered from the LMC Stakeholder Group which represents a wide range of industry and environmental bodies, and from other interested parties. It is intended to make minimal changes to the Menu Scheme for 2006. Work has been commissioned to review the first year of the Menu Scheme, and this includes a detailed analysis of the applications and focus groups with farmers. This will inform any more substantial changes to Tier 2 for 2007, as part of the introduction of LMCs in full.</p>

  <p>The Menu Scheme enables land managers to carry out measures up to the limit of their individual allowance. The share of a common grazing contributes to this allowance at present and will continue to do so next year. From 2007, Tier 3 of LMCs will enable groups, such as common grazing committees, to work together on measures where appropriate. This is currently feasible under existing agri-environment schemes.</p>

  <p>Comprehensive requirements for dealing with winter weather problems on trunk roads are contained in the contracts with the four trunk road Operating Companies. Each year the Operating Companies are required to translate these into Winter Maintenance Plans (WMPs) which are scrutinised by the Performance Audit Group (PAG) and approved by the Scottish Executive. Copies of the WMPs for 2004-05 are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. numbers 34250, 34251, 34252 and 34254).</p>

  <p>The Design, Build, Finance and Operate (DBFO) contracts for the A74(M) between Millbank (Junction 12) and the Scottish Border and the M77 between Malletsheugh (Junction 5) and Meiklewood Interchange, operated by Autolink and Connect, respectively, contain similar requirements for dealing with winter weather which are also translated into WMPs. The WMPs are scrutinised by PAG for the Autolink contract and Renfrewshire Council for the Connect contract.</p>

  <p>The WMPs for 2005-06 have recently been approved and copies will be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 37611) in the near future.</p>

  <p>The Youth Pact aims to improve the education and training of young Europeans and to integrate policies aimed at young people fully into the Lisbon process. The pact acknowledges that it can only succeed with the involvement of regional and local authorities and others and proposes actions in three areas: Employment, integration and social advancement; Education, training and mobility; Reconciliation of working life and family life. The Executive fully supports the Communication from the Commission to the Council published on 30 May 2005 that proposes measures for implementation of the Youth Pact. In Scotland, our priorities already reflect these measures well. Examples include democratic citizenship where &quot;Values and Citizenship&quot; are embedded across the entire school curriculum via the fourth of our five National Priorities in Education and our strategies for enterprise and lifelong learning, which have expanded the opportunities on offer to young people beyond school age. Supporting young people into education, training and employment are pivotal in achieving the Lisbon goals.</p>
