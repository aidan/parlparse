  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that Article 42 (5) of Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003 allows member states to tackle disadvantages faced by groups of farmers, such as Scotland&rsquo;s deer farmers who do not receive the single farm payment, and, if so, whether it will act in response to the concerns of deer farmers and use this article to support deer farmers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that deer farmers in Scotland are at a competitive disadvantage compared with those in England as they do not receive the single farm payment and, if so, what action it will take to put the Scottish deer farming sector on a level playing field with England.</p>

  <p>The national reserve provision allows member states limited scope to assist farming if there is a risk of land abandonment or in order to compensate for specific disadvantages. It has not, so far, been possible to make a case for deer farmers that meets all the conditions for the national reserve set out in the legislation, even under the latest version (EC/73/2009).</p>

  <p>However, an inquiry into future support for agriculture in Scotland has begun, which will look in particular at the single farm payment, and a report is due next year. Deer farmers can also apply for support under a range of other government-funded schemes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not intend to issue a code of practice specifically on the welfare of racing greyhounds. A code of practice on the welfare of dogs will be issued later in the year and much of the advice in that code will be appropriate for racing greyhounds. Practical guidance on track safety and other matters is available from the Greyhound Board of Great Britain.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is funding several initiatives to make sure local authorities have access to the best information and tools to build their capacity to adapt, or prepare for a changing climate. These include &pound;185,500 in 2009-10 and &pound;200,000 in 2010-11 to develop the Scottish Climate Change Impact Partnership - a free information and resource hub for local authorities and other organisations in Scotland. The Scottish Government is also providing 50,159 Euros in match funding to the CoastAdapt project. The project will investigate &quot;adaptation to climate change in coastal communities and habitats on Europe&rsquo;s Northern Periphery&quot; and is being delivered as part of the Northern Periphery Programme 2007-13. Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is the lead partner for Scotland in this international partnership.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also part funds the UK Climate Impacts Programme (UKCIP) to coordinate scientific research into the impacts of a changing climate, and to help organisations adapt to those unavoidable impacts. This means that Scottish local authorities have access to world-leading climate projections to help them prepare for the unavoidable consequences of climate change.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also funding, in partnership with the UK Government, the development of a UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (CCRA) to improve our understanding of the consequences of likely climate change.</p>

  <p>More specifically, the Scottish Government is providing up to &pound;200,000 to Comhairle nan Eilean Siar for a hydrodynamics study of coastal processes at the South Ford. This will inform the Council&rsquo;s policies on coastal erosion and adaptation on South Uist and Benbecula.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, along with colleagues from Northern Ireland, England, and Wales are unaware of any incidents of microchips being wiped prior to animals being abandoned.</p>

  <p>Microchips to be used under the new horse passport regulations must adhere to internationally recognised ISO standards covering radio frequency identification (RFID). RFID chips are not magnetically encoded; therefore magnets or tape erasers will not affect the chip. This is the same technology that has been used for several years with the pet travel scheme where no problem of erased data has been detected.</p>

  <p>The future of the Less Favoured Area Support Scheme (LFASS) post-2010 has already been subject to a full public consultation. Following an analysis of the consultation responses, it was the consensus view that LFASS payments must be linked to activity. At the combined CAP/LFASS stakeholder meeting held on 16 June, it was agreed that a small technical working group would be set up. The purpose of this group will be for members to look closely at the more detailed rules of the scheme, including a definition of the active farming requirement.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government provides funding to the independent environmental charity Keep Scotland Beautiful (KSB).</p>

  <p>KSB carries out surveys of all award winning beaches each summer for cleanliness in line with the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and the Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse (COPLAR).</p>

  <p>There are four standards of beach cleanliness. These are: cleanliness grade A (no litter or refuse), cleanliness grade B (predominantly free of litter), cleanliness grade C (consistent distribution of litter and refuse) and cleanliness grade D (heavily littered with significant accumulations). Beaches should achieve at least a grade B at all times. When they drop below this standard they must be returned to at least a grade B within a set timescale.

  <p>The Environmental Protection Act 1990 (the act) places a duty on various bodies to clear litter from their land. For many beaches the duty body is the local authority. However, as independent organisations how they fulfil that duty and with what resources is for each local authority to determine, provided they meet the standards in the Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse (COPLAR).</p>

  <p>COPLAR provides practical guidance on the discharge of duties imposed on Scottish local authorities and other duty bodies by the act to keep specified land clear of litter and refuse.</p>

  <p>COPLAR was published by Scottish ministers in December 2006 following a revision of the litter and fly tipping provisions of the act. COPLAR helps to explain who has a duty to clean public places, what their responsibility is, how individuals can tell if a place is clean, and what to do if you don&rsquo;t think public places are of an acceptable standard in terms of litter and fly tipping.</p>

  <p>Major amendments to the code included a greater focus on beach cleansing standards and guidance on issuing fixed penalty notices. Further information, including an electronic copy of COPLAR is available from <a href="http://www.littercode.co.uk/." target="_blank">http://www.littercode.co.uk/.</a></p>

  <p>This website is operated by the independent environmental charity Keep Scotland Beautiful.</p>

  <p>However that the duty to clean beaches extends only to above the high water mark and litter from ships and marine installations is the responsibility of the UK Government.</p>

  <p>The Marine (Scotland) Bill includes proposals for a new system of marine planning including new powers to define Scottish marine regions for which a local marine plan should be prepared in consultation with stakeholders. The proposals also include provisions for the co-ordination of plans covering the terrestrial and marine environment.

  <p>To help tackle the issue the Scottish Government continues to provide funding to the independent environmental charity Keep Scotland Beautiful (KSB) who run a number of anti-litter campaigns designed to raise public awareness of the problem. KSB also coordinate a number of other programmes, including the Blue Flag award scheme and the Seaside Award.</p>

  <p>In April, KSB once again ran their annual month long &quot;National Spring Clean&quot; campaign. The 2009 campaign has proven to be a great success, with a record level of almost 58,000 people volunteering to participate in clean-up events across Scotland. Coastal clean-up events proved to be very popular, with 80 such events involving a total of 8,665 volunteers talking place. Overall, enough litter was collected across Scotland to fill almost 29,000 wheelie bins. While many groups already take part in voluntary clean ups organised by KSB during the rest of the year, National Spring Clean provides an opportunity for schools, youth clubs, environmental organisations, voluntary groups, community gatherings and businesses to play an important part in a bigger, coordinated campaign.</p>

  <p>KSB, through the two beach award schemes, the Blue Flag and the Seaside Award, also encourages beach managers to provide information about beach litter and its impacts at all award beach information boards to raise public awareness of the problems.</p>

  <p>Through the Scottish Bathing Water Litter Grant Scheme we are also tackling the litter problem at bathing waters and their beaches. The grant scheme, administered by KSB on our behalf, aims to encourage communities to carry out clean-ups of beaches close to bathing waters, or to run litter prevention campaigns or support and promote community action with a focus on reducing marine and coastal litter pollution. The 2009-10 grant application deadline is the end of June 2009.

  <p>Existing legislation in Scotland is amongst the toughest in Europe. A person who is caught littering is, if the case goes to court, liable to a fine of up to &pound;2,500. Alternatively, the person may be offered the opportunity to pay a fixed penalty fine, the level of which is &pound;50.</p>

  <p>Police officers and designated local authority officers have the power to issue fixed penalty notices to those who litter. However, as independent bodies, whether local authorities empower officials to issue notices and whether police forces exercise their powers, is entirely up to them. They are encouraged to do so by the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse (COPLAR) provides practical guidance on the use of the litter enforcement powers contained in the act. COPLAR website, operated by the independent environmental charity Keep Scotland Beautiful (KSB), provides guidance on the issuing of fixed penalty fines.

  <p>As Stewart Stevenson told the Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee on 9 June 2009, section 2 of the Pollution Prevention and Control Act 1999 allows ministers to make regulations which, <em>inter alia</em> , impose conditions to be required in landfill permits. These conditions could include selective bans. These powers have already been exercised to make selective landfill bans in the Landfill (Scotland) Regulations 2003.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, ministers may use the power in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 to make regulations implementing community obligations, or about matters relating to such obligations. The Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) requires the prioritisation of prevention, re-use and recycling over other recovery and disposal.

These conditions could include selective bans. These powers have already been exercised to make selective incineration bans in the Waste Batteries (Scotland) Regulations 2009.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, ministers may use the power in section 2(2) of the European Communities Act 1972 to make regulations implementing community obligations, or about matters relating to such obligations. The Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC) requires the prioritisation of prevention, re-use and recycling over other recovery and disposal. Selective bans may be a means of achieving the required prioritisation.</p>
