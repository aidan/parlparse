  <p>The Care Commission&#8217;s complaints procedure allows complainants to confirm whether they accept the Care Commission&#8217;s provisional conclusions and if not, to express any concerns to the Commission. The Commission will address these concerns before issuing a final decision. If they remain dissatisfied complainants can then seek a review of that decision. The Care Commission&#8217;s head of policy and development or the director of operations will either review the decision or ask the Care Commission Review Committee to do so.</p>

  <p>If the complaint is ultimately not upheld either wholly or partly by the Care Commission the complainant has recourse to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman, who can investigate any action taken by or on behalf of the Commission in the exercise of its administrative functions.</p>

  <p>On 5 December 2003, in response to a question from Jackie Baillie MSP, I published my strategy for consultation during the drafting of the charity bill. The strategy set out three core elements, including: the establishment of a bill reference group; a range of specialist consultation meetings looking at particular aspects of the bill; and wider information-sharing activities.</p>

  <p>The bill reference group has now met five times. It is continuing to examine and debate the key issues of policy for the proposed bill. Additionally, the bill team has now held 29 separate meetings with a range of identified stakeholders to discuss and refine technical aspects of the bill. Officials are continuing to meet with charity sector networks and professional bodies to ensure the draft bill fully meets the aim of creating an effective, proportionate regulatory framework for charities.</p>

  <p>Monthly updates on progress, and background information including details of the consultation meetings, are available to all on the charity law pages of the Scottish Executive website at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/UNASS/UNASS/00015300/page1193351391.aspx"> http://www.scotland.gov.uk/about/UNASS/UNASS/00015300/page1193351391.aspx</a></p>

  <p>The draft bill will be published for formal consultation in the spring.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers, acting through Communities Scotland, have requested that East Lothian Council produce an improvement plan, setting out how it will respond to the findings of the pathfinder inspection report. The plan is due to be submitted on 17 March 2004, eight weeks after the publication of the inspection report.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland will then agree arrangements with the local authority for monitoring the implementation of the plan to ensure that the necessary improvements in the services for homeless people and those threatened with homelessness are achieved. Performance in this area will be reassessed within two years and a full re-inspection of the local authority will be carried out within five years.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive adopts a range of processes when selecting service user consultees and in selecting such representation on working groups.</p>

  <p>Regarding consultation processes, the aim is always to ensure that we hear from as broad a range of people as possible, including those in &quot;hard to reach&quot; groups. Our efforts to do this include formal written consultation exercises; organisation and participation in events and road shows; and making use of existing networks, for example through NHS boards and voluntary organisations.</p>

  <p>Regarding selection for representation on working groups, we normally invite known organisations to nominate service users and carers who have appropriate experience and links to community networks. Consideration is always given to the support needs of individual service user and carer representatives, for example by ensuring reimbursement of appropriate expenses, and provision for a supporter to assist them where needed.</p>

  <p>A review of all involvement since 1999 would incur disproportionate cost. However, the spread of contribution has been considerable and, as well as individuals, would include organisations such as:</p>

  <p>I am pleased to say that the outcome guidance for agencies on the planning and delivery of post-natal depression services will be published on 4 <strong></strong> March. That guidance is of course a direct response to the provisions within the Mental Health (Care and Treatment) (Scotland) Act 2003 and will help agencies plan services and accommodation to allow mothers with a post-natal depression to be admitted to hospital accompanied by their babies.</p>

  <p>The interim report of Dr Sandra Grant&#8217;s National Assessment of Mental Health Services and 15 locality reports were published on 10 December 2003, (Bib. numbers 30239, 30221-30234 and 30236). The final report is published electronically today, (Bib. number: 31001). Hard copies will be available later this month.</p>

  <p>I welcome Dr Grant&#8217;s report and the recommendations made. The final report and its predecessors now provide a shared, current benchmark for all concerned in planning the steps to be taken jointly to achieve full implementation of the new act. I know the report will provide extra impetus to the work underway on the preparation by the agencies on their joint local implementation plans and to the underlying initiatives underway and planned on national mental health issues including those on workforce, equity and joint working.</p>

  <p>We will continue to work with NHS boards, with local authorities, the voluntary organisations and with users of services and carers in taking this agenda forward.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for local authorities to decide on the detail of their contracts. The EC public procurement directives provide scope for reflecting environmental considerations in procurement, where it is relevant to the subject matter of the contract or based upon environmental objectives of the public body concerned. Given that the current main investment in school buildings is through the public private partnerships procurement route and will involve a substantial amount of new build, the opportunity exists to deliver public services in a more environmentally friendly way.</p>

  <p>The National Guidelines on Expressive Arts 5-14 give guidance on the provision of the curriculum for art and design. The guidelines on the structure and balance of the curriculum advise education authorities and schools that a minimum of 15% of a pupil&#8217;s time should be devoted to the expressive arts during the primary school years and over the first two years at secondary school. As the school curriculum in Scotland is non-statutory, it is for education authorities and schools to decide how to implement this advice, taking into account the needs and circumstances of their pupils.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive adheres to the standard publication conventions used by all publishers. This means that the publisher&#8217;s name and address, copyright statement and year of publication are all shown on the copyright page which is included at the front of all documents. Additionally, the month and year of each document is printed on the back of documents, together with the contractor&#8217;s reference number.</p>

  <p>Many of our publications already include the month and year of publication and we are currently in the process of rolling out this procedure to all of our documents.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer, further to the answer to question S1W-28863 by Sir David Steel on 17 September 2002, what progress has been made in developing public transport options to ensure that there are easily accessible and affordable transport links to the new Parliament building.</p>

  <p>The Parliament is responsible for providing the infrastructure to allow transport links to the site of the new building as part of the landscaping scheme and the convener of the Holyrood Progress Group has informed me that good progress has been made towards that. Provision has been made in the scheme for the inclusion of appropriately located bus stops, a disabled parking area on Horse Wynd, and a cycle rack close to the building. There will also be an extended taxi rank on the Canongate. Apart from particular routes, the City of Edinburgh Council has ultimate responsibility for public transport to all areas of the City. It would be a matter for the council and local bus companies to determine routes and timetables, as well as a pricing structure.</p>
