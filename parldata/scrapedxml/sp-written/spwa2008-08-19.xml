  <p>Within the 5-14 curriculum, the Scottish Government has assessed pupils&rsquo; skills in literacy by measuring achievements in reading and writing, through the Scottish Survey of Achievement.</p>

  <p>The most recently published results for reading were published in the 2006 SSA report, which can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/ssa2006report" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/ssa2006report</a>.

  <p>Improving literacy and numeracy skills is at the heart of the Curriculum for Excellence programme. Within the programme, literacy is defined as the set of skills which allows an individual to engage fully in society and in learning, through the different forms of language, and the range of texts, which society values and finds useful.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not define a level at which a pupil is judged to be able to read. Level D is considered to be the level most pupils should be able to reach by the end of P7. However, it is recognised as a challenging level at which pupils should demonstrate an awareness of genre and a knowledge of language associated with literature, as well as the ability to read for both information and enjoyment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Survey of Achievement (SSA) is the principal national source of information about pupils&rsquo; attainment in primary and early secondary stages.</p>

  <p>At a recent meeting, with the Scottish Council of Independent Schools, I encouraged the independent sector to continue to work closely with local authorities (LAs) and schools across Scotland&rsquo;s educational community to share and promote best practice for instance by supporting small special schools in the LA sector or by providing access to advanced highers to pupils at LA schools.</p>

  <p>Independent schools, like all other registered charities must pass the &quot;public benefit&quot; test developed by the Office of the Scottish Charities Regulator to retain their charitable status. It is a matter for each independent school to make its case to the satisfaction of the regulator.</p>

  <p>Scottish Power advises that its meter replacement programme is progressing with 81% of prepayment customers in Scotland now having key meters which can be re-calibrated remotely meaning that the issue of back-charging does not arise. The programme is due to be completed by September 2009.</p>

  <p>Scottish Power assures me that they make every effort to gain access to homes to recalibrate meters and if they are not satisfied that proper procedures for meter reading and timeous re-calibration of meters has been carried out they will waive back-charges.</p>

  <p>I await the findings of Ofgem&rsquo;s probe into the energy supply market which is expected in September. The probe is intended to make sure that the market is working well for all customers, including those on pre-payment meters.</p>

  <p>Systems for the management and maintenance of core paths should be set up at the local, not the national level. We expect access authorities to take a lead in this, working with others in the local area, especially local access forums.</p>

  <p>Access authorities have been provided with powers under the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, to do anything they consider appropriate for the purposes of maintaining a core path. They should be making provision to use these powers for the effective management and maintenance of their core path network.</p>

  <p>The first point of contact for community organisations should be the local access authority, who should have a system in place for managing and maintaining the core path network, as indicated in the Guidance for Local Authorities and National Park Authorities issued by the Scottish Government in February 2005. It is up to the local access authority to address the concerns of any local organisations.</p>

  <p>The intention of extended hours is to increase the availability of routine GP appointments outside of normal office hours, regardless of the patient&rsquo;s background or circumstance. There is in principle no restriction on who may book an extended hours appointment although they will be of most benefit to patients who are unable to attend during normal office hours and GP practices may encourage other patients to make use of existing in-hours appointments whenever possible.

  <p>As stated in our new International development policy, published in May 2008, the Scottish Government is starting new programmes in Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia and the Darfur region of Sudan, as well as the Indian subcontinent.</p>

  <p>In addition, some programmes supported under previous international development funding rounds are still on-going in several countries of Sub-Saharan Africa as well as in Sri Lanka.</p>

  <p>The commitment within the concordat is to pay approved kinship carers of Looked After Children a weekly allowance at the equivalent rate as paid by the local authority to its foster carers.</p>

  <p>We continue to support the payment of allowances based on TFN&rsquo;s recommended rate of allowance. It is however up to individual local authorities to decide on an appropriate rate of allowance based on their local need and priorities.</p>

  <p>Looked After children are those who are children subject to:</p>

  <p>A supervision requirement made by a children&rsquo;s hearing under section 70 of the 1995 act.</p>

  <p>A child accommodated by the local authority under section 25 of the 1995 act.</p>

  <p>An order made or authorisation or warrant granted by virtue of chapter 2, 3 or 4 of Part II of the 1995 act.</p>

  <p>A placement made by a local authority which has taken parental responsibility under section 86 of the 1995 act (to be repealed shortly under the Adoption and Children Act 2007).</p>

We have made it clear since the report was published on 1 July that this is a priority for the Scottish Government.
