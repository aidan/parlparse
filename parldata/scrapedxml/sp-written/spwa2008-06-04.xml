  <p>The available information is given in the following table, which shows all offences recorded under section 61 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997.</p>

  <p>The police have powers under section 61 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 to confiscate alcohol from under 18s in a public place and dispose of it. Under this section, the police also have powers to confiscate alcohol from persons aged 18 or over, in a public place and dispose of it if that person has supplied, or intends to supply, alcohol to under 18s. If the alcohol is surrendered to the police, it is not an offence and so is not included in the recorded crime statistics. It is, however, an offence to fail to comply, for example by failing to surrender the alcohol or by failing to give his name and address if requested. The number of these criminal offences are shown in the table. It should be noted that this cannot be assumed to be a true representation of the number of incidents where alcohol was confiscated.</p>

  <p>Number of Offences Recorded by Lothian and Borders Police under Section 61 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997, by Local Authority Area, 2006-07</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, following the change in policy announced by the Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing on 22 May 2008 ( <em>Official Report</em> , c. 8934-51), how it intends to ensure that vulnerable groups, such as pensioners, continue to benefit from the free central heating installation scheme.</p>

  <p>Our policy on tackling fuel poverty has not changed. The statement last week outlined how the current central heating programme does not tackle fuel poverty effectively. The changes that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing announced for this financial year are designed to ensure that those pensioners most vulnerable to fuel poverty are the first to benefit from a free central heating system. Going forward, the re-convened Scottish Fuel Poverty Forum will advise ministers on the best way of tackling fuel poverty in future years.</p>

  <p>The Local Government (Scotland) Act 2003 provides a statutory framework for best value and community planning and provides a statutory underpinning for the mainstreaming of equal opportunities in the implementation of these duties.</p>

  <p>In addition to these training events, HM inspectors will also attend HMIE directorate conferences at least once each year. If their responsibilities takes them across different sectors i.e. primary, secondary, services for children etc, HM inspectors could attend more than one directorate event each year.</p>

  <p>In conjunction with the Kiel Centre, HMIE has also drawn up a best practice framework for all HM Inspectors and tailored training events to develop and build on coaching techniques were arranged in June and August 2007, and in January, February and May 2008. Further events are planned for June, July, September and December 2008.</p>

  <p>There are also &quot;drop-in&quot; sessions offered to all HM inspectors when a new process is introduced. These sessions are arranged at various times in the various HMIE offices across the country to allow staff the opportunity to learn more about new processes in their local environment.</p>

  <p>HMIE also support HM inspectors in undertaking specific job related and developmental training.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held in a format which allows the question to be answered directly. However, HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) currently has 108 inspectors and assistant chief inspectors and from that group, 92 were previously qualified teachers and two were qualified lecturers in further education colleges. This equates to 87% of the current inspector group.</p>

  <p>Those inspectors from outwith teaching/lecturing, will be involved in other aspects of HMIE&rsquo;s work i.e. community learning and development, services for children and as a consequence, will have a background in community education, health, educational psychology, criminal justice and social work.</p>

  <p>Since January 2005, 48 inspectors and assistant chief inspectors have retired or resigned and of that group, 42 were previously qualified teachers and five qualified lecturers in further education colleges. This equates to 97.9% of that group. The inspector without a teaching background was a qualified social worker involved in services for children inspections.</p>

  <p>Since January 2005, there are and have been 156 inspectors and assistant chief inspectors involved in HMIE inspections, 141 were previously qualified teachers and qualified lecturers in further education colleges which equates to 90%.</p>

  <p>Assistant inspectors are appointed by HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) to undertake a number of days&rsquo; work each year. They comprise retired HM inspectors or others with up-to-date knowledge of and a background in education and services for children and young people, including experience in inspection and review procedures and quality assurance work. They can be called upon at short notice to meet certain peaks of activity or unforeseen demands. This flexibility makes them a valuable resource to HMIE.</p>

  <p>HMIE first appointed assistant inspectors in 2003. Since then, the following have been appointed each year.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has advised that various habitat types including wet heath and blanket bog over an area of 137 ha were affected by the heath fire in May 2008. SNH estimates that it will take between five and 10 years for the vegetation to recover, although some bird species may recommence nesting in affected areas as soon as next year. Recovery time for the affected blanket bog is unknown and will depend amongst other things on the depth of penetration of the fire into the peat.</p>

The NSC goes on to recommend that a woman with a personal history of venous thrombosis should be advised to avoid oral contraception and HRT if acceptable alternatives are available, and should be counselled regarding the level of risk faced.</p>

  <p>In primary care, the risks and benefits of any prescribed medication are discussed during consultation between the patient and their GP. This would include the risks of thrombosis associated with hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and the contraceptive pill, which are well-known.</p>

  <p>Pharmacists will discuss the indications, contra-indications, drug interactions and side effects with the patient before dispensing medication. There is also a legal requirement for each prescription for HRT and the oral contraceptive pill to contain an information leaflet which describes product characteristics, including the risk of thrombosis.</p>

  <p>We would also expect clinicians providing maternity services to assess pregnant women for risk factors for DVT as part of their clinical assessment, and to provide further management in line with the current clinical guidelines produced by SIGN and the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.</p>

  <p>In addition, we have commissioned Lifeblood, the thrombosis charity, to develop a general information leaflet on DVT. The leaflet includes guidance for individuals considered to be at high risk, including those on HRT and the oral contraceptive pill, and mentions that a simple blood test is available which may show a genetic susceptibility to DVT. The leaflet has been distributed to every GP practice in Scotland so that it can be on display and available to the general public.</p>

  <p>In my parliamentary statement on 27 February 2008 regarding the future of accident and emergency (A&amp;E) services in Ayrshire and Lanarkshire, I outlined the estimated additional costs likely to be incurred by both boards in maintaining A&amp;E units at Ayr and Monklands &ndash; these figures have not changed significantly since then. It is estimated that NHS Ayrshire and Arran will incur additional one-off capital costs of &pound;18.6 million and additional revenue costs of &pound;5.7 million per annum (1% of revenue budget). NHS Lanarkshire expects to incur additional revenue costs of &pound;5.3 million per annum (0.7% of revenue budget) and are continuing to develop business cases to maintain and improve the Monklands site.</p>

  <p>Both boards will be expected to manage all of their services, including A&amp;E services, within the resources available to them. NHS Ayrshire and Arran&rsquo;s budget increased by &pound;17 million in 2008-09 to &pound;547 million while NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s budget increased by &pound;26 million to &pound;760 million. Both boards have agreed that the additional costs incurred in maintaining A&amp;E services will be accommodated over a number of years within their overall budgets and their 2008-09 five-year financial plans demonstrate this.</p>

  <p>I have also previously confirmed that I will provide an additional &pound;30 million capital funding for NHS Ayrshire and Arran and an additional &pound;100 million capital funding to NHS Lanarkshire to support service reconfiguration, including the regeneration of Monklands Hospital.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government definition, used in the application of the moderating criteria, that racism &quot;can be indirect, direct or institutional, and that racism is unacceptable in any context no matter who it is perpetrated by or against&quot;, is consistent with the Race Relations Act 1976 as amended in 2000.</p>

  <p>There is a wide range of legislative provisions which form the legal foundation of public bodies in Scotland.

  <p>Local authorities are responsible for decisions on capital investment in school buildings. The Scottish Government does not hold comprehensive information about the timing of local authorities&rsquo; entering into school construction contracts, although some details, as provided by authorities, are set out in the recently published <em>Infrastructure Investment Plan 2008</em> of planned 2008-09 expenditure on school investment projects of over &pound;5 million. (Available on the Scottish Government website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/03/28122237/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/03/28122237/0</a> ).</p>

  <p>However, we anticipate that, with the funding we have put in place, authorities will be enabled, in the context both of new build and refurbishment and through a range of funding mechanisms, to complete or have under construction around 250 schools during the current parliamentary period.</p>

  <p>The contractual arrangements for teachers are matters for local authorities as employers. The Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers has agreed a code of practice which states that while recognising service needs local authorities should be providing opportunities for teachers to gain secure employment.</p>
