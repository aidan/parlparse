  <p>Some 70-80% of this total support is in the form of CAP Market Support payments, for which planned provision is classed as Annually Managed Expenditure (AME). The actual level of payments to the industry under CAP Market Support schemes will depend on a range of factors including EU Commission decisions on Euro payment rates, the prevailing Sterling/Euro exchange rate and demand under the schemes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service is funded to provide services across Scotland. This year&#8217;s allocation is &pound;94.3 million &#8211; up &pound;4.1 million on last year.</p>

  <p>The allocation includes &pound;500,000 specifically for 20 more frontline staff in Glasgow, and a further &pound;485,000 to train 75 more paramedics across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Areas round Glasgow will benefit from deployment of extra frontline staff in the south and east of the city. And of course the ambulance service regularly reviews performance in all health board areas, including Lanarkshire, to ensure that it is providing the services people need.</p>

  <p>If the tenants vote in favour of stock transfer, the new community landlords will install central heating and insulation and carry out other improvements and repairs, in many cases to a total value considerably greater than the &pound;2,500 per house available under the central heating initiative. If the tenants decide to stay with the local authority, those of them who lack central heating will have it installed under our initiative and the resources will come from the Scottish Executive. No tenant lacking central heating will be disadvantaged by the stock transfer process.</p>

  <p>The Executive is to improve the accessibility, affordability and quality of childcare provision through a range of initiatives. These include: pre-school education with investment of over &pound;130 million a year providing places for all four-year-olds and over two thirds of three-year-olds; New Opportunities Fund <i> </i> investment of &pound;22.5 million which is expected to provide out of school places for 100,000 children by 2003; improved regulation arrangements underpinning our commitment to good quality childcare provision and to children&#8217;s safety, and we are on track to achieve our workforce target to train 5,000 new childcare workers by 2002.</p>

  <p>Funding for such groups is a matter for decision locally, primarily by local organisations such as local authorities and health boards.

  <p>Within the &pound;100 million drug funding package announced recently, &pound;21 million is for young people and families. Some of this will be used for supporting the families of drug misusers. Details have still to be decided.</p>

  <p>I have reviewed the role and organisation of Her Majesty&#8217;s Inspectors of Schools.</p>

  <p>I attach great importance to quality assurance in the education system; and the contribution which the Inspectorate can make to supporting education authorities, schools and teachers in improving the quality of education and raising standards of attainment. I wish to see a strong emphasis on rigorous independent inspection and on the collation and publication of evidence from inspections to inform improvements in educational policy and practice. I wish to ensure that the Inspectorate continues to make this contribution.</p>

  <p>Following a review of the options for discharging these functions, I have decided that the creation of an Executive Agency represents the best way forward. I have rejected other options, including the creation of a Non-Departmental Public Body. Executive Agency status enables operational independence and impartiality in individual inspections to be combined with direct accountability to Ministers for the overall standard of the work done and Ministers&#8217; ability to set a framework for the inspection process which ensures that it supports our strategic objectives for the education system.</p>

  <p>Executive Agencies do not have a separate legal status from the departments out of which they are formed, and Ministers remain fully accountable to the Parliament for the activities of the agency.</p>

  <p>The review also covered the other current functions of the Inspectorate: contributing to policy advice to Ministers, and leading the development and implementation of new policies.</p>

  <p>In addition to the contribution to policy advice which the Executive Agency will continue to make in collating and publishing evidence from inspections, there will also be a role for officials with professional experience as education practitioners to contribute to the internal advice which Ministers receive. They will continue to discharge that role within the core of the Executive. Some staff who are currently part of the Inspectorate will remain within the core to contribute to that function and will not form part of the Executive Agency. This approach will be complemented by the measures which I am taking to ensure that the views of teachers and education authorities are sought regularly as an input to my department&#8217;s work.</p>

  <p>I have concluded that the Inspectorate should not discharge the lead role in the development and implementation of new policies, although it will be important for development work to continue to be informed by evidence from inspection. In the context of devolution, I consider that there should be closer ministerial oversight of such activity. The Education Department will ensure that development work is closely managed on behalf of Ministers, drawing on a wide range of professional contributions.</p>

  <p>The review did not cover the role of the Inspectorate in relation to non-compulsory post-school education and training, or inspection of further education colleges or any other task which the Inspectorate undertakes under contract to a body other than the Scottish Executive. Such contracts will be unaffected by the changes flowing from the review.</p>

  <p>I believe that these new arrangements will deliver better results through separation of the present functions of the Inspectorate and more appropriate arrangements for the discharge of those functions. The relevant parts of the Inspectorate will operate on an agency basis from 1 December and my department and the Inspectorate will develop the framework for full agency status to begin on 1 April 2001.</p>

  <p>Fluctuations in the number of business starts are heavily influenced by conditions in the broader economy.

  <p>In addition, we have a number of measures aimed to help people setting up new businesses: improvements to the Scottish Enterprise Network through the establishment, from July, of a single brand Small Business Gateway offering an extremely important package of core measures that improve on the quality and consistency of public sector support for new and small businesses in the Scottish Enterprise area; work by Scottish Enterprise to review the Business Birth Rate Strategy to further encourage entrepreneurship and start-ups - including from non-traditional sources, like women and youth; and the continuation of local events under the Personal Enterprise Campaign, including shows in deprived areas. In addition, new start-ups with growth potential also have access to support from the &pound;12 million Business Growth Fund and our national mentoring scheme - Business Mentoring Scotland.</p>

  <p>The fiftieth anniversary of Her Majesty The Queen&#8217;s Accession to the Throne will be celebrated during the summer of 2002. Tuesday 4 June 2002 has been proclaimed as a bank holiday in place of the Spring Bank Holiday, which would otherwise fall on 27 May in 2002, and Monday 3 June has been designated as an additional bank holiday to mark the Golden Jubilee.</p>

  <p>Her Majesty hopes to travel within the United Kingdom as widely as possible during the summer months of May to July, and especially the weeks running up to and following the bank holiday weekend. She will attend the opening of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in Edinburgh on 25 May 2002. A number of other engagements will be undertaken in Scotland at this time, further details of which will be announced in due course.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been kept fully informed of the events that are being planned at the United Kingdom level. The Prime Minister is today making an announcement to the UK Parliament regarding the wider programme of events to mark the Jubilee.</p>

  <p>The fiftieth anniversary of Her Majesty&#8217;s accession to the throne will, I am sure, be a happy occasion for the people of Scotland and it will create numerous opportunities for voluntary and community activity. The Queen has said that she sees her Golden Jubilee as an opportunity to express her thanks for the support and loyalty she has enjoyed during her reign. It will be a time both for celebrating the change and progress that has taken place in Scotland during Her Majesty&#8217;s reign, and for looking forward.</p>

  <p>The information has already been made available to the Scottish Parliament Information Centre, Document Supply Centre in the following Scottish Executive Statistical Bulletin <i>Operation of the Homeless Persons Legislation in Scotland 1988-89 to 1998-99: National and Local Authority Analyses: HSG/2000/5</i> .

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive which organisations have been invited to respond to the <i>Learning Disability Review</i> ; what the timescale is for the review&#8217;s consultation process; when the review&#8217;s recommendations will be implemented, and what are the estimated financial implications of the review.</p>

  <p>We distributed 9,000 copies of the <i>Learning Disability Review</i> to approximately 800 statutory and non-statutory organisations across health, social work, housing, education, employment, leisure and recreation, and organisations representing people who use services and their carers. The formal consultation on how to implement the review ran from 11 May to end of August.</p>

  <p>The review sets out a programme of change for the next 10 years. It makes clear that agencies locally can make better use of existing resources. In addition, we are making available &pound;36 million over the next three years to support implementation. Meanwhile, we have already invited applications from organisations to set up the Scottish Centre for Learning Disabilities and hope to award the contract in February.</p>

  <p>We propose to introduce a four-year term for councils. This will help councils to plan ahead and to deliver their policy priorities more effectively. The Executive consulted on this issue in our response to McIntosh and found a strong consensus in favour of extending the term from three to four years. Extending the term of councils will complement other initiatives, such as the new finance settlement, and will assist councils in taking a longer-term strategic view.</p>

  <p>We propose that future local government elections should be held on the same day as Scottish parliamentary elections. In the local government elections in May 1999 there was a turnout of 59% compared with turnout between 41% and 48% from 1976 to 1995. Such high turnout reinforces the democratic mandate of local government. A combined election will also benefit the elector and offers the convenience of a single trip to the polling station.</p>

  <p>This change is part of the process of Renewing Local Democracy and complements other work, such as the power of community initiative and community planning, which should revitalise interest in local issues and local democracy.</p>

  <p>We wish to implement these beneficial changes at the earliest opportunity. We propose to do this by postponing the next local government elections from 2002 to 2003. These proposals will require primary legislation and we will look for an early opportunity to legislate.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not maintain profitability series on the Scottish pig industry. However, I have commissioned a study into the current profitability of this sector, the results of which will be available in late summer 2001. The market price data shown below gives an indication of how profitability is likely to have fluctuated over recent years.</p>

  <p>The EU Pigs Regime does not make provision for direct support to be given to pig producers. However, recognising the particular difficulties which our pig farmers have had to contend with recently, a State Aid application to support this sector is at an advanced stage of processing by the European Commission.</p>

  <p>If the public view is favourable, construction could start in 2003. This is the same construction timetable as I announced following the Strategic Roads Review.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) does not carry out prosecutions. Cases of contravention of environment protection legislation, which are considered by SEPA to warrant legal action, are referred to the Procurators Fiscal service for prosecution. Decisions on whether or not to proceed with prosecution in particular cases are entirely a matter for the appropriate Procurator Fiscal. The costs of carrying out prosecutions are borne by the Procurators Fiscal service and not by SEPA. The following table sets out information on cases referred by SEPA to the Procurators Fiscal since April 1996:</p>

  <p>From the start of the academic year 2001-02, we intend to introduce a wide-ranging package of measures to assist students and their families, including bursaries for mature students and for young students entering higher education from low income backgrounds for the first time. The Education (Graduate Endowment and Student Support) (Scotland) Bill will enable us to proceed with this package, as the income from the graduate endowment will be applied exclusively to fund bursary and other student support.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers regulate drinking water quality under provisions in the Water (Scotland) Act 1980. The consultation paper <i> Managing Change in the Water Industry</i> invited views on whether additional powers in this area are needed, given the prospect of increased competition in the Scottish water and sewerage sector.</p>

  <p>The Executive is considering responses to the consultation paper at present. Any new provisions for regulating drinking water quality will be included in the Water Services Bill planned for the current parliamentary session and will be the subject of full consultation before the Bill&#8217;s introduction.</p>
