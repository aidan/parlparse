  <p>On Wednesday 12 November the Minister for Children and Early Years held a conference call to consider progress since the oral feedback provided by HMIE in June 2008. The representatives from Aberdeen agencies included:</p>

  <p>After every inspection of services to protect children in a local authority area, HMIE ask the Chief Officers Group to prepare an action plan indicating how they will address the main recommendations of the report. In the case of Aberdeen, Scottish Government officials also met with Aberdeen Chief Officers in June 2008 and asked that they write to the Minister for Children and Early Years providing immediate and longer term assurances of the safety of vulnerable children in the area.</p>

  <p>Aberdeen City Council and its partners have produced a detailed action plan, and ministers have been assured that each action is already being addressed. Ministers will hold a follow-up meeting with Aberdeen agencies in January 2009 to discuss the latest progress against the plan.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what mechanisms (a) there are to require and (b) would be required to improve the sharing of information between professionals in relation to child protection.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-12-05.S3W-18156.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80331" speakername="Adam Ingram" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa1205.htm#2">

  <p>The document <em>Sharing Information About Children: a Guide to Good Practice</em> (Scottish Executive 2004) makes it clear that &quot;All professionals and service providers have a responsibility to act to make sure that a child whose safety or welfare may be at risk is protected from harm&quot;. In addition, good practice in information-sharing is already a key element monitored in child protection joint inspections led by HMIE.</p>

  <p>To improve information sharing further the Scottish Government is developing an eCare Framework to support best practice in information-sharing by electronic means, within a safe and secure environment.</p>

  <p>In March 2008, HMIE published an improvement guide: <em>How good are we at sharing and recording information to help children and families? How good can we be?</em> This guide is part of a series that focuses on specific issues highlighted through the child protection inspections. The guide aims to support staff to look at their information sharing practice when they need to:</p>

  <p>be alert to signs of abuse and recognise that a child needs help</p>

  <p>refer and communicate concerns within and between services</p>

  <p>respond to indications that a child may be in need of protection.</p>

  <p>Our support through <em>Getting it Right for Every Child</em> is helping to achieve the necessary shift in culture and practice. GIRFEC pathfinders and learning partners (Highland, Lanarkshire, Clydebank, Edinburgh, Dumfries and Galloway and Falkirk) are developing and testing approaches that facilitate multi-agency working to agree a proper course of action for a child, with a lead professional in place to ensure follow-up and co-ordination.</p>

  <p><em>Sustainable Seas for All - a consultation on Scotland&rsquo;s first marine bill </em> invited comment on proposals for a Scottish Marine Bill. Proposals include a new statutory marine planning system. It is proposed that Marine Scotland will develop a National Marine Plan for Scotland which will set out policies and priorities to promote sustainable economic growth and for the sustainable use, development and protection of Scotland&rsquo;s marine and coastal resources. The plan will be integrated into the National Planning Framework for Scotland.</p>

  <p>It is also proposed that marine plans will be developed at a local level by Scottish Marine Boards comprising representatives from the main stakeholder interests within Scottish Marine Regions. Scottish Marine Boards and Marine Scotland will also be responsible for integrated coastal zone management (ICZM), a process intended to facilitate an integrated approach to the management and protection of resources at the land/sea interface.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has produced promotional and patient awareness materials for the Minor Ailments Service and Acute Medication Service. These materials were made available in pharmacies and GP surgeries. In addition, the Minor Ailments Service has been promoted through the use of posters in pharmacies&rsquo; windows.

  <p>In the census for 2008, pre-school centres were asked for the first time to report numbers of peripatetic teachers, who work across more than one centre, separately from teachers employed in their centre only. In 2008, the headcount figures for teachers employed in only one centre was approximately the same as that for all teachers in 2007. In addition, a head count of 600 was reported for peripatetic teachers, equating to 204 whole-time-equivalent staff.</p>

  <p>Data on numbers of pre-school teachers is collected in two ways in the Scottish Government&rsquo;s annual pre-school and childcare census &ndash; head count, or physical numbers of teachers and whole-time equivalent (WTE). The question asked by Margaret Smith on 25 September used the headcount figures, and was answered by the First Minister on that basis. In the process, he also referred to the change in methodology between the 2007 and 2008 census. The 2008 census removed double-counting of peripatetic teachers which featured in the 2007 census.</p>

  <p>This government has made significant progress in the last 18 months in terms of improving the position of pre-school children in Scotland, in line with our manifesto commitments. We have made the most significant enhancement to pre-school education since 2002, increasing the entitlement to 475 hours from the start of the last academic year with a further increase to 570 hours from August 2010. We have also included our commitment to deliver access to a teacher for all pre-school children as quickly as possible in our concordat with local government.</p>

  <p>The Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP) was approved in February 2008. Resultant proposals for funding from programme resources have only been made on projects and proposals since then. It is therefore too early to provide an evidence based assessment of the impact of the programme.</p>

  <p>The success of the programme will be judged through a combination of the work of the SRDP&rsquo;s statutory programme monitoring committee, on-going evaluation activities, an annual programme implementation report to the European Commission and annual review meetings with the Commission. The performance of the SRDP will also be assessed in a mid-term evaluation in 2010 and an ex-post evaluation to be completed by 2015.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government expects to be reviewing the SRDP early next year. This will ensure the programme continues to meet the needs of rural Scotland especially given recent economic developments and taking into account the experience gained in the first year of the programme&rsquo;s operation.</p>
