  <p>Legislation already exists that enables local authorities to take action in respect of buildings found to be dangerous and buildings which they consider to be in need of repair. The relevant powers may be found in the Building (Scotland) Act 1959; the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982; the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997, and the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987.</p>

  <p>Relocation decisions are based on a range of issues including costs, quality and efficiency of service, economic factors such as unemployment, availability and suitability of property and staff, transport issues and the position of staff concerned and the individual requirements of each organisation. Further criteria to be taken into account will depend on the organisation itself and the nature of the work in question.</p>

  <p>In relation to the proposal from North Ayrshire for the relocation of the Scottish Public Pensions Agency, one of the property factors did relate to timetable risks associated with site ownership. This was taken into account in the decision making process.</p>

  <p>Training on internet crime, including action to tackle &quot;grooming&quot; by paedophiles on the internet, is already provided by the Police Service and by the Crown Office and both organisations are working together to identify further training needs in this area. Responsibility for ensuring that adequate police resources and training are applied to these tasks is primarily an operational matter for Chief Constables, who are fully aware of the importance of effective action. In taking action, Chief Constables will be able to draw on the increased funding we have made available to forces generally.</p>

  <p>In January 2001 the Scottish Executive commissioned research designed to help maximise employment opportunities from the housing stock transfer. The research will establish where construction skills gaps exist and what might be done to address them. The report has now been submitted to the Executive and is due for publication shortly. The Executive is considering its findings.</p>

  <p>The Executive met with senior officers of both Scottish Amicable and their parent company, Prudential Assurance, on 31 October. The discussion covered Prudential&#146;s decision to rebrand all Scottish Amicable products and to make further efficiency savings within the group. This meeting was convened on the understanding that commercial confidentiality would be respected. Following the public announcement of Prudential&#146;s intentions on 2 November, the scope of that discussion is now effectively in the public domain, including the company&#146;s pledge to retain Craigforth as a major business centre with more than 2,000 employed there.</p>

  <p>1. Foetal medicine did not develop until the late 1980s, when ultrasound technology improved to an extent that foetal therapy became a reality. The first series of direct intravascular were not performed regularly in Scotland until 1988.</p>

  <p>2. The information shown refers to the number of <u>procedures</u> performed. Many patients, particularly since 1988, received on average more than one transfusion during their pregnancy.</p>

  <p>The Executive is providing substantial resources to Grampian as part of the record investment we are making in NHSScotland. Grampian NHS Board&#146;s general funding allocation for 2001-02 is over &#163;446 million &#150; an increase of &#163;21.3 million (5.5%) compared with last year. In each of the next two years it will receive further increases of at least 6.5% and 7.4%.</p>

  <p>It is for NHS Grampian to decide how to deploy these funds on the basis of its assessment of local need and priorities for investment. In determining expenditure on the prescription of drugs, the NHS Board will of course also take account of national guidance and professional clinical advice.</p>

  <p>Medical research in the UK and overseas shows clearly that treatment with thrombolytic (clot-dissolving) drugs is an effective way of reducing or avoiding long-term damage from heart attack, and that effectiveness is greatest when the drugs are administered very quickly after a heart attack has occurred. Consequently there is considerable clinical interest in the potential role of ambulance paramedic staff in providing thrombolytic drugs before a patient is transferred to hospital.</p>

  <p>With support from the Remote and Rural Areas Resource Initiative, the Scottish Ambulance Service is undertaking a pilot project on pre-hospital thrombolysis in rural areas. The project is looking at joint working between the ambulance service and general practice and will provide research evidence on the effectiveness of pre-hospital thrombolysis.</p>

  <p>Pilot projects may have been undertaken elsewhere in the UK and overseas.</p>

  <p>There are risks associated with almost all medicines. There are a number of thrombolytic (clot-dissolving) drugs with specific side effects and contra-indications. For example, some patients suffer bleeding. Before a decision to administer a thrombolytic agent is taken, patients are assessed for these risk factors.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. From September 1991 data were derived using a new occupation classification for nursing staff. This has caused some discontinuities in the time series as previous misclassifications have been corrected. From 1993 data for the State Hospital, Carstairs are included.</p>

  <p>2. provisional.</p>

  <p>3. Excludes agency nurses, bank nurses and nurses employed by GP practices</p>

  <p>4. Excludes nurse teachers and nurses in training.</p>

  <p>5. Nursing management - all nurses on clinical grades are excluded from this category from September 1993. Some senior nurse managers are employed on A&amp;C senior management grades and are not included in the nursing total.</p>

  <p>6. Includes health visiting and district nursing teaching staff, and staff working in the field without a HV/DN qualification. The category 'Grades G &amp; above' gives a broad indication of those staff with a HV/DN qualification.</p>

  <p>7. This category is likely to be under-recorded.</p>

  <p>8. In 1990 it was not possible to identify midwives separately from nurses working in maternity services.</p>

  <p>All doctors working as consultants or specialist registrars in paediatrics or psychiatry will be members of, respectively, either the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health or the Royal College of Psychiatrists. The membership examinations for both institutions require a knowledge of child and adolescent mental health, and theoretical knowledge of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) will be included.</p>

  <p>Information is not collected on those staff who undertake any specific additional training in ADHD. However, all consultants in the specialty of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry will have received training in the assessment, diagnosis and management of patients with ADHD during their higher specialist training.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to making the judicial appointments process a more transparent and fair system for all who are interested in becoming Judges or Sheriffs. The appointment process which took place during the summer was the first in which Court of Session vacancies were publicly advertised and candidates were interviewed by a selection panel.</p>

  <p>Advertisements for the Chair and lay members of the Judicial Appointments Board appeared in the press on 12 October 2001 and I expect the board to be in operation early next year. Part of the board&#146;s remit will be to consider ways of recruiting judges, sheriffs principal and sheriffs who are as representative as possible of the communities they serve, while always maintaining the principle of appointment on merit. I shall give guidance to the Board on the importance of attracting applications from groups which are currently under-represented on the judicial bench.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Police STATS 19 form is the most accurate way of identifying the number and type of personal injuries that occur from road accidents, and whether any other record systems have been considered for use for this purpose.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-11-16.S1W-19241.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80134" speakername="Sarah Boyack" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa1116.htm#18">

  <p>The STATS 19 system, which is used throughout Great Britain, is designed to gather information for the production of statistics and to assist in the prevention of road accidents. It draws on the expertise of the police to collect information about key features of each accident known to them which occurs on a public road, involves one or more vehicles and results in the death or injury of one or more people. A considerable amount of detail is obtained about the circumstances of each accident. The STATS 19 records whether casualties' injuries were fatal, severe or slight.</p>

  <p>The system is kept under regular review. A National Statistics Quality Review of the STATS 19 started earlier this year, with the objectives of ensuring that the statistics are fit for purpose, and that improvements are identified and taken forward. It is being conducted by the Standing Committee on Road Accident Statistics, which includes representatives of the Association of Chief Police Officers (Scotland), the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, and the Scottish Executive. The review will consider, for example, whether outputs meet user needs, whether outputs are of adequate quality (eg in accuracy and timeliness), whether appropriate methods and best practice are used, and whether the burden on data suppliers is justified. Among the matters which will be considered are the STATS 19 definition of the severity of injury, the possibility of recording more information about casualties' injuries in the STATS 19 returns, the availability of health service information about casualties' injuries, the coverage of the health service statistics, and the relationship between the STATS 19 and health service classifications of the severity of casualties' injuries.</p>

  <p>Further information about the review may be obtained from the Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions Website, at the following address:</p>

  <p>We have today published our first progress report on electronic service delivery which shows that the Executive, its agencies and non-departmental public bodies already provide over 60% of their services online. Unsurprisingly, most of these relate to the provision of information, but some transactions are already fully electronically enabled, and many more are planned. We have also published a revised, more strategic version of our <i>21st Century Government Action Plan</i> . Both documents are available on our <i>21st Century Government </i> website and copies have been placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>One of the initiatives announced as a part of the Executive&#146;s Digital Inclusion Strategy <i>Connecting Scotland&#146;s People</i> is specifically targeted at disadvantaged communities. We have launched a &#163;3.5 million initiative to create two pilot &quot;digital communities&quot;. 2000 households in each community will be provided with home-based access to the web; training; a community-based web portal with locally developed content; and activities to raise awareness of the benefits of getting online &#150; increased access to education; jobs; shopping; entertainment; financial services; etc. Within these communities we aim to create a &quot;critical mass&quot; of web users &#150; so increasing the benefits for each individual of getting online, raising skill levels, and creating a supportive environment.</p>

  <p>Within Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP) areas in Scotland, the &#163;1.5 million Digital Champions programme is providing a network of eight digital &quot;champions&quot;. The Digital Champions are working to improve information communication technology (ICT) provision in SIP areas; initiating new ICT projects; spreading best practice on community access to the Internet and increasing the involvement of local people in the creation of Internet content. They are responsible for engaging local people in various initiatives and driving local activity forward.</p>

  <p>We are also working on a range of other initiatives as a part of the Digital Inclusion Strategy that will help to promote the benefits of the new technologies.</p>

  <p>The Executive is implementing and developing a number of initiatives to promote information and communications technology (ICT) skills in disadvantaged communities. These include:</p>

  <p>Learndirect Scotland to help and encourage individuals to take direct action to improve their own skills and employment prospects. The Learndirect Scotland helpline and website provides access to over 69,000 learning opportunities. The Scottish University for Industry (UfI) is also developing a network of Learndirect Scotland branded learning centres to enable easier access to ICT learning within communities &#150; 202 Learndirect Scotland<i> </i>centres have been created so far, of which 101 are located in areas of social exclusion. Scottish UfI Ltd has a target to create 300 centres by March 2002.</p>

  <p>Individual Learning Accounts which provide discounts of up to 80% on certain basic ICT skills courses.</p>

  <p>Many Further Education colleges which provide outreach facilities in the heart of disadvantaged communities, with ICT and on-line learning being used extensively to help students and organisations develop a culture of digital technology use. IT courses represent 20% of all enrolments in further education. The Scottish Executive is committed to securing an increase of 40,000 college places by 2002, and a significant proportion of these places are being targeted at those who are socially excluded or from low income backgrounds.</p>

  <p>The Executive, in partnership with Scottish Enterprise, has also launched &#163;150,000 Uplift programme. Uplift is providing initial computer training for 60 to 70 people around the country who will in turn be able to pass on their skills to other members of their communities.</p>

  <p>Through the Executive&#146;s Digital Inclusion Strategy <i>Connecting Scotland&#146;s People</i> we are also examining the feasibility of a range of other initiatives to promote digital inclusion in disadvantaged communities - one of which is a volunteering scheme. This scheme would seek to identify and recruit IT literate volunteers to share basic PC and web skills with those new to the web, within their local communities.</p>

  <p>The Executive recently published our Digital Inclusion Strategy <i>Connecting Scotland&#146;s People</i> which sets out how we intend to bridge the digital divide and achieve universal access to the internet by 2005. We see new technologies as making a key contribution to social justice &#150; increasing opportunities for disavantaged individuals and disadvantaged communities. The strategy sets out action to develop awareness; access; support; skills; content; and community involvement.</p>

  <p>To assist community and voluntary sector groups we have made &#163;1.5million available over three years for IT development in the voluntary sector. Last year, &#163;500,000 was made available to a wide range of projects to develop Internet access, develop websites, and improve connectivity. The successful projects included &#163;8,625 for One Parent Families Scotland to develop a website and interactive-group for lone parents and &#163;56,815 to set up a new and improved digital telephone conference service for Scottish charities. Criteria for organisations to apply for this year&#146;s round of grants will be announced shortly.</p>

  <p>We have also contributed &#163;432,000 to the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations Voluntary Sector Web Portal. The Portal will offer one-stop access to information about voluntary sector groups and services in Scotland, as well as facilitating communications between voluntary sector organisations and community groups.</p>

The two communities chosen will be announced in March 2002.</p>

  <p>Existing initiatives include:</p>

  <p>The National Grid for Learning Scotland web portal - which has developed a Guide to Getting Communities Connected. This provides anyone who wants to use the internet to benefit their community with a rich source of information, links and contacts to facilitate this.</p>

  <p>I believe that students and those considering teaching as a career recognise the very significant improvements in pay, conditions and opportunities adhered through the agreement <i>A Teaching Profession for the 21st Century</i> , and will see the long-term benefits of joining a re-invigorated profession.</p>

  <p>I am convinced that the improvements we are implementing through the agreement are of significant benefit to probationer teachers and the profession, both now and in the long-term. However, I am aware of the concerns raised by those mature students studying now, and in particular that they have budgeted for their training under certain expectations and assumptions. With our partners in Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the teacher organisations we will give the issues they have raised our full consideration.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what measures it is planning to introduce in areas where peak-time concessionary fares for bus travel are available to pensioners and/or disabled people in order to ensure that any such fares continue to be available following the introduction of free off-peak bus travel for pensioners and disabled people.</p>

  <p>The Executive's objective is to ensure that, as a minimum, free local off-peak bus travel (for eligible groups) is introduced for travel wholly within the boundaries of the participating local authorities in any given scheme area, after 09:30 weekdays and all day Saturday/Sunday. The Executive is working with Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the bus industry to deliver this commitment on a voluntary basis. Local authorities will still, however, be able to arrange peak-time concessionary travel on a local basis if they so wish.</p>

  <p>Over the past 30 years, grants were made available to local authorities to provide sites for travellers. Pitch targets were also set to encourage councils to take advantage of the grant scheme. This has led to the provision of over 30 sites for travellers. The grant scheme was discontinued in December 1998.</p>

  <p>For the future, local authorities should consider the accommodation needs of Travellers in preparing their Local Housing Strategies. Communities Scotland, as regulator of the housing functions of local authorities, will regulate local authority sites for travellers.</p>

  <p>Following the amendment of billing software, a number of local authorities have rebilled eligible households under the Water and Sewerage Reduction Scheme. It is anticipated that the remaining local authorities will complete the task in the near future with reductions backdated to 1 April 2001 where appropriate.</p>
