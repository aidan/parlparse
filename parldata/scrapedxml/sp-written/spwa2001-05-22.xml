  <p>The aggregates tax is a reserved matter. Detailed questions on the economic impact of the aggregates tax should be directed to HM Treasury. Although no separate assessment of the impact of the tax has been undertaken in Scotland, it is reasonable to expect a reduction in employers&#8217; costs to result in an increase in employment.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is taking a number of measures to assist the soft fruit industry in its current difficulties. These include assisting a number of grower co-operatives to decide whether to apply for recognition as a Producer Organisation (which is an essential pre-requisite to an EU grant-aided Operational Programme incorporating a marketing element); providing financial assistance to Scottish Soft Fruit Growers&#8217; Ltd (SSFG) towards the cost of employing a marketing manager; commissioning of consultants to investigate a future funding strategy for raspberry breeding; with the Intervention Agency, exploring every opportunity for SSFG to maximise the value of grant it is entitled to under the EU Special Scheme for Raspberries intended for Processing (which has been worth almost &#163;8 million over the last eight years), and funding strategic research into plant health problems such as raspberry root rot. There are no plans to subsidise any shortfall in payments to growers by Scottish Soft Fruit Growers Limited.</p>

  <p>The aforementioned measures should help the Scottish soft fruit industry to ensure that future production is in step with any increased market demand.</p>

From July we will be extending the current surveillance system to include all fallen stock and casualty animals over 30 months, and cattle born between August 1996 and July 1997 slaughtered under the Over Thirty Month Scheme.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has issued no directions regarding irradiated particles.</p>

  <p>The Secretary of State for Scotland wrote to the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) in 1998 asking it to ensure that there was sufficient monitoring at Sandside Beach, near Dounreay, such that any particles on the beach were promptly detected and removed. SEPA has required the operators of Dounreay, the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA), to carry out monthly monitoring of the whole beach and to notify SEPA of any particles found. The monitoring programme continues.</p>

  <p>The possible mechanisms by which the particles arrive at the beach are being investigated by UKAEA. This investigation is subject to scrutiny by the independent Dounreay Particles Advisory Group (DPAG) which was set up to provide independent scientific advice to SEPA and UKAEA on the particles of irradiated nuclear fuel found in the marine environment around Dounreay. The interim DPAG report is available on the SEPA website at the following address:</p>

  <p>In the year ended 31 December 2000, the Parole Board recommended the early release on licence of 374 prisoners sentenced to a term of imprisonment of four years or more.

Of the 30 cases over which Scottish Ministers exercised discretion, they accepted the Parole Board&#8217;s recommendation in all but one.

  <p>32 life prisoners, including 10 designated life prisoners whom the Parole Board directed should be released, were released on life licence. The remainder were released following a recommendation from the board and after consultation with the judiciary. 30 of those concerned had been convicted of murder, one of wilful fireraising and one of various crimes, including rape and assault and assault and robbery. Two life prisoners were recalled to custody because they faced criminal allegations involving violence which suggested that they presented an unacceptable risk to the safety of the public.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Charity Law Review Commission looked at the issue of trustees&#8217; powers of investment as part of its work. In its report, published on 9 May 2001, the commission recommends that a Trustee (Scotland) Bill should be introduced, giving charity trustees extended powers of investment in order to put them on the same footing as trustees in England and Wales. The Executive is consulting between now and the end of September 2001 on the recommendations in the commission&#8217;s report. We will consider this matter further in the light of responses to the consultation and the recommendations in the 1999 report of the Law Commission and the Scottish Law Commission.</p>

  <p>During the period in question, some 61 vacancies to non-departmental public bodies were advertised for a total cost of almost &#163;242,000. The average cost of advertising an appointment amounted to &#163;3,966. Under the terms of the Commissioner for Public Appointments&#8217; Code, not all vacancies are required to be advertised.</p>

  <p>The Executive is currently looking at ways in which the overall costs of advertising public appointments can be reduced without compromising the principle that vacancies should be promoted as widely as possible. One example of where progress on this front has been made is the Executive&#8217;s public appointments website which was launched at the end of last November. Details of all vacancies are placed on the site and to date over 8,000 hits have been recorded.</p>

  <p>The provision of local bus services is a matter for the commercial judgment of individual bus operators and for local authorities where they identify a social need. The Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 provides local authorities with a toolkit of options to improve bus service provision across Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive is currently undertaking a series of multi-modal studies which will provide us with a demand analysis and technical appraisal which will assist with prioritising support under such programmes as the Public Transport Fund and Rail Passenger Partnership fund.</p>

  <p>As a consequence of the UK Transport Act 2001, a number of important executive functions were transferred to Scottish Ministers including the authority to give binding Directions and Guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority for the Scottish passenger rail franchise. The first stage in producing these directions and guidance was a public consultation on the Scottish Executive&#8217;s paper <i>Strategic Priorities for Scotland&#8217;s Passenger Railway.</i> Among other things, the consultation document emphasises our desire to reduce peripherality, and develop and sustain rail links to rural areas. The outcome of this exercise, which closed at the end of February, will be used to inform the Executive&#8217;s Directions and Guidance.</p>

  <p>So that the Scottish Executive and the Strategic Rail Authority will be better placed to appraise bids for the re-letting of the Scottish passenger rail franchise, the Scottish Executive will be conducting a Central Scottish Rail Study. A number of Stakeholders will be consulted including the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive, SESTRANS, WESTRANS and Railtrack. The study is expected to be let shortly.</p>

  <p>The Executive is keen to support those involved in agricultural business who wish to diversify. Grant schemes have been available to assist those businesses with a wide range of diversification options, including tourism-related activities. Earlier this year, I launched the Agricultural Business Development Scheme, an element of which provides support for diversification activities in rural areas in the Highlands and Islands. I hope to launch the Farm Business Development Scheme shortly to provide similar support for rural areas outwith the Highlands and Islands.</p>

  <p>It is an offence not to dispose of waste properly and to cause litter. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency and local authorities have the power to serve notice on landowners to clear their land of illegally dumped material and to investigate flytipping and submit reports to the Procurator Fiscal. Local authorities also have the power to impose a fixed penalty on people dropping litter and can require the occupiers of littered publicly-accessible private ground, such as a marketplace or car park, to ensure that litter is removed. However, it will never be possible to eliminate either flytipping or littering so long as those responsible ignore society&#8217;s entitlement to a safe and clean environment.</p>
