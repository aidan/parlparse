  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently funding two advocacy projects for children with learning disabilities. These projects were selected following standard evaluation procedures of bids received under the Children, Young People and Families Unified Voluntary Sector Fund.</p>

  <p>We will make available &#163;250,000 in 2005-06 for advocacy services for parents of all children with additional support needs, and for young people with such needs.</p>

  <p>Credit unions can act either as money advisers or payment distributors for the purpose of the scheme if they meet the criteria and are approved. The Executive is aware that some credit unions are already actively involved in debt advice or have payment distribution services. In recognition of this, and in response to representations made by credit unions, the regulations setting out the detail of the scheme were specifically framed in such a way as to ensure that credit unions were not excluded.</p>

  <p>The UK Energy White Paper, <em>Our Energy Future &#8211; creating a low carbon economy</em> , maintained the UK Government&#8217;s strong commitment to further increase the amount of CHP, including a commitment to increase CHP capacity in the UK to 10,000MW by 2010. The Scottish Executive contributed to the development of the white paper and remains closely involved in its implementation, including the targets for CHP. Scotland is already playing a full part in achieving its share of the UK target and to date has installed capacity of 743MW. The Scottish Executive will continue to encourage further opportunities to advance CHP.</p>

  <p>In the recent past, the Chief Scientist Office (CSO) has received two research proposals on attention deficit hyperkinetic disorder (ADHD). The first proposal, relating to the acute and chronic effects of the psychostimulent drug methylphenidate (Ritalin) in girls with ADHD, was rejected by the Biomedical and Therapeutic Research Committee in June 2003 as it did not meet the required quality threshold for funding.</p>

  <p>The second proposal has now been allocated support through CSO&#8217;s NHS Mental Health Programme Support Grant funding. The proposed research will investigate whether chronic treatment with methylphenidate in boys with ADHD leads to tolerance or sensitisation, two processes associated with the development of substance misuse problems. Work on this project will commence in the near future.</p>

  <p>The White Paper, <em>Partnership for Care</em> , discussed the importance of partnership, integration and redesign in the health service in Scotland. It emphasised the need for sustainable specialist services allied to a wider range of services provided in community settings.

  <p>Professor David Kerr, Rhodes Professor of Cancer Therapeutics and Clinical Pharmacology at Oxford University;</p>

  <p>The work will provide a national context for the planning of health services and will run in tandem with work already underway at local levels. Professor Kerr will report to me within a year with recommendations for the future development of the NHS in Scotland. I have written today to the Chair of the Health Committee with details of the terms of reference for the exercise and copies have also been lodged with the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The Council of Europe report states &quot;There appears to be less emphasis on minority language policy on the part of the Scottish Executive, even though there is political will to protect the Gaelic language, as demonstrated, for example, by the Scottish Minister responsible for Gaelic and measures taken by the Scottish Parliament&quot;.</p>

  <p>This statement is not surprising given the relative position of Welsh in Wales and Gaelic in Scotland. In the 2001 Census, 20.5% of the Welsh population were found to speak Welsh and 28% to understand it. The comparative figures for Gaelic in Scotland were 1.2% speaking Gaelic and 1.9% understanding Gaelic.</p>

  <p>Although this difference would account for the different emphasis on minority language policy in Scotland and Wales, the Scottish Executive is committed to protecting the Gaelic language in Scotland.</p>

This followed an extensive consultation. The guidance can be found on the Executive&#8217;s web site (http://www.scotland.gov.uk/publications/recent.aspx) and is being sent out to local authorities and other key interests, including those with duties under the act. Copies have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre (Bib. numbers: 32428 - <em>Community Planning &amp; Advice Notes</em> ; 32429 - <em>Power to Advance Wellbeing</em> ; and 32430 - <em>Duty to Secure Best Value</em> ).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ambulance Service currently operates a system which specifically provides support for people threatening suicide. The service prioritises all calls it receives via the 999 system to ensure that a person&#8217;s clinical condition receives the most appropriate response.</p>

  <p>The system used - Advanced Medical Priority Dispatch System (AMPDS) - is the primary system used by ambulance services worldwide to prioritise calls. AMPDS has 33 Chief Complaint categories, one of which is Psychiatric/Abnormal Behaviour/Suicide Attempt; this is the protocol applied to a caller contemplating suicide. Whilst an emergency ambulance is dispatched, the Ambulance Service Call Taker remains on the line and provides support and encouragement to the caller or their carer. This ensures that appropriate response and care starts from the moment the 999 call is answered in the Emergency Medical Dispatch Centre (EMDC) and continues until the ambulance arrives on scene and takes over responsibility for the person&#8217;s care.</p>

  <p>Allocations to individual Higher Education Institutions are a matter for the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC).</p>

  <p>I refer to the answer I gave to S2W-7293 on 27 April 2004. Other than in BEd Music, BEd Technology and BEd Physical Education courses, SHEFC does not allocate places to specific subjects.</p>

  <p>SHEFC allocates 171.8 FTE student places to BEd Technology Courses, distributed as follows:</p>

  <p>University of Edinburgh &#8211; 51 places.</p>

  <p>University of Glasgow &#8211; 120.8 places.</p>

  <p>The criteria for the allocation of funded places between institutions are a matter for the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC). In allocating places, SHEFC is expected to take account of advice from the Scottish Executive Education Department on overall expected workforce requirements.</p>

  <p>A survey of local authorities&#8217; teacher vacancies informs the Scottish Executive&#8217;s annual teacher workforce planning exercise in categorising secondary subjects as to the level of priority for intake to higher education institutions.

  <p>The Executive expects to consult, in partnership with the UK Government and the Welsh Assembly, on draft regulations and guidance in the summer, so will not be able to lay any regulations before the summer recess of 2004. As the directive addresses a mix of devolved and reserved matters, we are considering whether implementation will be best achieved by making separate regulations for the Scottish devolved aspects or through UK-wide regulations made by the UK Government.</p>

  <p>The second stage of a three-phase consultation exercise with stakeholders closed on 1 March 2004. Consultation was undertaken jointly by the Scottish Executive, the UK Government, the Welsh Assembly and the Northern Ireland administration. The response is currently being assessed and will inform the proposals to be consulted on in the third phase. The Scottish Executive is discussing the developing proposals with Scottish stakeholders through a range of meetings.</p>

  <p>The directive seeks to reduce the environmental impact of disposing of waste electrical and electronic equipment by encouraging separate collection, setting treatment requirements and requiring high levels of recycling. Manufacturers and importers of goods within the scope of the directive will be made financially responsible for ensuring the collection, reuse, recovery and recycling of waste equipment. The recycling and recovery targets and higher treatment standards are a business opportunity for the waste management industry.</p>
