  <p>The Scottish Government has amended the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 to create a stronger system for supporting children&rsquo;s learning. The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2009 commenced on 14 November 2010. The Scottish Government has also published a revised <em>code of practice: supporting children&rsquo;s learning</em> which explains the duties on education authorities and other agencies to identify, assess and meet the additional support needs of children and young people.</p>

  <p>Local authorities, as the employers of teachers, are responsible for ensuring that relevant and high quality continuing professional development opportunities are available that enable their staff to help achieve better outcomes for all children and young people, including those who need additional support. The Scottish Government has supported that responsibility in a number of ways, including through the development of the Framework for Inclusion, which underpins teacher education and professional development in this area.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether there has been a reduction in the national HEAT 3 target of 19,493 children aged 5 to 15 to complete a healthy weight programme and, if so, for what reason and what the new target is.</p>

  <p>The HEAT 3 child healthy weight target was a development target. Final target numbers were agreed with boards as part of the 2010-11 local delivery plan sign-off process. The final target agreed in March 2010 was 6,317 completed interventions with the majority (4,453) being delivered in the third year of the target. We are in the process of agreeing the target for the next three years of 4,500, 5,000 and 5,500 interventions, which will result in 15,000 children completing a healthy weight intervention over the three-year period.</p>
