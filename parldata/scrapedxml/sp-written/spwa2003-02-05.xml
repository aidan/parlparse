  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Scottish Land Court will have the required number of members necessary to perform the functions that will be conferred upon it under the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill; and whether it will remove the maximum age limit at which existing members must vacate office, and whether it will make a permanent appointment of a deputy chairman.</p>

  <p>The Executive has always provided the Scottish Land Court with the staffing resources it requires. We envisage no difficulty about continuing to do that in future.</p>

  <p>We have no intention of removing the maximum age limit at which existing members must vacate office. None of its members is near the retirement age of 65. That retirement age was part of the package on pay and conditions that members freely entered into when appointed.</p>

  <p>There is no business case at present in either the Land Court or the Lands Tribunal for Scotland for the creation of a permanent post of Deputy Chairman. Powers for the ad hoc appointment of a deputy chairman already exist (see paragraph 10 of Schedule 1 to the Scottish Land Court Act 1993). These have been used once in the last eight years and they worked perfectly satisfactorily. Staffing levels are kept under regular review in consultation with Lord McGhie. The Executive stand ready to respond to bids for more staff when the workloads justify this.</p>

  <p>It is our intention that the jurisdiction of the Scottish Land Court and the Lands Tribunal for Scotland under the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill will be entirely distinct. They will not overlap. We have tabled an amendment to the bill which would give the tribunal jurisdiction over valuation appeals in relation to the right to buy. The Land Court will have a general jurisdiction over disputes arising out of agricultural tenancies under the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1991 and the bill, but will not have jurisdiction over valuation appeals.</p>

  <p>We recognise that there may be cases concerned with valuation appeals that raise issues that fall within the jurisdiction of the Land Court. Therefore, in order to facilitate the efficient disposal of such cases, I can confirm that we have also lodged an amendment to the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill that would enable the tribunal to refer a matter to the Land Court if it considers that to be appropriate.</p>

  <p>In their report on <em>Jurisdictions under the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Acts</em> (Scot Law Com No 178), upon which Part 7 of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Bill is based, the Scottish Law Commission recommended that the Land Court be given power to act as arbiter of consent on a contractual reference, similar to the power available to the Lands Tribunal for Scotland under section 1(5) of the Lands Tribunal Act 1949.</p>

  <p>New section 60(2)(d) of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 1991 (as introduced by section 59 of the bill) makes such provision as is appropriate in relation to tenancies under the 1991 act.</p>

  <p>Section 61(2)(d) of the bill makes equivalent provision in respect of tenancies under the bill.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what consideration its Environment and Rural Affairs Department gives to any trampling around outdoor feed rings by livestock when considering whether a farmer is liable to pay a penalty for overgrazing a field.</p>

  <p>Trampling around outdoor feed rings by livestock may constitute a breach of scheme conditions if it caused damage to a designated site, a site being managed in the interests of conservation under an agri-environment agreement, or to natural or semi-natural vegetation anywhere on a holding in receipt of livestock subsidy or agri-environment payments. In such a case, my department would discuss the situation and potential remedies with the claimant, but in the absence of corrective or preventative action some or all of any payment due would be withheld. If the damage was to any other areas or if the farmer did not claim subsidy, there would be no implications for payments.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will give any consideration to extending the range of disposals available to district courts in order to include community service orders.</p>

  <p>District courts deal with relatively minor offences and therefore have limited sentencing powers in respect of custody. In the year 2001, only 1% of all cases dealt with by district courts resulted in a custodial sentence. Community Service Orders are, however, defined by statute as a direct alternative to custody. These factors indicate that Community Service Orders would not be a suitable penalty in the vast majority of cases handled by district courts and that any such extension might put offenders convicted of relatively minor offences at risk of custody. The Scottish Executive therefore considers that it would be inappropriate to make Community Service Orders available to the district court.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what recommendations have been made by the working group on discrimination in reaction to the report <em>The Experience of Violence and Harassment of Gay Men in the City of Edinburgh</em> and what specific action has been taken in response.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-02-05.6.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80171" speakername="Hugh Henry" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0205.htm#4">

  <p>There is no official Scottish Executive working group on discrimination, although the Steering Group established to co-ordinate the Scottish response to the Stephen Lawrence Inquiry Report did deal with discrimination. <em>The Experience of Violence and Harassment of Gay Men in the City of Edinburgh</em> was not considered by the Steering Group.</p>

  <p>The report made a number of recommendations for a wide range of agencies to consider including the Executive. One of the main recommendations was that an inter-agency group at national level should be established to consider the violence and harassment experienced by gay men across Scotland. This was supported by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) and the Scottish Executive and led to the setting up of a wider group, the Scottish Police and Lesbian, Gay, Bi-sexual and Transgender (LGBT) Community Liaison Forum. The forum&#8217;s main remit is to advise ACPOS on service delivery issues in relation to LGBT communities. It also advises COSLA and the Executive on service delivery and policy issues in relation to policing the LGBT communities. The Scottish Executive is represented on the forum, which has just completed its second productive year.</p>

  <p>Note:</p>

  <p>1. Estimated from Home Office data. Figures are provisional.</p>

  <p>The figures provided on the total number of persons with a charge proved for drug offences are derived from the Scottish Executive Justice Department&#8217;s court proceedings database. This database does not currently hold information on the type of drug involved in such convictions.</p>

  <p>The Home Office collects data separately on drug offenders, including information on the type of drug involved in court convictions and fiscal fines. The coverage of this data is known to be incomplete. For example, the Home Office data are currently estimated to cover about 91% of total Scottish convictions for drug offences in 2000. However, it is possible to make use of this information to estimate the proportion of convictions involving different types of drug.</p>

  <p>Information on drug-related deaths are published by the General Register Office for Scotland. In a recent review, <em>Reducing drug related deaths</em> (2000), The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs reports that there is no literature evidence of acute death directly due to toxicity from cannabis.</p>

  <p>1. Estimated from Home Office data. Figures are provisional.</p>

  <p>The figures provided on the total number of persons with a charge proved for drug offences are derived from the Scottish Executive Justice Department&#8217;s court proceedings database. This database does not currently hold information on the type of drug involved in such convictions.</p>

  <p>The Home Office collects data separately on drug offenders, including information on the type of drug involved in court convictions and fiscal fines. The coverage of this data is known to be incomplete. For example, the Home Office data are currently estimated to cover about 91% of total Scottish convictions for drug offences in 2000. However, it is possible to make use of this information to estimate the proportion of convictions involving different types of drug.</p>

  <p>Information on drug-related deaths is published by the General Register Office for Scotland. Figures relating to heroin are grouped with morphine in the statistics and are given in the following Table 2.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. When a number of drugs are identified in a body it is not always possible to tell which of them made the major contribution to death. The information on heroin/morphine corresponds to the number of deaths where heroin/morphine was mentioned on the death certificate or was identified following investigation.</p>

  <p>2. It is believed that for the overwhelming majority of cases where morphine has been identified in post-mortem toxicological tests its presence is a result of heroin use.</p>

  <p>A Green Goddess and the Breathing Apparatus Rescue Team were actioned in response to an emergency call. A police traffic patrol unit was in the vicinity at the time and responded immediately when this call came through. In line with operational orders they assessed the situation and found no visible flames, and no cries for help/assistance. They sought advice on entry to the building from the Senior Fire Officer present at the Joint Operational Control Centre. They were instructed not to force entry as a Green Goddess and Breathing Apparatus Rescue Team were en route to the incident. The involvement of the traffic patrol unit did not affect the time of response to the emergency call.</p>

  <p>The Bain Report recommends a move to risk assessed fire cover rather than the current rigid system of response based on property and geographical area. This mirrors proposals contained in the Executive&#8217;s policy consultation paper published last April. The Executive is currently considering how to take this forward to ensure that the new arrangements provide even better protection for the public.</p>

  <p>Mixed crewing of appliances could satisfy existing standards in some circumstances. Current standards of fire cover are directly related to local geographic areas and timed attendance targets. In some areas, the target response does permit the use of retained personnel, in others it would be difficult to achieve. A move to a risk assessment approach may alter the target response on the basis of professional judgement. The option of using mixed crewing could, therefore, also be reconsidered and changed.</p>

  <p>We are considering this report from the Fostering Network and how best to take forward the proposals they have made to improve the fostering system in Scotland. We will be examining those concerning the legal framework for fostering during the second phase of the adoption policy review, which is due to report next year. Many of the remaining proposals involve the management and delivery of foster services and are the responsibility of local authorities. We are also in contact with the Department of Health on their review of fostering services, <em>Choice Protects</em> , which is considering similar issues for England and Wales, as well as some reserved matters involving pension arrangements for foster carers. We will continue to discuss relevant issues with the Fostering Network.</p>

  <p>As an Executive Agency, the SPS operates under a framework document, the text of which is available on SPS&#8217;s website at: <a href="www.sps.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.sps.gov.uk</a> . Paragraph 3.1 of that document says that &quot;The Chief Executive is responsible and accountable for operational and contractual matters involving the Agency and for its performance. He or she is answerable to the Scottish Ministers.&quot; Paragraph 3.2 of the document says that &quot;The Chief Executive may make changes in the organisation and management structure of SPS in pursuit of its aims and objectives.&quot;</p>

  <p>As the framework document makes clear, Scottish ministers expect the Chief Executive to manage SPS consistent with the aims and objectives set by ministers and to obtain the best value for taxpayers&#8217; money made available by ministers. Within that policy and resources framework, decisions on contracting out services are therefore for the Chief Executive.</p>
