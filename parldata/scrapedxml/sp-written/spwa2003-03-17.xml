  <p>The Active Communities Initiative is our strategy for supporting voluntary and community action within local communities across Scotland. It has four key objectives:</p>

  <p>to bring about positive attitudes to volunteering;</p>

  <p>to locate volunteering at the heart of policy and practice;</p>

  <p>to broaden the range of people involved, and</p>

  <p>to increase the number of people involved.</p>

  <p>Any voluntary organisation with proposals that advance and support these overall objectives can seek financial assistance from the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The provision of outdoor play facilities for children with disabilities is a matter for local agencies, for example, local authorities.</p>

  <p>As the largest provider of lifelong learning in Scotland, the further education sector has a vital role in helping to deliver many of the Executive&#146;s policy priorities, including those to re-establish Scotland&#146;s entrepreneurial drive and to increase the number of new businesses and growing businesses. In considering matters of demand and supply, including the provision of skills to people wanting to set up their own business, the Scottish Executive encourages colleges to be vibrant and responsive.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not fund further education colleges directly. That is the responsibility of the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC). Under the terms of the Further and Higher Education (Scotland) Act 1992, colleges of further education are independent bodies responsible for determining, among other things, their own curriculum. Whether a course of a specific type is available at a particular college is therefore a matter for the board of management of the college concerned.</p>

  <p>In addition, general support is available to individuals wishing to start a business from the enterprise networks.</p>

  <p>In the short-term, it is our intention to target forthcoming transitional support of up to &#163;10 million through a variety of selection criteria and conditions of award. One such condition will require white fish vessels restricted to 15 days per month (or the equivalent) to tie up rather than pursue additional fishing opportunities (for example on nephrops). In the long term, we plan to consult on other options such as restrictive licences.</p>

  <p>This information is not yet available. The Economic Impact Assessment Group has commissioned external consultants to provide an assessment of the outbreak and that work is in its final stages.</p>

  <p>In addition to a Scotland total, the assessment will quantify the economic impact of the outbreak on sectors and regions of Scotland. In line with the definitions used during the outbreak, Scotland will be divided geographically into three categories: South of Scotland, central belt and north of the central belt. As such, separate information on Dumfries and Galloway and Scottish Borders will not be available.</p>

  <p>Estimates of long-term impacts will be included.</p>

  <p>The paper entitled <i>Improving Health in Scotland &#150; the Challenge</i> is published today. It provides a framework for action over the coming 12 to 15 months. It indicates a role for the Scottish Executive, NHS boards, local government, voluntary sector, private sector and the public to work in partnership to improve Scotland&#146;s health and narrow the gap between the most and least affluent communities. Today at the Healthy Scotland Convention, the third in a series, around 300 people will gather to celebrate the success of efforts to date and plan further action to improve Scotland&#146;s health record.</p>

  <p>The data on receptions are held in such a way that it is not possible to provide an answer to each element of the question.</p>

  <p>However, the following two tables show the number of people detained on 30 June of 2000 and 2001 and the number detained in connection with illegal drugs offences. As the warrants only record the fact that illegal drugs were involved, it is not possible to identify where these offences related to the possession or supply of cannabis.</p>

  <p>In the period running from the beginning of the process until the date that the reletting is completed in 2004, costs are likely to have been incurred directly and indirectly by a range of parties, including the Scottish Executive, Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive and Authority, the Strategic Rail Authority, each bidding company, and UK bodies.</p>

  <p>Trunking of local roads, or detrunking of parts of the existing network, is effected by means of an order made under section 5(2) of the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984.

  <p>Responsibility for the provision of recreational and leisure facilities is primarily a matter for local authorities. In December 2002, local authorities were notified of their Quality of Life funding over the next three financial years. This funding is expected to be used to reflect the shared central and local government priorities for improving the local environment and increasing opportunities for children and young people. This funding follows the success of the reallocation of &#163;95 million of Executive funds in June 2002, which some local authorities chose to spend on skateparks.</p>

  <p>In addition to this, applications for the provision of such facilities can be made to <strong></strong>sportscotland under the Lottery Sports Fund&#146;s Sport Facilities Programme. Another possible funding route is the Awards for All Programme, though the maximum level of award is &#163;5,000.</p>
