  <p>We are working with retailers to reduce the number of single-use carrier bags generally. I met retailers on 15 May to discuss this matter and it was agreed a working group should be established. This working group has its first meeting on 19 June and will discuss a variety of issues including public information campaigns on bags. We await with interest the views of the working group on the issue of biodegradable and compostable bags. This is not a straightforward issue and there is some evidence to suggest that biodegradable bags going to landfill can generate methane, a greenhouse gas and that they can also contaminate the recycling stream for conventional plastic bags.</p>

  <p>It is intended that single outcome agreements (SOAs) will develop over time and equality impact assessments will be part of that process. The Scottish Government would not delay signing off an SOA at this stage because the EQIA is not complete. However, we are emphasising to councils and Community Planning Partnerships their responsibilities in relation to the public sector equality duties, in particular toward 2009-10 when we expect SOAs will include Community Planning Partnerships.</p>

  <p>Under the Scotland Act 1998, matters relating to oil and gas, including offshore installations and pipelines, are reserved. However, I understand that in response to two recent incidents involving the discharge of crude oil in produced water from the Beatrice Alpha platform that the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) are investigating the incidents. As a consequence BERR have taken enforcement action in line with the Offshore Petroleum Activities (Oil Pollution Prevention and Control) Regulations 2005.</p>

  <p>The initial clean up of oil coming ashore as a consequence of the spill in question was co-ordinated by the Highland Council. However when it was established that the oil had come from Beatrice Alpha platform, Talisman Energy (UK) Ltd took over responsibility for arranging the clean up and contracted Oil Spill Response Limited (OSRL) to undertake the removal of the oil, which was in the form of small tarry lumps, coming ashore on successive tides. Highland Council has advised that as far as they are aware all oil observed on beaches is being successfully removed by OSRL.</p>

  <p>Information on appeals against decisions to remove patients from waiting lists is not collected centrally. We are not aware of any appeals that have been made or indeed any complaints received. There are a number of safeguards that protect the interests of patients in relation to their position on hospital waiting lists.</p>

  <p>I have made clear that patients will be able to ask, at any time, to see the waiting time information held by their local NHS board about them and if necessary to have that information corrected. The Independent Advice and Support Service are also available to support patients or their representatives in making representation to NHS boards about any aspects of hospital care including their removal from a waiting list.</p>

  <p>The NHS in Scotland already has a well established formal complaints procedure in place. Information on the number of complaints made and the issues raised, including waiting times, is published annually. It will not be possible to separate complaints relating to the operation of New Ways from complaints about other aspects of waiting times.</p>

  <p>The New Ways guidance sets out the rule around the removal of patients from the waiting list and it makes clear that the GP and the patients must be informed. We would normally expect that the reasons for removal from a waiting list are discussed and agreed between the clinician and the patient. Where patients are returned to the care of their GP they can of course be re-referred once they are available for hospital care.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>Published national guidance on the management of waiting lists states that if a patient does not attend on the agreed date then the patient would be recorded as a &quot;Did Not Attend&quot; and their waiting time clock re-set to zero. The health care professional responsible for treating the patient can decide whether to refer the patient back to the care of their GP or to offer another appointment. However, hospitals have the discretion based on the individual patient&rsquo;s circumstance to offer the patient a new appointment quickly.</p>

  <p>The guidance also makes clear that the patient and the patient&rsquo;s GP should be informed if a decision is made to return a patient to the care of their GP. The GP can of course re-refer the patient.</p>

  <p>Voluntary modulation enables the Scottish Government to transfer money from Pillar I of the CAP to Pillar 2 in order to augment the low funding level of Rural Development funding that Scotland receives from the European Commission, as a result of the deal accepted by the UK Government.

  <p>Funding allocations within the Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP) are made according to four axes defined in the Rural Development Regulation (EC Regulation 1698/2005). These four axes cover business development, the countryside and environment, rural communities and LEADER. In addition, the SRDP shows an indicative financial breakdown for 29 specific policy measures within these axes.

  <p>Special advisers provide policy advice, not legal advice. The role of a special adviser is to help ministers on matters where the work of government and the work of the party overlap and it would be inappropriate for permanent civil servants to become involved. They provide policy, political and presentational advice and support to ministers. Professor MacCormick is the First Minister&rsquo;s adviser on Europe and external relations and Duncan Hamilton is his political adviser.</p>

  <p>We are working in partnership with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and individual local authorities to achieve shared policy aims. As I have indicated, we will include our 25% limit for energy from waste technologies for treating municipal waste by 2025 in the National Planning Framework, at both a national and regional level.</p>

  <p>No such agreements exist. However, in my statement to parliament on the 24 January I made it quite clear that I would apply a 25% cap on the amount of municipal waste sent to energy-from-waste facilities and that this cap would be incorporated, in due course, into the National Planning Framework.</p>
