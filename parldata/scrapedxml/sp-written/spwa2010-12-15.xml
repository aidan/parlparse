  <p>I am pleased to say that we have today published the first progress report against our Games Legacy Plan, <em>A games legacy for Scotland</em> , which was launched in September 2009. Since then, working with our partners, we have made good progress across all key areas in our ambitions for delivering a lasting legacy for the people and communities of Scotland.</p>

  <p>This update outlines the progress made on our aspiration to get people more physically active. Significant progress has been made through the launch of the Active Nation campaign with Scots everywhere taking their own steps towards a healthier life. The first community sports hub is also now in use with each local authority committed to creating and developing their own hubs to suit local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>The work done in regenerating the east end of Glasgow through the work on the athlete&rsquo;s village and velodrome is also detailed. The games continue to provide an essential boost to the national and local economy with the report illustrating Scottish companies&rsquo; successes in winning 82% of games related contracts so far, worth around &pound;158 million to the Scottish economy.</p>

  <p>In developing programmes for our young people, 71 youth legacy ambassadors have been recruited from all over Scotland to promote and ensure that young people will be directly involved in creating the legacies they want to see in their own communities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has always been quite clear that the games will touch upon all communities. The games for Scotland programme around the Delhi handover was celebrated in all 32 local authorities and work will continue to ensure that the level of engagement and commitment by partners is maintained as we move forward to 2014.</p>

  <p>With the games now handed to Scotland the update reflects that their legacy is beginning to deliver for people now, and shows that we are well on track not only to deliver an outstanding games but leave a lasting impact on all of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The update <em>A games legacy for Scotland</em> can be found at: <br /> <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/ArtsCultureSport/Sport/MajorEvents/Glasgow-2014/Commonwealth-games" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/ArtsCultureSport/Sport/MajorEvents/Glasgow-2014/Commonwealth-games</a>.</p>

  <p>A copy of the document has also been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe) (Bib. number 52207).</p>

  <p>The RET pilot scheme has been extended to spring 2012. The final results of the evaluation of the pilot will be available early in 2011.

  <p>Decisions about the future of RET will be taken once the final results of the evaluation of the pilot are available in early 2011. Decisions will be taken in good time to allow ferry operators to set fares for 2012, and for businesses to plan accordingly.</p>

  <p>There were 3,471 cases in which the absence of access to a solicitor prior to interview at a police station had been raised at the date of the decision. An initial estimate indicated that 120 solemn cases were likely to be challenged. Cases are currently being reviewed, with priority being given to solemn cases, and where appropriate further enquiries are being conducted to ascertain if there are other sources of evidence that may provide a sufficiency of evidence.

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is currently monitoring the impact of the decision in Her Majesty&rsquo;s Advocate v Cadder.</p>

  <p>There were 3,471 cases in which the absence of access to a solicitor prior to interview at a police station had been raised at the date of the decision. An initial estimate indicated that 120 solemn cases were likely to be challenged. Cases are currently being reviewed, with priority being given to solemn cases, and where appropriate further enquiries are being conducted to ascertain if there are other sources of evidence that may provide a sufficiency of evidence. The Crown intends to publish statistics on the impact of the judgment at the conclusion of this review process in early 2011.</p>

  <p>Israel is a party to the World Trade Organization&rsquo;s Government Procurement Agreement (GPA). The GPA is an international trade agreement that applies in the UK, other EU member states and other participating countries, including Israel. It provides that EU companies have a legal right of access to contract opportunities advertised by public bodies in Israel and that Israeli companies have equivalent rights when tendering for public contracts in the EU.</p>

  <p>Companies which have failed to comply with the law or which have committed acts of grave misconduct may be excluded from competition. It is not usually possible, however, to refuse to deal with a company simply because it has a connection to another country or because it is offering to supply goods produced in another country.</p>

  <p>There are no legal set-back distances. Scottish Planning Policy recommends a 2km separation distance between areas of search for wind farms and the edge of cities, towns and villages. The Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Public Petitions Committee has supported this position as a guide rather than a rule in closing petition PE1328; the petition summary can be accessed on the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s website <a href="../../petitions/docs/PE1328.htm">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/petitions/docs/PE1328.htm</a> .</p>

  <p>Development of the transport plan for the 2014 Ryder Cup is at an early stage and final decisions on transport provision for the event have yet to be agreed. As such, I am not in a position to provide any costings for the possible upgrading of Gleneagles Station or potential road access at this time.</p>

  <p>AECOM&rsquo;s independent review published earlier this year on behalf of the Campaign to Open Blackford Railway Station Again (COBRA) quotes the cost of re-opening Blackford Station to be &pound;4.5 million. This figure was estimated by the Tayside and Central Scotland Transport Partnership in its Tay Estuary Rail Study and does not include road access.</p>
