  <p>Decisions on prosecution of retailers are a matter for procurators fiscal. The roll-out of test purchasing across Scotland is providing both police forces and licensing boards with valuable information on retailers who irresponsibly and unlawfully sell to those who are under age. Test purchasing operations are now leading to licensing boards suspending licences in respect of premises that have sold alcohol unlawfully.</p>

  <p>Nucleic acid detection of viruses in blood, in general, detects positive donations at an earlier stage after the infective episode than antibody or antigen tests. For HIV, for example, a nucleic acid test in general becomes positive after about 11 days after exposure whereas for the current HIV anti-body test this is around 21 days after exposure.</p>

  <p>The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service introduced nucleic acid testing for HIV in November 2002 as an additional test to improve the safety of the Scottish blood supply.</p>

  <p>It is not possible for the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service to introduce nucleic acid testing as its &quot;standard&quot; test because the UK Blood Safety and Quality Regulations require an antibody test for HIV and hepatitis C to be performed on each donation as the &quot;standard&quot; test.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government considers it is important for any nucleic acid blood testing (NAT) regime to specify both hepatitis C virus and HIV. This is the regime carried out by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service to test blood supplies in Scotland.

  <p>The following changes to the blood donation testing regime have been introduced by the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service over the past decade:</p>

  <p>By April 1999 all blood for transfusion was tested negative for hepatitis C by both antibody and nucleic acid testing (NAT).</p>

  <p>NAT testing for HIV/AIDS was introduced in November 2002</p>

  <p>Testing for Human T-Lymphotropic Virus 1 (HTLV-1) was introduced in August 2002</p>

  <p>Malaria antibody testing of donors with a risk of malaria was introduced in 2004.</p>

  <p>Testing of apheresis donors for anti-hepatitis B core began in March 2005 and testing of platelets for bacteria using the BActAlert system started in 2004.</p>

  <p>Various exclusion criteria for donors have been introduced over the past decade as a risk reduction measure against variant CJD.</p>

  <p>Visitors to the United States must wait at least 28 days after their return to donate as a precaution against West Nile Virus transmission.</p>

  <p>Men who have had sex with men, and who fail to acknowledge this at a blood donation session, have consistently the highest incidence of being HIV positive. This is the case with or without the implementation of nucleic acid testing. Securing the safety of the national blood supply in Scotland is a major priority. The Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service follows strict United Kingdom and European rules and regulations when collecting and processing blood to make sure it supplies the NHS in Scotland with the safest possible blood. The regulations are monitored and reviewed on a regular basis by medical and scientific experts. We believe it is important to accept this medical and scientific advice.</p>

  <p>There is no straightforward definition of a sustainable community. <em>Scottish Planning Policy 1 &ndash; The Planning System (SPP 1)</em> states that planning should encourage sustainable development by:</p>

  <p>promoting regeneration and the full and appropriate use of land, buildings and infrastructure;</p>

  <p>promoting the use of previously developed land and minimising greenfield development;</p>

  <p>conserving important historic and cultural assets;</p>

  <p>protecting and enhancing areas for recreation and natural heritage;</p>

  <p>supporting better access by foot, cycle and public transport, as well as by car;</p>

  <p>encouraging energy efficiency through the layout and design of development;</p>

  <p>considering the lifecycle of development from the outset, and</p>

  <p>encouraging prudent use of natural resources.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Sustainable Communities Initiative is being taken forward currently and a framework document inviting local authorities and their partners to submit proposals for new sustainable communities will be published in the next few weeks.</p>

  <p>The Straiton exchange was initially upgraded for broadband under a Scottish Government contract with BT. This exchange has a broadband product called Exchange Activate which has a limit on take-up. The government has recently become aware of a capacity problem experienced at the Straiton exchange.

  <p>There are 106 premises currently registered by people from the Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley constituency who are essentially too distant from their exchange to receive broadband. They are thus included under our broadband reach procurement. The break down by postcode area is:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the vital role of all those working throughout the supply chain in ensuring the long-term capacity and capability of our food supply. We have established a Food group, under the Resilience Advisory Board for Scotland (RABS) structure, to bring together key people to define what the issues are that need to be considered and what more government could do to work with the food sector to tackle vulnerabilities during an emergency. This group met for the first time on 15 May 2008.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has received representations from several organisations on the issue of smart meters for domestic gas and electricity supplies including the Energy Retail Association, energy supply companies, Energy Action Scotland, local authorities and Ofgem.</p>

  <p>In particular, we received 15 representations on smart meters in response to the consultation on a draft energy efficiency and microgeneration strategy which issued in March 2007. Individual responses have already been published on the Scottish Government website. We will shortly be publishing an analysis of all the responses including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s response to views expressed in the consultation.</p>

  <p>In general, all of the representations we have received were supportive of smart meters as a means to reduce energy consumption.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is supportive of measures which help to reduce energy demand and we recognise that smart meters and real time displays could play a role. We work closely with the UK Government in this policy area and are currently awaiting the results of a major UK-wide pilot to understand the costs and benefits of smart meters. This pilot includes Scottish consumers and it makes sense to await the results of the pilot before further considering the widespread roll-out of smart meters.</p>

  <p>Agreement has been reached with COSLA on the key elements of the transfer of local regeneration functions to local authorities in the Scottish Enterprise area, in line with the enterprise networks reform package announced last September. No equivalent transfer of regeneration functions is envisaged in respect of Highlands and Islands Enterprise, recognising that organisation&rsquo;s continuing role in strengthening local communities. The agreement also covers the transfer of Business Gateway functions to local authorities, reflecting their increased responsibility for local economic development activity.</p>

  <p>In line with the agreement, the lead role in local regeneration projects will in future lie with local authorities. There will be a transitional period over the next two to three years during which Scottish Enterprise will conclude its own involvement in a number of such local projects, to ensure continuity of delivery. A list of those projects is set out below. Reflecting the difficulty inherent in categorising such interventions, no firm definition has been set out in the agreement as to what should constitute a local as opposed to regional or national project. However, the list provides an indication as to the range of projects in which local authorities may in future, wish to invest. It has been agreed that the distribution of funding to individual authorities in respect of the transfer of local regeneration functions out of Scottish Enterprise, should be determined in further discussions between the Scottish Government and COSLA.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has no plans to issue a separate single purpose entitlement card.</p>

  <p>There is no compulsion for anyone in Scotland to use a multi-application card, i.e. a number of entitlements on one card. They can, if they wish, choose to have a card which functions only as a travel card, i.e. single entitlement, rather than the full multi-application card.</p>

  <p>However, the national entitlement card helps deliver the Scotland-wide free bus travel scheme to older and disabled Scots as well as the young persons concessionary travel scheme. Both these schemes are national schemes and therefore there needs to be a national card which is recognised and works as an electronic ticket across Scotland. In order to be recognised by the different bus companies across the country the card&rsquo;s appearance and technology needs to be the same as the multi-application cards.</p>

  <p>Young people, particularly over 18s, have a number of ways of proving their age, e.g. driving licences, student cards etc, and there are a number of cards in circulation which have been accredited under the British Retail Consortium&rsquo;s proof of age standard scheme (PASS).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has provided considerable levels of funding behind the Young Scot national entitlement card which is PASS accredited. However, carrying the card is a voluntary matter and there is no intention to introduce a requirement to carry a compulsory proof of age card.</p>

  <p>Current priorities of the national entitlement card scheme are to replace the various and numerous card schemes currently run by local authorities, to reduce the number of cards people have to carry and to help make use of the card easier, i.e. one card to access many services.</p>

  <p>The card is currently used for the national concessionary travel schemes and locally, for library services, leisure services, cashless catering, free school meals and secure door entry and similar. The Young Scot version of the card also carries the British Retail Consortium&rsquo;s proof of age standard scheme logo and offers young people a variety of retail and leisure discounts.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not have access to any of the data provided by applicants for a national entitlement card. Local authorities are the issuing authority for the scheme.</p>

  <p>Each local authority has access to the records of their own residents only and is the data controller for this information. However, only a handful of staff within each local authority have access to these records.</p>

  <p>Transaction data in relation to individual services will continue to be held separately by local authorities and the only people able to access an individual&rsquo;s data will be those who are responsible for delivering the services, whether these are concessionary fare services, library or leisure services etc. This is no different from previous systems.</p>

  <p>There is no difference in the information held on the national entitlement card whether it is a single-application card or a multi-application card.</p>

  <p>The card holder&rsquo;s name, photograph and the card reference number are printed on the card. In the case of a young person who holds a Young Scot version of the card their date of birth is also included for proof of age standards scheme purposes.</p>

  <p>As the card is a smartcard it holds a chip which contains the minimum information needed to manage the card. This is basic personal details &ndash; name, house number and postcode, date of birth and gender as well as, in some cases, information needed by the service(s) the card holder has applied for.</p>

  <p>The card management system also includes name, address, a unique application number, card number and the date of issue, plus any information relating to the re-issue or replacement of a card.</p>

  <p>Card holders can request a copy of the information held on the card management system in accordance with data protection principles.</p>

  <p>Where it is necessary to hold a card for a particular service, such as the Scotland-wide concessionary travel schemes individuals will require a national entitlement card. This is no different to how previous travel schemes worked.</p>

  <p>However, there is no intention to issue national entitlement cards to the whole population, but they will be issued to those who wish to have one. This will depend on what services local authorities offer and whether they wish to use the card to provide access to these services. Where an individual only wishes to use the card for travel purposes they will need to carry other cards to access their local authority library/leisure services.</p>

  <p>The Strategic Review of the Delivery of Legal Aid, Advice and Information (published by Scottish ministers in 2004) considered the question of financial eligibility for criminal legal assistance. The review was not persuaded that there should be universal eligibility for criminal legal aid, and did not propose a general principle that the state should meet privately funded costs on acquittal. The Review considered that the general principle of ability to pay should be applied and that a contributory system would be consistent with that principle. It proposed that under such a system, where costs were met in part through a contribution by the accused person, that contribution should be refunded in the event of an acquittal.</p>

  <p>We have no current plans to introduce such a system but will consider it further as part of a broader consideration of financial eligibility rules for publicly funded legal assistance.</p>

  <p>Although responsibility for financial control rests with each local authority, the Scottish Government collects revenue budget and outturn information from each local authority but the provisional outturn information is not yet available for 2007-08.</p>

  <p>Given the rolling nature of capital expenditure plans, which are updated on an on-going basis to reflect new projects, slippage in programmes and revised assumptions on resourcing, the concept of over or underspends on capital expenditure does not apply in this context.</p>

  <p>No. Under our proposals, all income raised under a local income tax will go to fund local authority expenditure and local authorities will continue to decide how funding for their area is spent. In the consultation paper we issued in March 2008, we recognised that there would need to be an adjustment to local authority funding to take account of differences between the amounts raised under the council tax and under a local income tax and we pledged to work with local government to provide a stable funding environment to ensure people get the vital front-line services they need.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Deaths of Scottish residents are counted on the basis of the addresses of their usual residences, as recorded when their deaths were registered; deaths of non-residents are counted on the basis of where they died.</p>

  <p>2. The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) is produced using a range of statistical information for each of the &quot;datazones&quot; in Scotland, which have 500-1,000 residents each. For Scotland as a whole, quintile 1 contains the most deprived 20% of datazones, and quintile 5 contains the least deprived 20% of datazones, when classified on the basis used for the SIMD; for the NHS boards, the figures for each quintile were produced from the data for those parts that are in each SIMD quintile. As a result, a NHS board may not include any of the datazones which fall into a particular quintile, or the figures shown may have been produced from the data for considerably more, or less, than 20% of the NHS board.</p>

  <p>3. These figures were produced by using the distribution by age of the overall Scottish population for 2006. That is the same method as was used to produce the standardised death rates which appear in Table 2 of &quot;Scotland's Population 2006&quot;.</p>

  <p>4. The new Highland NHS board area, i.e. including parts of the former Argyll and Clyde NHS board area.</p>

  <p>5. The total number of deaths from which the standardised death rate was calculated. This may be small because only a small proportion of a NHS board&rsquo;s area was in a particular SIMD quintile: if so, the standardised death rate for a single year might not provide a reliable indication of the normal level of mortality because there could be large year-to-year percentage changes in the number of deaths. For example, if a particular quintile tended to have around 100 deaths per year, it would not be surprising if its figures fluctuated by 10-20% between one year and the next.</p>

  <p>6. The sum of the figures for all the quintiles may differ slightly from the published total number of deaths for a NHS board&rsquo;s area. There may be a number of reasons for this: for example, some of the datazones used in the SIMD might not fit properly within the boundary of the NHS board area, or corrections may have been made to some of the underlying data after the published figures were produced.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government view is that the removal of the residency requirement for F1 trainees represents an improvement in their conditions of service, reflecting the improvements in their working hours. It is also our view that as salaries for doctors in training are already competitive even without free accommodation there is no case for increasing salaries to reflect this change.</p>

  <p>Following an invitation from John Hooper, Chair of the Independent Review of the Postal Services Sector on 13 March, the Scottish Government responded to the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform&rsquo;s review of the postal services sector on 22 May. A copy of that response can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/06/postalreviewresponse" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/06/postalreviewresponse</a>.</p>

  <p>In developing our response we sought the views of a number of Scottish Business Organisations including SCDI, FSB, Scottish Chambers, CBI and Institute of Directors as well as the STUC.</p>

  <p>The independent review team in DBERR invited a wide range of organisations with a direct interest in postal services including mail companies, regulators, consumer and business organisations, unions, Government Departments and political parties to participate in the review.</p>

  <p>There was nothing to stop MSPs from responding direct to the independent review panel if they had so wished and indeed many MPs from all political parties did so.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) is different and better than the standard form of PFI funding in three ways. Firstly, SFT will have at its core the non-profit distributing model of finance. This removes the equity element of PFI funding which is the part of the finance that has delivered excessive profits. Secondly, SFT will provide a level of expertise in the development of projects and in the negotiation of contracts that is not available to many smaller public bodies and local authorities. With SFT involvement the public sector will therefore be dealing with bidders on a more equal footing and as a result will be in a position to deliver more competitive and realistic deals. Thirdly, by pooling projects there will be efficiencies in terms of delivery, risk and finance that together will result in savings.</p>

  <p><em>Taking Forward the Scottish Futures Trust</em> (Bib. number 45605) was produced by the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT) delivery team and was endorsed by the Scottish Futures Trust steering group.

  <p>The SFT work was informed by many informal discussions with industry and advisory interests, academics, and public sector practitioners, and by the 89 responses to the SFT consultation exercise.

  <p>There is a range of funding mechanisms available to public bodies for investment, and public bodies should continue to use the funding mechanism most appropriate to the investment they are undertaking to secure best value for money. The Government has published its infrastructure investment plan that includes &pound;14 billion of capital investment over the next three years.</p>

  <p>We do not agree with the standard form of PFI being used for mainstream projects which have a standard risk profile as it has allowed excessive returns for private investors. Our preference is for the non profit distributing model to be used for these projects as returns for the private investors are capped and surpluses are returned for the public interest.</p>

  <p>It is by virtue of being full-time and not part-time that a student is disregarded for the purposes of council tax. Where a part-time student is disregarded or eligible for some form of exemption from council tax, this is unrelated to their part-time student status and no accurate breakdown of the figures regarding part-time students and council tax payment (provided in answer to question S3W-12348) is therefore available.</p>

  <p>Similarly, while a part-time student may be eligible for a 25% single person&rsquo;s discount that is due to their single as opposed to their student status. And, while other exemptions, discounts or disregards may apply, more important is the likelihood of potential liability for council tax.</p>
