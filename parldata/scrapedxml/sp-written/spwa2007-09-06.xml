  <p>The Scottish Government intends to promote and encourage the maintenance and expansion of Scotland&rsquo;s international air connections which avoid the need for travellers to use connecting flights and reduce reliance on UK internal flights. The mechanism to assist the development of direct international air links is currently being revised in view of European Union Guidelines on start-up aid for new air services.</p>

  <p>This government is firmly committed to tackling alcohol misuse and the associated problems faced by our communities.</p>

  <p>We recently announced that we are looking at the legal position concerning offences associated with alcohol misuse. We will examine how we can make a clear statement in law that being drunk will simply not be accepted in courts as an excuse for bad behaviour.</p>

  <p>We also listen to the views of professionals who deal with the enforcement of alcohol laws. That is why I will shortly be convening a licensing summit with representatives from licensing boards and ACPOS to discuss how effective current enforcement mechanisms are and how they might be improved to help us tackle alcohol misuse.</p>

  <p>Since audiology services are not consultant-led, or defined as a speciality, and are a sub-specialty of ear, nose and throat, they do not fall under the current 18 week target of the Scottish Government. However, the Scottish Government is committed to improving services for the benefit of patients, is pleased that a number of NHSScotland boards have met, and in some cases exceeded, the 26 week target from referral to fitting set by the Audiology Modernisation Project Board and will continue to measure boards&rsquo; progress towards modernisation of the service allowing us to identify regional variations in service delivery and standards.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA) to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Revised energy standards were introduced on 1 May 2007 for all new buildings and also existing buildings which are converted, extended or altered. These measures are the best in the UK and encourage developers to consider the use of low and zero carbon technologies.</p>

  <p>An expert panel is being established which will meet this September. Revisions to the energy standards in Scottish building regulations will be kick-started by this meeting and issues such as mandatory low and zero carbon technologies and Scandinavian energy standards will be on the agenda.</p>

  <p>Research is underway to assess the impact on new buildings of various scenarios for reducing emissions of carbon dioxide which will include costings for the installation of low and zero carbon technologies, including micro-renewables. Cost information on each technology is available, but it is not possible to give a typical additional cost for a new home due to the variety of house-types and site layouts of new homes and the technology selected. Equally it is difficult to make a general statement about the energy generated by particular technologies due to differences between buildings and sites.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The agency are currently working to the 2007 SNP manifesto commitments &quot;It&rsquo;s time to move forward&quot;. The aims are consistent with those in the publication entitled It&rsquo;s Time for a Greener Scotland. Research work is underway to benchmark the energy standards in Scottish building regulations with those in Denmark, Finland, Norway and Sweden, which are currently acknowledged to be the best in Europe. A strategy, with input from an expert panel, for low carbon buildings and energy efficiency will be published later in the year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is committed to ensuring that every newly built home and office will be of the highest standard, as set out in a 2006 SNP press release entitled It&rsquo;s Time for a Greener Scotland, and, if so, what standard it will apply and what practical steps ministers have taken to progress such a commitment.</p>

  <p>The agency are currently working to the 2007 SNP manifesto commitments &quot;It&rsquo;s time to move forward&quot;. The aims are broadly consistent with those in the publication entitled It&rsquo;s Time for a Greener Scotland. An expert panel has been set up to produce a low carbon building standards strategy and this will be published later in the year. It is intended that this document will provide a route map to low carbon buildings, with an aspiration towards zero carbon buildings.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-2352 by Stewart Stevenson on 7 August 2007, under what circumstances a building owner is required to comply with current building regulations when converting, altering or extending an existing building and which sections of building regulations require to be complied with under such circumstances.</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Schedule 2 to Regulation 4 and Schedule 6 to Regulation 12 of the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004, as amended, respectively list all of the &lsquo;triggers&rsquo; for conversions and current building standards which either apply to or apply so far as is reasonably practicable to conversions. With regard to energy, where a building is converted, so far as is reasonably practicable, it shall meet the energy standards 6.2 - 6.6 and shall not fail those standards to a greater degree than before the conversion. It shall also meet the requirements of energy standards 6.7 - 6.10.</p>

  <p>With respect to alterations and extensions to existing buildings, the new building work shall meet standards 6.2 - 6.10 and shall not cause the remainder of the building to fail the standards, or in the case of an older building, to a greater degree than before.</p>

  <p>The energy standards referred to above are contained in Schedule 5 to Regulation 9 of the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004, as amended and are as follows:</p>

  <p>6.1 carbon dioxide emissions</p>

  <p>6.2 building insulation envelope</p>

  <p>6.3 heating system</p>

  <p>6.4 insulation of pipes, ducts and vessels</p>

  <p>6.5 artificial and display lighting</p>

  <p>6.6 mechanical ventilation and air conditioning</p>

  <p>6.7 commissioning building services</p>

  <p>6.8 written information</p>

  <p>6.9 energy performance certificates</p>

  <p>6.10 metering (non-domestic only).</p>

  <p>It should be noted that standard 6.1 &quot;carbon dioxide emissions&quot; only applies to new buildings, where a &quot;whole building&quot; approach is possible. Where a building is converted, altered or extended it is not feasible to apply standard 6.1 and in these cases a traditional elemental approach is followed.</p>

  <p>Free personal care is available to people aged 65 and over who live in their own home, or are self funding and living in a care home. For those in care homes, local authorities pay &pound;145 per week to the care provider towards their personal care costs. This payment level has remained static since the policy was introduced in July 2002. The Scottish Government will increase payments for personal and nursing care in line with inflation from April 2008.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the weekly expenditure per client for free personal care in a care home in both real and cash terms.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it will ensure that any extra money it receives as a result of the UK Government&rsquo;s recent announcement of additional funding for services for children with disabilities is distributed fairly and in a way that recognises the additional costs of providing viable and appropriate support such children in rural areas, particularly in the Highlands and Islands.</p>

  <p>All funding eligible for allocation to Scottish budgets by way of budget consequentials is held centrally. It is then allocated by the Scottish Government in light of all competing pressures and the government&rsquo;s priorities.</p>

  <p>At the present time there has been no indication of the status of this announcement on support for disabled children.</p>

  <p>Rurality is taken into account in the allocation of funding to local authorities through the core local government finance settlement. The grand aided expenditure (GAE) funding mechanism is a needs-based methodology that helps determine the allocation of that funding. Rurality has been identified as a financial pressure for some local authorities and as such it is a factor recognised within the series of indicators that contribute towards the calculation of GAE lines. These indicators recognise the particular needs that are associated with population dispersal.</p>

  <p>Through the national continuing professional development framework, the Scottish Executive expects all teachers to be able to recognise and know how to support pupils with additional support needs, including dyslexia.</p>

  <p>In support of this, following recent talks with the Executive, the General Teaching Council for Scotland have now added five new areas to their professional recognition framework, one of which is dyslexia. This will provide a clear pathway which teachers can use to gain recognition for their expertise in teaching children with dyslexia.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive provides education authorities with &pound;7.2 million over 2007-08 specifically for the training and development of staff working with pupils with additional support needs, including dyslexia. The priority is to tailor educational provision to meet the needs of the individual pupil. A further &pound;13.5 million is being issued over 2007-08 to allow local authorities to co-ordinate and provide continuing professional development for teachers.</p>

  <p>In addition to the new building regulations which came into force on 1 May 2007, the SBSA is also reviewing energy standards with a view to introducing further improvements. These will further reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions and improve the energy efficiency of all new buildings as well as existing ones being converted, altered or extended.</p>

  <p>The recent changes included improved energy standards which will provide more energy-efficient housing designs for all housing in Scotland, including those for local authorities, and will reduce CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 40% compared with housing constructed five years ago.

  <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) and Scottish Enterprise collaborate closely on a wide range of joint strategic areas of operation which will, due to the nature of partnership working, inevitably involve some crossover. The following areas are based on formal partnership arrangements between HIE and Scottish Enterprise:</p>

  <p>Scottish Development International</p>

  <p>Careers Scotland</p>

  <p>Future Skills Scotland</p>

  <p>Investors In People Scotland</p>

  <p>Careers Trust Scotland Ltd</p>

  <p>Scottish Health Innovations Ltd</p>

  <p>Scottish Intellectual Asset Management Ltd</p>

  <p>ITI Scotland Ltd.</p>

  <p>HIE and Scottish Enterprise also collaborate on a number of projects aimed at growing business. These projects are:</p>

  <p>Scottish Manufacturing Advisory Service (SMAS) - offering specialist support to manufacturing companies;</p>

  <p>Co-operative Development Scotland (CDS) - promoting and supporting the co-operative sector, and</p>

  <p>The Enterprise Facilitator - a local enterprise development project being piloted in three locations: Kintyre, Perthshire and Dundee.</p>

  <p>Such partnership working also includes consideration of other issues, including the delivery of business support (account and client management, innovation policy and the Business Gateway).</p>

  <p>Further to this, HIE and Scottish Enterprise work closely in areas of economic inclusion. Scottish Enterprise is part of a consortium led by HIE which manages the &quot;Growing Community Assets&quot; strand of funding of the BIG Lottery. This Fund is used for community owned organisations which are seeking to buy and develop assets as a way of increasing their long term sustainability.</p>

  <p>There is also a wide range of regular joint working which may not be described as strategic partnerships but which operate across the Scottish Enterprise and HIE areas. These include a number of joint projects and shared ownership of key aspects of industries in areas of tourism, energy, life sciences, food and drink, textiles, marine and ship building, construction, creative industries, forest industries and music. In the skills area there are other examples of regular joint working, including the development of a flexible level 2 SVQ in conjunction with a range of partners.</p>

  <p>As required by the Gender Equality Duty, which came into force in April 2007, the government has published its Gender Equality Scheme, setting out the government&rsquo;s high-level objectives for delivering on gender equality. These include an objective to continue our action to close the gender pay gap (both part-time and full-time) in Scotland by working in partnership - with the Equal Opportunities Commission Scotland, Scottish Trades Union Congress, Scottish Enterprise and others - in the <em>Close the Gap</em> project. <em>Close the Gap</em> raises awareness about the gender pay gap and its various causes, and encourages action by employees and employers to tackle the causes and close the gap.</p>

  <p>Two other high-level objectives set out in the Gender Equality Scheme address main contributors to the gender pay gap, namely occupational segregation and pregnancy discrimination. In 2006 the government set up a Cross-Directorate Working Group to explore ways of tackling occupational segregation, and in 2008 the group will produce its report, mapping out the range of factors involved and making recommendations for policy interventions that will help deliver change.</p>

  <p>The government&rsquo;s Gender Equality Scheme is available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 42934).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will continue to act to eliminate gender discrimination and continue to provide support to improve the availability of childcare across Scotland, both of which are important elements in addressing the pay gap.</p>

  <p>The government has also been working with stakeholders to raise awareness about the Gender Equality Duty and the opportunity for women (and men) to contribute to the development of public sector policy, including on issues of pay.</p>

  <p>Further to the restructuring of the former Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd that took effect from 1 October 2006 as part of the preparations for the tendering of Clyde and Hebrides ferry services, I can confirm that David MacBrayne Ltd has established a new subsidiary with separate banking arrangements, Cowal Ferries Ltd, whose sole function is the operation of the Gourock to Dunoon ferry service. That subsidiary has been trading since 1 April 2007 and all subsidy requirements for the passenger only element of that route are payable directly to that company, separate from the subsidy that is payable to CalMac Ferries Ltd under present arrangements. Cowal Ferries Ltd will publish its annual acccounts from 2007-08.</p>

  <p>Financial results for the Gourock to Dunoon service will also be reflected in the David MacBrayne Ltd Annual Accounts and carrying figures will continue to appear in Scottish Transport Statistics, as published annual by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-2278 by Stewart Stevenson on 7 August 2007, how leakage of subsidy from passenger-only customers to those travelling with vehicles is prevented when the vessel involved also conveys commercial vehicles and private cars and their passengers.</p>

  <p>I am satisfied that the vehicle element of the current Cowal Ferries Ltd service on the Gourock to Dunoon route does not generate an additional subsidy requirement. Indeed, the revenue from vehicles carried exceeds the additional costs involved in running a vehicle, as opposed to passenger only service, using the vessels currently deployed on the route.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-2274 by Stewart Stevenson on 7 August 2007, what percentage of passengers using Gourock station are considered, in its interpretation of the HITRANS data, to be users of ferry services; what the evidential basis is for this interpretation, and whether this interpretation has been endorsed by the author of the HITRANS report.</p>

  <p>The HITRANS survey was focussed on ferry users rather than users of Gourock station. It cannot therefore be used, on its own, to derive estimates of the percentage of passengers using Gourock station who are ferry users. It can be used to derive estimates of the percentage of those using the Gourock to Dunoon ferry who arrive at or depart from Gourock by train. On this latter basis, the survey showed that 56 of the 179 passengers interviewed on the Gourock to Dunoon service had used the train to arrive at Gourock or planned to use the train for their onward journey from Gourock. This represents 31% of passengers using the service which is twice the figure used by Western Ferries in preparing the news release it issued on 18 July 2007. This interpretation of the survey results has been endorsed by the author of the HITRANS report.</p>

  <p>The steering group responsible for implementing the recommendations in the review of genetics services in Scotland, which was published last September, is currently considering a proposal, largely developed by the Scottish Huntington&rsquo;s Association, looking at the health and social care needs of those with single gene (adult onset) complex disability disorders, of which Huntington&rsquo;s disease is one. The proposal has two main elements: to develop a strategic approach to the delivery of services through a national needs assessment and a national assessment of quality of life indicators, and the provision of direct support to families living with such disorders, with a focus on providing more support for people in their local communities.</p>

  <p>Widening access to lifelong learning is a priority for the Scottish Government. We have already announced the intention to abolish the graduate endowment fee which has helped remove one of the barriers faced by people in deciding whether or not to study at higher education level and we will be considering further measures to remove the debt or fear of debt which is a significant factor in widening access.</p>

  <p>We recognise that that significant activity is already taking place to widening access and that it requires a long term strategy. Accordingly, we will continue to work with the Scottish Funding Council to ensure there is a focus on those activities which are most effective. This will require partnership working with colleges, higher education institutions, the funding council and the four Regional Widening Access Fora.</p>

  <p>We will continue to take action to promote further and higher education, and have already announced steps to remove the graduate endowment fee so that access to higher education is open to those who have the ability rather than the ability to pay. However, we do not believe it is helpful to express participation in terms of a target rate. Unlike the position in England there has never been a target rate for participation.</p>

  <p>The &quot;offers subject to survey&quot; approach helps, in most cases, to address the issue of multiple valuations in the current buying and selling process. However, the approach also reduces the degree of certainty in the transaction process, which has been a key strength of the Scottish house buying and selling process over many years. It is important to consider the balance of arguments between the &quot;offers subject to survey&quot; approach and the single survey in deciding the way ahead.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government agrees with the World Health Organization that water is critical to human life.</p>

  <p>In temperate climates, such as the UK, the Food Standards Agency advises that six to eight glasses (about 1.2 litres) of water, or other fluids, should be consumed every day to prevent dehydration. This amount should be increased when the weather is warm or when exercising. Fluid intake is also achieved through food eaten.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is not responsible for purchasing for either hospitals or care homes. Responsibility for all procurement for the health service lies with NHS National Services Scotland. In the case of care homes, responsibility lies in the main with individual homes.</p>

  <p>In 2003 NHS Quality Improvement Scotland published <em>Clinical Standards for Food, Fluid and Nutritional Care</em>. These standards state that where clinically appropriate, patients should have access to fresh drinking water at all times. These standards apply to patients only.</p>

  <p>There are currently no national standards which relate to provision of water for staff and visitors. This is a matter for local health boards and care homes.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland published a national overview in 2006 that reviewed services across the country against four Quality Indicators for Learning Disabilities selected as strongly representative of key elements of hospital closure. These were making sure services are in place to meet people&rsquo;s needs when hospitals are no longer there; in-patient services for those who need them, and ensuring the transition into the community is planned in partnership with people with learning disabilities, their carers and local communities and involving people in decisions about their lives.</p>

  <p>They found improvements to all of these areas and also set out a number of recommendations for continued improvements to offer better services for children and adults with learning disabilities and their carers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether ministers intend to consult on proposals to introduce a planning presumption requiring new buildings in Scotland to include sufficient renewable generation on-site to deliver between 20% and 50% of energy needs, as set out in the 2007 SNP manifesto and, if so, when that consultation will be completed.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to increasing the levels of renewable energy generation as it has the potential to provide a sustainable source of low carbon energy and reduce carbon dioxide emissions from buildings. It will be part of a coherent approach to energy policy, recognising that promoting reduced energy consumption and promoting low carbon technologies are key to achieving sustainable economic growth. I have started a dialogue with key stakeholders and this will continue so as to ensure a clear and shared strategy and achievement of objectives.</p>

  <p>Scottish Planning Policy (SPP) 6 Renewable Energy already sets a target that all future planning applications proposing development with a total cumulative floorspace of 500sq metres or more should incorporate on-site zero and low carbon equipment contributing at least an extra 15% reduction in CO<sub>2 </sub>emissions beyond the 2007 building regulations CO<sub>2</sub> emissions standard. It also says that planning authorities should consider whether local circumstances justify going beyond 15% and whether higher standards can be secured for particular developments. We intend to issue planning advice on implementing the policy in the autumn.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for planning and delivering pre-school education lies with local authorities. Authorities need to take population projections into account to ensure that there is enough pre-school education provision available in the right areas. Over time this may involve opening new provision and closing other centres in line with patterns of demand.</p>

  <p>The Scottish government has no plans to undertake an investigation into the reasons for the closure of individual pre-school education settings.</p>

  <p>The Scottish government provides local authorities with block grant for their core revenue services through the core local government finance settlement. A needs-based methodology (otherwise known as grant aided expenditure (GAE)) is used to determine the allocation of that block grant. As GAE is a component used in distributing the total block grant that the Scottish Government provides to local government, it is not a budget or a spending target. It is for each local authority to decide how best to allocate the resulting overall block grant across all their services, based on local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>The GAE allocations for each local authority for pre-school services in 2007-08 is shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government believes that Scotland&rsquo;s economic success must be a partnership between the private, public and third sectors, with the private sector the principal driver of growth. The debate about the size of the public sector in Scotland to date has been influenced by figures which exclude a proportion of Scottish economic activity relating to the Scottish sector of the UK Continental Shelf and the government believes that this issue must be seen within the context of an actual public sector size that is estimated to be comparable to the UK average when the whole of the Scottish economy is included <em>.</em></p>

  <p>The government is taking action to ensure that the public sector delivers more effectively with resources directed more towards frontline services in health, education and community safety, all of which contribute to Scotland&rsquo;s potential for greater economic success and we are also taking forward measures to improve the competitive environment for Scottish business through lower business taxes, lighter and more effective regulation and a greater focus for national enterprise activity.</p>

  <p>The government believes that this balanced approach will ensure that the public sector compliments the private and third sectors and that public spending does more to help generate private sector growth. Within this context our action to simplify and de-clutter the public sector landscape will play an important role in raising Scotland&rsquo;s overall economic growth rate.</p>

  <p>Careers Scotland in the Highlands and Islands area are working with the National Academic Recognition Information Centre (NARIC) to develop a service which will provide guidance to individuals and employers on matching qualifications. They intend to publicise this service in due course, once initial testing is complete.</p>

  <p>In November last year the Relocation Advisory Service (RAS) engaged with the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) and learned of the latter&rsquo;s recent research into qualifications from Poland. SQA informed RAS that this was in response to a growing demand from employers for a tool that would provide a basic understanding of the the typical qualifications being presented by the large number of Polish nationals seeking employment in Scotland.</p>

  <p>With the SQA&rsquo;s permission and input, RAS put information relating to this work on the business section of Fresh Talent&rsquo;s main website <a href="http://www.scotlandistheplace.com" target="_blank">www.scotlandistheplace.com</a>. There are also links to the various international elements of the SQA&rsquo;s work.

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to tackling racism, promoting race equality and good race relations. A wide programme of work is underway which supports this commitment, including the development of a National Strategy and Action Plan on Race Equality, and the further development of One Scotland Many Cultures Campaign.</p>

  <p>The strategy is not yet published and therefore it has not been publicised as such. However, just over &pound;4,000 was spent on expenses relating to a consultation event on the draft strategy in December 2006. We are further developing the Strategy and will consult on it in the autumn.</p>

  <p>Between August and December 2006, and May and July 2007, there was no spend on media advertising for the One Scotland anti-racism campaign. We are, however, very keen to continue with and develop the campaign and are currently in the planning and development stage. It is not therefore possible at this time to give an indication of proposed spend between August and December 2007.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water is fully funded to provide the strategic infrastructure required for all anticipated new development during the current investment period.</p>

  <p>The <em>Provision of Water and Sewerage Services (Reasonable Cost) (Scotland) Regulations 2006</em> introduced a legal basis for the calculation of the reasonable cost contribution to be made by Scottish Water and developers towards the cost of providing local &quot;Part 2&quot; and &quot;Part 3&quot; connections to its networks. Scottish Water will provide a reasonable cost contribution towards the developers&rsquo; costs of funding &quot;Part 2&quot; and &quot;Part 3&quot; infrastructure. This reasonable cost contribution to new connections is available towards the total costs of both local water mains and sewers, and all other &quot;Part 2&quot; and &quot;Part 3&quot; assets.</p>

  <p>The projected costs for providing the necessary connections will depend on the timing of the house building construction programme and the contribution to be made to such connections by the relevant developers.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the plans to procure the rolling stock for both the Airdrie to Bathgate rail line and the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, both due for completion in 2010, will place undue demand on the supply of rolling stock and whether, in the context of higher demand, the projected cost of between &pound;300 and &pound;375 million remains the same.</p>

  <p>The rolling stock procurement plan continues to be developed by Transport Scotland alongside the wider procurement plan to address the requirements of both the Major Projects, including Airdrie to Bathgate, and the increasing demands for rail services. Transport Scotland is confident that it can successfully procure the rolling stock needed to continue growing Scotland&rsquo;s railways, and the procurement plan is on schedule to meet the delivery deadline for the Airdrie to Bathgate project of December 2010.</p>

  <p>The procurement of rolling stock for the Airdrie to Bathgate project is an operating rather than capital cost, and therefore has no impact on the &pound;300 to &pound;375 million capital cost projection for the Airdrie to Bathgate project.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has the operational responsibility for this area and can be contacted for more information if required.</p>

  <p>Under Section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989, Scottish ministers are responsible for the granting or refusal of applications for consent for electricity generation. There is no published timetable set for Scottish ministers to make these decisions, however, they are required by legislation to be satisfied that they have considered all relevant factors before taking their decision.</p>

  <p>For applications made under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act, local authorities decide the vast majority of planning applications. Scottish ministers have a general power to intervene by calling in applications for their own determination where they consider such action necessary. Where a planning application has been called in and a report is returned to Planning Directorate, following a public local inquiry, Scottish ministers&rsquo; published targets are to provide a decision on 80% of applications in two months and 100% of applications in three months.</p>

The true number of foreign motorists involved in accidents will therefore be higher than would appear from the STATS 19 data, and the true number of accidents involving foreign motorists will therefore be higher than the figures given in the following table. In addition, it should be noted that several changes were made to the STATS 19 specification with effect from the start of 1999, including the introduction of the code which is used to identify drivers or riders who are non-UK residents. As some police forces&rsquo; returns for 1999 were affected by difficulties connected with the implementation of the new specification, the figure for 1999 is lower than it should have been .</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured and which become known to the police. The returns do not cover damage only accidents or accidents of which the police are unaware because they were not reported by the public.</p>

  <p>The specification of the STATS 19 returns includes a code which the police can use to identify as non-UK residents any drivers or riders, of vehicles involved in reported accidents, whose homes are outwith the UK. However, this information is not available in all cases - for example, the police will have no knowledge of the areas of residence of hit-and-run drivers. The true number of foreign motorists involved in accidents will therefore be higher than would appear from the STATS 19 data, and the true number of accidents involving foreign motorists will therefore be higher than the figures given in the following table.</p>

  <p>Statistics about the factors which may have contributed to the occurrence of an accident are only available with effect from the start of 2005, when the STATS 19 specification was expanded to include such information. It must be emphasised that the Contributory Factors shown in the returns reflect the reporting officer&rsquo;s opinion at the time of making the report, and are not necessarily the result of extensive investigation: subsequent enquiries could lead to a change in the opinion of the reporting officer. The factors are largely subjective, and depend upon the skill and experience of the reporting officer in reconstructing the events which led directly to the accident, based upon the information available at the time of making the report.</p>

  <p>In the case of many accidents, Contributory Factors are recorded for more than one of the parties involved in the accident. For example, in the reporting officer&rsquo;s view, one driver may have been &quot;travelling too fast for the conditions&quot;, another may have been &quot;impaired by alcohol&quot;, and a pedestrian may have &quot;failed to look properly&quot; - if so, the STATS 19 returns will show Contributory Factors for three of the parties involved in the accident. In such a case, the returns do not identify one participant as &quot;responsible&quot;, since it appears more than one person&rsquo;s actions (or lack of action) contributed to the occurrence of the accident. However, if Contributory Factors are recorded for only one participant, it would appear that the reporting officer&rsquo;s view is that that particular person was responsible for the accident. The following table therefore distinguishes between:</p>

  <p>(a) accidents for which all the Contributory Factors were recorded for non-UK resident motorists, as they may be regarded as responsible for such accidents;</p>

  <p>(b) accidents for which some of the Contributory Factors were recorded for non-UK resident motorists, and other Contributory Factors were recorded for other participants (such as UK motorists, cyclists and pedestrians), as it appears that, in each such case, responsibility should be split between the non-UK motorist(s) and one or more of the other participants in the accident, and</p>

  <p>(c) accidents for which none of the Contributory Factors were recorded for non-UK resident motorists, as it appears that they were not responsible for such accidents.</p>

  <p>(Contributory Factors were recorded for all of the reported accidents involving non-UK resident motorists in 2005 and 2006.)</p>

  <p>More information about Contributory Factors is given in an article on pages 53 to 74 of <em>Road Accidents Scotland 2005</em>, copies of which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 41118).</p>

  <p>Details of the delivery of our current committed programme of major and important trunk road and rail infrastructure improvements can be found on the Transport Scotland website at <a href="http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.transportscotland.gov.uk</a> . Future transport investment priorities will be considered by the multi-modal Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR) which is undertaking an objective, evidence-based, review of the existing performance and future requirements of the nationally strategic transport networks. This will include better utilisation of the rail and road networks.</p>

  <p>In addition, the High Level Output Specification (HLOS) for 2009-14 sets out future requirements for more efficient working of the rail network. With growing demand for rail travel, it is anticipated that there will be a continuing requirement for improvements to rail services, including increased capacity and performance. A range of priority areas are identified within the HLOS and efficiency savings will be used to support their delivery.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has the operational responsibility for this area, and can be contacted if required.</p>

  <p>Data about injury road accidents are collected by the police and reported to the Scottish Executive using the STATS 19 statistical report form. These returns cover only road accidents in which one or more people were injured and which become known to the police. The returns do not cover damage only accidents or accidents of which the police are unaware because they were not reported by the public.</p>

  <p>The following table gives the total number of reported injury road accidents which were identified in the STATS 19 returns as occurring on the A835, A836, A837, A894, A897 and A9 (North of the Dornoch Bridge Roundabout) between 1999 and 2006.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that the statistics given as follows are based upon the data which are held in the central statistical database and which were collected by the police at the time of the accident and subsequently reported to the Executive. They may differ from any figures which the local authority would provide now, because they do not take account of any subsequent changes or corrections that local authorities may have made to the statistical information, for use at local level, about the location of each accident, based upon their knowledge of the roads and areas concerned.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently working in partnership with the Carbon Trust through its Carbon Management Programme to establish the feasibility of installing micro-renewables at selected buildings on its core estate. Initial surveys have been completed for a number of buildings, including Saughton House in Edinburgh, Cameron House in Oban and Strathearn House in Perth. These have highlighted a number of opportunities that are to be investigated further.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not currently have a specific plan to roll out micro-renewables in hospitals as energy procurement is devolved to NHS boards. However, the Scottish Executive Health Directorates Environmental Management Policy for NHSScotland advises NHS boards that combined heat and power and renewable technologies should be considered in new build and refurbishment projects, where feasible and, that in general, energy should be procured from renewable sources, where practicable and feasible.</p>

  <p>This policy document is available at <a href="http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/hdl2006_21.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.sehd.scot.nhs.uk/mels/hdl2006_21.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland bodies are already investigating the use of microrenewables and other energy saving initiatives. Some of this work is being carried out through the Carbon Trust&rsquo;s &quot;Partnerships for Renewables&quot; initiative which assists the public sector to develop on-site renewables projects. For example, NHS Ayrshire and Arran has utilised this to facilitate the installation of a wind generation facility at Crosshouse Hospital.</p>

  <p>The available statistics on court proceedings and recorded crime cannot be combined in any meaningful way to derive rates of conviction. However, the available statistics do illustrate that the conviction rate for rape, in particular, is very low.</p>

  <p>The prosecution of rape presents a particular challenge. It can be very difficult to obtain corroborated evidence to convince a jury of the accused&rsquo;s guilt beyond reasonable doubt. Prosecutors cannot raise proceedings where there is insufficient evidence in law to do so. In cases where the accused does not deny the act of sexual intercourse but maintains that the complainer consented, the trial may focus entirely on the question of whether the complainer consented to sexual intercourse with the accused.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to addressing the low conviction rate for rape and serious sexual offences. It is clearly very important to have a robust legal framework that reflects the values of modern society. That is why we have announced that we will introduce a Bill on rape and sexual offences in the light of the Scottish Law Commission&rsquo;s forthcoming report.</p>

  <p>It is equally important that we ensure that cases are handled as effectively as possible. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service&rsquo;s Review of the Investigation and Prosecution of Rape and Sexual Offences recommended improved specialist training and guidance to prosecutors. The implementation programme is well underway with 18 recommendations having been implemented and work ongoing towards full implementation by June 2009.</p>

  <p>No athletes were invited to the Performance Sports Summit. However, a number of Scottish sports governing bodies were invited to the event and they represented the views of their athletes. In addition, national sports agencies also attended who were able to give an athlete perspective.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps are being taken to reduce the suicide rate, particularly among men aged between 15 and 44.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-09-06.156.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0906.htm#62">

  <p>Suicide prevention is a key aim of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s action to improve mental health and wellbeing. The main delivery vehicle for this is Choose Life, the National Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent Suicide. One of the priority groups for action is young people, especially young men. Through Choose Life there is now an identified suicide prevention coordinator in every local authority area in Scotland, targeting suicide prevention action in ways tailored to local needs and circumstances.</p>

  <p>Nationally, through Choose Life we have introduced suicide prevention training, which is being rolled out across Scotland. Over 11,500 people in community and public service settings have been trained in suicide intervention and risk management skills in the last three years. We are also developing suicide prevention training and risk assessment training for frontline staff in mental health services, in primary care and in accident and emergency services.</p>

  <p>On 10 September 2007 I launched Choose Life&rsquo;s latest phase of campaign activity, &quot;Talk. Listen. Save a Life.&quot; This awareness-raising action highlights the importance of encouraging people to be more open about their and other people&rsquo;s feelings and worries.</p>

  <p>The Breathing Space telephone advice line helps to underpin related action on suicide prevention. Open from 6pm to 2am nightly, Breathing Space provides free and confidential advice and signposting to people experiencing low mood, depression and anxiety. It is available to all but is particularly targeted at young men because of the increases in suicide numbers in this group in recent decades. Breathing Space currently handles around 3,000 calls per month and is currently undergoing a pilot extension of its opening hours to 6am at weekends.</p>

  <p>Annual fluctuations occur in suicide rates. When assessing trends, three year rolling averages are used because they smooth out some of the fluctuations. It is encouraging to note that from 2000-02 to 2004-06 there was a downward trend of 13% for population suicides. Within this, there was a 14% reduction in male suicides and a 9% reduction in female suicides.</p>

  <p>Visitscotland.com is not a member organisation, but a commercial enterprise set up to provide Scottish tourism businesses and accommodation providers a route to the quickly expanding sector of the market which wishes to use the internet to research and book holidays online. Since its launch in 2002, visitscotland.com has built up around 11,500 business subscribers, about 85% of which are small businesses such as B&amp;Bs, guest houses and self caterers. Many of these receive very significant numbers of their bookings through visitscotland.com.</p>

  <p>Annual figures for the numbers of businesses which have ceased subscribing to visitscotland.com are not currently available because of the introduction of new software.
