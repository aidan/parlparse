  <p>The Executive is committed to increasing the number of British Sign Language (BSL) interpreters in Scotland and has worked with its BSL and Linguistic Access Working Group to develop its approach.</p>

  <p>The Executive&rsquo;s approach has focused on developing and supporting the infrastructure to deliver long-term change and has provided over &pound;900,000 to a variety of initiatives including supporting the development and delivery of a Graduate Diploma in Teaching British Sign Language Tutors at Heriot-Watt University and funding the Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive is in the final stages of recruiting a BSL and Linguistic Access Project Manager to develop a detailed plan for improving linguistic access for Deaf, deafblind and hard of hearing people, which will include exploring further ways in which the Executive can increase the number of registered BSL/English interpreters.</p>

  <p>The Executive funded &quot;training the trainers&quot; programme aims to provide an award-bearing course embedded within the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework to train a minimum of 10 Deaf people in Scotland to become trainers of British Sign Language (BSL) tutors. This will help address the shortage of trained trainers able to teach students at a sufficient level to progress on to BSL/English interpreter training.</p>

  <p>The &quot;training the trainers&quot; course has been developed as a Graduate Diploma in Teaching British Sign Language Tutors and was officially launched on the 15 February 2006 by the Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters and Heriot-Watt University. There are 11 students undertaking the course, which is due to finish in September 2007.</p>

  <p>Plans to double the number of British Sign Language (BSL) interpreters in Scotland were announced on 4 November 2004 in answer to question S2W-11983 and included supporting the development and delivery of a Graduate Diploma in Teaching British Sign Language Tutors at Heriot-Watt University to develop the infrastructure to ensure a sustainable increase in BSL interpreters.</p>

  <p>Before taking action on any matter reported by the police, the Procurator Fiscal must be satisfied that the circumstances reported to him or her disclose a crime known to the law of Scotland and that there is sufficient admissible and reliable evidence.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of charges for drink and drug driving offences reported to the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) in each year since 2002 and how many of those were marked &quot;no proceedings&quot;.</p>

  <p>Where several related charges are reported to the Procurator Fiscal, sometimes it will be more appropriate to proceed with a different charge, such as causing death by dangerous driving, or causing death by careless driving while under the influence of drink or drugs, and for the drink or drug driving charge to be technically marked for &quot;no proceedings&quot;. The most common reason for drunk or driving charges being marked &quot;no proceedings&quot;, other than for that technical reason is because there is insufficient admissible evidence.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The information in the table above has been extracted from the COPFS Case Management Database. The database is a live, operational database used to manage the processing of reports submitted to Procurators Fiscal by the police and other reporting agencies. If a Procurator Fiscal amends a charge submitted by a reporting agency the database will record details only of the amended charge.</p>

  <p>2. The database is charge-based. The figures quoted therefore relate to the number of charges rather than the number of individuals charged or the number of incidents that gave rise to such charges.</p>

  <p>3. COPFS completed an upgrade of its electronic case management system in April 2002. Only case records created after that date contain complete data which is capable of electronic analysis.</p>

  <p>The Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2004, passed by the Scottish Parliament, was introduced as part of the legislative framework to support the new national (UK) GP contract arrangements, which came into effect from 1 April 2004.</p>

  <p>As stated in the answer to question S2W-29918 on 27 November 2006, the Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2004 provides the statutory framework for NHS boards to discharge their duty to secure or provide primary medical. The Scottish Executive has no role in the selection of primary medical services providers.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are statutorily responsible for providing or securing primary medical services for their local populations. How that is achieved is a matter for each NHS board taking into account the needs of the local population and local circumstances.</p>

  <p>None. It is for NHS boards to determine how best to meet the particular needs of patients in the face of a vacant practice, and to seek the best solution to fulfil those needs in accordance with the Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2004 and the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978.</p>

  <p>As I said in my letter to the member dated 28 November 2006, the vast majority of contracts between NHS boards and practices are of the traditional model and I see no reason why that should change, so long as these arrangements continue to work for the benefit of local patients and the community.</p>

  <p>Last summer, a sub-group of the Scottish Ministerial Working Group on Tobacco Control, the Smoking Prevention Working Group, was set up to make recommendations to assist the development of a new long-term smoking prevention strategy. The group was also asked to advise ministers on the question of evidence to support raising the age of sale for tobacco products from the current age of 16.</p>

  <p>The Working Group&rsquo;s report <em>Towards a future without tobacco </em>was published on 22 November 2006. The Scottish Executive welcomes this report and, in particular, its support for raising the tobacco purchase age to 18. We will shortly be consulting on the report&rsquo;s recommendations, and on a draft Order and partial Regulatory Impact Assessment to implement the increase of the tobacco purchase age to 18. This will include specific consultation with young people and the Scottish Youth Parliament.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action is being taken to ensure that there is no delay in accessing free flu vaccine for those susceptible to the virus.</p>

  <p>&#8206;While there has been some delay in the delivery of this year&rsquo;s flu vaccine, NHS boards are expected to receive their full vaccine orders. In Scotland we will be receiving 1.3 million doses of flu vaccine this year, 200,000 &#8206;more doses than last year. Over 84% of the flu vaccine has now been delivered in Scotland and this will rise to over &#8206;&#8206;99% by the end of December 2006. This will ensure that all priority groups including those aged 65 and over, &#8206;and people with a chronic medical condition will receive their flu jabs.</p>

  <p>Strenuous efforts have been made by key stakeholders including flu vaccine manufacturers, community pharmacists and NHSScotland to coordinate the distribution of influenza vaccine to minimise the effect of any delay in supply. Individual GP practices have been asked to liaise closely with community pharmacists to ensure that they have sufficient stock of vaccine before scheduling patients for immunisation clinics. Information on the delay in supplies, and the measures that could be taken to deal with that delay, has been made available to NHS Scotland from June.</p>

  <p>In addition, guidance issued by the Scottish Executive to the NHS in Scotland to spread orders among several manufacturers was implemented from last year to reduce any potential risk of influenza vaccine being unavailable from an individual manufacturer, and spread the risk should problems in the supply chain occur.</p>

  <p>The Vaccine Supply Monitoring Group, an expert group chaired by a Consultant in &#8206;Pharmaceutical Public Health, is continually monitoring the situation to establish the vaccine supply &#8206;position in NHS boards.</p>
