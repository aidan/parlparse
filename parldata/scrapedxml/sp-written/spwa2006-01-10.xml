  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-17131 by Patricia Ferguson on 16 June 2005, whether it has given further consideration to developing links between Blantyre in Malawi and Blantyre in Scotland.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-01-10.S2W-21685.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80030" speakername="Patricia Ferguson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0110.htm#4">

  <p>As I stated in the answer to question S2W-17131, the Scottish Executive encourages the establishment of links between Scotland and Malawi and through the International Development Fund, has supported a range of organisations to work with Malawi. Details of International Development Fund supported projects are available on the Scottish Executive website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/News-Extras/intdevfundnov2005" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/News-Extras/intdevfundnov2005</a> .</p>

  <p>However, the impetus for taking forward these initiatives is very much based on the wishes of local communities and it is for those communities, rather than the Scottish Executive, to decide whether to pursue this.</p>

  <p>To date, no applications to develop links between Blantyre in Scotland and Blantyre in Malawi have been received although I am aware that some bodies have long-standing links, such as the Rotary Club of Blantyre, which has been committed to supporting the education of students in Blantyre Malawi for 15 years.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a duty under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to assess the needs of people and decide, in the light of the assessment, whether they should arrange any services and, if so, which services. Any decision taken by the local authority&rsquo;s social work department should be based on a detailed assessment of a person&rsquo;s care needs taking his or her wishes into account. However, local authorities are also expected to ensure that the resources available are used in the most effective way to meet individual care needs.</p>

  <p>Assistance to owners of private sector housing to make their houses suitable for the needs of disabled occupants is given mainly by local authorities through housing improvement grants, funded by Private Sector Housing Grant (PSHG) from the Scottish Executive. Adaptations for disabled people, along with improving houses which fall below the tolerable standard, are ministerial priorities which are taken into account in assessing local authorities&rsquo; proposals for PSHG expenditure. It is for local authorities to set local priorities, and information on the priority accorded to privately-rented and owner-occupied housing is not held centrally.</p>
