  <p>Under the previous administration, CalMac were directed to sell the Claymore to Sea Containers in order to facilitate the operation of the Campbeltown-Ballycastle ferry service. The Scottish Executive first became aware of the sale of the Claymore through the article in <i>The Herald</i> dated 17 November. This matter has not been discussed with any of the parties mentioned; ownership arrangements for the vessel are a matter for Sea Containers Ltd or its subsidiaries.</p>

  <p>The Joint Ministerial Committee will contribute to good communication between the Scottish Executive, the cabinet of the National Assembly for Wales and the UK Government. It will meet in a number of guises, but most of its business will be conducted by correspondence.</p>

  <p>The Committee on Overseas Promotion&#8217;s principal aim is to prevent wasteful duplication of inward investment activity by its members and to ensure that the activities of individual bodies are complementary and contribute to the overall UK effort. All of the Inward Investment Agencies in the UK, including Locate in Scotland, are members.</p>

  <p>Three or four meetings are held each year. No date has yet been set for the next meeting.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive follows clear best practice guidelines on conducting consultation exercises. Consultees will vary according to the subject matter and decisions on consultation lists are therefore taken on a case-by-case basis.</p>

  <p>Policy directions to the New Opportunities Fund were issued in August 1998 by the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport after consultation with interested colleagues, including the Secretary of State for Scotland, and the Fund&#8217;s Board.</p>

  <p>These directions specified that grants for projects under the childcare strand of the Fund&#8217;s out of school hours activities initiative could be made up until 2003. In order that the Fund can meet the targets set out in the policy directions for numbers of children benefiting from places, funding for the large majority of projects will be for one year only. This might be extended for up to three years in certain circumstances. Nothing in the policy directions prevents existing childcare providers receiving funding, although this should be for new rather than existing childcare places.</p>

  <p>There are no present plans to amend or add to the policy directions to the Fund in relation to childcare.</p>

  <p>For other projects, the information is available in full business cases. These are already published in the health sector and, in line with my statement in the Scottish Parliament in June, will be published in future for all Government public-private partnership projects in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The current discount rate used in the appraisal of PFI projects in which the Scottish Executive is directly involved is 6% (real). Given close ties between the Scottish and UK economies I see no need for a different approach at the current time.</p>

  <p>A pilot exercise involving local authorities and health boards was announced in April, based on a national definition that a delay has occurred where two days have passed after the clinician has agreed that a transfer is appropriate.</p>

  <p>On the basis of information currently available for 13 of the 15 health board areas, in the 35,524* average available staffed beds in Scotland, there are 2,015 patients whose discharge has been delayed by more than the two days referred to in the pilot definition.</p>

  <p>Guidance has issued on the need to ensure that plans are in place locally to deal with peaks in demand for services and care throughout the year and over holiday periods in particular. All agencies are continuing to work together to keep the numbers and duration of delays to an absolute minimum.</p>

  <p>It is for each Health Board to determine its prescribing policy on medicines, including Riluzole, taking into account the advice provided by their Drug and Therapeutic Committee.</p>

  <p>In 1996, Riluzole was granted a Marketing Authorisation valid for the European Union on the basis of the dossier submitted to the European Medicines Evaluation Agency (EMEA). The European Committee of Proprietary Medicinal Products satisfied itself of the quality, safety and efficacy of Riluzole before recommending the granting of the Marketing Authorisation. Treatment with Riluzole should only be initiated by specialist physicians with experience in the management of motor neurone diseases.

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises that funding is a key issue for voluntary organisations and is developing a more strategic approach to its own funding of the sector. The Executive has a commitment to work with other funders to create a more stable funding environment for the sector at both national and local level, for instance through three year funding. The Scottish Compact commits the Scottish Executive to best practice in funding, monitoring publicly-funded work, and to targeting resources effectively in a way which takes account of need. As part of the implementation of the Scottish Compact, good practice guidance on funding has been drafted and this is presently out for consultation. <br /></p>
