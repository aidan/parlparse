  <p>Passengers to and from Glasgow Prestwick International Airport are able to benefit from lower cost rail and bus travel through the airport&#8217;s partnership arrangements with Strathclyde Passenger Transport and ScotRail, and with Stagecoach and Scottish Citylink. The Scottish Executive has no plans to enhance those arrangements. Completion of the proposed M77 between Newton Mearns and Fenwick will benefit passengers travelling to and from the airport by road.</p>

  <p>The minimum qualifications for surveyors taken on by Eaga are City and Guilds Certificate 6176 "Energy Awareness" and/or NVQ Level 2 "Domestic Energy". Many surveyors have supplemented these qualifications with the NHER Site Assessor qualification. Prior to undertaking surveys for Eaga, surveyors must participate in a four-day training course which is specially designed by Eaga and leading experts in the field. Surveyors have to pass this course before they are approved to carry out surveys.</p>

  <p>The definition of a central heating system is given in the Home Energy Efficiency Scheme Amendment (Scotland) Regulations 2001 No. 267. A gas, electric, oil or solid fuel central heating system is typically installed in the living room, the hall, the bathroom and the main bedroom or bedrooms, depending on the size of the household. All systems in the private sector must perform to the specifications set by the Scottish Executive and be capable of achieving a temperature of 23 deg C in the living room and 18 deg C in the other rooms. Local authorities and housing associations have been given these specifications also.</p>

  <p>Indicative allocations for each local authority area were announced on 30 October 2001, based on a distribution formula weighted for relative population of children and young people, deprivation factors and rurality. An assessment panel will consider whether proposals adequately meet the criteria for the Changing Children&#8217;s Services Fund before funding is released.</p>

  <p>Guidance issued on the fund advised that proposals would need to show real evidence of participation by key voluntary organisations (both the larger national organisations and smaller community-based organisations) at each stage in the process. This will be one of the criteria considered in the assessment process.</p>

  <p>We have no plans for community support officers with police powers in Scotland to undertake neighbourhood patrols along the lines proposed south of the border. However, the Scottish Executive has provided funding under the Better Neighbourhood Services Fund (BNSF) for a pilot to explore the use of neighbourhood wardens in part of Paisley. Their principal function will be to observe and report incidents to local authority colleagues or the police, as appropriate, with the aim of reducing vandalism and anti-social behaviour.</p>

  <p>Restrictions on the number of scheduled sailings on the Caledonian MacBrayne, Gourock to Dunoon service, were first imposed in 1982, when Scottish Office ministers restricted the company to one sailing per hour to ensure that public subsidy was not used to undermine an unsubsidised operator on the route. In 1987 Scottish Office ministers acknowledged that the company had added four scheduled services to that hourly service pattern and that these were being operated on a commercial basis, consistent with an Out of Undertaking activity. The Scottish Executive has not placed any further restrictions on the company's operations of the Gourock to Dunoon service.</p>

  <p>None.</p>

  <p>Only the passenger element of Caledonian MacBrayne's service on this route is within the Undertaking between the company and the Scottish ministers. Accordingly, the agreement of ministers is not required if the company wishes to change the level of vehicle service it provides.</p>

  <p>The review of implementation is now complete. This has indicated substantial progress towards the implementation of the recommendations of the Expert Advisory Group on Infertility Services in Scotland (EAGISS). The following table shows the progress made on movement towards adoption of the recommended criteria for eligibility for NHS funded infertility treatment given in the EAGISS report.</p>

  <p>The eligibility criteria, as recommended in the EAGISS report, are as follows:</p>

  <p>Infertility with an appropriate diagnosed cause of any duration, or</p>

  <p>Unexplained infertility of at least three years in duration, and</p>

  <p>Female partner aged less than 38 years at the time of treatment, and</p>

  <p>Neither partner previously sterilised, and</p>

  <p>No child living with the couple in their home, and</p>

  <p>Less than three previous embryo transfers funded from any source.</p>

  <p>Discussions are currently taking place with Castlemilk Estate about the possibility of some limited replanting of trees at Birkshaw Forest in the current planting season. This would be a welcome development in helping return the site to its former use less than a year since the site was operational during the foot-and-mouth disease epidemic.</p>

  <p>An order was laid before the Scottish Parliament on 28 March 2002 in exercise of powers conferred by sections 93(3) and 113 of the Scotland Act 1998. The instrument specifies certain functions for the purposes of section 93(1) of that act, which may be exercised by a Minister of the Crown on behalf of Scottish ministers. The relevant functions in relation to the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms are:</p>

  <p>maintaining the public register;</p>

  <p>determining those particulars which may be excluded from the public register for reasons of commercial confidentiality, and</p>

  <p>receiving and examining applications for consent to release or market genetically modified organisms.</p>

  <p>The order does not transfer ministerial responsibility for these functions but, in practice, provides for suitably qualified officials in a UK Government department to carry out certain functions in accordance with the terms of an agency arrangement. This clarifies an arrangement which has been in place since the mid-1990s and does not constitute any change in practice.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to investigate the prescribing of steroid creams on the NHS.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to monitor repeated use of steroid creams in children from data collected centrally. These data relate to prescribed items dispensed in the community and are not patient-specific.</p>

  <p>Guidance on the use of these products is available to doctors from a number of sources. Importantly, the British National Formulary, issued free to doctors, provides prescribing advice, which includes advice on topical corticosteroid use in children.</p>

  <p>The use of these treatments depends on the clinical judgement of the doctor concerned, informed by advice and evidence about their use.</p>

  <p>Generally it is for local authorities to decide how best to deploy the resources available to them to meet housing need, including the provision of equipment and adaptations to promote independent living at home. However, in 2000-01, a one-off allocation of &#163;5 million was made to local authorities. This was to assist in overcoming any delays in making alterations to the homes of people with disabilities who wished to continue living in their own homes as an alternative to institutional care. The answer given to question S1W-21422 on 18 January 2002, provided a breakdown of this figure by local authority.</p>

  <p>Section 202 of the Criminal Procedures (Scotland) Act 1995 permits a sheriff to impose a deferred sentence on an offender and record a condition that he should make good any damage done, either pay a sum of money or repay costs to the complainer by the date of the deferred sentence.</p>

  <p>Under section 249 of the 1995 act the sheriff can impose a Compensation Order, subject to some qualifications and with certain conditions, in respect of an accused who has been convicted of an offence. The order will be imposed for any sum deemed appropriate, which is normally the value of the damage as proved to the court's satisfaction. However, Compensation Orders cannot be imposed as a condition of a deferred sentence.</p>

  <p>These options remain within the sole discretion of the sheriff and there is no formal requirement for him to make such a condition or Compensation Order.</p>

The arrangements for the Mental Health and Well Being Support Group membership, remit and approach are kept under review for continued relevance and to ensure that their contribution to the investment and reform agenda for mental health in Scotland remains effective.</p>

  <p>The <i>Framework for Mental Health Services in Scotland</i> and more recently <i> Our National Health</i> set the agenda for change and improvement in mental health services in Scotland. Agencies are working toward the benchmarks provided in those documents and the new Performance Assessment Framework which will provide one of a range of evaluation measures on progress made across Scotland. As to progress made since 1997, this is summarised in the Annual Reports, individual area assessment reports and the six-month progress reports published by the visiting Mental Health and Well Being Support Group. These are available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre and on the support group website at:</p>

  <p>The National Advisory Group has met twice, on 21 January and 29 April. Its initial focus is on overseeing the development of a national programme for improving mental health, which will have the two main components of information collection and a range of practical initiatives. Proposals for the former include a public attitudes survey, capacity building work for mental health improvement, and the establishment of a national resource to provide information to the field. Current practical initiatives include the continuing work on the National Framework for Reducing Suicide and Deliberate Self harm, the Breathing Space Phoneline for people with low mood or depression introduced on 8 April, the National Anti-Stigma Campaign, which is being led by People Too, and research work on mental health in the workplace, which is being led by HEBS.</p>

  <p>A programme director is now in post to help drive forward the national programme.</p>

  <p>Trusts were written to in September last year and again on 7 February this year reminding them that they should be using the Accounts Commission criteria. Use of agency nurses will be monitored through the Staff Governance Standard.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s policy on the use of planning conditions is as set out in Circular 4/1998. This requires that conditions should be necessary, relevant to planning, enforceable, effective, precise and reasonable in all other respects. It is, of course, for individual local authorities to apply planning conditions in specific cases, however, National Planning Policy Guideline (NPPG) 8: <i>Town Centres and Retailing</i> requires that conditions should not seek to control details of particular products but apply only to the main ranges of goods.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. An allegation may involve a complaint against more than one officer. A case is defined as a single investigation undertaken by an investigating officer into one incident or a group of incidents following a complaint by one or more persons.</p>

  <p>2. Neither of the columns in the table equate to the number of officers who have been the subject of a complaint because, for example, more than one person may make a complaint about a single officer, someone may make a complaint about a number of officers or an officer may be the subject over a period of more than one complaint.</p>

  <p>Across all modes of public transport the underlying principle is that fares should reflect journey costs, be paid by those making the journeys and be determined by transport operators. However, the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Rural Transport Fund provides support for certain scheduled bus and ferry services that would otherwise not operate or operate at considerably higher fares, while the Executive also provides subsidy support for lifeline air and ferry services in the Highlands and Islands.</p>

  <p>The effects would result in a positive impact but the evidence suggests that this would not be to any significant or quantifiable extent. The existing rail service is already faster and more reliable than the car for journeys between the city centres. Further improvements in the service will benefit the existing public transport users but are unlikely to lead to a significant shift in the number of travellers from car to public transport.</p>

  <p>the Scottish Executive's Directions and Guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority (SRA) will be issued this summer;</p>

  <p>the SRA will subsequently invite bids later in 2002;</p>

  <p>The word "prescribe" does not have a single statutory definition. Sections 7 and 8 of the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 are silent on a specific meaning of the term. It is therefore taken to have its meaning in common usage, which is "to specify, state or set out".</p>

  <p>We have reviewed comments on this proposal, but conclude that these do not present persuasive arguments for retention of the board. Our assessment remains that the policy of introducing competition with solicitors in relation to executry and conveyancing services has had very limited success, that it is unlikely that the number of registrations will increase to the point where the board could become self-funding and that the status quo would result in a continuing burden on the taxpayer to provide an on-going subsidy.</p>

  <p>We have therefore decided to promote statutory provisions in the Public Appointments and Public Bodies (Scotland) Bill to abolish the board and transfer its responsibilities for qualified conveyancers and executry practitioners to the Law Society of Scotland. The society has had long experience of the supervision of solicitors and is well placed to assume responsibility for the regulation of those professions. We are very grateful to the society for its willingness to take on this responsibility.</p>

  <p>From the date of transfer of responsibility to the society, it will not be possible to register as an independent qualified conveyancer, though those already registered will be able to continue to practise in that capacity. Qualified conveyancers and executry practitioners will continue to be able to practise in an employed capacity under the society&#8217;s supervision. Students on relevant law courses who wish to pursue a future career as a qualified conveyancer or executry practitioner will still be able to do so.</p>

  <p>In terms of fisheries management, ministers have powers under the Inshore Fishing (Scotland) Act 1984 to prohibit fishing in any specified area of Scotland's inshore and intertidal waters. In the past, these powers have mainly been exercised to protect fish stocks or in the pursuit of resolving conflict between fishermen using different types of gear. Ministers also have powers under the Sea Fisheries (Shellfish) Act 1967 to provide local management organisations with powers to manage local shellfisheries sustainably under Regulating Orders.</p>

  <p>Where an intertidal area is designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) may, at the time of notification of the SSSI, have specified cockle or other shellfish harvesting as an operation likely to damage the features of interest of the SSSI. If so, any owner or occupier proposing to carry out such an activity would have to consult SNH regarding the proposal and SNH may enter into a management agreement which would prevent the owner or occupier from carrying out the operation.</p>

  <p>In cases where the person proposing or carrying out the cockle or other shellfish harvesting is not the owner or occupier of the SSSI, or where it does not prove possible for SNH to enter into a management agreement with the owner or occupier of the SSSI, Scottish ministers may, after consultation with SNH, make a Nature Conservation Order under section 29 of the 1981 act to restrict the operation, if that operation is likely to destroy or damage the feature of interest for which the SSSI has been designated. Nature Conservation Orders to control shellfish collecting are currently in place on a number of SSSIs around Scotland where this activity would cause damage to the features of interest of the sites.</p>

  <p>Where an intertidal area is classified as a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the EC Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the Conservation of Wild Birds (the Birds Directive) or as a proposed Special Area of Conservation (SAC) under the EC Council Directive 92/43/EEC on the Conservation of Natural Habitats and of Wild Fauna and Flora (the Habitats Directive), Scottish ministers may, after consultation with SNH, make a Special Nature Conservation Order under Regulation 22 of the Habitats Regulations to restrict an activity, which could include harvesting of cockles or other shellfish, if that operation is likely to destroy or damage the feature of interest for which the SPA has been classified or the SAC proposed.</p>

  <p>I understand that an interim interdict was recently served on cockle handgatherers preventing them from fishing in Burntisland Bay. The Scottish Executive will consider conducting an assessment of the effect of the handgatherers activities on the features of the Firth of Forth Special Protected Area and whether this is sustainable in the longer-term.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is also considering possible legislative reforms arising from its policy statement <i>The Nature of Scotland</i>. Future legislative proposals will address the protection of Sites of Special Scientific Interest and may, in particular, afford them increased protection from the actions of third parties.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s report demonstrated that in the short term the priority should be strengthening partnership working amongst the local authorities in the Highlands and Islands. Consequently, joint working between the partners in the region has been strengthened. This is illustrated by the move from a forum to a Strategic Partnership; the implementation of the partnership&#8217;s successful bid to the Public Transport Fund in 2001; the creation of HITRANS and the recent formalisation of its constitution and funding arrangements. This has been aided by a commitment from the Scottish Executive to match fund HITRANS&#8217; constituent councils&#8217; contributions to the development of a Joint Transport Strategy for the area, on which work is substantially under way.</p>

  <p>GPs and NHS staff have an important role to play in offering advice and information to patients and carers, and many already do this routinely. The Community Care and Health (Scotland) Act 2002 will enable Scottish ministers to require NHS boards to prepare &quot;carer information&quot; strategies, to ensure that carers are informed that they may be entitled to an assessment by the local authority of their ability to care. Local authorities in turn can give carers and service users advice on local sources of support. We will be discussing with the NHS and carers&#8217; organisations how carer information strategies should work to support the partnership of care between carers, local authorities and the NHS.</p>

  <p>The arrangements for the provision of advice on voluntary organisations are a matter for local NHS organisations, in liaison with other agencies. Local Health Care Co-operatives and primary care teams have an important role in providing information regarding voluntary services to patients, carers and the public. General advice and information on voluntary organisations in Scotland can be accessed through the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations. In addition, local information can be accessed through the national network of Councils for Voluntary Service and the local authority for each area.</p>
