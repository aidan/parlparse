  <p>Yes. Today I am publishing the findings of the Police Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) Working Group which was set up to consider how best to distribute police funding between Scottish forces. The working group has produced a new formula which aims to ensure that the way we distribute funding is linked much more directly to the cost of policing each force and recommends a target share for each force. The formula takes into account a range of factors including the population in each area, deprivation and the demands on forces.</p>

  <p>An interim report from the working group, submitted in late 2002, had indicated that the allocations at that time merited adjustment and additional resources. As a result, an additional &pound;4.5 million was added to the GAE allocations for Grampian Police, Fife Constabulary, Central Scotland Police and Northern Constabulary in 2005-06.</p>

  <p>The group&rsquo;s final report now makes clear that further adjustment is needed and recommends this continues to be achieved by &quot;levelling up&quot; the funding allocations for forces rather than by redistributing existing funding between forces. I have accepted this recommendation which means that no force will have its allocation cut as a result of the model. The overall extra amounts allocated for levelling-up are &pound;5.5 million in 2005-06, rising to &pound;8.5 million in 2006-07 and &pound;15.5 million in 2007-08. We intend to find the balance needed to complete levelling-up by 2009-10. Once the levelling up process is complete, subsequent allocations will then be made using the new formula.</p>

  <p>It is too early, at this stage, to say what the total policing cost of the G8 Summit at Gleneagles will be and therefore what amount of additional funding will be provided by the UK Government. A group involving representatives from UK Government departments, Tayside Police and the Executive has been set up to assess what the additional policing costs will be. That group&rsquo;s conclusions will inform the level of additional funds to be provided by the UK Government.</p>

  <p>No, the Scottish Executive shares are held in a share category established specifically for a holding by ministers and not for open market trading. The share structure of Partnerships UK is intended to ensure a balance of private and public sector interests within a private sector classified company, and it is important that this structure be maintained and Scottish interests recognised. Accordingly, the Scottish Executive has no plans to dispose of its shareholding in a body that provides the dedicated and non-conflicted private sector expertise and resources essential to support the public sector in building better partnerships across the UK.</p>

  <p>The Executive is a minority shareholder and the role it plays over the appointment of directors of Partnerships UK is appropriate to the level of shareholding it holds. The board of PUK is made up of members from the private sector and two non-Executive Directors appointed by HM Treasury. There is an Advisory Council which oversees the work of PUK and is made up exclusively of members from the public sector. Scottish ministers are represented on the council.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">what the level of expenditure was on developing renewable energy in each of the last three years, expressed also on a per capita basis, and how this expenditure compares to similar expenditure in other European countries.</a></p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-10-12.20.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80128" speakername="Allan Wilson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa1012.htm#QuestionText">

  <p>The information is not available in the form requested. A separate budget for renewable energy was not introduced until 2003-04, when direct spending from within the Executive&rsquo;s energy budget amounted to &pound;1.6 million. This compares to an estimated &pound;0.4 million in 2002-03.</p>

  <p>These figures do not take into account budget transfers to Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE) and the Energy Saving Trust (EST) to fund and operate our Scottish Community and Household Renewables Initiative (SCHRI). We estimate that Executive spending on the SCHRI from its introduction in 2002 until April 2005 will come to a further &pound;5 million.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also contributed funding of &pound;2.2 million towards the establishment of the European Marine Energy Centre.</p>

  <p>We also fund a range of other renewables support measures through the activities of HIE, Scottish Enterprise, EST and the Carbon Trust, in addition to direct business support and Regional Selective Assistance funding for small businesses and companies involved in renewable energy activities.</p>

  <p>Renewables activity in Scotland also benefits from a range of UK capital and research support schemes administered by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). Awards to Scottish companies from DTI renewable programmes since 2002 amount to an estimated &pound;28 million.</p>
