  <p>The Scottish Executive has not commissioned research that explores the factors associated specifically with antisocial behaviour (as opposed to broader delinquency). However, the Executive is currently part-funding the Edinburgh Study of Youth Transitions and Crime. This is a programme of research being carried out by the University of Edinburgh that aims to address a range of fundamental questions about the causes of criminal and risky behaviours in young people. The core of the programme is a major longitudinal study of a single cohort of around 4,000 young people who started secondary school in Edinburgh in the autumn of 1998.</p>

  <p>While the study recognises that explanations for delinquency are extremely complex, it does highlight a number of factors which appear to be strongly associated with delinquency at age 15. These are: moral beliefs; victimisation; parenting, and risk taking. Other factors that were quite strongly associated with delinquency at this age were: peers and spare-time activities; impulsivity, and attachments to school. For further details see the 2004 research digest entitled &quot;Gender and Youth Offending&quot; which is available on Edinburgh Study website at publications: <a href="http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/cls/esytc/" target="_blank">http://www.law.ed.ac.uk/cls/esytc/</a>.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for improvement of private houses lies primarily with the owner. The provision of adequate insulation is an improvement that falls within the eligibility criteria for housing improvement and repair grants, but it is for local authorities to determine priorities for available funding.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to reply. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>A number of changes will affect how local authorities prepare their Local Housing Strategies. These include legislative changes arising from the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, proposals to create a national Strategic Housing Investment Framework, and on-going work to ensure that assessments of future housing need are more consistent and more strongly linked to assessments of overall housing supply requirements for development planning purposes.</p>

  <p>These changes will necessitate revisions to the current guidance on the preparation of Local Housing Strategies. Local authorities are expected to update their current Local Housing Strategies by early 2009. We propose therefore to issue a series of revisions to the guidance to reflect these changes in sufficient time for local authorities to prepare both for the implementation of the Strategic Housing Investment Framework and for their Local Housing Strategies to be completed by the deadline.</p>

  <p>Local housing needs assessments are complex exercises that must be prepared using robust methodology that takes account of both local and national requirements. We will shortly be piloting an exercise which aims to gather needs assessment information in a standard way. When the exercise is rolled out across Scotland at the end of the year, it will help us to gain a better understanding of the relationship between local and nationally undertaken needs assessments. More consistent and reliable local needs assessments will enhance their value as a contributory element of soundly based development plans and in informing resource allocations.</p>

  <p>The remit of the Affordable Housing Working Group is &quot;To establish means of securing the more effective supply of affordable housing in areas of greatest need&quot;. The group has met on one occasion and was attended by representatives from four local authorities, Homes for Scotland, the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, COSLA and Scottish Water. There will be a further meeting of the group in October at which the work programme will be discussed, although at this stage it is not envisaged that the group will prepare or present a formal report. The work of the group will be informed by research already commissioned by the Executive on the allocation of land for affordable housing through the planning system. The completed research is expected to be available prior to the October meeting of the working group.</p>

  <p>The Community Ownership Programme is open to any local authority in Scotland, and each application is considered on its own merit.</p>

  <p>The City of Edinburgh Council is reviewing the options for the future of its housing and any decision to re-apply to the community ownership programme lies with the council.</p>

  <p>Tenant participation is at the heart of community ownership and section 76 and Schedule 9 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 clearly sets out the requirements for statutory consultation with tenants whose homes are included in a transfer proposal. There are no proposals to change this guidance to include prospective tenants.</p>

  <p>On 10 June 2006 Defra made SEERAD aware that the enforcement powers of the Cattle Identification Regulations 1998 (CIR) and the Cattle Database Regulations 1998 (CDR) may not be effective as they were not updated when Council Regulation (EC) 820/97 was revoked and replaced by Council Regulation 1760/2000 in August 2000. In order to put the enforcement powers in the regulations beyond doubt, amendments were made, with my approval, on a GB basis to update references in the CIR and CDR pending consideration of the Defra advice. The amending legislation came into force on 15 June 2006.</p>

  <p>Following consideration of the position of Scottish CIR and CDR convictions from August 2000 to June 2006, it was determined that these convictions should be set aside as unsafe.

  <p>The Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters Unit (SEIRU) has already issued advice to local authorities on this matter. In March of this year the Chief Inquiry Reporter wrote to all Heads of Planning in local authorities explaining how improvements in current practice at local plan inquiries were being implemented. The first paragraph of that advice suggested that the planning authority should establish a timetable for the lead-in to the public inquiry from the end of the deposit period, allowing sufficient time for its own consideration of the merits of the objections lodged to the local plan and for the preparation of all documentation. Additionally, the SEIRU have adopted a more systematic approach to assessing authorities&rsquo; state of preparation. In addition to a quarterly progress report from all authorities, the Unit explores the realism of the programme for each local plan through preparatory meetings involving the SEIRU and local authority officials before committing to the provision of a reporter.</p>

  <p>Ministers are responsible for setting the strategic direction for Scottish Enterprise. In turn, Scottish Enterprise agrees with ministers an annual Operating Plan which contains budget allocations for key activities, although amendments may be agreed in the course of the year. The Operating Plan for 2006-09 was published on 29 June 2006. Detailed budget allocations for each local enterprise company are an operational matter for Scottish Enterprise.</p>

  <p>This data for 2005 is not yet available.</p>

  <p>The reference point for the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s business stock database is being brought forward from November to March. For continuity of analysis, the first two years of March based figures (2005 and 2006) will be published together by the end of this year. This change has resulted in a delay to the 2005 figures; however the data for 2006 and subsequent years will be available at least six months earlier under the new timetable.</p>
