  <p>The Executive recognises that many unpaid carers need a regular break from caring in order to support the caring relationship. Our Partnership Agreement reflects our firm commitment to develop respite provision across Scotland. Over the last three years &pound;22 million has been provided to local authorities specifically to develop short break services. These resources are just part of the total resources available to local authorities. Those authorities decide with key partners, including health boards, how much to spend on delivering home-based respite. If a carer has to withdraw from supporting a cared-for person, for whatever reason, that inevitably has financial implications for authorities, health boards and the other key agencies involved in providing alternative care. Information is not available on the cost to the NHS of withdrawing home-based respite services in north and west Sutherland, or elsewhere.</p>

  <p>Scotland's tourism industry benefits greatly from this country's cultural history and Burns is one of Scotland's great cultural icons. His work is well known around the world, and in particular Burns Night presents an excellent opportunity for the promotion of Scotland as a tourist destination.</p>

  <p>How this is done is primarily a matter for VisitScotland and other agencies. However, I understand that VisitScotland have recently set up a feature on Burns, accessible from the home page of visitscotland.com and featuring items on biographies of the man, Burns suppers, how to stage them, recipes, poems etc, while VisitScotland's London Office is presently running a Burns promotion. VisitScotland and EventScotland will also be supporting the Burns an a' that Festival this spring in Ayrshire.</p>

  <p>There are no current plans to end &quot;golden hello&quot; payments. From 1 April 2004 dental graduates undertaking vocational training in Scotland will be entitled to an allowance of &pound;3,000 or &pound;6,000 where they undertake vocational training in a designated area.

  <p>The target referred to is &quot;Reducing the gap in unemployment rates between the worst 10% of areas and the Scottish average by 2006&quot;.</p>

  <p>The measure is constructed by subtracting the claimant count unemployment rate for Scotland from the claimant count unemployment rate for the worst 10% of wards in Scotland. Definitions of claimant unemployment vary across countries due to different eligibility criteria for unemployment benefit, so international comparisons are not possible.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to reducing disparities in unemployment between different parts of Scotland. &quot;Reduce the gap in unemployment rates between the worst 10% of areas and the Scottish average by 2006&quot; was set out in <em>Building a Better Scotland</em> and is one of the performance measures for achieving <em>A Smart, Successful Scotland</em> and <em>Social Justice &#8211; a Scotland where everyone matters</em>.</p>

  <p>The Fraser of Allander Institute report <em>Measuring progress towards Smart, Successful Scotland, 2003 </em>indicated that over the past 10 years the gap between unemployment levels in Scotland's worst 10% of areas and the Scottish average has closed from just over 20% to 5%.</p>

  <p>Progress towards this target will continue to be monitored through <em>A</em> <em>Smart, Successful Scotland.</em></p>

  <p>We have no plans currently to carry out a detailed analysis of the outcome of every individual inward investment project recorded for the years in question.</p>

  <p>Accurate figures could only be obtained by undertaking a comprehensive survey of overseas-owned companies on a regular basis. This would be a costly exercise and would also be inconsistent with the policy of reducing the burdens on business.</p>

  <p>The Executive has not been involved in any national noise survey since 1999-2001 when there were UK-wide noise attitude and parallel national noise incidence surveys undertaken. There are no plans to conduct further surveys of this type at present.</p>

  <p>The Executive, together with the UK Government, will be transposing the EC Environmental Noise Directive in 2004. This directive requires the mapping of noise levels for all major agglomerations, roads, railways and airports initially by 2007, and the drawing up of action plans as appropriate by 2008.</p>

However, the implementation of the EC Environmental Noise Directive and the issuing of the proposed noise management guide later this year, as described in the answers to questions S2W-5126 and S2W-5136 on 20 January 2004, should help promote a consistent approach to the management of noise.

  <p>Scottish Development International (SDI) promotes the internationalisation of Scottish companies in line with the Scottish Executive's Global Connections strategy. The EU is a key market for Scotland and SDI provides a wide range of support measures to companies and organisations to assist them to develop trading links, global alliances and strategic partnerships. These include the provision of market research, delivering customised entry support for companies looking at new markets, assistance on outward missions and attendance at major exhibitions and in market assistance through SDI's network of overseas offices.</p>

  <p>In respect of the EU candidate countries, activity to date has been largely concentrated on raising awareness and SDI has been working closely with the Euro Info Centres on awareness activities directed at business across Scotland. For the future, specific opportunities have been identified in sectors such as engineering and environmental services; financial services and business process operations; e-business and software; electronics; food and drink and tourism. Where other opportunities are also identified, companies will have access to the full range of SDI services to ensure that these are maximised.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to a world class further education sector which delivers the maximum value for the record levels of funding now being invested. We look to the colleges' boards of management to work together, where possible, to identify areas where efficiencies can be secured and further education delivered in the most rational way, to the ultimate benefit of the students and communities served by the colleges. It is encouraging that discussions are continuing between Glasgow's five city centre colleges on their future estates configuration, but I am not aware that a proposal to merge the colleges has emerged from these discussions.</p>

It is for college boards of management to balance these policy objectives within the resources at their disposal in a way which best supports the needs of the communities they serve. The letter for the current year of 2003-04, dated 20 December 2002, can be found in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 27458). The letter for 2004-05 was issued on 12 January 2004 and a copy of this will also be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>For many women, the symptoms that occur at menopause adversely affect their quality of life. Following careful assessment of findings from a number of studies that provide important information on the safety of hormone replacement therapy (HRT), the UK Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) and its expert working group on HRT have reviewed the use of HRT in its licensed indications and issued clear safety advice to health professionals and women.</p>

  <p>The CSM's advice regarding the short-term treatment of these symptoms is unchanged and HRT remains the first choice of treatment. However, in these women, the lowest effective dose should be used for the shortest possible duration, each decision to start HRT should be made on an individual basis with a fully informed woman and treatment should be re-evaluated at least annually in light of new knowledge and any changes in the woman's risk factors.</p>

  <p>The CSM has further advised that HRT should no longer be considered as the first choice treatment for the prevention of osteoporosis in women who are at increased risk of fractures, as the risks are considered to outweigh the benefits. However, HRT may still be used in women who are intolerant of, or unresponsive to, other osteoporosis therapies.</p>

  <p>I understand that these arrests were the result of a thorough investigation carried out by Lothian and Borders Police. In the normal manner, a formal report on the evidence gathered was prepared and submitted to the Crown Office. The decision not to indict the accused within the statutory 110 day period was entirely a matter for the Crown Office following careful consideration of all the available evidence at that time. As regards any further comment on this case at the present time, the Lord Advocate considers that disclosure of the evidence and the specific circumstances would be contrary to the public interest.</p>

  <p>Both <em>A Framework for Maternity Services</em> (2001) and the report of the Expert Group on Acute Maternity Services (<em>EGAMS</em> 2002) state that NHS boards should make sure that local consultation and public involvement takes place when planning maternity services.</p>

  <p>Unlike prescription medications dispensed in the community, psychological therapies are not paid for centrally and as a result there is no single stream for data on psychological interventions.</p>

Work on this is beginning, through the Improving Mental Health Information Programme (iMHIP), eCare and the eHealth strategy.</p>

  <p>It is for the Scottish Medical Practices Committee, on the basis of information from NHS boards, to ensure the adequacy of general medical services in their areas. Where the committee determines that a doctor who retires or resigns should be replaced, or where it determines that an additional doctor is required, it will direct the board to seek applications for the post. In addition, regulations provide that any patient who is without a doctor for any reason, may apply to their board for assignment to a GP. I am not aware of any patient for whom a GP cannot be found.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to S2W-4605 by Mr Tom McCabe on 15 December 2003, whether it will list the specific organisations that have received grants for 2002-03 under section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 for the provision of services to disabled persons, stating the level of grant awarded.</p>

  <p>A number of organisations provide services across the entire community care client group. Some organisations which receive section 10 grants do not provide services for disabled persons alone. This makes it impossible to provide a full breakdown of section 10 funding for the provision of services to disabled persons.</p>

  <p>The table details all grants made under section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 in 2002-03 from the Health Department budget. Other departments also make grants under section 10 which may relate to disabled persons.</p>

  <p>Section 10 Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 Health Department Grants 2002-03</p>

  <p>In recognition of the potential difficulties in moving to full cost recovery fee levels in 2004-05 for service providers, ministers have reviewed the full cost recovery policy. While we still wish to deliver the original policy intention, we have now proposed that the move to full cost recovery is staged over the next three years, rather than being introduced in one step in 2004-05 <strong>. </strong> A consultation paper was issued on 15 December seeking the views of interested parties including local authorities, voluntary and private sector providers by 6 February.</p>

  <p>Part 2 of the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 provides for ministers to make regulations determining what is a reasonable cost, for the purposes of section 1 of the Sewerage (Scotland) Act 1968 and section 6 of the Water (Scotland) Act 1980, which deal respectively with new water and new sewerage connections to the public water and sewerage networks.</p>

  <p>Ministers made clear during the passage of the 2003 act that regulations determining reasonable cost were likely to mean that developers would no longer receive an automatic subsidy from Scottish Water on more or less every house that they build. Instead they would normally be expected to provide the infrastructure as part of the development.</p>

  <p>Regulations under Part 2 of the act will be the subject of public consultation before they are brought into force.</p>

  <p>Information prior to 1997 and agency figures are not held centrally. The latest figure for local authority social workers is 4,017, whole-time equivalent, as at October 2002, an increase of 21% over the 1997 total.

  <p>We are encouraging and supporting local agencies to improve planning and provision of services for children and young people. For example, the Changing Children's Services Fund is providing &pound;170 million over three years to help agencies better co-ordinate children's services, in particular for those most in need of support. In addition the Anti Social Behaviour Bill contains measures to ensure compliance, through the courts if necessary, strengthening the statutory duty on local authorities to implement supervision requirements.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has also had a programme of work to support the employers to boost social work numbers since shortages can contribute to problems in allocating workers and delivering services. The Scottish Executive published data at the end of June 2003 which showed there are 144 more social workers in children and family services nationally when compared with 2002. The position should be helped further when 50 fast-track social work trainees start work, and 469 current students enter the workforce this year.</p>

  <p>The Sewel memorandum and motion were forwarded to the Enterprise and Culture Committee for consideration on 12 January. The memorandum addresses a wide range of provisions within the Energy Bill that fall within devolved competence. These include provisions to establish the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority; to reconstitute the UKAEA Constabulary as the Civil Nuclear Constabulary; to amend the Radioactive Substances Act 1998; to establish Renewable Energy Zones; to provide powers in respect of the decommissioning of offshore renewable energy installations; to extend the scope of the Renewables Obligations and to permit funds from the Fossil Fuel Levy to be paid into the Scottish Consolidated Fund.</p>

  <p>The Executive has discussed with Her Majesty's Government the content and implications of the bills in its legislative programme, including the Energy Bill. The discussions for each bill have reflected the extent of the relationship with devolved matters. We have now issued a Sewel motion to the Parliament covering those provisions within the Energy Bill that fall in devolved competence.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-4278 by Allan Wilson on 5 December 2003, whether it has the power to specify threshold levels for small commercial waste oil burners under the Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003, as has been exercised by Her Majesty's Government under the equivalent regulations in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>The Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003 transpose the Waste Incineration Directive (2000/76/EC). Section 57(2) of the Scotland Act 1998 provides that the Executive has no power to make regulations in a way that is incompatible with European Community law. As the Waste Incineration Directive has no <em>de minimis</em> threshold for small waste oil burners, the Executive is unable to specify any threshold level for such units in the regulations.</p>

  <p>The equivalent regulations for England and Wales do not include any threshold for small waste oil burners. I understand the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has no plans to introduce such a threshold.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why it has decided not to set a threshold in relation to small commercial waste oil burners under the Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003, as has been set by Her Majesty's Government, and whether it has any plans to review its interpretation of the regulations to reflect the position in England and Wales.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer given to question S2W-5142 on 20 January 2004. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament's website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="/webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a> .</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to review its interpretation of the Waste Incineration Directive. The interpretation of the Waste Incineration (Scotland) Regulations 2003 is a matter for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency in the first instance, and ultimately for the courts.</p>

  <p>The Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 provides a strategic framework to protect the Scottish water environment. The provision of water storage facilities for public water supplies is a matter for Scottish Water, not the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>
