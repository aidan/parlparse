  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will grant, for all scallop vessels, a four week extension to the seasonal closure which is due to operate from 23 August 1999 until 1 November 1999, and whether it will ensure that any necessary procedures to obtain such an extension are carried out before 23 August 1999.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is considering a request to extend the exception to the seasonal inshore closure on mobile gear fishing between Lochmaddy south to Barra Head which applies from March until October. The exception applies to scallop dredging between 1 May and 24 August. The request comes in light of the current ban on scallop fishing off the West Coast due to the detection of high levels of Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning (ASP). It is however unclear whether the ASP ban will be lifted before 24 August. Particular consideration will also require to be given to those fishing in the area after 24 August using other types of fishing gear.</p>

  <p>The conclusions of the National Review of Resource Allocation for the NHS in Scotland were published on 15 July, in the form of the report &#145;Fair Shares For All&#146;. In order to give Members and the general public sufficient time to consider the Review&#146;s recommendations I have decided that the report should be subject to consultation for a period of four months from the date of publication. The Parliamentary Committee for Health and Community Care will be briefed on the Review and I look forward to hearing their views on some of the key issues. A copy of the Review&#146;s report has been sent to each member and has been laid in the Parliamentary Library.</p>

  <p>The Review&#146;s remit asked it to bring forward recommendations with the aim of promoting fair access to healthcare, based on the health needs of each area Health Board. This has involved the use of a wide range of relevant deprivation indicators in order to assess needs associated with deprivation. The full list of the indicators used by the Review are included in the report.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to request the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland to conduct a separate review from that of the Chief Medical Officer for the UK of the Beef-on-the-bone ban and, if not, whether it will explain the reason for this.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will be guided by advice from the Chief Medical Officer for Scotland when reaching a view on the Beef Bones Regulations. But there is free movement of live cattle and meat within the UK. In addition the main market for our high quality cattle and beef is in England. When considering the Beef Bones Regulations it would therefore not be sensible to ignore the position in the rest of the United Kingdom.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what criteria exist for the provision of infertility treatment in Scotland, whether these criteria are the same throughout Scotland and, if they are not, what action it intends to take to ensure that the highest standards and levels of availability in the provision of this treatment apply throughout Scotland.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/1999-08-17.8.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-99/wa0817.htm#99">

  <p>Infertility services are divided into 3 levels. Level 1 services are provided by a General Practitioner while Level 2 services, involving more advanced investigation and treatment, are normally provided by a gynaecologist with a specialist interest in infertility within a District General Hospital. Level 3 infertility services are complex and involve high-technology procedures which include, for example, In-Vitro Fertilisation (IVF) and Intra-Cytoplasmic Semen Insemination (ICSI). These services are provided at 4 centres in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Level 1 and 2 infertility services are provided by all Health Boards. Individual Health Boards determine the provision of Level 3 services on the basis of clinical need for patients who meet locally determined criteria. The criteria varies from Health Board to Health Board but includes an upper age limit on the age of the woman, minimum duration of unexplained infertility and restrictions relating to existing children.</p>

  <p>An Expert Advisory Group on Infertility Services in Scotland has undertaken a review of the clinical management of infertility services with a particular focus on establishing a model specification for infertility care in Scotland. The Expert Group has reported to the Chief Medical Officer in Scotland and to the Clinical Resources and Audit Group. The Report is currently being considered.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) facilities are available to patients in the Tayside area, the location of the facilities, how long the facilities have been in place, and how the current provision compares to the provision of MRI facilities in the periods 1996-1997 and 1997-1998.</p>

  <p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for patients from across Tayside is provided by 2 MRI scanners at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee: one machine was installed in November 1998; and the other was redeployed in January 1999 as part of the transfer of services from Dundee Royal Infirmary.</p>

  <p>In 1997 and 1998 there was one scanner at Dundee Royal Infirmary and a mobile MRI unit in service one day each fortnight in the former Angus NHS Trust area. The mobile unit was withdrawn in April 1999 after the installation of the new scanner at Ninewells Hospital.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question SW1-292 by Susan Deacon on 29 July 1999, to specify the projected income from charges under the Road Traffic (NHS Charges) Act 1999 and to which budget such income will be allocated.</p>

  <p>It is estimated that the new charging arrangements will eventually increase road traffic accident income to the NHS in Scotland to around &pound;10 million per annum. The previous arrangements saw only &pound;1 million per annum being recouped.</p>

  <p>Once collected, the income is remitted directly to the NHS Trust or Trusts that provided the treatment for the accident.</p>

  <p>What these figures do not show is the huge increase in support staff over this period when numbers rose from 3,404 in March 1992 to 4,661 in March 1999 an increase of 37%.</p>

  <p>A number of minor schemes have recently been completed on the A82 and a further 14 road safety schemes have been approved for completion in this financial year. In addition the Base Railway Camp Bridge strengthening scheme at Fort William is expected to commence on site in September 1999. A Route Accident Reduction Plan (RARP) has already been carried out on the majority of the route with the section between Balloch and Tarbet due to report in the Autumn. RARP measures which are under consideration are aimed at introducing a consistent regime of signing and carriageway markings throughout the length of the route.</p>

  <p>Additional road safety improvements which include traffic calming measures within villages may be implemented on the A82 subject to competing priorities on the trunk road network and funds being available.</p>
