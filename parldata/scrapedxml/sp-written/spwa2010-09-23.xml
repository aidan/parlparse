  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Covers crime categories sale of drink to person under 18 and wholesaler selling liquor to person under 18, although no crimes of the latter have been recorded in the years reported.</p>

  <p>2. The Lothians region consists of the local authority areas of City of Edinburgh, East Lothian, Midlothian and West Lothian.</p>

  <p>For data on the financial year 2007-08, I refer the member to questions S3W-26512 and S3W-26513 which were both answered on 7 September 2009. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>In 2008-09, the latest year for which court proceedings data is available, there were 27 convictions for sale of alcohol to a person under 18. This covers the crime categories sale of drink to person under 18 and wholesaler selling liquor to person under 18, although no convictions of the latter have been recorded in the year reported. There were 15 convictions for purchasing alcohol for consumption by a person under 18.</p>

  <p>In 2008-09, there were no convictions in the Lothians region for purchase of alcohol or its consumption in a licensed premises by a person under 18 or confiscation of alcohol from a person under 18.</p>

  <p>Please note that prosecution is not the sole course taken in dealing with these offences. Where persons under 18 possess alcohol in a public place, the police have powers under section 61 of the Crime and Punishment (Scotland) Act 1997 to confiscate this alcohol and dispose of it. If the alcohol is surrendered to the police, it is not an offence and so is not included in the recorded crime statistics. It is, however, an offence to fail to comply, for example by failing to surrender the alcohol or by failing to give name and address if requested. During the years reported, for the Lothians region, there were no recorded instances of persons under 18 failing to comply with such a request.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that statistics dealing with court proceedings and recorded crime are not directly comparable as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime involving more than one victim and there is the possibility that the crime recorded by the police may be altered in the course of judicial proceedings. Also a crime may be recorded by the police in one year and court proceedings concluded in a subsequent year.</p>

  <p>A review of significant case review (SCRs) is currently underway. A working group of key multi-agency professionals was established in November 2009 to consider the SCR process in the light of recent research and practice, and in the context of the current review of the national child protection guidance. The key aims are to make recommendations to help improve consistency and practice, and to help child protection committees <em> </em> (CPCs) build confidence and capacity in undertaking SCRs.</p>

  <p>The group&rsquo;s report was presented to the Scottish Government in July 2010 and is now in the public domain. The recommendations for action are currently being considered jointly by the Scottish Government and CPCs, and a response will be published later this autumn.</p>

  <p>The key considerations and responsibilities for clearing and publishing the report of the significant case review (SCR) are outlined in the interim guidance for child protection committees (CPCs) for conducting SCRs published in March 2007. This is available on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p>Further clarification on publication and dissemination was issued by the Scottish Government in October 2007.</p>

  <p>It is for Chief Officers to decide how to publish the SCR based on this guidance and individual circumstances. However, as set out in the guidance, the executive summary and recommendations from each SCR should be published and made publicly available to provide an overview and analysis of the case.</p>

  <p>Chief Officers should select from a range of dissemination options available to them, including the option of publication aimed at the general public, that best serves the public interest and the purpose of improving service delivery.</p>

  <p>The issues around publication and dissemination have been considered by the SCR working group, and are reflected in its report. The Scottish Government is considering how to take this work forward and will set out its plans later this autumn.

  <p>Ultimately, Chief Officers across Scotland are responsible for the leadership, direction and scrutiny of their respective child protection services. However, Child Protection Committees (CPCs) work on behalf of the Chief Officers in their area and their responsibilities include putting in place robust mechanisms for the identification, consideration and management of significant case reviews (SCRs). This includes the need for processes to be in place to promote good practice, maximise learning, respond to conclusions and disseminate the lessons learned. The Scottish Government has published guidance for CPCs which makes clear their role in the SCR process.</p>

  <p>HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) is currently undertaking its second round of inspections of services to protect children. Every local authority area in Scotland will be visited, and as part of the inspection process, HMIE look at all significant case reviews undertaken in the previous 12 months.</p>

  <p>The findings of SCRs and how services have responded to the conclusions and recommendations should be reflected in local improvement plans and formally considered as part of annual child protection reviews by CPCs. CPCs have responsibility for the development and implementation of inter-agency self-evaluation, quality assurance and continuous improvement mechanisms.</p>

  <p>The aim of the current guidance <em>Interim Guidance For Child Protection Committees (CPCs) for Conducting Significant Case Reviews</em> published in March 2007 is to provide more clarity and consistency on what should be done and how best to act on lessons learned from a significant case review (SCR) both locally and across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The SCR Working Group outlined in the answer to question S3W-36024 on 23 September 2010 has looked specifically at the issue of consistency and quality assurance. The Scottish Government is considering how to take this work forward with CPCs and will set out its plans later this autumn.</p>

  <p>A national conference will be held in November 2010 for professionals to explore the conduct and use of SCRs. The key aims are to promote best practice and consistency of approach across Scotland. It is being jointly organised by the government funded Multi-Agency Resource Centre (MARS) and the Scottish Child Care and Protection Network (SCCPN), and independently funded Centre for Learning in Child Protection (CLiCP).</p>

  <p>SSSI boundaries are defined using suitable features on the ground and it is not uncommon for marginal areas of SSSIs to contain small areas of habitat that are not an essential component of the site.</p>

  <p>In this case it was established that a section of the SSSI contained areas of scrub and rough grassland, which had little ecological or hydrological connectivity with the notified reedbed and saltmarsh habitats. Discussion between Scottish Natural Heritage and the landowner resulted in agreement for the establishment of a new boundary fence and the removal of 2.4 hectares from the SSSI.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency (SFPA) was wound up on 31 March 2009. The functions and resources of SFPA were incorporated into Marine Scotland which was launched on 1 April 2009.</p>

  <p>In the last decade the increasing use of real time satellite surveillance has meant that Marine Scotland is able to use this information, along with conventional aerial surveillance, to determine where fishing vessels are. Although this information is of immense value it is still essential to have Marine Protection Vessels to maintain a credible deterrent to illegal incursions and provide an essential reaction capability to any issues detected using satellite or aircraft information. However, they are no longer the primary means of providing surveillance capability within the waters around Scotland. The changes in the sources, importance and use of the surveillance data led Marine Scotland to consider the fleet requirements for the future which would provide the most cost effective solutions.</p>

  <p>It was determined that aerial and satellite surveillance, along with risk based tasking and the adoption of new technology such as remote electronic monitoring using closed circuit television cameras and the use of electronic statutory returns (e-logbooks) will enable similar or improved levels of outputs from three Marine Protection Vessels (MPVs) to that previously provided by four.</p>

  <p>The Invasive Non-Native Species Strategy for Great Britain provides a comprehensive policy framework to guide management response to invasive non-native species. This is based on the approach advocated by the Convention on Biological Diversity, which prioritises prevention. Once invasive non-native species are well established, complete eradication is rarely viable.</p>

  <p>Whilst the Scottish Government will continue to seek to prevent the spread of North American crayfish in Scotland, it has no current plans for central government action to eradicate established populations. The Minister for Environment will shortly be meeting representatives from Dumfries and Galloway Council and other local interests to discuss the situation in Loch Ken with regard to North American Signal Crayfish.</p>

  <p>The Childsmile School programme provides twice-yearly fluoride varnish (FV) applications as a preventive treatment for children who are identified as living in the areas of highest need. Tables 1, 2 and 3 show, by NHS board of delivery and by school year, the number of children who received at least one fluoride varnish application, expressed also as a percentage of the number of eligible children.</p>

  <p>The Childsmile<em> </em>School programme is at various stages of implementation in all 14 NHS board areas. Three NHS boards; Dumfries and Galloway, Orkney and Western Isles are implementing in school year 2010 -11; no data available currently.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has developed a programme of web based health checks for people when they reach 40 in association with NHS 24. The &quot;Life Begins at 40&quot; pilot service was launched in Grampian in May 2010. To the first week in September, 212 people have accessed the system.</p>

  <p>Keep Well currently delivers inequalities targeted health checks to individuals in the most deprived communities across Scotland. These are targeted at those aged <br /> 45 to 64 and individuals outwith this age range may also receive a check if they are considered to be particularly vulnerable or &quot;at risk.&quot; Around 85,000 checks have been undertaken around Scotland. A record of those checked at 40 years of age is not maintained.</p>

  <p>Pilots to introduce universal health checks for all Scots aged 40 to 74 are due to begin in 2011.</p>

  <p>NHSScotland does not gather data on the numbers of days lost due to sickness absence, but does monitor the number of hours lost, as this is a more accurate measure of the impact of sickness absence on the service.</p>

  <p>For the period 1 April 2009 to 31 March 2010, NHSScotland had an absence rate for the year of 4.75% of the total available contracted hours.</p>

  <p>This rate represents a 0.2% reduction in sickness absence over the 2008-09 rate of 5.95% and a 0.8% reduction compared with the 2006-07 rate of 5.55%.</p>

  <p>Percentage rates for each NHS board are published yearly by the Information Services Division (ISD). Further information on sickness absence rates in NHSScotland can be found at the ISD website.</p>

  <p>There was no need for the Scottish Government to provide match funding in order to participate in the EU school fruit scheme. The regulations associated with the EU scheme allow Scotland to claim up to 100% of eligible costs of an extension, up to the value of 50% of the overall scheme value for each participating local authority, in lieu of the fact that Scotland already funds a free school fruit scheme.</p>

  <p>However, despite being successful in our bid for EU funding, Scotland is unable to gain any real benefit from participation in the scheme due to UK Treasury rules requiring 72p in every pound claimed from the EU under this scheme to be immediately repaid to the UK Treasury.</p>

  <p>The determination of Section 36 applications is not easy or straight forward and ministers must strike the right balance in their decision making between developing and delivering Scotland&rsquo;s energy future and the protection of environmental, cultural heritage, economic and community issues. Likewise, environmental effects outwith Scotland can also be a material consideration, although it would of course depend on the individual circumstances of an application.</p>

  <p>In a situation where an EIA development in Scotland appears to the Scottish Ministers to be likely to have significant effects on the environment in another European state, there is a requirement to send the EEA state in question certain information in relation to the EIA. The requirement to give that information also exists where the other state requests it and both are set out at regulation 12 of the Electricity Works (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Scotland) Regulations 2000.</p>

  <p>We do not envisage any external body taking on this important role for Scotland.

  <p>The Scottish Government also has regular, detailed and ongoing engagement with Ofgem, National Grid, renewable energy developers, Scottish transmission system operators, DECC and the European Union, on strategic grid infrastructure development and reinforcement across Scotland. This includes working in the Electricity Networks Strategy Group, which has set out the strategic onshore and offshore grid development for Scotland that will support connection of up to 11.4 GW of renewable energy by 2020.</p>
