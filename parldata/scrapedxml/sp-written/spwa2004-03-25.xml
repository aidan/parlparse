  <p>The Executive does not regularly monitor Scottish progress towards achieving the Lisbon Agenda.

  <p>The report is a &quot;to&quot; Government report and as such is not a statement of policy. It is for the Scottish Executive to formulate a response to each of the recommendations and our intention is to work in partnership with the industry on this over the summer.</p>

  <p>Our aim is to respond more definitively with an implementation plan later in the year.</p>

  <p>However, the Executive welcomes the broad conclusions of the report, particularly the recognition that the industry has a potentially bright future if all the players make the right choices now.</p>

  <p>It is particularly reassuring to note that our policy of arguing for more responsibility to be given to the proposed regional advisory councils has been vindicated. The current system of centralised decision-making no longer enjoys the confidence of the industry and the case for change has been made.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive ministers and officials were involved with the Strategy Unit project from the start and contributed to all aspects of the work on a daily basis.</p>

  <p>The Executive now intends to work with the industry and others to pull together an implementation plan which will form the basis for a definitive response. Meantime ministers broadly welcome the findings of the report.</p>

Such arrangements will need to meet mandatory accreditation standards to ensure a safe, quality service.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are currently developing their plans for out-of-hours service re-provision and are being assisted by a national out-of-hours working group. This group is comprised of key stakeholders from across the service and includes members from NHS24, the Scottish Ambulance Service and patient representatives. In addition, three key senior appointments have been made to the Pay Modernisation Team of NHS Scotland to focus on the new models of out-of-hours care across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive, the Science Review, and the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment (ACRE) are all satisfied that the methods used in the farm scale trials for both design and analysis were valid and robust. They are the most extensive and thorough evaluations of their kind in the world, and gave a clear picture of the changes in biodiversity caused by different herbicide regimes used on genetically modified (GM) and conventional crops, including maize.</p>

  <p>ACRE recommended that studies were initiated to consider the validity of the results in light of the phasing out of Atrazine. Further analysis of the farm scale evaluation (FSE) data has been published in the peer reviewed scientific journal <em>Nature</em>. This work concludes that the banning of Atrazine is unlikely to undermine the conclusions of the FSEs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to improving health and reducing inequalities in health. There are no current plans to initiate pilot studies and a cost-benefit analysis of exercise on prescription by NHS doctors. However, there are a number of local exercise initiatives in place which are the subject of review and evaluation. Exercise referral schemes are just one type of intervention that can be used to promote physical activity for health gain. It is important to emphasise the broad range of actions being supported to promote physical activity. Physical activity is one element of the national and local approach to improve health and reduce inequalities.</p>

  <p>The principal mechanism for funding affordable housing is the Communities Scotland Development Programme. It provides new and improved housing to replace or improve poor quality housing and seeks to help people on low incomes to rent social housing or buy a home in areas where demand exceeds supply or where market prices are beyond the reach of their incomes.</p>

  <p>This new housing is available to meet the most pressing housing need, including that of public sector workers and programmes are developed in close consultation with partners, based upon local housing market and needs analysis. In due course they will be informed by the local housing strategies prepared by each local authority.</p>

  <p>NHS Argyll and Clyde's Code of Conduct for board members is available from the system headquarters at Ross House, Paisley.</p>

  <p>All public bodies covered by the ethical standards regime have to have a Code of Conduct in place that is based on the Model Code of Conduct for Members of Devolved Public Bodies, under the terms of the Ethical Standards in Public Life etc. (Scotland) Act 2000.</p>

  <p>Argyll and Clyde NHS board members are covered by such a code, and have adopted a code that also includes, as an annex, an extract of text on best practice guidance for members of public bodies, published by the Scottish Executive in February 2003.</p>

  <p>This answer addresses this and questions S2W-6881 to S2W-6990 answered on 25 March 2004, in which similar information for the Executive's other portfolios is sought. Whilst the exact figures are not available, the following comparable information may be helpful. As the proportion of budgets spent on staff costs will not change significantly from year to year, the following figures cover 2005-06 only, and are on a cash basis.</p>

  <p>The administration portfolio covers all the Executive's own internal staff costs for all portfolios. Plans for 2005-06 are for &pound;176 million gross or &pound;163 million net of that portfolio's budget to be used for pay and pensions costs. But this covers only the Executive's own staff costs, so that it is not a reflection of how much of the Scottish budget is finally spent on pay. It will for example exclude major elements of budgets spent on staff costs that are classified either as outside the relevant accounting boundaries or fall in the private sector, such as local authority and NHS pay and pay in further and higher Education institutions, and that element of the Executive's funding for concessionary fares that supports private sector drivers' pay.</p>

  <p>We can make estimates of how much of the budget supports staff costs in this widest sense, but cannot provide exact figures, since this depends on decisions by a wide range of bodies, many of whom are fully independent of the Executive. Those estimates suggest that around 50% of the total Scottish budget is spent on pay and other staff costs. The following table shows an estimate of the percentage of each portfolio's budget that supports staff costs in this widest sense. These estimates serve only to give an indication of the relative importance of staff costs in each portfolio &#8211; they are not robust enough to make conversion into precise budgetary figures meaningful.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>*Most spending by local authorities on pay is shown under the relevant portfolio, so for example teachers' pay falls under the Education and Young People portfolio.</p>

  <p>We support bodies such as Envirowise which provide advice to business on waste minimisation. On domestic waste, we are funding a programme by the Waste and Resources Action Programme which includes work on real nappies; home composting and work with retailers. We also support the public awareness work of the Scottish Waste Awareness Group and local authority activities through the Strategic Waste Fund. The National Waste Plan states that the Executive will aim to stop growth in the amount of municipal waste produced by 2010.</p>
