  <p>Rateable values for telecommunications operators are based on the rateable assets in occupation by them. Any variations will be determined by the extent of such assets in the occupation of any particular operator. The majority of operators are valued using the comparative approach where actual rental levels of fibre space are used to set the rateable value. For BT the receipts and expenditure method is used to value their rateable assets due to the size of the network. If this method was used for the smaller operators it would result in a nil or very low rateable value. There is relevant legislation and case law which sets out when it is appropriate to use the receipts and expenditure method and assessors, who are independent from both central and local government, follow this when determining how to reach a rateable value. The valuation of the industry is being looked at afresh in advance of revaluation 2005 and assessors will be holding discussions with all operators to agree an approach and ensure the system is fair to all.</p>

  <p>Glasgow Crossrail proposals were received by the Executive from Strathclyde Passenger Transport executive on 28 October. These proposals will be considered carefully, including their interactions with the Glasgow airport rail link and other rail projects in the Glasgow area arising from the central Scotland transport corridor studies. The latter include: additional car parking at Castlecary station to reduce car dependency in the A80 corridor; improving public transport accessibility by offering increased levels of rail services at Glasgow-Carfin/Holytown, between Motherwell and Stirling via Cumbernauld, and Glasgow-Whifflet, and improving public transport accessibility to jobs between the suburbs of Glasgow and Edinburgh through re-opening the Airdrie-Bathgate railway line.</p>

  <p>A requirement of the works contract will be that two lanes in each direction are made available to traffic at times of peak demand and traffic diversion onto the local network should be minimised.

  <p>It is not anticipated there will be any significant increase in traffic volumes on ancillary roads as two lanes in each direction will be maintained at times of peak demand on the A80 during the works contract.</p>

  <p>: It is anticipated that Horse Wynd will reopen before Christmas. The Holyrood progress group has decided that asphalt should be used in this area instead of traditional granite setts. This is a temporary solution which will allow construction to proceed and the road to re-open while leaving the option of returning to lay the setts once the council has developed a specification which is acceptable to their approved specialist contractors.</p>
