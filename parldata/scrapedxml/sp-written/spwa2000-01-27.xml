  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to introduce such a scheme. The very tight EU pigs regime and State Aid constraints which apply to this sector severely limit the scope for providing any direct aid unless, for example, associated with an exceptional occurrence.</p>

  <p>I believe the debt relief measures which the Republic of Ireland proposes to introduce for some of its pig farmers is based on the very special circumstances of the fire at the Ballymoney pig processing plant.</p>

  <p>Legislation is already in place which prohibits the tethering of calves. For adult cattle, draft Regulations on the Welfare of Farmed Animals will bring into force Council Directive 98/58/EC which sets out general requirements on the welfare of livestock. These Regulations will require that the freedom of movement of animals should not be restricted in such a way as to cause them unnecessary suffering or injury; and that animals continuously or regularly tethered will have to be given the space appropriate to their physiological or ethnological needs. Wide consultation, which included the veterinary profession, has already been undertaken in respect of these draft Regulations.</p>

  <p>OP sheep dips have been withdrawn from the market so that containers, which are safer for the user, can be designed and introduced. It does remain an offence under the Sheep Scab Order 1997 not to treat animals visibly affected by sheep scab and keepers of sheep are responsible for applying effective treatment to animals known to be affected and to take appropriate steps to avoid infestation.</p>

  <p>Breakfast club facilities are already available in a number of schools in Glasgow and other parts of Scotland, and this will provide valuable experience which can be drawn on where further clubs are to be established.

  <p>Section 51(2C) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980, provides that in considering the provision of school transport, education authorities must have regard to the safety of pupils. The provision does not seek to define what constitutes safety in this context. What constitutes a safety risk depends on the circumstances of particular cases and it is for the authorities to consider which circumstances should be taken into account. Ultimately, it would be for the Courts to determine whether an authority had reasonable regard to safety in the circumstances of a case.</p>

  <p>Glasgow benefits from a comprehensive package of measures designed to match people to jobs and jobs to people. New Deal, Skillseekers and Modern Apprenticeships are helping Glasgow&#8217;s young and long-term unemployed into work. These national initiatives will soon be complemented by the start up of Scotland&#8217;s only Employment Zone. Between April 2000 and March 2002, the Zone will help 4,600 people who have been unemployed for 18 months or more and are in receipt of Jobseeker&#8217;s Allowance to get back into the labour market.</p>

Key objectives include: reinforcing the joint Business Location Service which seeks to maintain the city&#8217;s market leadership in telephone-based business; positioning the city as a key inward investment location for software, biotechnology and advanced engineering; and attracting industry to the city by identifying a number of strategic sites for development.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to introduce in Scotland a body similar to the Small Business Administration in the United States of America. Public sector support for small businesses in Scotland is delivered primarily through Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, and we are currently reviewing the existing Enterprise Network in Scotland. We will also give careful consideration to any recommendations which emanate from the inquiry into Scotland&#8217;s local economic development services by the Scottish Parliament&#8217;s Enterprise and Lifelong Learning Committee.

  <p>Wider national economic performance is likely to be the main determinant of trends in small business creation and the prospects for the Scottish economy remain good. However we have also been working closely with Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise to improve the availability, consistency and quality of support for people wishing to start a business.</p>

  <p>A number of positive measures are in hand: improvements to the Scottish Enterprise Network through the establishment, from April, of a single brand in the network and new programmes on start-up and small business support; work by Scottish Enterprise to review the Business Birth Rate Strategy to further encourage entrepreneurship and start-ups &#8211; including from non-traditional sources, like women and youth; and the continuation of local events under the Personal Enterprise Campaign. We have also set increased targets for number of start-ups assisted by the Enterprise Network, and are working to improve the availability of website based business support. New start-ups with growth potential also have access to support from the &pound;12 million Business Growth Fund and, from April, to our new national mentoring scheme &#8211; Business Mentoring Scotland.</p>

  <p>This represents a significant contribution by the Scottish Executive to improve Scotland&#8217;s performance in business creation.</p>

  <p>The public sector currently provides, or contributes to, a range of small business finance schemes in circumstances where a discernible market failure can be identified. Most recently we established the &pound;12 million Business Growth Fund to provide loans to small businesses with potentially viable proposals but unable to access sufficient funds from established sources &#8211; for example because of a lack of sufficient security or a limited track record. Some &pound;2 million in loans has already been offered under the scheme and we will be evaluating its success in meeting this perceived gap in the funding market.</p>

  <p>The need for additional funding measures to support small business is kept under constant review. I remain to be convinced, however, that a case has been made for wider loan funding at below market rates, which may simply serve to displace existing private sector funding with no overall economic benefit.</p>

  <p>Funding <strong> </strong> of &pound;12 million is being provided under the Business Growth Fund over three years (&pound;3 million in 1999-2000; &pound;4 million in 2000-01; &pound;5 million in 2001-02), for loans between &pound;20,000 and &pound;100,000. These funds have been allocated to both Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise who are responsible for the administration of the scheme. &pound;2 million has already been committed under the fund. A decision on whether to extend the funding beyond the initial three years will be made towards the end of that period following a review of the impact of the scheme.</p>

  <p>Small companies can face difficulties in raising sufficient funding due to their size and risk profile. The Business Growth Fund seeks to address this by providing assistance to businesses which are commercially viable and have growth potential, but which are unable to access sufficient funding from established sources.</p>

  <p>The existing water pollution control legislation has been very effective at addressing problems of industrial and sewage pollution, but SEPA has identified the need for additional statutory powers which would secure further water quality improvements.</p>

  <p>A consultation paper will be released today on new regulatory powers for SEPA to prevent and control water pollution. Under the proposed regulations SEPA will be able to serve anti-pollution works notices on polluters or potential polluters requiring them to take action to clean up pollution or reduce the risk of incidents.</p>

  <p>These powers provide a more direct and effective means for SEPA to prevent and mitigate pollution than its existing powers to carry out anti-pollution works itself and then recover the costs from the person responsible.</p>

  <p>The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) reviewed the ban on the use of porcine MBM as recently as November 1999. The Committee concluded that a relaxation of the feed ban in the UK to allow the inclusion of porcine MBM in poultry feed could not be supported on scientific grounds, reasoning that the comprehensive feed ban in place in the UK had been a critical factor in breaking the cycle of infection in the BSE epidemic. The Scottish Executive has accepted this advice.</p>

  <p>The Executive is addressing mental health on a broad front, including the development of services for those who need care and treatment; promoting mental wellbeing by improving life circumstances through our policies on social inclusion, education, employment, the environment and housing; and by modernising the legislative framework.</p>

  <p>As part of the policy development process, the Minister for Health and Community Care and I have arranged a meeting on 31 January of major interests in the field for an exchange of views on mental health issues.</p>

  <p>In the current year, Glasgow City Council&#8217;s capital programme for its own houses amounts to some &pound;55 million of which the Council expects to spend around &pound;20 million on measures which will tackle dampness. Glasgow will also benefit from the new Warm Deal, introduced on 1 July 1999, which provides a comprehensive package of insulation measures up to &pound;500 for low income households. It is the largest scheme of its kind ever in Scotland. Substantial resources have been allocated for the Warm Deal: &pound;38 million for the years 1999-2000&#8211;2001-02. 100,000 households will benefit over the lifetime of this Administration.</p>

  <p>In addition, under our New Housing Partnership initiative, the Council is exploring the options for a transfer of its council housing into community ownership. This would release substantial resources to improve the stock and tackle dampness. To date, Glasgow has been awarded new housing partnership resources of &pound;15.5 million. A further &pound;15 million is earmarked for 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises the particular problems facing Glasgow. We are already providing over &pound;1.8 billion from the Scottish Block this year to various agencies in the city.

  <p>We all know that there are no quick fixes to the cycle of disadvantage that includes unemployment, low skills and poverty, but through its participation in the Glasgow Alliance and its support for the city&#8217;s Social Inclusion Partnerships, the Executive is committed to a long term programme of concerted action. This includes action to address homelessness, drug misuse and poor health, to promote economic development, to tackle low educational achievement, to expand childcare, and provide a radical solution to Glasgow&#8217;s acute housing problems. By joining up and delivering on these policies, we aim to create a framework within which all Glaswegians have a decent quality of life and the opportunity to prosper.</p>

  <p>*This figure is not the same as the previous year&#8217;s total because the annual level of CPS payments depends on the content of the plans.</p>

  <p>Equivalent schemes in operation prior to the launch of the CPS in 1997 were the Habitats Scheme (HS) and Heather Moorland Scheme (HMS). These were closed to new applications at the end of 1996.</p>

  <p>The Standards Committee&#8217;s report on the <i>Regulation of Cross-Party Groups</i> , which sets out the regulations, was published on 30 November 1999. In keeping with normal practice, the report was placed on the Parliament&#8217;s website on that date. Most of the partner libraries in each of the 73 Scottish Parliamentary constituencies provide public access to Internet facilities.</p>

  <p>Details of Committee reports also appear in the Business Bulletin and in the publication <i>What&#8217;s Happening in the Scottish Parliament</i> (WHISP), copies of which are available for public inspection in many of the partner libraries and for purchase in Stationery Office outlets. Journalists were notified prior to the publication of the report.</p>

  <p>The Regulations on Cross-Party Groups were the subject of a debate in the full Parliament on 15 December 1999. Advance notice of that debate appeared in the Business Bulletin and in WHISP and the record of the debate appeared in the Official Report for that day. Copies of the Official Report are also available for public inspection in many of the partner libraries and for purchase in Stationery Office outlets.</p>

  <p>Parliamentary staff are currently looking at the possibility of producing a fact sheet on Cross-Party Groups to be made publicly available in the Parliament&#8217;s Visitor Centre.</p>
