  <p>In-service training may involve workshops on specific issues. The National Autistic Society conducted such a workshop in October 2001 in Dundee.</p>

  <p>In the Data Protection Act 1998, stricter conditions apply to the processing of sensitive data, which includes information relating to health. The Executive&rsquo;s current policy is that figures should not be disclosed where the relevant population is less than or equal to five and greater than or equal to one, due to the potential for identification of individuals.</p>

  <p>The tables requested in the original question (S1W-21388) were at such a detailed level that disclosing a number of the figures would have breached this policy.</p>

  <p>Officials from the department would be happy to meet with you to discuss data collection and the information that is available.</p>

  <p>Implementation of the E-Commerce Directive was required before 17 January 2002. The Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) is responsible for implementation generally in Great Britain. The DTI announced on 14 December 2001 its intention to publish and consult on draft implementing regulations early this year. The UK Government anticipates that implementation will take place during the summer. The Executive is examining whether any Scots law prevents the conclusion of contracts by electronic means. This process is under way in the context of the existing exercise to promulgate orders under section 8 of the Electronic Communications Act 2000 to authorise or facilitate electronic communications more generally.</p>

  <p>The latest published statistics for Scotland on gun-related crimes and deaths show a marked downward trend between 1991 and 2000.

  <p>The answer given to question S1W-21399 assumed that "full financial support" should be taken to mean the maximum amount to which any particular individual was entitled.</p>

  <p>The answer explained that the full support to which any student is entitled will depend upon personal circumstances and family income. Applications for support are based on self-declaration of these details by the student or their parents.</p>

  <p>At present, students are only required to provide the information essential for those elements of support for which they choose to apply. Information on the full financial support available to each individual student could, therefore, only be obtained by requiring all applicants to provide details beyond those required for their particular application, including details of income even when the application is for non-means tested elements of support alone, and to confirm whether or not they meet the eligibility criteria for any of the supplementary grants, even when they choose not to apply for these. We have no plans to ask applicants to provide this additional information.</p>

  <p>The Higher Education Statistics Agency collects information on the first destinations of graduates from higher education courses provided in higher education institutions. The Scottish Further Education Funding Council collects similar information on graduates from higher education courses provided in further education colleges.</p>

  <p>These collections provide data on employment, classified by both the standard industrial classification (SIC) and the standard occupational classification (SOC). To produce the information requested requires the cross-referencing of these SIC and SOC classifications against subject groups, which are often very broad.</p>

  <p>This responsibility is clearly one which is shared between the Executive, other public bodies such as Scottish Enterprise, and employers. The Executive is also working with the UK Government to publicise changes introduced by the Home Office from October 2001 which will make it easier for international students completing degrees in the UK to move from student status to employed status.</p>

  <p>Health boards&rsquo; unified budgets include provision for the cost of prescribed medicines and are set to allow for the introduction of new medicines and the greater use of existing therapies. As these funds form part of their unified budget, health boards have the flexibility to decide locally how to use them.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-17830 by Susan Deacon on 27 September 2001, how many people are currently waiting for an out-patient appointment at the Scottish National Sleep Centre at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh; how many patients on average are assessed at the centre each month for the provision of a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) unit, and how much funding the centre (a) has received in (i) 1999-2000 and (ii) 2000-01 and (b) will receive in 2001-02 from Lothian Health Board.</p>

  <p>The total number of out-patients waiting for an out-patient appointment at the Scottish National Sleep Centre at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, from all health boards, is approximately 1,000. The number of Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) assessments carried out each month, involving overnight studies, is approximately 50. Not all patients whose cases are studied in this way are assessed as suitable for CPAP treatment.</p>

  <p>Funding by NHS Lothian in 2000-01 for the service was &#163;172,000. In 2001-02 this was increased by &#163;109,000, following the review of the service in June 2001. Final details of next year&rsquo;s funding have not yet been agreed. In addition, the National Sleep Centre receives substantial funding from a number of other NHS boards.</p>

  <p>Interpretation of the term will depend upon the particular context in which it is employed. Where the term is used, it will, as is always the case, be the Executive&rsquo;s intention to follow up the issue without any avoidable delay.

  <p>The Guidance for Local Authorities issued in June 1991 under The Children Act 1989 sets out the current minimum staff:child ratios in early years settings. From 1 April 2002, the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care will take over responsibility for the regulation and inspection of early years settings including the setting of adult:child ratios.</p>

  <p>In both cases, subject to the required ratios, staffing of pre-school services is a matter for employers, whether local authorities or operators in the private or voluntary sector.</p>

  <p>Planning is well in hand to set up the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care (The Care Commission) with effect from 1 April. It will regulate all care services, including those in pre-five education. Following consultation we issued a plan to all local authorities in November 2001. This set out how a smooth and trouble free transition should take place. We are about to issue a leaflet to providers of services telling them more about these new arrangements.</p>

  <p>The biennial survey of school boards, last conducted by the Scottish Executive in May 2000, provides details of the number and percentage of schools with school boards and the number of elections contested. The latest data available for school board elections is therefore for the election which took place between September and December 1999. Data for the most recent elections, which took place in late 2001, is not yet available.</p>

  <p>Table 1 provides details of the number and percentage of primary schools with school boards and the number and percentage of school board elections contested, broken down by local authority area, as at May 2000.

  <p>Since academic year 1999-2000, there have not been any delays in processing applications for the Disabled Students&rsquo; Allowance. The target of 21 days for processing fully completed applications is being met and in many cases exceeded. In certain cases, the process of putting equipment in place can take longer if a student needs to be assessed for technology needs by one of the National Federation of Access Centres.</p>

  <p>Disabled Students&rsquo; Allowance (DSA) was extended to distance-learning students for the first time in academic year 2001-02. Students have a responsibility to advise the Student Awards Agency for Scotland (SAAS) of any change in circumstances that might affect their support entitlement. SAAS is not aware of any DSA students who have withdrawn from or deferred their course in academic year 2001-02.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-21397 by Ms Wendy Alexander on 18 January 2002, why information on the number of students attending university or further education colleges who applied for a student loan, either through the Awards Agency for Scotland or the Students Loans Company Ltd, could only be obtained at disproportionate cost and whether the information could be provided were individual parliamentary questions on separate aspects of the subject lodged.</p>

  <p>The answer given to question S1W-21397 set out the background to the various data sets collected by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland and the Student Loans Company.</p>

  <p>To answer the question on the number of loans applied for would require a complete crosscheck of the two organisation's records for the past five years, which could only be undertaken at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>The previous answer provided the information sought on numbers of loans made and the average amount paid.</p>

  <p>There are a variety of measures of the number of Scottish students, including or excluding post graduates, part-time students, Scottish domiciled students studying in Scotland or elsewhere, non-Scottish domiciled students studying in Scotland and so on. In the absence of a specific definition in the question, percentage figures were not provided.</p>

  <p>Officials from the department would be happy to meet with you to discuss data collection and the information that is available.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-21398 by Ms Wendy Alexander on 18 January 2002, why information on the average period students spend in default on their student loans and the average charge applicable to these defaults is not available or could only be obtained at disproportionate cost and whether it will, from now, collate this information centrally, detailing the reasons behind its decision.</p>

  <p>Information on individual student loan accounts is held by the Student Loans Company. The analysis requested could only be obtained by examining the loan accounts of each individual borrower who had been in default. The company advises that such an exercise could only be undertaken at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to collate this information centrally, as this would require the Executive to hold duplicate records to those of the Student Loans Company.</p>

  <p>The General Teaching Council for Scotland is an Advisory Non-Departmental Public Body the structure of which was comprehensively reviewed in 1999. There are currently no plans for further review.</p>

  <p>The scheme to elect members of the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) was approved by ministers in advance of the 2001 election of teachers to the council. The next election of the GTCS will be in 2005 and ministers will approve any changes to the election scheme at that time.</p>

  <p>I am publishing today a consultation paper: <i>The Future for Scotland&rsquo;s Waters: Proposals for Legislation</i> . I am placing copies in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre. I am also placing an analysis of the responses to our first consultation paper, <i>Rivers, Lochs, Coasts: The Future for Scotland&rsquo;s Waters</i> (Bib. number 14576), published in June last year, on the Scottish Executive website and in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The consultation paper makes proposals for the water environment provisions of the Water Environment and Water Services Bill and lays the foundation for a modernised approach to protecting and enhancing Scotland&rsquo;s waters. The need to involve, take account of and balance all interests will be a cornerstone of this new approach. We need to hear the views of all those with an interest if we are to get the bill right for Scotland. We started the debate when we published <i>Rivers, Lochs, Coasts</i>. This paper is another significant step along the road to the bill.</p>

  <p>The A81 is a local road and, as such, the responsibility of East Dunbartonshire and Stirling Councils as the local roads authorities for the sections of the road that lie within their areas. This is therefore a matter for the councils to address.</p>

  <p>It is for each council to establish its expenditure priorities within unhypothecated resources available to it. It would not be appropriate for ministers to intervene in such circumstances.</p>

  <p>However, I am aware that Gala Youth Project was part of the bid put forward by Scottish Borders for resources allocated to drugs projects under the Changing Children's Services Fund. We understand that the full funding allocated by the Executive for the first year has been passed on to the Gala Youth Project. Officials will be seeking clarification from the council on the use of the resources to be allocated in years two and three of the project.</p>
