  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Patient registration may have lapsed on more than one occasion.</p>

  <p>2. Patients may have re-registered subsequently with the same or a different dentist.</p>

  <p>Under their NHS terms of service, if a dentist intends to withdraw from an NHS arrangement, whether with or without the patient's consent, the patient is entitled to receive written notice from the dentist or the NHS board/Primary Care NHS Trust depending on the circumstances.</p>

  <p>Once a patient's registration has lapsed it is for the dentist, as an independent contractor, to decide if he/she is prepared to enter into a new continuing care arrangement with the patient.</p>

  <p>Proposals are currently being developed to accelerate and extend access to broadband services across Scotland and to increase take-up of existing and projected services. This will include separate infrastructure programmes in the Highlands and Islands and the Scottish Enterprise area, supported by generic marketing and a business incentive package to encourage take-up. Consultations are taking place with a wide range of stakeholders about how these three projects will be taken forward and no final decisions have yet been taken on the breakdown of expenditure in the different geographical areas.</p>

  <p>The Electoral Commission, which is independent, has responsibility for running the public awareness campaign for the Scottish Parliament elections. The Scottish Executive has this responsibility with regard to local elections as these fall outside the remit of the commission.</p>

  <p>The commission and Executive are working together in the run up to 1 May to encourage increased voter participation. The detail of the joint campaign has still to be finalised but it is expected that the Executive will contribute about &#163;230,000 to the advertising costs for newspapers, poster sites and television for the local government element. I understand that the commission has appointed St Luke's advertising agency to handle the campaign. Questions on the costs of the Scottish Parliament elections element of the campaign are for the commission.</p>

  <p>The Agriculture and Fisheries Council agreed that the Total Allowable Catch for sandeels in the North Sea for 2003 should be 918,000 tonnes and that the EC share of this should be 863,000 tonnes. Of this, 814,067 tonnes were allocated to Denmark and 17,794 tonnes were allocated to the UK.</p>

  <p>The Council further agreed that sandeel vessels should be restricted to a maximum of 23 days fishing per month within the regulated area and that the closure of the Wee Bankie sandeel fishery off the east coast of Scotland should be continued in 2003.</p>

  <p>The negotiating timetable for the new general medical services (GMS) contract was extended to 21 February to allow sufficient time for negotiations to take place. Ministers in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are fully committed to the new GMS contract negotiations process and to the implementation of a new contract as soon as is practicable, assuming agreement can be reached.</p>

  <p>We will continue to support the NHS Confederation and General Practitioner Committee in seeking to reach agreement and are making every effort to that end. We have no wish whatsoever to delay an agreement being reached but it is important to get matters right rather than just do them quickly.</p>

  <p>As was stated in the framework document for the new contract published in April 2002, we are committed to phased implementation of the new contract taking place from April 2003.</p>

  <p>All NHS boards have Health Promotion Departments which employ staff whose aim is to build the capacity of the public, business and voluntary sectors to promote the health of communities and individuals. These staff have various responsibilities of which health improvement is one.</p>

  <p>In addition NHS boards, local authorities and the Scottish Executive are jointly funding health improvement posts based in each local authority area. 31 of these posts are currently filled. The responsibilities of these postholders are to support and contribute to the development of joint local Health Improvement Plans, facilitate their implementation through service planning and delivery in each local authority area, work with council services to develop and support their contribution to the health improvement agenda and to facilitate partnership working between local authorities and others, particularly NHS boards, in ways which will contribute to the joint health improvement agenda.</p>

  <p>&#163;27 million was made available to local authorities to assist with implementation of Part 1 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 (homelessness provisions). Specifically local authorities are required to apply the funding to increase the provision of temporary accommodation; to increase and improve the provision of advice and assistance, and to develop and deliver local homelessness strategies. Funding was allocated over three years, from 2001-02 to 2003-04. The table sets out the allocations to each local authority. The funding was allocated according to a formula, agreed with COSLA, based on the level of homeless applications receive by each authority. A small amount of funding was retained for later allocation (as agreed with COSLA) following councils' further assessment of need.</p>

  <p>Based on the guidelines given about the purposes of the funding, local authorities have drawn up local outcome agreements which set out the outcomes authorities expect to achieve. These outcomes are all in line with the purposes set out above.</p>

  <p>Quality Meat Scotland is working with major lamb producers to support long-term profitable opportunities for quality Scottish lamb products. Whilst we would strongly prefer to see meat and carcasses exported, the clear legal position confirmed by two European Court judgements, is that the trade in live animals for slaughter is legal and restricting or banning it could not be defended in law.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>In the answer given to question S1W-31082, the SPS agreed to make arrangements for the publication of its contracts for the provision of education services in prisons. I also refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-31444 on 22 November 2002, which explained that the SPS was currently in discussion with Medacs Health Care about the publication of the contract for medical services and that, on conclusion of that piece of work, it will commence discussions with local authorities on the publication of contracts for the provision of social work contracts. These tasks are sequenced, and once this work is completed we will commence work on the publication of contracts for education provision.</p>

  <p>I can report that work on the Medacs Health Care contract is nearing completion and it will be published soon.</p>

  <p>The regulation and safety of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA).</p>

  <p>The MCA has advised that as with any effective medicine or vaccine, influenza vaccine is not without side effects in some recipients. The risks and side effects associated with immunisation with influenza vaccine are stated in the product information for the vaccine. The recommendation of the Department of Health, outlined in its publication <i>Immunisation Against Infectious Disease (1996)</i>, is that the vaccine should not be given during pregnancy unless there is a specific indication. It is the responsibility of the prescribing physician to weigh the possible risks of vaccination against the possible risks of clinical infection with influenza virus during pregnancy.</p>

  <p>Not all influenza vaccines used in the UK contain thiomersal (also referred to as thimerosal) in the final product. With the exception of hypersensitivity reactions, there is no evidence that exposure to levels of thiomersal contained in influenza vaccine causes harm to adults or children. Similarly, with regard to vaccination of pregnant women, there is no evidence that the thiomersal content of influenza vaccine causes harm to the developing foetus.</p>

  <p>Manufacturers are being encouraged to phase out the use of thiomersal in vaccines, as a purely precautionary measure. It is anticipated that thiomersal-free vaccines will be considered for provision in the routine childhood immunisation programme after they have been licensed for use in the UK and have demonstrated that they are as effective in protecting children against the real risk presented by vaccine-preventable diseases as the vaccines that are currently used.</p>

  <p>The Committee on Safety of Medicines has advised that, with the exception of hypersensitivity reactions that typically include skin rashes or soft tissue swelling at the site of injection, there is no evidence of harm from the levels of thiomersal (which contains ethylmercury) contained in vaccines. Further studies have supported this finding. The benefits of immunisation with thiomersal-containing vaccines outweigh any potential risks of vaccination.</p>

  <p>The Committee on Safety of Medicines has advised that, with the exception of hypersensitivity reactions that typically include skin rashes or local swelling at the site of injection, there is no evidence of harm from the levels of thiomersal (which contains ethylmercury) contained in vaccines. Further studies, and the advice of the World Health Organisation, are consistent with this finding. The benefits of immunisation outweigh any potential risks of vaccination due to sensitivity from thiomersal.</p>

  <p>However, to reduce avoidable exposure to mercury in general, it has been agreed, on a European-wide basis, that even though there is no evidence of toxicity, as a purely precautionary measure, thiomersal should be phased out over time. The Executive, the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) endorse this decision.</p>

  <p>Manufacturers are being encouraged to phase out the use of thiomersal in vaccines as a purely precautionary measure. It is anticipated that thiomersal-free vaccines will be considered for provision in the routine childhood immunisation programme after they have been licensed for use in the UK and have demonstrated that they are as effective in protecting children against the real risk presented by vaccine-preventable diseases as the vaccines that are currently used.</p>

  <p>The only vaccines, used routinely in the childhood immunisation programme, that contain thiomersal in the final products, are the diphtheria, tetanus and wholecell pertussis (DTwP) vaccine and the combined diphtheria and tetanus vaccine (Td). The current expert advice is that DTwP is the most effective of DTP vaccines currently available in the UK.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to take part in a pilot scheme to ascertain the number of households in the Glasgow City Council area that have lead pipes. The recent Scotland-wide study, undertaken by Scottish Water, has identified areas where there are likely to be a significant number of properties with lead plumbing. This study included the Glasgow City Council area.</p>

  <p>The results of the study will allow Scottish Water to take action to ensure that the new, tighter standard for lead contained in the EC Drinking Water Directive is complied with by the due date of 25 December 2003.</p>
