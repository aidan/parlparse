  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when all pending decisions regarding the future of acute hospital accident and emergency and maternity services in Western Isles Hospital, Caithness General Hospital, Belford Hospital, Perth Royal Infirmary, Forth Park Hospital, Queen Margaret Hospital, Stirling Royal Infirmary, the Vale of Leven Hospital, Falkirk Royal Infirmary, Monklands Hospital, Stobhill Hospital, the Western Infirmary, the Victoria Infirmary, Wishaw General Hospital, Hairmyres Hospital, Ayr Hospital and the Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy will be made and whether the final approval by the Minister for Health and Community Care of these decisions will be given for all at the same time before the Executive comments on the Kerr report and, if not, on what date it expects to be able to take a ministerial decision on these services.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are responsible for determining the future pattern of accident and emergency and maternity services in their areas in the context of their own service strategies, provided these strategies are consistent with national policy and guidance.</p>

  <p>Boards must consult publicly and seek ministerial approval for any proposals that involve significant service change. I have made it clear that proposals for service change must also be consistent with the national framework set out in Professor Kerr&rsquo;s report <em>Building a Health Service Fit for the Future. </em>The Executive is at present finalising its detailed response to the report and will publish it shortly. We do not expect NHS boards to approve any new plans for service change until they have tested their proposals against it. The only exceptions would be where I am advised that there is an imminent risk to sustaining clinical safety.</p>

  <p>Local strategies involving accident and emergency and/or maternity services at a number of the hospitals listed in your question have already been subject to consultation and have received ministerial approval where appropriate. Service proposals at some others are still subject to consultation and Ministerial approval. The timing of final decisions on these is likely to be different depending on NHS boards&rsquo; consideration of the Executive&rsquo;s response to the Kerr report and the timing of their consultations and their submission of proposals for Ministerial approval.</p>
