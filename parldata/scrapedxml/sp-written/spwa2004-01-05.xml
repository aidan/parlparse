  <p>It is the responsibility of Scotland's local authorities to monitor and control pigeons within their areas, and to take action where appropriate to address pigeon related problems.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have a statutory duty of pest control and there is nothing to prevent measures being taken by them where there is genuine evidence of pigeons presenting a threat to human health and safety. Ultimately, it is for local authorities to determine whether a genuine public health or safety risk exists and to take appropriate action within the context of current legislation. They can also take action, without restriction, to limit the amount of waste food and refuse found around the streets and public places of towns and cities if that is considered to be a cause of such problems.</p>

  <p>The Environmental Protection (Scotland) Act 1990 imposes a duty upon local authorities to address statutory nuisance issues.</p>

  <p>The <em>National Waste Plan</em> , published in February 2003, makes clear that, regardless of diversion targets, there will continue to be a need for landfill for the foreseeable future as part of a strategy for disposing of those wastes which are not recovered or recycled. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency is currently undertaking an analysis of landfill capacity.</p>

  <p>The <em>National Waste Plan </em>also outlines the alternative methods of disposal which the Scottish Executive proposes. The plan is available at:</p>

  <p>The form the regulatory regime takes depends on the activity being carried out. In the case of disposal of sewage sludge, spreading on agricultural land is governed by the Sludge (Use in Agriculture) Regulations 1989, land reclamation or improvement by the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994, and landfilling by the Landfill (Scotland) Regulations 2003, all as amended. There are other regimes applying to discharge to water and to incineration. All these regimes have provisions to protect the environment, tailored to the kind of activity with which the regime is dealing. Similarly, the criteria for licensing operators depend on the applicable regulatory regime.</p>

  <p>Decisions about the appropriate regime to apply to any particular activity, and about any conditions to be fulfilled in respect of those regimes, are an operational matter for the Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>

  <p>In 1996 the Royal Commission on Environmental Protection published its report <em>Sustainable Use of Soil </em> (Col. 1365), which included examination of the transmission of pathogens from sewage sludge, or biosolids. This was reviewed by the commission in March 2002, and the review is available at:</p>

  <p>In 1998 the Environment Sub-Committee of the Select Committee on the Environment, Transport and the Regions published its <em>Inquiry into Sewage Treatment and Disposal</em> (Col. 4023). This is available at:</p>

  <p>Also in 1998, the UK Government commissioned the Water Research Centre (WRc) to review the scientific evidence underpinning controls on the agricultural use of sludge (DETR 4415/3 and DETR 4454/4). The results were published by the WRc as <em>Review of the Scientific Evidence Relating to the Controls on the Agricultural Use of Sewage Sludge</em> (ISBN 1 898920 37 0).</p>

  <p>Finally, in the same year, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) published its <em>Strategic Review of Organic Waste Spread on Land</em>, which includes consideration of sewage sludge. The review is available on SEPA's website at:</p>
