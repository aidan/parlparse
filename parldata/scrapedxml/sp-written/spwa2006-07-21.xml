  <p>The difference between the two figures provided for parliamentary questions S2W-14287 and S2W-25993 is caused by the fact that they were answered using different sources and using different definitions. Different sources were used due to the differences in the questions asked in the two parliamentary questions.</p>

  <p>The data used in the answer to parliamentary question S2W-14287 were taken from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) which is a survey of individuals in the UK looking at various socio-economic issues. This source was used as the parliamentary question requested data on employment in the manufacturing industry which includes employees, those who are self employed, unpaid family workers and those on a government training scheme. The LFS is the preferred source for data on employment.</p>

  <p>The data used in the answer to parliamentary question S2W-25993 were taken from the Annual Business Inquiry (ABI) which is an annual survey of businesses. This source was used as the parliamentary question requested data on those employed within the manufacturing industry. The ABI provides information on employees and is the preferred source for data on employees by industry. The ABI does not collect information on self employment.</p>

  <p>All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament's website the search facility for which can be at:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answers to questions S2W-14287 by Mr Jim Wallace on 2 March 2005 and S2W-25993 by Nicol Stephen on 8 June 2006, what the level of manufacturing employment was in (a) 1979, (b) 1997, (c) 1999, (d) 2004 and (e) 2005.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-07-21.S2W-27257.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80115" speakername="Nicol Stephen" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0721.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>The following table reports the level of manufacturing employment in Scotland in 1979 and for the spring quarter in 1997, 1999, 2004 and 2005.</p>

  <p>The manufacturing employment estimate for 1979 is not directly comparable with the estimates for 1997, 1999, 2004 and 2005 due to changes in the definition of manufacturing. The 1979 classification of manufacturing activity was broader and included activities which would now be classified in other industry groups. For example, in 1979 individuals working in vehicle repairs were categorised in the manufacturing sector whereas in 1997 they would fall into the service sector.</p>

  <p>The spring quarter runs from March to May in each year. These figures are estimated from the Labour Force Survey which is carried out by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).</p>

  <p>1. Includes capital expenditure funded from current revenue. Over the period, the main element of local authority capital expenditure on local authority housing was for improvements to properties. Capital expenditure also includes expenditure on the acquisition of land.</p>

  <p>2. Includes units transferred to registered social landlords from local authorities, additions through new build (net of right to buy) and capital costs associated with upgrading new houses.</p>

  <p>3. From 2003-04, expenditure on stock transferred to housing associations in Glasgow, Dumfries and Galloway and Borders is recorded under housing association expenditure.</p>

  <p>The preferred source for earnings estimates is the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings (ASHE), which is carried out by the Office for National Statistics.</p>

  <p>Table 1 shows the estimated number of employee jobs earning exactly the National Minimum Wage (NMW) by age group for Scotland. The NMW was extended to cover those under 18 in October 2004, ASHE results are for April each year, and therefore 16 to 17 year olds earning the NMW are only considered for the 2005 ASHE results.</p>

  <p>The estimates in the table are based on a sample survey, and as such, are subject to sampling error and disclosure control. Estimates which are disclosive (based on less than three employees) have been suppressed. Estimates are not available by local authority area due to the small sample sizes involved.</p>

  <p>1. The estimates are based on the hourly pay excluding overtime and shift premium payments.</p>

  <p>2. The estimates are based on a sample survey, and as such, are subject to sampling error.</p>

  <p>3. To improve coverage and hence make the survey more representative, supplementary information was collected from the 2004 ASHE survey onwards.
