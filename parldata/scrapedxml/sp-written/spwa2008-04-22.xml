  <p>It is already a legal requirement, and has been since July 2006, that clinical dental technicians (also known as denturists), who fit and make dentures, must be registered with the General Dental Council (GDC) in order to practise. Some have already registered. Regulation and registration, whose prime purpose is to enhance patient safety, allows clinical dental technicians to work within the law. In the past those fitting dentures were committing a criminal offence, as only dentists or persons acting under the supervision of dentists were able to do so.</p>

  <p>The 2006 legislation also requires dental technicians, who make but do not fit dentures, to register with the GDC by 31 July 2008. They have had since July 2006 to register on the basis of GDC approved experience and/or qualifications. From 31 July 2008 they can only register on the basis of approved qualifications. The GDC has carried out a widespread publicity campaign to ensure that dental technicians register before the deadline.</p>

  <p>There are a number of Scottish courses leading to the qualifications required for registration as a dental technician. It is also recognised that there are dental technicians who wish to register as clinical dental technicians so that they can fit as well as make dentures. A Scottish course has been developed for approval by the GDC.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have issued screening decision on 14 projects under the Environmental Impact Assessment (Agriculture) (Scotland) Regulations 2006, and the Environmental Impact Assessment (Uncultivated Land and Semi-Natural Areas) (Scotland) Regulations 2002 which they replaced. For 12 of these projects it was decided that there were no significant environmental effects and the applicants were notified appropriately. It was decided that the remaining two projects were &quot;relevant projects&quot; likely to have a significant effect on the environment and accordingly could not be carried out without consent of the Scottish ministers. If those projects are to proceed Environmental Statements are required in order to assess environmental impact and to determine if consent can be given. Environmental Statements are awaited from these applicants and consequently no consent decisions have been made.</p>

  <p>Rural Payments and Inspection Directorate (RPID) are responsible for the day-to-day operation of the regulations. It is for land managers to ensure that their farming actions comply with the regulations. RPID will offer advice and guidance on whether proposals fall within the scope of the regulations. An offence only occurs if works are covered by the regulations and the requirements of the regulations are not complied with. The regulations provide for powers of entry and inspection of land for the purposes of determining whether an offence under the regulations has occurred. Provision is also available to serve a stop notice to ensure that unauthorised works are stopped with immediate effect. The Scottish ministers may also serve a reinstatement notice upon persons responsible for committing an offence under the regulations requiring them to reinstate the relevant land to the condition it was before the project was commenced.</p>

  <p>Details of proposals submitted for screening can be viewed on the public register maintained under regulation 7(7) (b) of the 2006 Regulations on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p>Information on ethnic origin is not collected comprehensively on central statistical returns. Primary and secondary care databases have the facility to capture information on ethnic origin but recording is not a mandatory requirement of these databases.

  <p>Following the work of the Falls Prevention Group, the Scottish Government published guidance earlier this year for health boards, community health partnerships and others on actions to prevent falls by older people and improve bone health. The guidance is available on the Scottish Government website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/OlderPeopleCare/fallsgroup" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Health/care/OlderPeopleCare/fallsgroup</a>.</p>

  <p>Research evidence indicates that up to 30% of falls amongst community-based older people could be prevented through comprehensive multidisciplinary assessment.</p>

  <p>Guidance on the prevention of falls is available to the NHS in HDL (2007) 13:</p>

  <p>Recording and investigating the circumstances of falls and subsequent action is the responsibility of NHS boards. The guidance requires NHS boards to ensure protocols are in place to ensure the risk of falls in hospital is minimised; to establish a systematic process for the management and prevention of falls; to facilitate education and training for staff; and to ensure the accurate recording and monitoring of incidents. Every NHS board is required to appoint a falls prevention co-ordinator to develop a joined-up approach for minimising the likelihood of falls.</p>

  <p>The work-programme, and associated resources of the Fair for All &ndash; Disability and Fair for All &ndash; Race projects, transferred to NHS Health Scotland&rsquo;s new equalities and planning directorate in April 2008. We are committed to ensuring that.</p>

  <p>Each of the six Fair for All projects was asked to consult the communities they represented to explain the arrangements being put in place when their work was transferred to the new directorate. These consultations were in addition to those carried out by NHS Health Scotland with NHS boards and other key stakeholders across Scotland, including the Disability Rights Commission, the Commission for Racial Equality, and latterly the Equality and Human Rights Commission.</p>

  <p>The output of the various Fair for All projects clearly showed that inequalities in health are compounded by people&rsquo;s individual life circumstances. An aim of establishing the new directorate was therefore to give clear strategic accountability for the delivery of the Fair for All agenda by embedding it within NHS Health Scotland&rsquo;s wider health inequalities functions.</p>

The directorate has also begun meetings with a range of national organisations to build on the productive relations they established with the individual Fair for All projects.</p>

  <p>Yes. Under the terms of the management statement governing the relationship between the Scottish Government and Highlands and Islands Enterprise, any proposal by Highlands and Islands Enterprise to pay any redundancy or compensation for loss of office, requires the approval of Scottish Government officials.</p>

  <p>Once official approval was granted on 5 February 2008, the implementation of the proposal as a selective voluntary severance scheme became an operational matter for Highlands and Islands Enterprise.</p>

  <p>Data on specific selected healthcare associated infections (HAIs) were only routinely collected following the issue of Health Department Letter HDL (2001) 57 in 2001, and the information sought is not held in the format requested. It is also the case that there are no accurate or complete historical records available in Scotland to indicate whether an HAI (as opposed to a specific individual organism) was the cause of death, or whether the deceased contracted the infection in hospital.</p>

  <p>However, a range of reports on key infections are routinely published in Scotland which help to inform the drive and the focus of our HAI agenda. These are: quarterly rates of <em>Staphylococcus aureus</em> bacteraemias (last published on 1 April 2008); quarterly rates of <em>Clostridium difficile</em> (last published on 2 April 2008) and annual rates of Surgical Site Infections (last published on 5 March 2008). All publications are available from the Health Protection Scotland (HPS) website:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/pubs/index.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.hps.scot.nhs.uk/pubs/index.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>In addition, the thorough Scottish HAI National Point Prevalence Survey published on 11 July 2007 provides detailed information on the estimated prevalence of HAI in Scotland and of the specific types of HAI in adult inpatients in acute and community hospitals in Scotland. The findings in the survey provided the basis of our new HAI Delivery Plan, which was put in place on 1 April. The survey is also available from the HPS website.</p>

  <p>Many of the people who currently work overtime do not live in households that are in the top income decile. Under the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposals for a local income tax, average households in each of the first nine income deciles will pay less.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to confirm that following a rigorous review of the proposal The Scottish Government has now granted approval of the Outline Business Case for the New Southern Hospitals Project in Glasgow. The proposed investment will completely redevelop the Southern General Hospital and would also provide a new state of the art Children&rsquo;s Hospital for the West of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The total capital cost of the project is &pound;842 million. In accordance with the preferred option in the Outline Business Case the Scottish Government has agreed that project will be funded through the use of public capital. In considering the options for funding this project The Scottish Government has sought to ensure that the project is deliverable, affordable, sustainable and represents best value for money for the taxpayer.</p>

  <p>The sources of funding are &pound;270 million from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde allocations and capital receipts, &pound;20 million from locally held endowments with the balance of &pound;552 million being provided by the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>Published guidance on the management of waiting lists makes it clear that where for medical reasons a patient becomes unavailable while they are waiting for treatment, and is likely to be unavailable for more than seven days, then the patient&rsquo;s waiting times clock will be stopped and re-started when the patient becomes available again.</p>

  <p>The guidance further states that patients who are unavailable for treatment for medical reasons should be reviewed within 13 weeks. If no end date to the unavailability is known at that review, then the health care professional responsible for the patient&rsquo;s treatment will decide whether the patient should remain on the waiting list or be returned to the care of their GP. This decision can be made only by the health care professional responsible for treating the patient, who will not remove a patient if it is clinically inappropriate to do so.</p>

  <p>Arrangements for discussing a patient&rsquo;s care and treatment with them, including their medical availability for treatment, are matters for the clinicians concerned. It would be good practice for the responsible clinician to discuss with a patient future arrangements for managing their condition, including any decision to return the patient to the care of their GP.</p>

  <p>The question is relevant to patients who are on a waiting list for hospital treatment and who become unavailable for treatment for medical reasons. Decisions about how best to manage the patient&rsquo;s medical condition are clinical matters for the healthcare professional responsible for that patient&rsquo;s treatment. The responsible health care professional will normally be the hospital consultant or another appropriate member of the clinical team, who will decide whether to discuss management of the patient&rsquo;s case further, taking account of the individual circumstances of the case.</p>

  <p>Published national guidance on the management of waiting lists makes it clear that the patient and the patient&rsquo;s GP should be informed if a decision is made to return a patient to the care of the GP. The GP can of course decide to re-refer the patient.</p>

  <p>A decision to return a patient to the care of their GP can be made only by the health care professional responsible for treating the patient, who will not remove a patient from a waiting list if it is clinically inappropriate to do so.</p>

  <p>Support for the redevelopment of the Ravenscraig site has been provided mainly by Scottish Enterprise. As such, the role that will be played in phase two will be an operational matter for that organisation. I shall ask the Chief Executive of Scottish Enterprise to write to you in this regard.</p>

  <p>I was pleased to note the recent positive press coverage of the project and recognise that it is important to have good lines of communication in relation to this important project. That is why I have recently agreed to host a meeting involving relevant stakeholders, to discuss a range of issues relating to the project. This meeting is likely to take place in May 2008.</p>
