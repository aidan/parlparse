  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of recently published research by the University of Reading showing that children with autistic spectrum disorder have a higher incidence of the Clostridium histolyticum group (Clostridium clusters I and II) of bacteria than healthy children, what steps it will take to ensure comprehensive bowel examination of all autistic children whose parents request it to establish the extent of their gastroenterological problems and which dietary modulations will now be made accessible to parents to improve the gut microflora profile of autistic children.</p>

  <p>I note the research findings with interest. There can be clinical consequences of the Clostridium histolyticum group of bacteria in children with or without autism spectrum disorders. Parents may wish to discuss with individual clinicians what symptoms mean and how they can best be investigated and treated.</p>

  <p>The vital role of unpaid family carers as major care providers is well recognised by the Scottish Executive. Chief Medical Officer Letter CMO(2005)07 lays out current national policy on influenza vaccination for carers, requiring NHS boards to offer influenza vaccine to &quot;people who are the main carer for an elderly or disabled person whose welfare may be at risk if the carer falls ill&quot;.</p>

  <p>In May 2005, the Scottish Executive, in association with the Association of Directors of Social Work, launched a framework for supporting front line social care staff. <em>Improving Front Line Services: A Framework for Supporting Front Line Staff</em> offers advice to employers on, among other things, promoting a safe and healthy workforce, including the benefits of illness prevention. The document is available at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/05/13124510/45114" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/05/13124510/45114</a>.</p>

  <p>For the first time a comprehensive programme of child health surveillance, screening, immunisation and health promotion is being introduced for all children in Scotland. This is firmly evidence-based and available to all parents, wherever they live and whatever their circumstances. Health visitors will determine the nature and frequency of any additional contacts to the core programme, based on each individual family&rsquo;s need.</p>

  <p>This is intended to result in more visits for those families who require additional or intensive support, not less.</p>

  <p>The criteria &quot;deprived&quot; is not used in <em>Health for All Children (Hall 4) </em> in referring to which children should receive targeted health visitor support.</p>

  <p>In line with the requirements set out in <em>Health for All Children</em>, health visitors will determine the nature and frequency of contacts beyond the core programme on the basis of each individual child&rsquo;s and family&rsquo;s needs. Other support, agreed with the family, will then be put into place. This additional support may be needed because of a first baby in the family, breastfeeding problems, parental stress or other factors.</p>

  <p>In May 2005 the Scottish Executive Education Department asked schools to provide the average curriculum time per pupil set aside in the 2004-05 school year for mandatory, taught physical education within the standard school week. The purpose of this survey was to provide a baseline assessment of the starting position from which progress towards the target of two hours quality physical education for each pupil, every week could be measured.</p>

  <p>This baseline data has been included in a report on progress towards meeting the recommendations of the Physical Education Review Group, which was published on the Scottish Executive website today. The information you request is set out in the tables on page 6 of the report which can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/11/PEReport2005" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/11/PEReport2005</a>.</p>

  <p>I have today written to the Convener of the Education Committee of Parliament and to conveners of local authority education committees highlighting the outcomes of the baseline study and making it clear just how far education authorities and schools have to go to meet our targets.</p>

  <p>The Executive will continue to support the recruitment of additional PE teachers and will continue to deliver the range of actions promised following the PE review to support local authorities improve provision for pupils. The Executive firmly believe that improving the provision of high quality PE is a vital component in improving our education system and helping improve the health and wellbeing of our young people.</p>

  <p>The study published today allows us to highlight the scale of the challenge to local authorities and to monitor the progress that local authorities make from the low baseline now fully quantified.</p>

  <p>The <em>Health for All</em> guidance published in April 2005 recommends that vision screening should be performed by an orthoptist at age four to five years. Until this is in place, children&rsquo;s visual acuity should be tested on school entry by an orthoptist, or through a programme which is supervised by an orthoptist or an optometrist.</p>

  <p>The guidance also recommends that NHS boards should continue vision screening in secondary school at a single point only, unless this has already been discontinued; that any child undergoing assessment for educational under achievement or other school problems should have a visual acuity check, and that vision screening is undertaken in schools for children with hearing impairment.</p>
