  <p>I refer Ms Ullrich to my answer of 9 February 2000 to Mrs Margaret Jamieson (S1W&#8211;737) announcing additional funding of &pound;150,000 to support outreach cochlear implantation services across Scotland. There are no plans at present to establish outreach centres.</p>

  <p>Levonelle-2, was launched in the UK in February 2000 and is available throughout Scotland but only on prescription.</p>

  <p>The Medicines Control Agency (MCA) is currently considering an application to re-classify Levonelle-2 from prescription-only to pharmacy availability, so that it can be obtained from a pharmacy without prescription. Careful consideration will be given to the risks and benefits on the basis of a thorough evaluation of evidence, to ensure safe use without medical supervision. Expert advice will be sought from the Committee on Safety of Medicines, and there will be a period of public consultation before the MCA reaches a decision.</p>

  <p>The figure for staff costs is based on the annual salary costs for the staff currently in post and includes the staff costs associated with one Special Adviser. These are not shown separately to protect the privacy of that individual. The other figures are based on part-year figures. The figure for Other Administrative Costs relates to expenditure on office services and general administration.</p>

  <p>General Practitioners operate under terms of service set out in the National Health Service (General Medical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 1995. These terms of service require General Practitioners to refer patients as appropriate for services provided under the National Health Service.

  <p>The Joint Ministerial Committee (Knowledge Economy) met for the first time on 11 February 2000. The Committee agreed that its terms of reference should be &quot;To consider joint or co-ordinated actions by the UK Government and devolved administrations to optimise the benefits arising from the knowledge economy; and to exchange relevant information between administrations&quot;. The Committee agreed that there were a number of useful initiatives across the UK which could be co-ordinated and that there were others for which it would be helpful to exchange experience.</p>

  <p>A copy of a consultation paper on instruments to implement the targets in the Landfill Directive was sent to the chief executive of each Scottish local authority on 17 November 1999, including East Lothian Council. The council has now responded and its comments are being analysed along with others received. The City of Edinburgh Council requested an extension to the original deadline.

  <p>The proportion of biodegradable material in wastes going to landfill varies according to the source and the time of year. The information requested is not available for all local authorities, although some authorities have carried out sampling exercises. I intend shortly to publish a report of recent research commissioned jointly by the Executive and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to collect waste management data for 1997 and 1998. This will include a summary of the sampling information provided by local authorities.</p>

  <p>The procedure set out in section 2 will include many variables. These include the Reporter&#8217;s time, local authority input, costs of a PLI, if necessary, and publication of the report by Scottish Ministers amongst others.

The consultation period ended on 3 March 2000 and all points will be considered prior to the Bill being introduced to Parliament.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has explained to the residents of Loch Lomond, the Trossachs and the Cairngorms the &quot;Sandford Principle&quot;, as referred to in section 8 of the draft National Parks (Scotland) Bill; whether conservation will take precedence over the social and economic needs of those residents where there is a conflict; whether there has been any reference or explanation of this matter in any of its press releases on National Parks and how many press releases it has issued on National Parks since 2 July 1999.</p>

  <p>The Sandford Principle is explained in the explanatory notes printed opposite the draft bill. Section 8(5) of the draft bill provides that where a National Park Authority considers there is a conflict between the first aim and the others, the first aim (conservation and enhancement of the natural and cultural heritage of the area) should be given greater weight. There have been two press releases on National Parks from the Scottish Executive since 2 July. They do not explicitly cover the Sandford Principle.</p>

  <p>Future sea level rise and its implications for Scotland were covered in the Scottish Executive&#8217;s report <i>Climate Change: Scottish Implications Scoping Study</i> which I launched in December last year. In addition, Scottish Natural Heritage has commissioned further work on the implications of sea level rise for Scotland, the report on which they plan to publish later this year. The Executive have also just commissioned further research which includes consideration of the implications of sea level rise on coastal flooding which will inform its consideration on the effects of rising sea levels.</p>

  <p>More locally, in 1999 research was undertaken by SNH in liaison with the Forth Estuary Forum to investigate, among other things, the issue of sea level rise in the Firth of Forth. The forum is currently considering how best to take forward the findings of the study.</p>

  <p><i>National Planning Policy Guideline (NPPG) 7: Planning and Flooding</i>, published in 1995, provides guidance on the action which might be taken against the possibility of rising sea levels and storm tide surges affecting new developments.</p>

  <p>The primary responsibility for safeguarding land from encroachment by the sea, including coastal flooding, lies with the landowner. It is for them, together with local authorities and other interested parties, to consider any action that is required based on predictions of likely sea level rise. To date we are unaware of any strong drive by landowners or local authorities to address concerns about sea level rise and have not received any request for financial support in this context.</p>

  <p>MAIB have advised that the full report of the investigation into the sinking of the Solway Harvester will be made publicly available.

  <p>Student loans are available to eligible students aged 50-54 who wish to retrain in order to enhance their employment prospects. Students aged over 54 are not eligible for loans because it is unlikely that they would be able to repay the loan, and many will have other resources on which to rely.</p>

  <p>From academic year 2000-01, eligible Scottish domiciled students in the over-50 age group will not have to pay tuition fees if they are studying in Scotland. The detail of the new scheme of support to be introduced in 2001-02 is under consideration and we will consult on our proposals.</p>

  <p>Since coming into office, the Scottish Executive has taken a number of actions related to cycling.</p>

  <p>In December last year I hosted the Scottish Cycling Conference. The aim of this high level conference was to address strategic issues related to the promotion and development of cycling as a mode of transport in Scotland. Each local authority and health board in Scotland was invited to send representatives.</p>

  <p>I shall shortly be meeting the Scottish Cycling Forum to discuss the outcome of the conference and to see how best its conclusions can be taken forward in Scotland.</p>

  <p>I intend to commission a programme of research to undertake a comprehensive evaluation of the recent Scottish Cycle Challenge Initiative. The outcome of the research will help to inform policy on the need for other possible challenge schemes intended to encourage and promote cycling.</p>

  <p>Our recently published guidance on <i>Local Transport Strategies</i> makes clear that the Scottish Executive expects local authorities to build on existing efforts to increase the amount of cycling. In addition, local authorities are expected to produce a local cycling strategy as part of their overall transport strategies.</p>

  <p>Cycling and walking projects are eligible for consideration for support from the Public Transport Fund provided they meet the criteria for submitting applications.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has recently published <i>Cycling by Design</i> which provides comprehensive guidance and advice on the design of all aspects of cycling infrastructure. This guidance has been made available to each local authority in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The cost of recruiting the Water Industry Commissioner is estimated to have been &pound;20,000 and was paid by the Scottish Executive. The cost of maintaining the Commissioner and his office from establishment on 1 November 1999 to 31 March 2000 is expected to be of the order of &pound;450,000. We are currently considering the level of the Commissioner's budget for 2000-01. The water authorities meet the cost of the Commissioner and his office. The Commissioner's salary is currently &pound;67,500 per annum.</p>

  <p>Enric Miralles and/or his partners in the joint venture company EMBT/RMJM have met the SPCB on 10 separate occasions since 1 June 1999. Nine took place in Edinburgh and a range of issues were discussed. One meeting took place in the parliamentary chambers in Brussels and The Hague to discuss chamber design and was attended by myself and two SPCB members. I also met Enric Miralles while on a private visit to Barcelona.</p>

  <p>There is currently no specific budget for the purchase of artwork. Newspaper reports that we had cancelled a &pound;700,000 arts programme are false. No such programme had been considered. Art is integral to the architecture and design of the Holyrood building and the provision of specific artworks will be considered by the SPCB at the appropriate stage. <strong><br /> </strong></p>
