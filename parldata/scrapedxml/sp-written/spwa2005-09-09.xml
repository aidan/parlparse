  <p>Margaret Beckett, Ben Bradshaw and Jim Knight attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on the 18 July 2005. As I was on holiday I did not attend.</p>

  <p>The UK Presidency presented its work programme for the next six months. This included, amongst other things, sugar reform, the EU&rsquo;s Rural Development Strategic Guidelines, Forest Law Enforcement, Governance and Trade (FLEGT), Avian Influenza, Welfare of Broiler Chickens and a range of proposals to progress the sustainability of the fisheries industry.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection took the opportunity to announce adoption of a TSE Roadmap setting out the Community's BSE Strategy for the short-, medium- and long-term and signalled his intention to publish an Action Plan on Animal Welfare towards the end of the year.</p>

  <p>He also presented a proposed Directive establishing minimum rules for the welfare of chickens kept for meat production. The Presidency said would it take forward technical discussions on the proposal.</p>

  <p>At the request of France, Council discussed the measures introduced by the Commission on 1 July to protect the Bay of Biscay anchovy stock. The Commission was not prepared to relax its ban on fishing at this stage but said it would keep the situation under constant review.</p>

  <p>The Agriculture Commissioner presented her proposal for EU Strategic Guidelines for Rural Development, hoping for political agreement on this proposal in October. The Guidelines aimed to ensure that rural development programmes contributed to the Lisbon and Gothenburg objectives of jobs, growth and sustainability. Once the EU Guidelines had been agreed, they would be the basis for drawing up national strategies through a process of dialogue between member states and the Commission.</p>

  <p>The Council held its first discussion on Commission proposals to reform the EU sugar regime. There was broad support for a restructuring scheme instead of production quota cuts and for a 10-year time horizon but some member states argued that the proposed price cuts went too far and too fast; that compensation should be higher, and that the Everything But Arms import arrangements should be reviewed.</p>

  <p>Under Any Other Business, Italy called for the Commission to open crisis distillation measures before the end of July to deal with the critical situation on its wine market. The Commission replied that they needed time to analyse the situation, but would do so as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>The Netherlands expressed concern about the clarity of Community marketing standards for poultry meat. In particular, they were concerned that poultry meat that had been frozen should not be labelled as fresh. They also called for the introduction of a label for poultry meat originating from EU. The Commission agreed that marketing defrosted poultry meat as fresh did not conform with EU standards. The Commission would reflect thoroughly on both questions.</p>

  <p>The Council discussed the measures introduced by the Commission on 1 July to protect the Bay of Biscay anchovy stock. This was at the request of France who wanted a more limited closure to avoid unnecessarily severe socio-economic repercussions. The Commission, supported by Spain and Germany, would not relax the ban agreed to keep it under constant review.</p>

  <p>Note: *Under Priority Based Dispatch Category &quot;A&quot; (Life Threatening) calls only. Previously the time was to all emergency incidents.</p>

  <p>In some boards the recent decline in the average response time is a reflection of the consequences for the Scottish Ambulance Service of changes made by NHS boards to how they provide hospital services. Where such changes have been made then we have provided for additional resources to be put in by the Scottish Ambulance Service to enable it to manage these consequences. It takes time for the additional staff resources to be trained and deployed and for the impact on service times to materialise. This is also against the background that the ambulance service has responded to 32,257 more emergency incidents in 2004-05 than it did in 2002-03 (332,474 in 2004-05 against 300,217 in 2002-03) &ndash; an increase of 10.7% over the last two years.</p>

  <p>There have been no recent outbreaks of avian influenza in the UK and as such no quantified assessments are available. The impact of any outbreak would depend on specific circumstances such as the type of birds infected, their location the scale of any outbreak and its duration.</p>

  <p>Whilst the threat of avian influenza to the UK is judged to be low a number of actions have been taken to protect the Scottish poultry industry. In particular the Scottish Executive has been working with other UK administrations to:</p>

  <p>Provide stakeholders with biosecurity guidance to minimise the risk of disease incursion, egg through contact with wild birds, and minimise the risk of disease spread;</p>

  <p>Undertake surveys into the presence of low pathogenic avian influenza in domestic poultry and migrating birds, and</p>

  <p>Negotiate the terms of the new EU Avian influenza Directive, ensuring it provides an up to date and proportionate base to respond to any outbreak of avian influenza.</p>

  <p>In addition, well developed contingency plans are held by the State Veterinary Service for responding to any suspect case of avian influenza.</p>

  <p>It remains important that poultry keepers maintain good biosecurity levels and report any suspicion of disease to the State Veterinary Service</p>

  <p>If any individual is experiencing difficulties in paying their council tax charge they should discuss making alternative payment arrangements with their local council.

  <p>The number of drug-related deaths where heroin, ecstasy, or amphetamines were known to be involved is given in the following table. As individual deaths may involve a number of drugs, it is not possible to say how many deaths were caused by each specific drug. Because many drugs of abuse may be obtained legally but subsequently used illegally, it is not possible to provide information on &quot;other illicit&quot; drugs. There is no standard definition of alcohol-related deaths. The figures shown in the table cover key causes of death known to be associated with alcohol.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The table shows a combined total for heroin/morphine as it is believed that, in the overwhelming majority of cases where morphine has been identified in post-mortem toxicological analyses its presence is as a result of heroin use.</p>

  <p>2. Deaths from:</p>

  <p>(a) Mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol (ICD10 codes F100 to F109, ICD9 codes 291, 303 and 3050);</p>

  <p>(b) Alcoholic cardiomyopathy (ICD10 code I426, ICD9 code 4255), and</p>

  <p>(c) Alcoholic liver disease (ICD codes K700 to K709, ICD9 codes 5710 to 5713).</p>

  <p>It is unusual for doctors to mention tobacco (or smoking) as a contributory cause of death when completing death certificates. For example, of the 56,187 deaths registered in 2004, tobacco/smoking was mentioned on fewer than 300 occasions. However, in <em>Health in Scotland 2004,</em> the Chief Medical Officer reported that some 13,000 Scots die each year from smoking-related illness.</p>

  <p>Remuneration of executive board members is determined by Scottish Enterprise within pay remits approved by Scottish ministers. Details of remuneration of senior directors for 2003-04 and 2004-05 are contained within Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s annual accounts, copies of which are held in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference centre (SE/2005/178).

  <p>The Scottish Executive has benefited from a two year fixed price contract with Scottish and Southern Energy which was set at a particularly low point in the market.</p>

  <p>Since that contract was signed energy markets have been subject to a period of unprecedented volatility. Increases in oil and gas prices, political instability in key production areas and increased demand for energy have all combined to force prices up. The Executive has been protected from these changes during the period of the contract but the new contract reflects prevailing global market conditions.</p>

  <p>Since devolution the workload of the Executive has increased considerably. This has inevitably been reflected in the use of utilities such as electricity however the Executive is determined to reduce energy consumption where possible and has a wide range of energy efficiency measures in place &ndash; including low energy lighting, automatic lighting controls and flat screen computer monitors. In addition we are undertaking audits of all the Executive&rsquo;s main buildings to identify further ways of reducing energy consumption.</p>
