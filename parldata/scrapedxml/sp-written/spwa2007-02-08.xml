  <p>The figures requested are listed in the following table. The Scottish Ambulance Service rolled out a priority based dispatch system during 2002-04, so the figures from 2000-03 relate to all 999 emergency calls and the figures from 2003-06 relate to Category A (life-threatening) and Category B (serious but not life-threatening) calls. In 2005-06, the ambulance service responded to all Category A calls in an average of 8.4 minutes.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is satisfied that the policy which means that dentists are no longer considered to be NHS-committed as a consequence of at least 10% of patients not visiting the dentist in the preceding 15 months is helping retain access to NHS dentistry for patients.</p>

  <p>The policy which the member describes is not the policy of the Scottish Executive. It is, however, the policy of the Scottish Executive to require dentists within NHS committed practices to maintain their registration base, unless there are exceptional circumstances, in order to ensure that the additional resources we have provided are focused primarily on practices which treat all categories of patients on the NHS.</p>

  <p>Discrimination on the grounds of religion or belief is now unlawful in employment and training and in the provision of goods, facilities and services. The Executive&rsquo;s Equality Strategy published in 2000 made clear our commitment to promoting equality for all and tackling prejudice and discrimination. Among other things, we have mechanisms in place to allow for regular dialogue with all Scotland&rsquo;s faith communities, and as part of the Executive&rsquo;s mainstreaming equality programme, departments must assess the impact of their policies or proposed policies on faith/religious groups and the results must be published.</p>

  <p>GM Issues have been identified in the business of the under-noted Council meetings, but this list may not be exhaustive because agendas can change and issues relating to genetically modified crops and food may be raised during discussions of other items. The Executive does not keep comprehensive records of official attendance at Council meetings, but it is normal practice that an official is present at both the Agriculture and Fisheries and Environment Council.</p>

  <p>Firstly, I would like to express my sympathy to the family for their loss. Decisions on prescribing any form of treatment, including methadone, are ultimately ones for a clinician after considering the circumstances of the patient. The guidelines which underpin these clinical decisions are currently being reviewed across the UK.</p>

  <p>Decisions on whether or not to hold a fatal accident inquiry are matters for the Crown Counsel, taking into account all the factors involved. While it would be inappropriate for ministers to intervene directly in an individual case, we are always prepared to look at how the system that underpins fatal accident inquiries can be improved.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive works closely with its counterparts in the UK Government to ensure the free flow of information between the two administrations.

  <p>The latest available estimate from the Scottish House Condition Survey, for the year from October 2003 to September 2004, is that 328,000 households in Scotland (14.5%) were in fuel poverty. Estimates are available only for the years for which house condition surveys were conducted. In 1996, 738,000 households (35%) were estimated to be in fuel poverty. In 2002, 286,000 households (13%) were estimated to be in fuel poverty.</p>

  <p>These are estimates derived from a sample, so they have an associated confidence interval within which the true value will lie. The 95% confidence intervals for 2003-04 and 2002 are 14.5% +/- 2% and 13% +/-0.5%. Given these ranges, the estimated increase in fuel poverty between 2002 and 2003-04 is not statistically significant.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Sites covering less than 0.1 hectares are excluded.</p>

  <p>2. The figure for Vacant Land covers vacant land that is located within settlements of over 2,000 in population (as defined in council local plans). A limited number of councils surveyed for vacant land within some or all of their settlements below 2,000 in population. Within this more limited survey, a further 118 hectares of vacant land was identified across Scotland.</p>

  <p>3. The SVDLS is not a statutory survey. For those councils that did not provide data for any particular year, data from the previous SVDLS has been used.</p>

  <p>Information from the 2006 survey was published on 31 January 2007. This can be viewed on the Scottish Executive website at<br /> <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/01/30094119/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/01/30094119/0</a>.</p>

The Executive provides funding both for specific public transport projects, which in certain circumstances may be for a work programme involving a number of different elements rather than a single identifiable physical project, and for general allocations to recipients such as local authorities and regional transport partnerships which can be used for public transport purposes.</p>

  <p>The majority of such expenditure over the last three years has been distributed by grants paid under section 70 of the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001. Details of these are contained in the annual reports to the Scottish Parliament, copies of which are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. numbers 22114, 28193, 33166, 36946 and 39974).</p>

  <p>However, the setting of budgets is a matter for the individual councils and these may vary from the allocation figures shown in the table if, for instance, the council supplements the GAE allocations from its own resources. As the Scottish Executive does not hold data centrally on actual council budgets it is therefore not possible to provide the information requested on the amounts and percentages in relation to the budgets of the two local authorities.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Sources for Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) are the GAE Green Books for 2003-04 to 2006-07.</p>

  <p>2. Revenue expenditure is sourced from Local Financial Return (LFR) 5, completed by local authorities, which covers local roads maintenance net revenue expenditure. Expenditure figures for 2006-07 are not yet available.</p>

  <p>3. Revenue spending may differ from the allocation amounts for a number of reasons. First the allocations given above are neither budgets nor spending targets for local roads maintenance. They are simply a component used in distributing the total block grant that the Executive provides to local authorities. Second, it is for each local authority to decide how best to allocate the resulting overall block grant across all its services, based on local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>4. The increase in 2005-06 expenditure figure for Angus Council relates to reclassification of expenditure previously recorded as construction.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-02-08.S2W-31222.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80077" speakername="Mr Tom McCabe" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0208.htm#27">

  <p>The Scottish Executive currently has two central contracts for the provision of agency staff. Administrative and clerical staff are supplied through a contract placed with Pertemps. A contract is also in place for the provision of interim managers and specialist staff with Hays. For the period from 1999 to 2003 a central contract for the supply of typists was in place with Kellys agency.</p>

  <p>Individual departments may bring in temporary staff from employment agencies outwith these contracts, for example where specific professional skills are required, or to cover work in outlying areas, but this information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Employment agency staff are used by the Executive to cover temporary staffing needs for a number of reasons including pressures arising from maternity leave, sick leave, project work, unanticipated crisis and critical vacancies.</p>

  <p>The amount paid by the Scottish Executive for the hire of temporary staff, under the two centrally managed employment agency contracts and the contract with Kellys, is set out in the following table.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has no plans for a reduction cull of the red deer herd on Rum during 2007, only a maintenance cull in line with established practice.</p>

  <p>SNH manages Rum in line with its objectives for the National Nature Reserve (NNR) as set out in its management plan.</p>

  <p>The current 10-year NNR plan was agreed in 1998, and a new plan is due for agreement in 2008. As part of the process of producing the NNR plan, SNH will undertake a consultative exercise to draw together future objectives for the reserve. The process will involve the Rum community, independent advisers, representative groups with an interest in Rum, and others.</p>
