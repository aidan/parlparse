  <p>The Scottish Executive is engaged in preliminary discussions with the UK Government on the full range of issues arising from the Common Agricultural Policy. Proposals for reform of the Common Agricultural Policy are not expected to emerge from the European Commission until June. When we know what is proposed, there will be an assessment of the potential effect on consumers, taxpayers, farmers, rural communities and any other groups which might be affected.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-03-27.S1W-24053.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80238" speakername="Dr Richard Simpson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0327.htm#4">

  <p>Naloxone is a very effective drug and can be life saving when used to reverse the effects of any opiate-induced respiratory depression, or overdose with opiates. Naloxone should only be given where an overdose is suspected, and is usually administered initially by intravenous injection (0.8-2 mgs) which can be repeated at intervals of two to three minutes to a maximum of 10 mgs. If at that stage there is no response, then the problem is unlikely to be related to opiate overdose. If the patient responds, then naloxone can continue to be given for as long as required to allow the effects of the opiate to wear off.</p>

  <p>The effectiveness and limits of naloxone treatment should be well known to all doctors, in particular those in Accident and Emergency Departments and other doctors dealing with emergency situations. I understand that paramedics are allowed to carry and administer naloxone, subject to protocols developed by the Scottish Ambulance Service.</p>

  <p>There is general guidance in <em>Drug Misuse and Dependence - Guidelines on Clinical Management</em> on the procedures which doctors should go through before prescribing methadone. In light of the patient's motivation and expectations, the doctor will set mutually agreed and realistic goals covering what methadone treatment will mean for the individual concerned.</p>

  <p>Many doctors provide new patients starting on methadone with a copy of <em>The Methadone Handbook</em>, which sets out for those undergoing this treatment the effects of the drug, and the penalties for unlawful possession and supply.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive which business support schemes offered through the enterprise network are not available in the Grampian area because the region does not have assisted area status.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-03-27.S1W-24063.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80131" speakername="Ms Wendy Alexander" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0327.htm#6">

  <p>There are two main schemes which companies in Grampian cannot apply for due to the fact that Grampian is not an assisted area. These are Regional Selective Assistance (RSA) and Invest for Growth. Both these schemes are however operated by the Scottish Executive rather than Scottish Enterprise, as a result of the review of RSA. However, the wider measures that I announced in February, including a &#163;20 million venture capital "fund of funds" and more support for commercialisation, will benefit firms across Scotland, including those in Grampian.</p>

  <p>The impact of assisted area status on Scottish Enterprise's activity is more in terms of the rate/level of grant which can be offered to companies depending on whether they are located within an assisted or non-assisted area. The intervention rate under certain Scottish Enterprise schemes is therefore lower due to Grampian's non-assisted status.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how its priorities for growing businesses as set out in <em>A Smart, Successful Scotland: Ambitions for the Enterprise Networks</em> are being applied in rural areas.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-03-27.S1W-24079.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80131" speakername="Ms Wendy Alexander" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0327.htm#6">

  <p>The vision statement <em>Rural Scotland: A New Approach</em> , outlined the Executive's commitment to supporting rural economic development by building on existing strengths and promoting opportunities. <em>The Way Forward: The Framework for Economic Development in Scotland</em> recognised the particular opportunities in rural Scotland, while <em>Smart Successful Scotland</em> recognised Highlands and Islands Enterprise's on-going role in promoting the social development of the sparsely populated areas, and required Scottish Enterprise to be "responsive to the integrated nature of rural development". It also included a commitment to rural development and clearly set out mechanisms for priority setting.</p>

  <p><em>Smart Successful Scotland</em> has three priorities - growing businesses, global connections and learning and skills. These apply equally in rural areas. Particular rural challenges include sparsity of population, access to markets, distance, critical mass e.g. an insufficient concentration of entrepreneurs, limited job opportunities, labour supply, availability of development sites and limited range of services. These needs have been taken into account when growing businesses in rural economies:</p>

  <p><u>Greater entrepreneurial dynamism and creativity</u></p>

  <p>Creating openness to a world economy.</p>

  <p>Access to capital for business birth via the Business Growth Fund, and Social Investment Scotland for social economy organisations.</p>

  <p>Improving development for new starts e.g. 555 new businesses aided in the Borders and Dumfries and Galloway in 2001-02.</p>

  <p>Providing Business advice and information via Business Mentoring Scotland, the Small Business Gateway, developing Single Entry Points for business development services in the Highlands and Islands, and innovative promotional events such as the Scottish Enterprise Grampian rural roadshows in 2001.</p>

  <p>Greater employment inclusion for disadvantaged groups, young persons, and women.</p>

  <p><u>More e-business</u></p>

  <p>Assistance on all aspects of e-business delivered though the Enterprise networks and takes the form of workshops, seminars, one-to-one advice and online help. Businesses are advised about the best way for them to implement appropriate e-business solutions, including online trading.</p>

  <p>Supporting infrastructure development through public sector procurement of broadband in pathfinder areas - Highlands and Islands and South of Scotland. This should help telcos make a business case for investment and extending services to businesses in these areas. Trials under the DTI Fund for innovative uses of broadband will test alternative technologies for delivering broadband in rural areas. Projects include a wireless trial in the Western Isles, two powerline carrier trials in Crieff and Campbeltown and a network trial in Ayrshire.</p>

  <p>Broadband Demand Stimulation through the DTI Fund. A network of demonstration centres and a website will demonstrate the benefits of broadband to businesses. The first centre, "Broadband for Business" in Inverness, was launched on 19 March 2002.</p>

  <p>Developing use e.g. though public sector e-procurement (launched in Skye on 25 March 2002), and e-rings for rural cattle sales.</p>

  <p><u>Increasing commercialisation of research and innovation</u></p>

  <p>Increased research and development links with universities and businesses through the Science Strategy 2001, the UHI Millennium Institute, the Borders electronics design link to Napier University, the rural entrepreneurship and tourism link to Crichton Campus Dumfries (in conjunction with Paisley/Glasgow universities), and agricultural projects with Scottish Agricultural College.</p>

  <p>Fostering growth industries to develop Centres of Excellence in areas such as renewable energy (Muck Community Windpower unit, Vestas in Campbeltown, HIE Renewable Energy Forum, and the European Marine Energy Test Centre in Orkney), aquaculture (Dunstaffnage as the European Centre for Marine Biotechnology), nuclear decommissioning (Dounreay), and healthcare (Inverness MediCentre).</p>

  <p><u>Global success in key sectors</u></p>

  <p>Restructuring of traditional industries such as textiles and shipbuilding, ensuring transfer of skills into other key sectors e.g. through the SE Grampian Peterhead Company Diversification Scheme.</p>

  <p>Business expansion through Regional Selective Assistance.</p>

  <p>Creating exportable excellence through the biotechnology, opto-electronics (Strakan in the Borders), food and drink, tourism, creative industries and forest industries clusters, and the growth industries above.</p>

  <p>Where possible, we propose to develop a rural dis-aggregation of the progress measures of the Enterprise Networks, as published <em>in Measuring Progress towards Smart Successful Scotland</em>. This will allow the networks to become more responsive to the needs of the rural economy, and the success of specific interventions to be accurately measured.</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands Enterprise will develop the priorities of <em>Smart, Successful Scotland</em> in their forthcoming document <em>A Smart Successful Scotland: The Highlands and Islands Dimension</em>, with the Scottish Enterprise Rural Group leading evolution in the Scottish Enterprise Area.</p>

  <p>These principles, whether rural or urban, will integrate under the overarching Doing it Differently enterprise strategy launched on 12 February 2002, providing a new start for a new era.</p>

  <p>At the meeting on 7 March, I advised that the Executive does not hold a sum of money to fund local action plans direct. I also stated that it is not Executive practice to top slice local authority or Scottish Enterprise budgets in order to fund such plans centrally.</p>

  <p>If Scottish Enterprise Forth Valley consider they require additional resources to enable them to respond to the situation at Grangemouth, they can apply to Scottish Enterprise through existing procedures for a discretionary grant.</p>

  <p>With regard to the local authority, it is entirely for them to determine how its non-housing allocation is distributed amongst its capital programme. This system was developed to offer maximum flexibility to councils in managing their capital programmes.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not have specific targets for the reduction of any backlog in council house repairs. However, Audit Scotland has a performance indicator which measures the number of repairs to council houses, the proportion of these completed within councils' target times, the number of emergency repairs and the number of emergency repairs completed within the target time. Audit Scotland published its latest figures on these targets on 17 January 2002.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 introduced a single regulatory framework for local authorities and registered social landlords.

  <p>&#163;18.5 million is being allocated over the three-year period 2001-04 to the local authorities. The following table sets out the allocations for 2001-02 and planned allocations for the two subsequent financial years.</p>

  <p>Each local authority has submitted an action plan, outlining outcomes to be expected in terms of an expansion of learning opportunities for those adults needing help with literacy and numeracy. Some of the details have to be finalised before local outcome agreements can be reached with the local authorities.</p>

  <p>We are keen to help local authorities' efforts to improve services and share good practice. As local authorities pursue continuous improvement under Best Value we expect them to use the information in inspection reports and the Accounts Commission's value for money reports to challenge their current levels of performance and take action to achieve the standards of the best.</p>

  <p>The consultation paper we are publishing today entitled <em>Renewing Local Democracy: The Next Steps</em> also seeks views on the best way of further supporting local government in its efforts to improve services.</p>

  <p>A Best Value framework was introduced on a voluntary basis by all Scottish local authorities in 1997. The stated aim of this framework was the pursuit of continuous improvement in both corporate management and direct service provision.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Local Government Bill will be introduced to Parliament at the end of April 2002. It will give statutory force to the existing Best Value framework. This framework seeks to provide councils with the maximum flexibility to develop policies and deliver services in the way that best reflects local needs and circumstances, while delivering value for money.</p>

  <p>Through Best Value, we are encouraging all local authorities to seek continuous improvement in their service delivery. They already have a duty to report performance publicly through the performance indicators. The forthcoming Local Government Bill will include a new statutory backing for Best Value in Scotland and provide the Accounts Commission for Scotland with additional powers to set performance indicators.</p>

  <p>Significant progress has been made both in providing support to local authorities seeking to implement electronic government and developing partnership working.</p>

  <p>For example, the Executive in partnership with COSLA and local authorities, has established the Central Local 21st Century Government Forum which has a remit to support electronic service delivery across local authorities. Through the forum all councils are now working to produce documented 21st Century Government Action Plans which set each council priorities for electronic service delivery.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also established the Modernising Government Fund which aims to support local authorities and other public sector providers in developing new models of service delivery. The fund has already distributed &#163;26 million in support of this development and more than &#163;17 million was distributed to local authorities. Further bids for a second round of the fund are currently under consideration.</p>

  <p>The Executive has also been working with the wider Scottish public sector, including health and local government, to develop an e-procurement service which will be available to all Scottish public bodies, including all Scottish local authorities. One of the major benefits of adopting a common approach to e-procurement across the public sector is that the system will help facilitate partnership working (such as the use of common contracts) in a procurement context. Early adopters of the system are already working together in encouraging suppliers to join the system.</p>

  <p>The Executive is also demonstrating its commitment to effective partnership working through providing a statutory basis for community planning in the forthcoming Local Government Bill. The independent Community Planning Taskforce, which comprises a wide range of interests, is also working on the key issues surrounding effective partnership working.</p>

  <p>We indicated in December last year that we would bring forward proposals for taking forward the principles of Kerley before the Easter Recess. We have today published <em>Renewing Local Democracy: the Next Steps</em> which fulfils that commitment. The document includes consideration of issues such as future governance, councillors' remuneration and options for electoral reform. I am placing copies of the document in the Parliament's Reference centre (Bib. number 20270).</p>

  <p>There will now be a four-month consultation period on the options set out in the document and we would welcome comments from all those with an interest in the future of local government. Shortly after Parliament reconvenes in September 2002 the Executive will set out the next steps in relation to legislation and the future governance of councils.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is now very close to completing its submission of Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) in advance of further formal consideration by the European Commission scheduled for June 2002. Ninety-eight per cent of the total of 227 SACs on which consultation has already taken place have been proposed to the Commission as candidate sites.</p>

  <p>This is a major contribution to the EU Natura 2000 network. I shall be considering, with Scottish Natural Heritage's (SNH) advice, four remaining sites and one extension to an existing SAC, all of which have already been announced as candidate sites. These are:</p>

  <p>River Dee</p>

  <p>River Tay</p>

  <p>Firth of Tay and Eden Estuary</p>

  <p>Airds Moss</p>

  <p>Sunart extension</p>

  <p>Some of the river sites do not currently include all qualifying tributaries but will be extended in future.</p>

  <p>I have also agreed that five new sites (four raised bog and one blanket bog) should be considered for designation. Coverage of these habitats was not considered adequate by the European Commission in its first consideration of the UK's list. The sites are:</p>

  <p>Red Moss of Netherly</p>

  <p>Raeburn Flow</p>

  <p>Peeswit Moss</p>

  <p>Ofference Moss, which is an extension to Flanders Moss</p>

  <p>West Fannyside Moss blanket bog</p>

  <p>The sole remaining site on the published list of SACs is the Sound of Barra. After careful consideration, and following scientific advice from SNH, I have decided to delay a decision on this site until further data are available on the effect of construction of the Eriskay causeway on the numbers and location of seal populations.</p>

  <p>Good progress has also been made on Special Protection Areas. One hundred and thirty-five out of 141 SPA sites in Scotland have now been classified. To complete the series, I have asked SNH to begin formal consultation on proposed golden eagle sites on Skye and Mull already announced. Consultations are in progress or complete on three other sites and one extension and decisions will be made on these sites once all necessary information is available. The remaining sites from the previously published list, and on which I expect to take decisions this year are:</p>

  <p>Arran Moors</p>

  <p>Cnuic Agus Cladach Mhuile (the Mull eagle site)</p>

  <p>Cuillins (the Skye eagle site)</p>

  <p>Glen App - Galloway Moors</p>

  <p>Muirkirk and North Lowther Uplands</p>

  <p>Forth Islands (extension)</p>

  <p>I expect also to consider a small number of further sites for the capercaillie, for which a significant population decline is causing concern.</p>

  <p>The remaining site on the public list of proposed SPAs is Ladder Hills. SNH have advised that currently available data are insufficient to justify classification at present and further survey work will be required. I propose therefore to delay consideration of this site until the necessary information is available.</p>

  <p>This contribution to the Natura network represents a notable effort on the part of SNH to present the scientific data and to ensure that as full consultation as possible has taken place with local interests.</p>

  <p>SNH will now be closely involved in management of the sites and I expect their Natural Care programme to be of particular benefit to owners and occupiers in assisting them to bring their land into positive management. The Executive increased SNH's budget in the last Spending Review (by &#163;22 million in total over the three years) partly to enable management schemes to be more widely offered.</p>

  <p>Looking further ahead, for the terrestrial sites I expect the focus to be on appropriate management. I cannot, however, rule out additional SPAs or SACs, where suitable sites are identified which properly reflect Scotland's contribution to the Natura network. At UK level a framework has been put in place for review of the SPA series, and we shall continue to contribute to this consideration. In addition, we shall be required, along with the rest of the UK to contribute to the selection of SPAs and SACs in the marine environment. This process is on-going at present, led by the Joint Nature Conservation Committee.</p>

  <p>National planning policies encourage the re-use of previously developed or underused land. Such sites can make an important contribution to the supply of land for housing. However, the amount of previously developed land varies greatly across Scotland. The Executive has therefore not set targets for the use of such land, as what might constitute a meaningful and challenging target in one planning authority area may be wholly unreasonable or unachievable in another.</p>

  <p>I am not aware that East Lothian Council Planning Committee have made any comments on <em>Designing Places: A Policy Statement for Scotland</em> . I understand, however, that a report by planning officials to the Planning Committee made reference to the status of this document in respect of a specific housing development.</p>

  <p>It is clearly stated in <em>Designing Places</em> (in the Foreword and on page 41) that the document is a material consideration in planning applications and appeals. Importantly, the statement sets out general design principles which would be applicable to a range of development types including housing.</p>

  <p>In addition, National Planning Policy Guideline 1: <em>The Planning System</em> (revised 2000) makes it clear that design is a material consideration in determining planning applications. Design grounds may be used as the sole reason for refusal of an application.</p>

  <p>It is for the decision-maker to decide what weight is given to each material consideration.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the proposed changes to Regional Selective Assistance, what steps will be taken to ensure that there is no increased risk to the Grampian area as a result of incentives for inward investors to choose other locations and assistance to businesses to relocate and to locate projects in assisted areas.</p>

  <p>There is no increased risk, as there is never any question of Regional Selective Assistance being used simply to relocate a business.</p>

  <p>The Executive works to ensure that all regulations are necessary and proportionate, in particular for regulations which impact upon business, charities and the voluntary sector. The use of the Regulatory Impact Assessment and the Review Regulatory Impact Assessment should guarantee that regulations are proportionate, necessary and fit for purpose when they are introduced and remain so over time. To date, comments made to the Scottish Executive regarding regulations affecting business, charities and the voluntary sector seldom refer to any individual regulation for which the Executive has responsibility.</p>

  <p>Regulations which impact upon business, charities or the voluntary sector will be accompanied by a Regulatory Impact Assessment (RIA) and when finalised the RIA should be placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre, copied to the lead committee, subordinate legislative committee, Parliament legal advisors and the Improving Regulation in Scotland Unit as appropriate.</p>

  <p>I have written to the Chair of the SQA to indicate our decision to discontinue the second year of the Winter Diet pilot. Following a review by the SQA in conjunction with those schools and colleges that participated in the first year of the pilot in 2002, it is clear from the number of entries for this year and the projected entries for the second year of the pilot that continuing to run a winter exam round for such a small number of entrants is not a sensible or cost effective option at this time.</p>

  <p>The SQA has been asked to work closely with centres to ensure that any disruption to candidates is kept to a minimum. The SQA is committed to the principle of flexibility in external assessment and has been asked to explore - in consultation with stakeholders - options for more flexible approaches in the future.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether any study into the feasibility of the Skye Bridge with the title or Scottish Office number "RD11" exists and whether it will place a copy of any such study in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>The report <em>A Bridge To Skye Feasibility Study</em> was prepared by JMP Consultants Ltd for Highland Regional Council in 1986. It was subsequently lodged as production SORD11 at the public local enquiry into the Skye Bridge project in 1992. A copy has been placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 20055).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether any representatives from the tourism industry sit on the Nicholson Committee and, if not, whether any such representatives can be appointed to the committee and whether the committee can be expected to have full and proper regard to the interests of tourists and the tourist industry as a whole.</p>

  <p>There is no representative of the tourism industry as such on the Nicholson Committee, as it is not possible to include every field of interest if the committee is to function effectively. However, that does not preclude the committee having full and proper regard to tourism interests. The Nicholson Committee has consulted widely and I understand that VisitScotland is included among the respondents who have been invited to give oral evidence to the committee.</p>

  <p>The SPCB agreed at its meeting on 19 June 2001 that IT cabling should be installed to the MSP desks in the debating chamber during fabrication, along with the voting and microphone cabling, to allow for any future connecting of IT equipment. There will be no computer facilities at the desk, although future parliaments will thus be enabled to decide otherwise. Audio and Voting consoles will be provided on MSP desks in the debating chamber from the outset.</p>
