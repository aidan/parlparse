  <p>The Scottish Executive is today publishing its consultation &quot;Proposals to revise existing animal welfare legislation&quot;. This is being placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 31992) and on the Scottish Executive website. It is being made widely available and we would encourage all organisations, business and individuals with an interest to respond.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress is being made on the implementation of personal health plans, referred to in <em>A Partnership for a Better Scotland</em> , in light of the recent global initiative for asthma report that indicated that Scotland has the highest prevalence of asthma in the world and recent evidence indicating that personal health plans are the most effective non-drug method of controlling asthma.</p>

  <p>The global initiative for asthma study is not due to be published until 4 May 2004, and it would not be appropriate for the Executive to comment on it until it has been possible to make an assessment of its methodology and conclusions.</p>

  <p>It is expected that the strategy for developing and piloting personal health plans will be developed by summer 2004. The strategy will take into account and learn from the extensive range of existing health plans that have already been developed, mainly for specific diseases. For example, in January 2003 the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network published recommendations for the effective management of patients with asthma. The recommendations included the use of personal health plans and a specific reference to material produced by the National Asthma Campaign.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has in place contracts relating to the recruitment and selection of both temporary and permanent staff. All contracts were let through a competitive tendering process.</p>

  <p>In relation to temporary staff, the Scottish Executive has in place two contracts. There is a contract with Pertemps for the provision of admin and clerical (Scottish Executive grades A1 and A3) and junior managerial (Scottish Executive grade B1) staff. This contract was originally let to Pertemps in February 2000 following a competitive tendering process. Pertemps were successful in retaining the contract following a further competitive tendering process in February 2003. There is also a contract for the provision of interim managers (at, or around, Scottish Executive grade C1) let to Hays Personnel. This contract was let through a competitive tendering process in November 2003.</p>

  <p>Occasional <em>ad hoc</em> arrangements are also made to engage temporary staff at these levels for example through other agencies for locations outside Edinburgh and Glasgow where the current contractor does not have a business presence. Information relating to this is not held centrally. These contracts cover all Scottish Executive departments.</p>

  <p>In relation to permanent staff, the Scottish Executive has a contract with Capita for the provision of recruitment services. This includes the design and delivery of assessment centres and other selection tools and covers all levels of staff. Capita are involved in the recruitment and selection of generalist staff at all levels and have also been involved in recruitment and selection for certain senior specialist and professional posts. This contract was originally let to Capita in January 2000 following a competitive tendering process. Capita were successful in retaining the contract following a further competitive tendering process in January 2004. This contract covers all Scottish Executive departments.</p>

  <p>In relation to Senior Civil Service staff, a call-off contract exists for the provision of executive search and selection services. The three participating contractors are Munro Consulting, Thomson Partners and Odgers Ray &amp; Berndtson. This contract was let through a competitive tendering process in August 2001. Prior to this Thomson Partners had been used on occasional <em>ad hoc</em> basis. This contract covers all Scottish Executive departments.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is today publishing an <em>Annual Evaluation Report</em> which replaces the old <em>Annual Expenditure Report</em> and launches Stage 1 of the 2005-06 budget process.</p>

  <p>The Executive has changed the name and format of its Stage 1 Budget document as a result of discussions with the Finance Committee of the Parliament. The <em>Annual Evaluation Report</em> provides information about the Executive's performance against the targets published in <em>Draft Budget 2004-05</em>, as well as providing outline information about the Executive's spending plans for 2005-06. I hope that the new document will meet the expectations and requirements of the Finance Committee, and that it will assist public and parliamentary scrutiny of the Executive's budget.</p>

  <p>The Health Department has funded Stonewall Scotland to manage an LGBT inclusion in health project to research and develop a mainstreamed approach to the effective inclusion of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people in health planning and services. As part of this research, information on LGBT service users and staff was collated and analysed as part of the reports <em>Towards a Healthier LGBT Scotland</em> (Bib. number. 31922) and <em>LGBT Stocktake Exercise: Analysis of Responses</em> (Bib. number 31923). These reports have been distributed to the NHS, equality bodies and patient groups across Scotland. They are also available at <a href="www.lgbthealthscotland.org.uk" target="_blank">www.lgbthealthscotland.org.uk</a> .</p>

  <p>The Executive is looking at these reports and considering how the approaches used might be applied to other relevant public services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to raise the minimum age for purchasing alcohol from an off-licence. Ministers are considering the regulation of off-licences following the report of the working group on off-sales in the community and will respond to that report and to the Nicholson Committee's Review of Liquor Licensing in Scotland in due course.</p>

  <p>We understand that in some areas, for example in Aberdeen, voluntary arrangements have been piloted with off-licences which include a minimum age of 21 for purchases of alcohol.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are required, under the terms of the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) (Scotland) Regulations, to arrange that one or more community pharmacies in their area be open &quot;at all reasonable times&quot;. The days and times of &quot;out of hours&quot; opening must be specified in respect of each participating pharmacy. Arrangements must also be made for urgently required prescriptions to be dispensed outwith the specified hours.</p>

  <p>Since 1999 the provision of out-of-hours community pharmacy services has been a matter for local negotiation between each NHS board and its area pharmaceutical committee. Information about the arrangements currently in place in the Edinburgh area will be available from NHS Lothian.</p>

  <p>Consultations on planning issues are sent to a wide range of interested organisations and individuals, and they are also placed on the Executive's website. A typical consultation will involve us sending out 600 printed copies and 635 email alerts, though for the forthcoming consultation on appeals we intend to send out about 2,000 printed copies. In line with the Executive's best practice on consultations, a list of the organisations to whom the consultation paper has been sent is included in the paper.</p>

  <p>We have already consulted on several major issues which are likely to be included in a Planning Bill later this session. These include the modernisation of the development planning system as set out in our 2002 document <em>Review of Strategic Planning &#8211; Conclusions and Next Steps</em> and public involvement in planning as set out in the 2003 White Paper <em>Your Place, Your Plan</em> .</p>
