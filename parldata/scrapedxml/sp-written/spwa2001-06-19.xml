  <p>The guidance issued in March and referred to in my previous answer summarised the results of current research and translated this into practical guidance on the design and delivery of services, including the technical aspects of hearing aid fittings and rehabilitative support. The guidance should help ensure better and more equitable practice across Scotland.</p>

  <p>It is for health boards and NHS Trusts to manage the planning and delivery of health services in their areas, including the provision of the right number and mix of hospital beds to meet the needs of local populations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is supporting NHSScotland in meeting the demands on it by providing more resources than ever before. Health spending is set to increase by more than &pound;400 million each year from 2001-02 to 2003-04. By 2003-04, health spending will be &pound;6.7 billion.</p>

  <p>To help ensure that the performance of the NHS next winter is as satisfactory as last, the Scottish Executive has asked health boards to submit draft winter plans by the end of July. These will cover the full range of issues to be addressed by an expert panel, as was done in preparing for winter 2000-01.</p>

  <p>The UK Local Authority Debt interest figure is provided by Treasury. The Scottish value is sourced from Scottish Executive estimates of external interest payments by Scottish local authorities, based on information from the annual survey of local authority borrowing by the Institute for Public Finance. These figures exclude borrowing from the Public Works Loan Board. The rounded values for 1998-99 are: UK &pound;0.4 billion, and Scotland &pound;0.1 billion. The unrounded figures give a Scottish share of UK local authority debt interest of 30.7%.</p>

  <p>The mix of external debt interest varies from year to year. The Scottish Executive estimates that in 1998-99 some 27% of local authorities&#8217; external interest payments were on short-term debt, 5% on long-term variable rate borrowing and 68% on long-term fixed rate borrowing.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive contracts with the new trunk road Operating Companies (OCs) contain procedures to address incidents which result in trunk road and motorway closures.</p>

  <p>The contracts require the OCs to record all incidents where a trunk road is closed and they are required to initiate certain actions within predefined timescales following the notification of an incident that requires the closure or partial closure of a road. The contracts require the OCs to prepare an Emergency Response Plan which is issued to the emergency services. This plan contains information which enables the police, who would initiate a road closure, to call on the OCs to provide additional resources, if necessary, to assist the emergency services and maintain safety.</p>

  <p>Following an emergency incident, the OCs are required to liaise with local road authorities to arrange a diversion route utilising local roads. The Scottish Executive will pay the cost of diversion signing. However, responsibility for the maintenance of local roads used as diversion routes remains with the local authority.</p>

  <p>It is a matter for local authorities (where appropriate) or schools themselves to decide whether specific ingredients should be omitted from school meals. Current legislation requires that all foods or food ingredients containing approved GM soya, maize, additives or flavourings sold to caterers must be labelled. Additionally, school caterers, in line with caterers in general, must ensure that, either through labels, notices or access to oral advice, the final consumer can obtain information about any GM ingredients in the food on sale.</p>

  <p>All genetically modified foods are subject to a rigorous safety assessment before they can be marketed in the EU. The Food Standards Agency is the UK competent authority for approving GM foods and is satisfied that the only GM ingredients currently approved and on sale in the UK, soya and maize, are as safe to eat as their conventional counterparts.</p>

  <p>The task force on <i>E.coli</i> 0157 advised me recently that its work was almost complete and that it was now preparing the Draft Report in consultation with its 150-strong membership. The task force would then deliver its report at the end of June. Once we have received the report we shall make arrangements to publish it along with our response as soon as possible. We shall respond to the issue of abattoir waste in the light of its findings.</p>
