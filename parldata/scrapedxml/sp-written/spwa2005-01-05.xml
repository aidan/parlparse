  <p>Broadcasting is a reserved matter. However, the Scottish Executive is responsible for funding the Gaelic Media Service. There is no reason to suppose that the BBC&rsquo;s recent announcement implies any reduction in its commitment to Gaelic broadcasting.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The rural home ownership grants scheme was developed in April 1994 and national guidelines have been available since that time, with a recent reissue of promotional material in 2004.

  <p>Statistics on the number of Anti-Social Behaviour Orders (ASBO) served are collected at local authority level. National park boundaries are not co-terminous with those of local authorities. Each of Scotland&rsquo;s national parks includes land within the boundaries of four different local authorities. The number of ASBOs granted in these areas over the period 1 December 1999 to 31 March 2004 are set out below. It should be noted, however, that these figures are likely to include ASBOs served in parts of these authorities which are outside the national park boundaries and thus tend to overstate the number of ASBOs granted within the national park areas themselves.</p>

  <p>(a) Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park</p>

  <p>Total ASBOs granted 1 December 1999 to 31 March 2004 in Argyll and Bute, Perth and Kinross, Stirling and West Dunbartonshire council areas = 28.</p>

  <p>(b) Cairngorms National Park</p>

  <p>Total ASBOs granted 1 December 1999 to 31 March 2004 in Angus, Aberdeenshire, Highlands, Moray council areas = 20.</p>

  <p>The provision of community benefit by a developer is a matter for that developer and the communities concerned. The Executive has not discussed these matters with Scottish Power nor has it signed any concordats.</p>
