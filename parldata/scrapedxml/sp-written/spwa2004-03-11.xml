  <p>Access to fisheries in Scottish territorial waters (0&#8211;12 miles) is mainly restricted to UK vessels. Some EU member states have limited access. In consequence the numbers of foreign vessels operating there is normally very small.</p>

  <p>On 1 March 2004, surveillance by the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency indicated that no foreign fishing vessels were active in Scottish territorial waters.</p>

  <p>I agree entirely with the need for practical support to pupils.</p>

  <p>Pupil welfare and support is one of the four key themes of our current review of school/college links. I launched the review&#8217;s consultation paper last month in Edinburgh&#8217;s Telford College. There I saw the sterling partnership working that is already taking place.</p>

  <p>In delivering our Partnership Agreement commitment to provide 14 to 16 year olds with vocational opportunities in colleges as part of their school week, we are not therefore starting from a zero base. However, it is absolutely right that we review current arrangements for pupils&#8217; practical support to spread best practice.</p>

  <p>We will consult further on the detail of our plans when we produce our a draft strategy for schools and FE colleges in the autumn.</p>

  <p>We have a strong track record on funding for higher education, demonstrated by the fact that we have increased funding from &#163;600 million in 1999-2000 to &#163;800 million by 2005-06. We are committed to ensuring that Scottish higher education retains its competitive edge and have agreed to make additional funding available as part of the forthcoming spending review.</p>

  <p>We have been liaising closely with the Barker Review team and we will consider the conclusions of the review after the final report has been published and we have had an opportunity to consider their implications for Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive publishes average prices for dwellings in the Statistical Bulletin (Housing Series), based on the survey of mortgage lenders conducted by the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister. The Registers of Scotland publish quarterly data on average residential property prices for the whole of Scotland and for seven areas across Scotland. Other organisations including Lloyds-TSB, Halifax Bank of Scotland, Nationwide and the Council of Mortgage Lenders collect and publish information on movements in house prices.</p>

  <p>As regards the responsiveness of supply to changes in prices the interim Barker Review contained analysis of how prices might change in response to a change in supply. No specific analysis is available for Scotland.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for the National Museums of Scotland who made an announcement on 26 February about preparations for Concorde&#8217;s journey by sea and road from Heathrow to the Museum of Flight.</p>

  <p>The Museums expect that Concorde&#8217;s journey will start on 4 April and be completed in a little over a week. Concorde will go on public display this summer after a full restoration programme.</p>

  <p>Further announcements will be made by the museums in due course to let people know where and when they can see Concorde during its journey and when it will be available to view at the Museum of Flight.</p>

  <p>The Doctors and Dentists Review Body (DDRB) have today published their 33rd report of the Review Body on Doctors&#8217; and Dentists&#8217; Remuneration. I am grateful to the chairman and members of the review body for their hard work.</p>

  <p>This year&#8217;s report deals primarily with general dental practitioners, doctors and dentists in training, non-consultant career grade doctors, medical and dental consultants who have chosen not to take up new contracts, and ophthalmic medical practitioners. For consultants taking up new contracts, general medical practitioners and the salaried primary dental care services, 2004-05 will be the second year of a three year pay deal agreed as part of NHS pay modernisation.</p>

  <p>The review body has recommended with effect from 1 April 2004 general increases in remuneration of 2.7% for doctors and dentists in training and non-consultant career grade doctors, 2.5% per cent for consultants who remain on the old contract and an increase of 2.9% in gross fees for general dental practitioners. The review body has also recommended adjustments to some features of the pay scales for associate specialists, staff grade practitioners and specialist registrars.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce that the Scottish Executive is accepting the DDRB&#8217;s recommendations for 2004-05 in full and without staging. Copies of the DDRB report will be placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 31536).</p>

  <p>The appropriate numbers of GPs necessary in the new models of out-of-hours care will be considered as NHS boards develop their plans for out-of-hours service re-provision under the terms of the new General Medical Services (GMS) contract.</p>

  <p>NHS boards must have alternative arrangements in place by December 2004 which must meet mandatory accreditation standards to ensure a safe, quality service. Under such alternative arrangements anyone who needs access to primary medical services will get it, whether it be telephone advice, a home visit or seen at a GP surgery or primary care emergency centre.</p>

  <p>A national out-of-hours working group is established to assist boards. This group is comprised of key stakeholders from across the service and includes members from NHS24, the Scottish Ambulance Service and patient representatives. In addition, three key senior appointments have been made to the pay modernisation team of NHS Scotland to focus on the new models of out-of-hours care across Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s Violence Against Women Branch, has provided Rape Crisis Scotland with core funding of over &#163;80,000 in each of the three years from 2002-03 to 2004-05. This funding was awarded to Rape Crisis Scotland for staffing and running costs of the national office.</p>

  <p>However, five of the Rape Crisis groups that will receive the funding announced by Margaret Curran on 23 January, provide support and counselling to male victims of sexual abuse. These are Ayr, Central, Dumfries, Fife and Highland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive also provides funding to a range of other organisations which provide counselling and family support services to male and female victims of sexual abuse. These include Men Against Sexual Abuse and the Moira Anderson Foundation. Moreover, all victims of crime can access information and support through Victim Support Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive, through Communities Scotland, is providing financial support of &#163;160,000 over 4 years to Social Firms Scotland to help them set up new social firms across Scotland. We have also provided direct funding of &#163;122,000 over 2 years to Social Firms Scotland for a project to assist the expansion of the social firm model for mental health sufferers.</p>

  <p>As you are aware, we are also in the process of reviewing our policies to support and develop the wider social economy in Scotland, which includes social firms. Early last year we published <em>A Review of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Policies to Promote the Social Economy</em>. We are developing an action plan to implement the report&#8217;s recommendations and hope to make an announcement shortly.</p>

  <p>In addition, we support individual projects that contribute to the promotion of employment for disabled people. On 26 February the Minister for Communities announced support of &#163;200,000 over 3 years for the DARE Foundation&#8217;s project on Transition into Supported Employment and Education. This innovative project focuses on building partnerships with young disabled people, education providers, school staff and employers.</p>

  <p>The criteria require safety cameras to be installed at casualty hotspots where there has been a history of speed-related collisions resulting in death or serious injury. Installation decisions are made by safety camera partnerships for each force area. Partnerships involve local authorities, the trunk roads network, the police, district courts and other agencies with an interest in reducing road casualties.</p>
