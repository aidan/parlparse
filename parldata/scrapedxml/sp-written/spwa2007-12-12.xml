  <p>We will bring forward regulations to increase the payments for personal and nursing care in care homes in line with inflation from April 2008.

  <p>Sure Start Scotland was intended to deliver four high-level objectives around support for vulnerable families with very young children rather than an anti-poverty measure. Under the terms of the concordat between the Scottish Government and local government, resources allocated under the Sure Start formula through the unhypothecated Revenue Support Grant remain to fund work around improving children&rsquo;s social and emotional development, health and ability to learn as well as strengthening families and communities.

  <p>The concordat that we have signed with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities is founded on improving educational outcomes and providing more choices and more chances for all children and young people, including those identified as living in poverty.</p>

  <p>We will focus on improving the learning experience for children and young people by improving the fabric of schools and nurseries; developing and delivering the curriculum for excellence, and, as quickly as possible, reducing class sizes to a maximum of 18 in primary 1 to primary 3 and improving early years provision with access to a teacher for every pre-school child. In addition, our skills strategy describes our ambitions for developing skills in a lifelong learning context, from cradle to grave.</p>

  <p>We are committed to working with local government and other partners in the education community to build on the new relationship. Our aim is to develop young people who are successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens, and so raise educational attainment in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Claims companies in England and Wales are regulated by the Secretary of State under the Compensation Act 2006, pending the establishment of the Legal Services Board under the Legal Services Act 2007. There is no equivalent regulatory structure in Scotland, but there is currently an active debate underway about the regulation and business structures of the Scottish legal profession in Scotland, prompted by a report of the Office of Fair Trading. Ministers await the outcome of a consultation by the Law Society of Scotland, which concludes in January, and will thereafter work with the legal profession to agree a way forward. This will provide an opportunity to consider what measures might be necessary in Scotland to regulate claims companies.</p>

  <p>As part of a wide-ranging strategy to combat domestic abuse, the Scottish Government is promoting effective handling of criminal cases, through the development of options for a Domestic Abuse Court in Glasgow and the production of a toolkit to encourage innovation across courts in Scotland. This is underpinned by a protocol on the handling of domestic criminal incidents, agreed between the police and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service.</p>

  <p>However, sentencing of those found guilty is solely a matter for judges.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has supported the development of an accredited domestic abuse programme for men convicted of crimes relating to domestic abuse, (the Caledonian programme). The Caledonian Advisory Group has been invited to submit a proposal for the further development and testing of the Caledonian domestic abuse programme. This testing will inform its re-submission to the Scottish Accreditation Panel for Offender programmes in September 2008. Decisions about roll out will be taken in the light of the panel&rsquo;s decision on accreditation.</p>

  <p>Other than the Caledonian programme, there are no current plans to support the development of further perpetrator programmes.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>However, support and assistance for children with dyslexia is primarily provided through the school education system. The provision of education in Scotland is the responsibility of the appropriate local authority and Angus Council and Dundee City Council, like all local authorities, are under a statutory duty to ensure that there is adequate and efficient provision of school education made for their area. It is therefore a matter for Angus and Dundee City to determine how the educational needs for children with dyslexia are met.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much has been spent on school education in each year since 1990, broken down into (a) local authority spending and (b) central government grants.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-12-12.S3W-7436.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80330" speakername="Fiona Hyslop" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa1212.htm#6">

  <p>The question raises two different concepts: spend on school education and how this spend is funded. The following table outlines (a) gross revenue expenditure on school education by local authorities and (b) central government grants for school education (which excludes Revenue Support Grant, the main route education is funded by the Scottish Government).</p>

  <p>Central government grants for school education represents funding for both local authorities and other organisations which support the school education system (for example Scottish Qualifications Authority and HM Inspectorate of Education). Therefore, elements of central government grants will have funded local authority gross revenue expenditure on school education. Consequently, the two sets of figures should not be aggregated as there is an element of overlap. It is not possible to identify the exact overlap as some central government grants are not ring-fenced for school education.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to delivering effective support for families experiencing breakdown and has invested considerably in the family support sector. The incentive for parents to participate in mediation is that it yields consensual outcomes on issues to be resolved on family breakdown.

  <p>Yes it is lawful for interdicts to be made without limit of time. Interdicts may be permanent (without limit of time) or interim. An interim interdict is awarded at the court&rsquo;s discretion and is an immediate remedy which may be applied for during the process of obtaining a permanent interdict. It is valid until recalled by the courts. In general interdict is only awarded where there is a legitimate prospect of future wrongs. It is not competent in respect of an activity which is unlikely to be repeated. The Scottish Government has no plans to change the law in this area.</p>

Both the CSO and MRC would be pleased to consider proposals for such research into CFS/ME which would be subject to the usual peer and committee review.</p>

  <p>The National Research Register (NRR), a UK-wide research database, records that there are currently 22 projects on-going in the UK on chronic fatigue syndrome/myalgic encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME), of which four are bio-medical research projects.

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The implementation of Agenda for Change locally, including populating job matching and evaluation panels, is a matter for each individual health board in partnership with the NHS trades unions and professional organisations.</p>

  <p>I can also report that health boards are close to concluding the implementation of Agenda for Change pay, with the vast majority of staff now assimilated to the new pay bands and in receipt of arrears of pay. There has been no target set for conclusion, but health boards are aware that it needs to be done as quickly and effectively as possible.

  <p>Under the concordat agreed between Scottish ministers and COSLA, the ring-fence around the Police Capital Grant will be removed from 1 April 2008, with the funding being absorbed into the main local government settlement.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11.

  <p>The distribution of Police Grant Aided Expenditure between police forces follows an allocation methodology which aims to ensure that the way funding is distributed is linked directly to the cost of policing each force. This methodology was agreed in 2004 following a review comprising the Executive, the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and COSLA.</p>

Together these proposed increases are expected to lead to an increase in services to victims and witnesses.</p>
