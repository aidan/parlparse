  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what representations it will make to Her Majesty&#8217;s Government in relation to any proposed pesticide tax, in particular regarding what implications such as a tax might have on Scottish agricultural jobs and what evidence, if any, exists to show that some pesticides currently used by farmers have improved the quality of grain.</p>

  <p>The UK Government asked the agrochemical industry and others to offer proposals to reduce the environmental impact of pesticide use. Proposals now brought forward by the British Agrochemicals Association will form the basis of discussions between the UK Government, industry and other interested parties over what form a partnership approach might take. It has been announced by HM Treasury that subject to further detailed discussions, the Chancellor will not proceed with the introduction of a pesticides tax in the Budget. The Scottish Executive will keep in close touch with developments on this.</p>

  <p>No. The Executive stands by the principle of a national agreement on pay and conditions for teachers. Future machinery for determining teachers pay is one of the issues being examined by the Independent Committee of Inquiry into professional conditions of service for teachers, under the Chairmanship of Professor Gavin McCrone.

  <p>The NHS Estate Revaluation took effect from 1 April 1999. The valuation of Land &amp; Buildings in the NHS in Scotland reported in the 1998-99 Annual Accounts was &pound;2,730,992,000 as at 31 March 1999. The revaluation exercise has increased this figure to &pound;2,746,300,000, an increase of only 0.56% for all Scotland.</p>

  <p>The health boards and Trusts are required to pay capital charges on the valuation of their net relevant assets. After the results of the revaluation exercise were known, the service was asked to resubmit their Capital Charges estimates for 1999-2000. These returns have indicated that the net movement in Capital Charges is a reduction of 1.2%.</p>

  <p>Dr Harold Shipman was found guilty at Preston Crown Court on Monday 31 January on 15 charges of murder and of forging the will of one of his patients. On behalf of the Scottish Executive, I express my deepest sympathy for the relatives and friends of all those who died.</p>

  <p>The crimes took place in England but have implications for Scotland also. Our priority is to ensure that patients are safe, and to maintain confidence in the vast majority of doctors who are dedicated and hardworking. In discussion with the profession, we shall therefore be taking forward a number of proposals to ensure that all GPs are properly monitored and to tighten up the mechanisms to deal with those few who fail their patients.</p>

  <p>I intend to bring forward Regulations to require the removal from health boards' and Primary Care Trusts' medical lists of GPs guilty of serious crimes and to make it harder for potential GPs to conceal any past convictions when applying to practice. I intend also to make it compulsory for GPs to report deaths on their premises. I shall also be looking critically at the disciplinary process, to establish whether more streamlined and speedy procedures are needed to protect patients.</p>

  <p>I will also build on the excellent work already being done by contractors, Local Health Care Co-operatives and Primary Care Trusts to develop bottom-up quality assurance. We have already done a great deal to support this &#8211; for example, by creating the Clinical Standards Board to set standards and identify where local teams need to improve.</p>

  <p>In the House of Commons yesterday, the Secretary of State for Health announced that he is setting up an independent inquiry into the issues raised and that the Home Secretary will conduct a review of matters relating to death certification. We will keep in close touch with this review process and learn lessons from the findings.</p>

  <p>The cost of installing full central heating in three-apartment local authority flats would be determined by a number of factors including floor space, type of central heating to be installed and the extent to which full or partial central heating already exists in the stock. This information is not held centrally and so no estimate can be made.</p>

  <p>In the Scottish Executive paper <i>A New Single Social Tenancy for Scotland: Rights, Obligations and Opportunities</i> we made it clear that our aim is to create more mixed communities in all parts of Scotland. To achieve this objective, we will ensure that Scottish Homes directs its resources for investment in new socially rented housing to those areas where there is clear, demonstrable need.</p>

  <p>Yes. There is evidence of tenants desire to exercise the right to buy and denying this right to anti-social tenants, as part of a package of measures, will act as a deterrent of such behaviour.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive believe that it is right that those who can afford to pay a contribution towards the costs of their case should be required to do so. In setting the levels of contribution payable, by all civil legal aid applicants, the Scottish Executive gives due cognisance to the principle that the most needy should receive the help they require.</p>

  <p>The level of contribution payable is determined solely by the amount of disposable income or capital which an applicant has available. In assessing disposable income, the Scottish Legal Aid Board makes allowance for essential living expenses such as reasonable employment expenses, dependant children, council tax and other housing costs.</p>

  <p>Under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, local authorities already have a duty to provide advice and assistance with a view to preparing a young person for when he or she is no longer looked after by a local authority. Local authorities are also required to advise, guide and assist a young person who was looked after at school leaving age or thereafter up to the age of 19 unless the local authority are satisfied that the young person&#8217;s welfare does not require it. Local authority assistance, which may include assistance in kind or in cash, may continue until the young person is 21 years old. <br /></p>
