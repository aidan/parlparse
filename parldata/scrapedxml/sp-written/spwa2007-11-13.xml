  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-5468 by Shona Robison on 31 October 2007, whether it intends to make more up-to-date estimates than for 2002-03 in respect of the total cost to society of alcohol misuse.</p>

  <p>While there are currently no plans to update the estimates, we will consider ways in which the alcohol misuse cost estimates could be revised and updated. This will be informed by commissioned research to develop a robust methodology for estimating the social and economic cost of illicit drug use in Scotland. This research is due to be completed in March 2008.</p>

  <p>A wide range of actions that contribute to children achieving and maintaining a healthy weight are delivered through implementation of the Scottish Diet Action Plan and Physical Activity Strategy.</p>

  <p>Implementation of the Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) Act 2007 includes banning the sale of carbonated drinks and confectionary in all Scottish schools. The act also introduces a duty on all schools to be &quot;health promoting&quot;, with a whole school approach to healthy eating and physical activity, including the Hungry for Success and Active Schools programmes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also promoting healthier environments outwith schools. This includes funding to Sustrans for the &quot;Safe Routes to School&quot; initiative to encourage walking and cycling as alternatives to the car school run and the &quot;Beyond the School Gate&quot; initiative which seeks to maximise the potential for local government to create environments that encourage children to lead more active and healthy lives.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Enhanced Services Programme (SESP) has given NHS boards the option to offer services for children with unhealthy weight when an adult family member presents for existing obesity services. Uptake of this service is a matter for individual health boards.</p>

  <p>Subject to the outcomes of the Strategic Spending Review the Scottish Government will publish our plans on diet, physical activity and obesity in the new year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government currently centrally funds the Counterweight adult obesity treatment programme in Keep Well Wave 1 practices in Lanarkshire, Lothian and Tayside NHS board areas. As part of Wave 2 of Keep Well Counterweight will also be introduced in practices in Grampian, Fife and Ayrshire and Arran. Counterweight is an evidence-based system for managing weight in primary care and incorporates a range of approaches from lifestyle interventions to drug prescription and referral to dieticians and psychologists. The programme is intensive and for each patient lasts a year with continuing follow up.</p>

  <p>Information on other adult obesity services provided by individual Health Boards is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Obesity Action Resource (SOAR) project is due to be published by the Scottish Public Health Network later this year. SOAR will provide a partial baseline of information on current NHS activity tackling obesity.</p>

  <p>We are not aware of any such requests. Guidance on funding arrangements for hospices is provided in <em>HDL (2003)18</em> which indicates that hospices will receive funding from the relevant NHS board in respect of 50% of agreed running costs. This figure was reached with the agreement of the Scottish Hospices Forum and was set at 50% so as not to compromise the essential independence of individual hospices.</p>

  <p>St Andrew&rsquo;s Day will be a great opportunity to celebrate Scotland&rsquo;s culture, history and talents. Our programme for St Andrew&rsquo;s Day involves events across all of Scotland's six cities, and Scottish Government events in Edinburgh, Brussels, Washington and Beijing. Scottish Government employees have been given the option of swapping an existing holiday for a half day holiday on St Andrew&rsquo;s Day and we are working with organisations across Scotland to raise the profile of our national day. Detailed information about the programme can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.org" target="_blank">www.scotland.org</a> and further details of the plans will be announced during November.</p>
