  <p>I understand that the Scottish Ambulance Service&#8217;s Joint Working Party has made progress in reducing the amount of on-call working in many parts of Scotland. The Ambulance Service is fully aware, however, that wherever revised methods of working are introduced, including in rural areas, they must ensure that services to patients are maintained.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-14098 by Nicol Stephen on 15 May 2001, what terms and conditions apply in relation to the Scottish Computers for Teachers scheme and how these compare to the terms and conditions of similar schemes in England and Wales.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-06-12.S1W-15955.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80243" speakername="Nicol Stephen" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0612.htm#3">

  <p>Under the Scottish Computers for Teachers scheme all GTC registered teachers in publicly funded primary and secondary schools, including publicly funded special schools and units, are eligible to apply for a rebate of &#163;200 against the cost of a modern computer.</p>

  <p>The computer must match or exceed a technical specification drawn up by Learning and Teaching Scotland, who administer the scheme on behalf of the Scottish Executive. The specification is reviewed before each new phase of the scheme.</p>

  <p>The payment is a taxable benefit, but the Scottish Executive has made arrangements to settle the tax and National Insurance centrally. No liability falls on the individual teachers.</p>

  <p>The English scheme is currently restricted to the priority group of teachers of mathematics at Key Stage 3 as a necessary way of managing demand following high demand in the first phase. The English scheme has offered teachers 50% of the cost of a computer, up to a maximum subsidy of &#163;500. Income tax and National Insurance liabilities have been met centrally, with no further liability on the teacher. Teachers must have undertaken, or have stated they are committed to take, the New Opportunities Fund ICT training programme. Further information about the English scheme can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://cft.ngfl.gov.uk/user/index.html" target="_blank">http://cft.ngfl.gov.uk/user/index.html</a></p>

  <p>No comparable scheme currently operates in Wales. The National Assembly for Wales has opted for a different means of increasing access to ICT in schools and in support of lifelong learning by establishing School Learning Centres and ICT Learning Centres in community venues. Full details were set out in the Prospectus <i>ICT for Learning</i> which is available on:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps have been taken to ensure that any potentially environmentally damaging material contained on the two United States Air Force jets which crashed in the Cairngorms recently is removed from the crash site.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-06-12.S1W-15458.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80135" speakername="Rhona Brankin" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0612.htm#4">

  <p>I understand that the Royal Air Force (RAF) has produced a written recovery plan for the crash sites in consultation with a working group comprising of the two landowners involved, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB) and the National Trust for Scotland (NTS), the USAF, the RAF and the two environmental agencies, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH). The principal aim of the plan is to ensure the removal of all debris before the snow cover melts and exposes sensitive vegetation and soils. I understand that approximately 10 tonnes of the 25 tonnes of debris have already been removed from the sites.</p>

  <p>The status of the aviation fuel and oil contaminants, which are being held in the snow, is being monitored, and the RAF has contracted a specialist environmental clean-up company to assist it with the clean-up of hydrocarbons from the site. Aviation fuel is volatile and it is expected that most will evaporate, minimising the risk to soil, vegetation and watercourses. Monitoring shows that fuel is currently not moving within the snow. However, should this occur, there is a contingency plan to remove contaminated snow for treatment and disposal. Snow contaminated with the heavier oils is being removed for appropriate treatment and disposal.</p>

  <p>I also understand that SEPA has collected and carried out analysis of water and invertebrate samples from streams draining the area since the crash and have found no signs of pollution. SEPA will continue to monitor the area. As part of the recovery plan, a long-term monitoring programme will be put in place to determine whether there are any long-term environmental impacts at the crash sites.</p>

  <p>To ensure that this service is as integrated as possible with existing NHS services in Scotland, the Scottish Executive Health Department has carried out an extensive consultation with key stakeholders, including GP out-of-hours services, accident and emergency departments, the Scottish Ambulance Service and patient representatives. This process was designed to ensure NHS 24 meets the particular needs and circumstances of the Scottish public and NHS Scotland.</p>

  <p>The establishment of NHS 24 as a national service, requires detailed planning and design in order to address many complex issues. A detailed blueprint and implementation plan is currently being developed.</p>

  <p>Tackling methicillin resistant S <i>taphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA), and other kinds of healthcare-related infections, is an important task for the NHS in Scotland. The Scottish Executive has produced comprehensive guidance in support of the NHS. A joint Health Department/NHS working group has very recently prepared further guidance and standards on hospital-acquired infection which will help combat MRSA. Responsibility for ensuring that adequate resources are applied to these tasks is primarily a matter for NHS Trusts, who are fully aware of the importance we attach to effective action. In taking action, Trusts will be able to draw on the increased funding of more than &#163;400 million a year over the next three years which the Scottish Executive is making available to the NHS.</p>

  <p>My reply of 26 February to question S1W-12857 referred to funding of &#163;7,000 for myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) projects in 1999-2000. I regret to say that this was an error and I have written to Linda Fabiani accordingly. There were no projects on ME that were funded by the Chief Scientist Office (CSO) in the period 1997-98 to 2000-01 nor has CSO received any recent funding proposals. However, the CSO would be pleased to consider funding innovative ME studies of a sufficiently high standard.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-13189 by Nicol Stephen on 20 March 2001, what progress has been made regarding the provision and funding of pre-school placements for children whose fourth birthday falls in January or February and whose parents wish to defer entry to primary school until after the children reach the age of five.</p>

  <p>I accept the five key recommendations in the report of the Deferrals Working Group submitted to me in December 2000. COSLA and ADES also support them.</p>

  <p>From August 2001, children who become four in January or February and who, though eligible to start school, have their entry to primary school deferred by their parents will be able to access an additional year of publicly funded pre-school education.</p>

  <p>Local authorities will retain discretion over the provision of additional pre-school education for slightly older children &#8211; those born between September to December &#8211; whose parents are considering deferral.</p>

  <p>COSLA and ADES will improve information for parents considering deferral. They will also develop guidance for local authorities on the use of their discretion. Such guidance is crucial in assuring parents that decisions on deferrals are both transparent and consistent. Decisions should reflect the needs of individual children after careful assessment and discussion between schools, parents and the local authority about what is best for the child.</p>

  <p>The changes require careful preparation. That is why I support the group&#8217;s recommendation that the new arrangements should be implemented as from the 2001-02 academic year. This means the first eligible children (those becoming four in January or February 2002) will begin their deferred year in August 2002.</p>

  <p>There are children who will have reached four in January or February <i>this year</i> and whose parents want to defer entry. Although they will not be covered by the new entitlement, I would expect local authorities to continue to make well-informed decisions for them, in the light of full discussions with schools and parents, based upon their individual needs and taking into consideration the new policy which is being introduced.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive&#8217;s Freight Facilities and Track Access Grant schemes are both targeted at encouraging manufacturers to transfer freight from road to rail which is a central plank of our freight transport policy.</p>

  <p>In the Spending Review 2000 we announced that the Freight Facilities Grant budget would double to &#163;36 million over the next three years. The opportunities to take advantage of these grant schemes are available to industry throughout Scotland, including the Highlands where roads are often particularly unsuited to heavy road freight traffic.</p>

  <p>The Energy Saving Trust&#8217;s (EST) remit in Scotland is to promote energy efficiency to the domestic energy user and the very small business market. In Scotland, the Trust delivers UK-wide programmes as well as distinctive Scottish schemes developed by the Executive. One example of the latter is a loan scheme for small businesses to help fund energy saving investment. The Trust offers a wide range of practical guidance to domestic and small business energy consumers. It does not develop policy.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s Scottish Energy Efficiency Office approves and funds the EST&#8217;s annual programme of activities in Scotland as well as monitoring its performance. The EST grant from the Scottish Executive in the current financial year is expected to be &#163;2,200,000.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the proposed Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care or the proposed Scottish Social Services Council will have any power to influence the pay and conditions of staff working in private nursing and residential homes and what impact the creation of these bodies is expected to have on the pay and conditions of such staff.</p>

  <p>Pay and conditions are matters for employers. Any influence of the Commission or Council would be indirect.</p>

  <p>The Commission will inspect care homes against the National Care Standards and will be able to comment on any matter which affects the quality of care, such as, for example, a rapid turnover of staff.</p>

  <p>Care home managers will be in the first tranche of staff to be registered by the Council and care home staff in the second. Registration will involve some training requirements; and the Council&#8217;s code of practice for employers will include responsibilities for training and developing staff. A better trained workforce may be one factor which influences the pay levels considered appropriate.</p>

  <p>Nursing homes are privately owned and therefore the pay and conditions of staff are not determined by the Scottish Executive. Residential homes are currently barred from employing nurses.</p>

  <p>I welcome the Expert Panel&#8217;s report, <i>Reducing the Risk: improving the response to sex offending</i> . It is an important contribution to the debate on a subject of public concern. The report will now go out for public consultation, which will inform decisions on taking forward the recommendations of the report. Copies of the report are available in the Parliament&#8217;s reference centre (Bib. no. 14000).</p>

  <p>Following its unsuccessful application for an increase in the level of Development Grant Aid made available to shinty, the Camanachd Association (CA) accepted an offer from <strong> </strong> sportscotland to fund an independent review. The aim of the review is to provide the basis for the long-term success of the sport and the viability of the association itself. Consultants Genesis were invited to conduct the Governing Body Development Audit with the CA. The purpose of this audit is to allow the governing body the opportunity to assess the current position of the organisation in key policy areas. It also allows the governing body to check whether it is keeping pace with the expectations required of a modern, well functioning sporting organisation.</p>

  <p>The Genesis report and analysis is to be submitted by the end of August 2001. A copy of the report will be submitted simultaneously to the CA and <strong></strong>sportscotland. The report will be the property of the CA but <strong></strong>sportscotland will be required to check that the consultant has fulfilled its brief before making the final payment. A maximum sum of &#163;8,000 has been allocated to complete the CA audit.</p>

  <p>After the recent experience of Tartan Day I am convinced that Scotland can only gain by continuing to build links with the United States.</p>

  <p>The Glasgow Islay Association has been in touch to ask about possible participation in this festival. We are considering opportunities for increasing Scotland&#8217;s Gaelic profile and active cultural involvement in events in New York. We will then be able to determine what we can do to ensure an appropriate Scottish profile within UKinNY.</p>
