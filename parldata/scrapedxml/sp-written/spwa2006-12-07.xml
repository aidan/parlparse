  <p>The Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Bill will enable ministers to make exceptions to a ban on the sale of swords for legitimate religious, cultural and sporting purposes. The Policy Memorandum for the bill makes clear that Scottish Highland dancing is recognised as a part of our rich cultural heritage and will be one of the exceptions to the general ban on the sale of swords. Highland dancers will therefore be able to continue buying swords for use at their classes and competitions.</p>

  <p>The provisions of the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Bill do not change the law on the carrying of swords in public.</p>

  <p>It is an offence under section 49 of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 to have any article which has a blade or is sharply pointed in a public place without good reason or lawful authority. Any individual instance will be a matter for the police, and ultimately the courts, but transporting a highland dancing sword to and from classes or competitions would generally appear to be a &quot;good reason&quot;.</p>

  <p>The Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Bill was introduced to Parliament on 3 October and is currently subject to Stage 1 consideration by the Justice 2 Committee. Subject to Parliament&rsquo;s approval, the Executive anticipates that it would receive Royal Assent in April 2007 and could come into force from June 2007. The provisions on swords will not all come into force immediately as it will be necessary to prepare regulations to implement the restrictions on the general sale of swords and introduce licensing for the sale of swords and non-domestic knives. These regulations will be the subject of consultation with local authorities and others with an interest before a final decision is taken on the timing of their implementation. The regulations will also be subject to parliamentary scrutiny in the usual way.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has provided funding to local authorities for the rehabilitation of offenders with substance misuse problems in two main ways:</p>

  <p>The following figures are for section 27(1) of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 which provides funding both for those offenders subject to community disposals and those discharged from custody, excluding the costs of specific court orders such as Drug Treatment and Testing Orders or drug courts. Information for years 1999-2000 and 200-01 is not available.</p>

  <p>In addition, &pound;6.8 million per annum was provided to local authorities in financial years 2001-02 to 2003-04 specifically to support drug rehabilitation services, to which offenders in the community will have had access. Thereafter this funding was incorporated into Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE).</p>

  <p>Data held by the Executive does not indicate how many prosecutions relate specifically to noise pollution in town centres. Problems of noise can be dealt with in many ways, including prosecution, action under the Antisocial Behaviour Scotland Act 2004, action under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 or through mediation and education. I recognise the tremendous distress noise causes to people and their communities, and that is why the Executive has put in place strong and effective measures.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to his comments on 26 June 2006 at Glasgow Chamber&rsquo;s &quot;Glasgow Talks&hellip;with the First Minister&quot; business breakfast in relation to Glasgow&rsquo;s super casino bid that the Executive would need to weigh up the benefits that the initiative would bring to the city against the potential risks it posed of increasing problem gambling, what subsequent deliberations the Executive has had on the issue.</p>

  <p>Ministers have considered the available evidence on the potential economic benefits and possible negative impacts of new casino developments.</p>

  <p>We have decided that we are not opposed in principle to new casino developments in Scotland, subject to there being significant demonstrable regeneration benefits and appropriate safeguards to mitigate the potential negative impacts. We also decided not to back particular bids because we believe that local councils are best placed to weigh up the pros and cons of new casino developments in their areas. I announced the Executive&rsquo;s position on this issue on 12 September 2006.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will prepare guidance on the management of arrhythmias and sudden cardiac death, similar to the new chapter added to the Department of Health&rsquo;s national framework for coronary heart disease (CHD), and, if not, what action it is taking to highlight cardiomyopathy.</p>

  <p>Scotland was represented on the group which drew up chapter 8 of the National Service Framework (NSF), dealing with arrhythmia and sudden cardiac death. The key elements of that chapter will be reflected in the refreshed CHD and Stroke Strategy which we are currently developing, to bring it fully into line with the thinking set out in <em>Delivering for Health</em> .</p>

  <p>A proposal has been developed for a National Managed Clinical Network which would bring together genetics and cardiology to support the treatment of patients with cardiomyopathy and other conditions. This covers many of the issues dealt with in chapter 8 of the NSF. The proposal will be considered by the National Services Advisory Group in due course.</p>

  <p>The review of genetics in relation to health care in Scotland, which we published in September of this year, notes that familial cardiovascular disease is one of the most prevalent genetic disorders, and that primary care is well placed to deal with genetic issues. The review contains a number of recommendations designed to improve training and enhance support for primary care in relation to the management of people with genetic conditions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is investing record resources in the NHS in Scotland. Health boards have received uplifts in resources with an average 7.25% increase in funding in 2006-07, well above the rate of inflation. It is for each NHS board to plan and deliver services within these resources to meet the needs of its resident population.</p>

  <p>At present there is no provision by NHS Lothian for the fitting and supply of mandibular repositioning splints. However, NHS Lothian and the Department of Sleep Medicine are currently exploring ways of providing this service.</p>

  <p>In relation to the development of COPD clinical standards, I understand NHS QIS has taken the view that it would not be sensible for it to embark on a further piece of work on COPD until Audit Scotland has completed work on its long term conditions project, which takes COPD as one of two marker conditions, and the Department of Health has published its COPD National Service Framework. As a general rule, NHS QIS believes that it is not a good use of public resources for it to duplicate work already under way elsewhere in the UK, unless there are strong reasons for it to do so.</p>

  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s Sustainable Development strategy sets the agenda for change needed to raise sustainability standards. It emphasises the need for public bodies to play their part, not least with the management of the public estate.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive requires all public bodies &ndash; except NHS bodies and local government, which have different but complimentary approaches &ndash; to set targets and establish policies to improve their environmental performance, including that of their built estate. For existing public sector buildings, energy performance certificates will be required from 2007 and will help to identify possible improvements. Environmental management systems have been deployed in a number of public buildings and we are seeing examples of reduced electricity and water usage across the public estate. Guidance for procuring new public sector buildings addresses sustainability issues.</p>

  <p>Public sector buildings are also covered by a range of initiatives aimed at improving the environmental performance of the built environment more generally, including the building regulations, an updated version of which will come into force on 1 May 2007.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) is an established Scottish Executive agency. In line with standard procedures, Senior Civil Service posts within the Executive, and its agencies, can be filled through external recruitment, internal promotion or managed move depending on the skills required and the availability of staff. On this occasion it was decided to fill the SPS Chief Executive post through a managed move and no external candidates were considered.</p>

  <p>In keeping with an appointment of this level, a decision on the succession arrangements was taken well in advance and an announcement was made as soon as ministers had been informed. The Nolan principles apply specifically to public appointments rather than Senior Civil Service appointments. All those involved in the managed move process were civil servants bound by the Civil Service Code.</p>

  <p>The time taken to repay a loan varies depending on the type of loan taken. For mortgage-style loans (those starting their course before 1998-99), borrowers who have finished paying off their loans take an average time to repay of (a) 5.21 years for women and (b) 5.44 years for men.</p>

  <p>As an example of repayment times on the newer income contingent loans (those starting their course in 1998-99 or later) for 2005 graduates commencing repayment in 2006, the forecast average length of time to repay a student loan for (a) women, is approximately 14.9 years and (b) men, is approximately 10.6 years.</p>

  <p>The times taken for each type of loan are not comparable. Those provided for mortgage-style loans are based on the time from entering repayment to paying off the loan. These loans are repaid over a fixed period of five or seven years.</p>

  <p>The forecasts for income-contingent loans estimate the average time taken from the 1 April after graduating or leaving higher education to fully repaying the loan.</p>

  <p>Visitscotland.com was established in 2002 as a Public Private Partnership joint venture company with funding of &pound;7.5 million. The only public sector investment was &pound;1.875 million from VisitScotland, which gave VisitScotland a 25% stake in the company. This was invested by way of loan and equity on the condition that it would be repaid once visitscotland.com reached profitability. The visitscotland.com business plan always anticipated that it would run at a loss in the first years of its operation and it is expected to reach profitability in 2007.</p>

  <p>There have been no further equity or loan investment from the public sector since visitscotland.com was established in 2002, although payments have been made for services provided under contract. Following a recent change in the shareholding structure, VisitScotland&rsquo;s share in visitscotland.com has now increased to 36%, without any extra cost to the public purse.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body meets or reimburses the interest payments on a mortgage up to the limit set by the Parliament for this purpose within the rules of the scheme approved by the Parliament. It does not concern itself with whether the member is likely to make a gain or a loss.</p>

  <p>Implicit in the question is the assumption that property prices in Edinburgh continue to rise. On that basis, irrespective of the type of mortgage, an owner would expect to make a profit when the property is sold. Although Capital Gains Tax is a reserved matter to the UK Parliament, currently disposal of a second home would be liable to tax at a rate of 40%.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body what its position is on the principle, in relation to allowances generally and the Edinburgh Accommodation Allowance specifically, that no MSP should personally profit from the use of allowances.</p>

  <p>The functions of the current SPCB with regard to the Members&rsquo; Allowances Scheme have been conferred by resolution of the Parliament unanimously agreed in June 2001. Therefore the SPCB interprets, administers and enforces the current scheme by virtue of the will of Parliament as expressed in the provisions of the scheme. The Parliament has approved the payment of a variety of allowances. All payments under allowances schemes meet or reimburse actual expenditure. This includes meeting the interest on the capital borrowed to purchase a property within the levels calculated in accordance with the allowances scheme.</p>

  <p>As a general statement of principle, the SPCB would see that any allowances scheme should:</p>

  <p>(a) ensure that members have sufficient resources to effectively undertake their parliamentary functions, and</p>

  <p>(b) that members are not out of pocket in the performance of those functions.</p>

  <p>The SPCB also, as I am sure do MSPs generally, seeks value for money in the use of allowances. From the information already published on allowances it can be noted that, in general, the costs of leasing property is higher than the costs of meeting interest payments on the capital borrowed to purchase a property.</p>
