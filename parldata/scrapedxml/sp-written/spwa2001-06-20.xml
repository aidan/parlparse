  <p>The responsibilities of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency do not cover noise pollution, which is a matter for local authorities under the Environmental Protection Act 1990. Any enquiries that SEPA receive on this matter are passed on to the appropriate local authority.</p>

  <p>The employment of specialist nurses is a matter for individual NHS Trusts to determine in the light of clinical needs.</p>

  <p>In the case of multiple sclerosis (MS) nurses, I am aware that the MS Society wrote to Trusts and health boards last November offering assistance by providing information about the needs of people with MS, by facilitating links with local MS communities, by sharing best practice, and through partnership funding of key posts and work. To this end, health boards have been asked by my officials to consider the Scottish Needs Assessment Programme (SNAP) Report on Multiple Sclerosis, particularly in relation to specialist nurses and the part-funding offer that the society has made.</p>

  <p>Planning authorities in Scotland have the primary responsibility for taking whatever enforcement action may be necessary, in the public interest, in their administrative area.</p>

  <p>Failure on the part of the planning authority to take appropriate enforcement action against a breach of planning conditions may be subject to a referral to the Commissioner for Local Administration in Scotland.</p>

The table gives the latest available information on the number of persons proceeded against and those with a charge proved in Scottish courts where the main offence was under section 33 of the Environmental Protection Act <strong> </strong> 1990.</p>
