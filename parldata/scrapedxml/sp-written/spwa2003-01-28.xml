  <p>Plans are being finalised to implement a step-change in broadband population coverage in Scotland, as well as to stimulate demand for services. In addition, we are already supporting trials of alternative technologies, such as powerline carrier and fixed wireless, which may have potential for commercial deployment in rural areas.</p>

  <p>An environmental assessment was included in evaluation of the Central Science Laboratory&#146;s application for authorisation for an experimental permit.</p>

  <p>This permit was granted under the Control of Pesticides Regulations 1986 (as amended), which requires all pesticides to have gained approval before they can be advertised, sold, supplied, stored or used. The regulations do not allow for the publication of details of the assessments of experimental permits and the information supplied in support of an application for such a permit must be treated as confidential. However, the Central Science Laboratory, as the holder of the experimental permit and data owner, has agreed to make the evaluation available, subject to the removal of commercially confidentially information. Once such information is removed I will arrange for copies to be placed in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>As part of the negotiations during the December 2002 Agriculture and Fisheries Council, the number of days a UK vessel could spend at sea in the regulated area carrying nets of mesh sizes of 100mm or more was negotiated upwards from seven days to 15 days per month.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is now in a position to announce a package of financial assistance for Scotland&#146;s fisheries-dependent communities.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2003-01-28.9.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-03/wa0128.htm#5">

  <p>Following the outcome of the December Council, I made clear our commitment to bring forward a reasonable package of financial assistance for Scotland&#146;s fisheries dependent communities, and to keep the Parliament informed of progress in developing that package.</p>

  <p>Our intention is to lay three Scottish Statutory Instruments (SSIs) in the Parliament to give effect to the regulations adopted at the December Council, and to afford the fisheries sector and its associated communities the assistance we have promised in adjusting to these new Community measures. The first is likely to be laid later this week, with others following as soon as possible thereafter.</p>

  <p>Our policy objectives are two-fold. First, we wish to pursue sustainable development in the fisheries sector. It seems to us that sustainable fisheries are the best long-term guarantee of economic prosperity for our fishing communities. That inescapably implies further restructuring of the whitefish sector. Secondly, we wish to facilitate rational economic planning, and a process of structured change in the sector. We wish to avoid ill-considered responses driven by the February deadline for introduction of the new &quot;days at sea&quot; regime (Annex XVII of the new total allowable catch and Quota Regulation). Our forthcoming financial assistance package will, therefore, comprise a coherent and carefully balanced package designed to promote change in an orderly fashion.</p>

  <p>Our implementing and associated regulations will consist of an SSI to give effect to Annex XVII, an SSI to introduce a further Scottish decommissioning scheme, and an SSI to introduce a transitional support scheme for the whitefish sector.</p>

  <p>The SSI related to Annex XVII will be designed to give practical effect to what is a binding EC regulation. It will set out practical arrangements connected to the days at sea limits imposed by Annex XVII, and associated obligations on member states to monitor and control associated activity.</p>

  <p>The SSI on decommissioning will be designed to give effect to the underlying conservation and sustainable development objectives. The intention is to reduce Scottish fishing effort on cod by a further 15% to 20%, in conjunction with parallel initiatives for the rest of the UK in the Westminster Parliament. The scheme will be carefully targeted to ensure delivery of those conservation and commercial considerations. It will operate on the normal basis of competitive bidding. Eligibility criteria and other details of the scheme will be announced when we are ready to table the SSI.</p>

  <p>The SSI on transitional support will be designed to facilitate a rational economic response to the new economic circumstances implied by the reduced quotas and the days at sea regime. The intention is to secure a six-month breathing space for the industry to assess its prospects and adjust in a structured manner. We judge that this might not be possible, if the absence of such interim support resulted in debts being called in. As such, the scheme will be carefully targeted at those vessels most affected by the new regulations. It will help vessel owners retain their crews and their commercial viability, while they assess their longer term prospects and adjust accordingly. It will also be as simple as possible, in order to allow for rapid implementation. We will be discussing eligibility criteria and other details of the scheme with the industry. Those details will be announced when we are ready to table the SSI. However, it is also likely to focus on those Scottish vessels worst affected by the new arrangements</p>

  <p>Sustainable development is the key to long-term prosperity for the sector and our associated fishing communities. Rational (but not uncontrolled) restructuring is necessary. Our intention is therefore to underpin these SSIs with a generous financial package of up to &#163;50 million covering both decommissioning and transitional support. Of that, we envisage spending up to &#163;40 million on decommissioning and up to &#163;10 million on transitional support.</p>

  <p>In addition, we will be taking steps to protect other vital fisheries from a diversion of fishing effort from existing whitefish activity. We are considering how best to protect the nephrops and shellfish sectors from such damaging displacement of effort.</p>

  <p>We are considering how best to build on the Scottish Fish Processors Action Plan. We will also ensure that our fishing communities acquire the support they need to weather these fundamental changes. We take the view that they have a future based on more sustainable fisheries. They will benefit over time from the initiatives described above. However, they will clearly need assistance in the short- and medium-term. That more general promotion of sustainable economic development and regeneration is best dealt by local organisations and agencies.</p>

  <p>The Enterprise Networks are already charged with promoting economic development across Scotland. Each local enterprise company continually assesses opportunities and needs in its area and designs specific responses to add to the range of support in business development and skills available across Scotland.</p>

  <p>In the North East, Scottish Enterprise Grampian is drawing up an action plan with local partners. This will expand on previously planned activity, and will cover a three-year period. Similarly, the local enterprise companies in the Highlands and Islands and Northern Isles are currently working with their economic development partners, particularly the local authorities, to consider and develop appropriate action plans for their respective areas.</p>

  <p>We hope that the unemployment effects of reduced quotas and the days at sea regime will be much smaller than feared. The aim will be to ensure that everything possible is done to help all those affected find alternative employment. First class support services will be available via the Executive&#146;s Partnership Action for Continuing Employment (PACE) framework.</p>

  <p>Under the PACE framework, response teams have been set up in each local enterprise company area. These local response teams are all are taking forward pre-planning work to allow them to put in place the appropriate support structures. The PACE teams have considerable experience and understanding of the issues facing the fishing industry and are therefore well placed to deal with the situation.</p>

  <p>Taken as a package, these various initiatives are designed to promote economic development and sustainable fisheries communities, both by encouraging a more sustainable fisheries sector and by facilitating alternative development opportunities. We hope that they will encourage greater economic vitality in Scottish fishing communities, and the continuing prospect of a viable Scottish-owned fleet delivering a sustainable quality product into those communities and also to other markets beyond.</p>

  <p>The independent scientific advisory group on Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalomyelitis (CFS/ME) was set up by the MRC to develop a broad strategy for advancing biomedical and health services research on CFS/ME. In December 2002, it issued a draft research strategy for public consultation, inviting responses by the end of this month. The Scottish Executive Health Department (SEHD) will be offering comments on the document and, once the MRC&#146;s work is complete and the future strategic direction of research is clear, SEHD will seek to play a full part in the implementation of that strategy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department (SEHD), together with other UK Health Departments, collaborates with the Medical Research Council (MRC) through a formal Concordat which aims to develop and maintain an effective partnership for the promotion, funding and management of UK medical research.</p>

  <p>SEHD takes account of MRC research strategies when making decisions about its own future research funding. This would include considerations about whether to fund studies on specific areas of research only within Scotland or to collaborate with the MRC in UK-wide programmes.</p>

  <p>At an operational level, the Chief Scientist Office within SEHD is actively engaged in funding research initiatives jointly with the MRC, namely the core-funding of two research units based in Glasgow and the funding of Research Training Fellowships, two of which are currently being supported over a three-year period.</p>

  <p>Guidance on Family Friendly Policies was prepared in partnership with the service, trade unions and the professions, and published in January 2000. This document contains a section on child care, and lists the provision of workplace nurseries as an option that employers should consider. The guidance underpins the Staff Governance Standard and all NHS Scotland Employers are required to meet or exceed it. Employers&#146; progress towards meeting the guidance will be part of the annual Staff Governance Standard audit process.</p>

  <p>NHS Organisations receive Scottish Executive funding each year, and the decision of how much of this money to allocate to provision of child care is made locally based on local priorities and circumstances. Some help with start up costs for nurseries may be available from local Early Years Development and Childcare Partnerships.</p>

  <p>Information on appeals prior to the appraisal year 2001-02 is not held centrally. However, information collated by personnel teams, which may not be complete, shows that in the 2000-01 appraisal year five appeals were received and heard. Of these, two were upheld or partially upheld, two were not upheld and one has yet to be determined.</p>

  <p>In the 2001-02 appraisal year nine appeals were received and heard. Of these three were upheld, five were not upheld and one has yet to be determined.</p>

  <p>Appellants were in Bands A to C.</p>

  <p>Given the small number of appeals and the need to maintain confidentiality in relation to individuals it is not possible to give a more detailed breakdown of each case.</p>

  <p>The performance management system applies to all staff in Bands A to C. All arbiters are experienced managers at Head of Division level (Senior Civil Service) or the level immediately below (Band C). All staff receive training in performance appraisal and written guidance on the conduct of appeals is provided for arbiters and appellants. Also, personnel teams and heads of profession are available on request to provide advice.</p>

  <p>The oath of allegiance or solemn affirmation must be taken in English under the terms of the Promissory Oaths Act 1868 and the Oaths Act 1978. However, under Rule 1.2 of Standing Orders, after taking the oath or affirmation, a member may repeat it in a language other than English. In accordance with the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body language policy, written versions will be available to members in the languages covered in that policy, but that does not preclude any member from using Scots or any other language if they so choose.</p>
