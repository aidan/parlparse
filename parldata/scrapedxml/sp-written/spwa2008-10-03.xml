  <p>There are no proposals at present to replace the current Housing for Varying Needs standard for new properties built by housing associations. As part of the package of further action on housing announced on 19 August we have however agreed with Scottish Federation of Housing Associations to relax the usual Housing for Varying Needs requirement to assist in the purchase of unsold stock from private developers, subject to conditions.

  <p>The total number of older people affected by clinical depression is not recorded centrally. It is generally acknowledged that a large proportion of people with depression remain with their condition unrecognised and untreated.</p>

  <p>To address this the Scottish Government and local partners continue campaigns to end stigma and discrimination of mental ill health and to encourage those in need of help to seek help. We are also investing &pound;3 million in new innovative approaches, with a focus on self help, to better reach and support those with anxiety or depression.</p>

  <p>Estimates drawn from a sample of general practices in Scotland indicates that 23,000 patients over age 65 were recorded with depression by GPs or practice nurses in 2006-07. This figure of course does not capture those with depression who do not seek help from the support agencies.</p>

  <p>It is difficult to estimate the numbers of those making a full recovery given the range of possible reasons for non presentation following initial contact and support.</p>

  <p>The 2003-06 Scottish Government Doing Well by People with Depression initiative which is now carried forward in local areas did show improvement in some patients from presentation to discharge across all the pilot sites. The difficulty with definitive data extends here also however with some patients for example declining to continue contact with the initiative as they did not wish to recall or revisit that period of their depression.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government are investing &pound;3 million in new innovative approaches, with a focus on self help, to better reach and support those with anxiety or depression. Attention also continues on reducing anti-depressant prescribing and offering alternatives to medication and on campaigns to encourage those in need of help to seek help.</p>

  <p>We are working with GPs so that new patients with depression receive a formal assessment using a standardised tool and matched therapy appropriate to the level of need.</p>

  <p>The GP contract provides additional resources to practices to make objective assessments to assess the severity of depression and provide appropriate information on interventions including self help, life style advice and other evidence based interventions such as exercise. The pharmacy contract also enables some pharmacists to advise on mental health and wellbeing issues.</p>

  <p>Our published standards for Integrated approaches to the treatment of depression will also inform all practitioners on expectations.

  <p>GPs as independent contractors are expected to identify, assess and address their own training and educational needs aligned to the needs of their patients. On-going attention will include consideration of needs for the identification, treatment and recovery expectations for those with depression.</p>

  <p>Learning needs are also highlighted and discussed at the contractually required GP annual appraisals. Other parts of the GP practice contract also assist in the learning process such as significant event analyses.</p>

  <p>GPs are supported in addressing their training needs by their NHS board, through protected learning time initiatives. Other help and support is offered through directors of GP post graduate education; NHS Education; Royal College of General Practitioners; NHS elibrary services; special colleagues, and others.</p>

  <p>Our published standards for Integrated approaches to the treatment of depression will also inform all practitioners on expectations.

  <p>The information requested cannot be obtained at proportionate cost.</p>

  <p>However, I will as part of a routine exercise be releasing shortly information on each ministerial visit overseas undertaken from 1 April 2007 to 31 March 2008. The information will include the dates of each visit, the minister, the reason for travelling, the number of officials accompanying the minister and the overall cost to the minister.</p>

  <p>Information on ministerial visits overseas undertaken during the financial year 2008-09 will be published on the Scottish Government website in due course, this information will include the dates of each visit, the minister, the reason for travelling, the number of officials accompanying the minister and the overall cost to the minister.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many student nurses have benefited from the one year job guarantee scheme.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-10-03.S3W-16572.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa1003.htm#6">

  <p>Between 2002, when the initiative was introduced, and 29 September 2008, 53 full and part-time newly qualified nurses and midwives benefited from the one year job guarantee scheme. This is broken down as follows:</p>

  <p><table width="50%" border="BORDER" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">
<tr>
<td width="13%" align="center" valign="top"> 2002</td>
<td width="13%" align="center" valign="top"> 2003</td>
<td width="13%" align="center" valign="top"> 2004</td>
<td width="13%" align="center" valign="top"> 2005</td>
<td width="13%" align="center" valign="top"> 2006</td>
<td width="13%" align="center" valign="top"> 2007</td>
<td width="23%" align="center" valign="top"> 2008 to date</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td width="13%" align="right" valign="top"> 0 </td>
<td width="13%" align="right" valign="top"> 9 </td>
<td width="13%" align="right" valign="top"> 1 </td>
<td width="13%" align="right" valign="top"> 3 </td>
<td width="13%" align="right" valign="top"> 18 </td>
<td width="13%" align="right" valign="top"> 13 </td>
<td width="23%" align="right" valign="top"> 9 </td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>The number of students recruited to pre-registration nursing and midwifery programmes is linked to the nursing and midwifery workforce planning process for Scotland. Most newly qualified nurses are therefore able to find employment through their own means, in their locality and area of expertise. The one year job guarantee is for the few students who, for some reason or another, are unable to secure employment in this manner.</p>

  <p>The early years framework, which is being developed jointly with COSLA, will be published later this year. It will set the long term direction of policy and consider the range of services needed to support young children and their families and help end cycles of poverty, disadvantage and ill-health.</p>

  <p>A key focus of this work is implementing existing pre-school commitments and examining targeted additional services for vulnerable 0-3s. Over 2000 two-year-olds are currently in pre-school nursery places</p>
