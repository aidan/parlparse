  <p>This is an issue reserved to the UK Government and Scottish ministers have had no discussions with them on this. However, the former Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, in her capacity as Minister for Science, wrote to the Minister for State at the Home Office in April 2009, to confirm that the Scottish Government was content with their plans for a UK consultation on proposals for a new European Union Directive on the protection of animals used for scientific purposes. She also noted that it was important that we continue to move towards standards which minimise the use of animals in research, and to press other countries to adopt similar standards.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is already working to assist public bodies to equip themselves with the knowledge, skills and awareness to deliver climate friendly policies and services. We support the Sustainable Scotland Network to provide assistance to local authorities in meeting their commitments in Scotland&rsquo;s Climate Change Declaration, and the Scottish Climate Change Impacts Partnership is helping organisations to prepare for the impacts of climate change. Tailored support is provided by both the Carbon Trust and the Energy Saving Trust.</p>

  <p>We will continue to work with public bodies to consider what further support may be required to assist in compliance with climate change duties which are yet to be imposed on them, as section 44 of the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009 does not come into force until 1 January 2011.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its position is on the fact that only 10 single outcome agreements contain a specific reference to children affected by domestic abuse in the area profile, despite the publication of the <em>National Domestic Abuse Delivery Plan for Children and Young People</em> .</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-12-10.S3W-29406.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80331" speakername="Adam Ingram" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa1210.htm#5">

  <p>Single outcome agreements (SOAs) are designed to set out the agreed high level, strategic priorities of a community planning partnership (CCP). These are set out as local outcomes, each of which is aligned to at least one of the government&rsquo;s national outcomes. SOAs are not expected to describe how these local outcomes will be pursued, nor are they designed to capture all important activity undertaken by local community planning partners. Similarly, area profiles in the SOA will not include all statistics or information for the area.</p>

  <p>The national domestic abuse delivery plan&rsquo;s programme aim is to reduce the prevalence of domestic abuse and its impact on children, families and communities in Scotland. It was launched as a partnership between Scottish ministers and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities in June 2008. All key partners have signed up to it. The vast majority of CPPs have identified domestic abuse in their SOAs as a local priority, reflecting the importance community planning partners in Scotland place on improving outcomes for children, families and communities affected by this issue.</p>

  <p>The Fife Equally Well test site is one of eight that the Scottish Government is supporting to promote collaboration between local public services, aimed ultimately at reducing inequalities in the health and wellbeing of people who need most, or all, of those services. I visited the Fife test site in Kirkcaldy on 26 October.</p>

  <p>We are supporting the Fife site with over &pound;200,000 funding in 2009-10 and 2010-11. We are also addressing Scotland&rsquo;s unhealthy relationship with alcohol through measures in our alcohol bill for minimum pricing and banning irresponsible off-sales promotions; we would welcome the support of all members for these.</p>

  <p>The best way to reduce alcohol and drug-related crime is to get problem drug users into appropriate treatment and support services. We are committed to providing opportunities at all stages of the criminal justice system for people to access treatment.</p>

  <p>There are a number of excellent schemes operating across the country such as the Community Service Centre at Alness, which I visited on 27 November and saw some fine work being done in partnership with Apex and SACRO.</p>

  <p>On the same day, during a visit to Inverness Prison, I was also impressed by the work of the IMPACT group, which is a multi-agency project. IMPACT runs in the community and focuses on offering clients &quot;tools&quot; to help them in their recovery. Of 30 new service users who started attending the IMPACT group in 2008, 22 have gone on to the Progress to Work programme, 19 to Learn Direct and seven have gained employment.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the publication of <em>She Figures 2009: Statistics and Indicators on Gender Equality in Science </em> by the European Commission, what it is doing to encourage women to enter scientific disciplines and careers.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-12-10.S3W-29431.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80381" speakername="Michael Russell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa1210.htm#9">

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises gender inequality as a significant issue in science and engineering careers in Scotland, as it is in the UK and indeed in most European countries, as is set out in the report referred to in the question. This is not just about unfairness for individuals, important though that is, but it is also about the limitations on economic growth that arise from inefficient skills utilisation. This is however, a complex issue requiring action on many fronts, in many areas of education and lifelong learning policy. It is not simply about encouraging more women to enter scientific careers, but also about retaining them in those careers once qualified, given the much higher attrition rate for women than men in these careers. Overcoming gender inequalities in these careers will itself act to encourage greater uptake by women at earlier stages.</p>

  <p>Ministers decided in June 2009 that tackling occupational segregation would be one of two priorities for advancing equality between women and men. My predecessor was very keen to make progress on this issue in relation to academic careers and I intend to maintain that momentum. The Scottish Government is already supporting several areas of activity on reducing gender inequality in this area. The Scottish Government is, for example, an active partner in the Close the Gap initiative (together with Scottish Enterprise, Highlands and Islands Enterprise, Skills Development Scotland, the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the STUC) and is providing funding of over &pound;567,000 to the latest phase of the initiative until March 2011. This project aims to raise awareness about the gender pay gap and encourages action by employees and employers to tackle the causes, such as occupational segregation, and reduce the gap. Close the Gap is targeting colleges, universities and key sectors for the recovery of the economy, like life sciences. Further details can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.closethegap.org.uk/" target="_blank">http://www.closethegap.org.uk/</a>.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Further and Higher Education Council (SFC) is committed to looking at this issue as part of its overall aspiration to embed principles of equality and diversity across and within all its funded programmes. For example, SFC is currently working with Skills Development Scotland and the Scottish Government to address issues of occupational segregation, particularly within SFC-funded school-college partnership activity. It is intended that this will form a package of aligned initiatives that can respond to the issue of gender representation within Scotland&rsquo;s colleges and universities. SFC has committed funding of over &pound;320,000 to the Scottish Resource Centre for Women in Science Engineering and Technology, based at Napier University for a range of initiatives aimed at tackling gender inequality within the science, technology and engineering sectors. SFC is currently working on a pilot project with the sector skills organisation Constructionskills to provide equality and diversity training for students. SFC has in addition established the Scottish Research Career Co-ordination Forum to facilitate implementation of the research concordat. At this forum there has been discussion of how to support and retain women in research careers, including science, and there are plans to establish a sub-group to focus on supporting women in research careers. SFC are also planning more research on why only four of Scotland&rsquo;s universities have become members of the Athena Swan Charter, which commits institutions to high standards of gender equality. SFC is discussing with Universities Scotland how best to engage with Scottish HEIs regarding their participation in this charter.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the need to address this issue at all stages of the career spectrum. Our current &quot;Do something creative. Do science&quot; marketing campaign highlights a range of science careers and encourages young people to consider the opportunities available to them when they study science, regardless of their gender. Key aims are to tackle the stereotypes that many young people have about science, including the perception that science is &quot;just for boys&quot;. A range of case studies on the campaign website at <a href="http://www.infoscotland.com/science" target="_blank">www.infoscotland.com/science</a> provides useful information about male and female role models in science.</p>

  <p><strong>Rt Hon Elish Angiolini QC: </strong>The Scottish prison service, court service and Crown all ensure that accused are not remanded in custody beyond the terms of the court&rsquo;s warrant. Statistics are not maintained on the actual number of days that an accused remains in custody in terms of the court&rsquo;s warrant or warrants. The criminal justice system in Scotland works within very strict time limits to ensure that accused are brought to trial quickly. The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service prioritises the prosecution of serious crime in order to ensure that these limits are complied with and all custody cases are indicted within 80 days.</p>

  <p>The figures provided in the answer to question S2W-29301 were derived from Criminal Proceedings in Scottish Courts data up to 2004-05. While it is possible to update these figures on a comparable basis to 2006-07, the introduction of a new IT system within the courts meant that breaches of social work orders were no longer recorded as separate offences from 2007-08 and so have been excluded from the most recent Criminal Proceedings bulletin.</p>

  <p>More information on the changes is available in Annex C of the 2007-08 Court Proceedings bulletin at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/04/27103325/50" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2009/04/27103325/50</a>.</p>

  <p>Other, more up to date information on community sentences is currently collected on an annual basis from local authority social work departments. The social work statistics give somewhat different figures since they include cases where the outcome of the breach application is not known by the social work department. The equivalent information to that requested above can be found in table 3.1 of Criminal Justice Social Work Statistics, 2007-08 which is available at:</p>

  <p>The most recent available information is given in the 2007-08 criminal justice social work bulletin. This can be accessed at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/12/09091001/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/12/09091001/0</a>.</p>

  <p>Table 1.1 shows the number of community service orders issued and the number of breach applications, while table 3.1 gives information on breach applications and outcomes. Figures are for &quot;orders issued&quot; and &quot;applications for breach&quot; during the year, but &quot;orders issued&quot; during one year may be subject to breach applications in the next reporting year, and similarly, &quot;applications for breach&quot; may relate to orders issued in the previous year. Figures for 2008-09 will be published in the first quarter of 2010.</p>

  <p>On the effectiveness of community service orders, I refer the member to the Scottish Government statistical bulletin &quot;Reconviction Rates in Scotland&quot;, which provides comparative data for reconviction rates across the range of community and custodial penalties. The latest published edition covering cohorts for the periods 2005-06 and 2006-07 published in August 2009 can be accessed at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Crime-Justice/PubReconvictions" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Statistics/Browse/Crime-Justice/PubReconvictions</a>.</p>

  <p>It shows that of those sentenced to custodial sentences of six months or less, approximately 74% were reconvicted within two years, while only 42% of those sentenced to community service were reconvicted during the same period.</p>

  <p>Data on the precise number of cases where the disclosure process has revealed sexual offences committed by prospective host parents is not available. This is because the variety of ways the position of host parent is described on disclosure applications makes it difficult to draw down aggregated statistics. Of those applications which were specifically identified as relating to host parents in 2008-09, 7% had convictions disclosed. We cannot confirm the detail of those offences, whether those were sexual offences nor any action that organisations may have taken as a result. Disclosure Scotland does not routinely gather information on what recruitment decisions are made following receipt of the disclosure certificate. For this reason, knowledge of the deterrent effect of disclosure in these cases is anecdotal and it is not appropriate to comment on particular cases.</p>

  <p>Following discussions with opposition parties and the NUS around the recent consultation paper, <em>Supporting a Smarter Scotland</em>, we have matched the income of dependent and independent students.

  <p>Scotland did not take part in the OECD&rsquo;s Teaching and Learning International Survey (TALIS), which underpinned this report but the findings do provide interesting points of comparison with the Scottish system.</p>

  <p>For example, the report indicates &quot;that much can be gained by integrating professional development in the total work package of teachers&quot;. It is a core part of the Teachers&rsquo; Agreement in Scotland that all teachers should have 35 hours per year contractual CPD time (in addition to five days of in-service time in each school year). The agreement also put in place a requirement for each teacher to engage in professional review and development with their line manager each year and to identify professional development needs on the basis of individual, school and national priorities, which is in line with the suggestion in the report that greater &quot;emphasis on appraisal and feedback could strengthen its benefits in schools&quot;.</p>

  <p>As well as tending to confirm that many of the structural supports for teachers&rsquo; professional development in Scotland are sound, the report also suggests ways in which that professional development can best be focused to support improved learning and teaching. These include that professional development is most effective when it is collaborative and focused directly on the learning environment. To a significant extent this mirrors the findings on continuing professional development in HM Inspectorate of Education&rsquo;s (HMIE) recent report, <em>Improving Teaching, Improving Learning</em>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will continue to work with partners to ensure that lessons and effective practice, as identified in this report and elsewhere, are utilised within Scotland. This will be particularly important in the context of the wide-ranging review of teacher education (including the full range of professional development for teachers), to be led by Graham Donaldson (currently Her Majesty&rsquo;s Senior Chief Inspector) and due to commence in January 2010.</p>
