  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of reports that the UK Government will implement legislation requiring Roman Catholic adoption agencies to handle applications from same-sex couples, whether it will implement the terms of the equalities legislation or raise the issue with the UK Government so that matters involving religious conscience will be taken into account.</p>

  <p>The Prime Minister&rsquo;s announcement of 29 January 2007 indicated an intention by the UK Government to bring forward regulations on discrimination in provision of goods and services under powers in section 81 of the Equality Act 2006, which would be applied in the case of existing adoption agencies from the end of 2008. These powers relate to a matter reserved under the Scotland Act 1998 and enable such regulations to apply in England, Scotland and Wales. As the Prime Minister&rsquo;s announcement made clear, he took account of representations made personally to him by the First Minister on the issue. During the transitional period up to the end of 2008 the Scottish Executive will continue to keep in close contact with the agencies concerned, the Catholic Church and the UK Government to seek to ensure that the agencies&rsquo; valuable work continues.</p>

This edition carried a variety of features on Robert Burns, and included a guide on how to host a Burns Supper. We also highlighted a range of Burns events being held by Scottish groups and societies internationally, as well as events taking place throughout Scotland.

  <p>Mr Smith originally raised his case against the Electoral Registration Officer in the Sheriff Court. Although his application for civil legal aid in this case was ultimately rejected, a fee of &pound;809.58 was paid to his legal representatives under special urgency procedures.</p>

  <p>The most recent appeal is to the Court of Session, sitting as the Registration Appeal Court. Civil legal aid for this appeal was granted in August 2004 and &pound;2,686.29 has been paid to date.</p>

  <p>Final accounts have yet to be submitted in this case. Therefore, the final legal aid bill is not yet known. However, solicitors are asked to estimate the final cost of a case before legal aid is granted. Mr Smith&rsquo;s representatives have estimated the final cost to be in excess of &pound;5,000.</p>

  <p>It is not customary for my officials to include guidance notes from the European Commission in scheme information packs sent to farmers/crofters. Instead, they ensure that they reflect the guidance, in such notes, in the notes for guidance (NFG) issued to farmers/crofters on the schemes concerned. Under the Suckler Cow Premium Scheme (SCPS) 2003, the need to include a minimum of 5% heifers on claims of 14 animals or more was set out in the NFG on page 2 under &quot;Main Changes&quot; and in section 2.4 under &quot;Heifer/cow limits&quot;. Additionally, the need to replace heifers when the heifer/cow ration fell below 5% was set out in the NFG in section 4.2.3 under &quot;Heifers calving&quot; and in the first paragraph of section 4.3 under &quot;Replacement and notification of animals&quot;.</p>

  <p>Costs of complying with the new provisions in EC Regulation 1/2005 on the transportation of animals are estimated to be:</p>

  <p>A one-off fee of &pound;40 for a driver competency test for drivers driving animals over 65km and up to eight hours or &pound;100 for drivers driving animals over eight hours.</p>

  <p>The inspection costs for vehicles used on journeys of over eight hours will be between &pound;50 and &pound;150. The approval certificate will last five years. There is no inspection of vehicles used on shorter journeys.</p>

  <p>Alterations to the ramp angles to some existing vehicles will be in the region of about &pound;100 (for the smallest vehicles and trailers) to &pound;10,000 for large multi-deck vehicles. This requirement will be phased in over five years.</p>

  <p>Some existing vehicles used for journeys over 12 hours may require mechanical ventilation, temperature monitoring and warning equipment and satellite navigation systems to be installed. The cost of this could range from &pound;1,750 to &pound;12,250 where it is necessary.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Revenue spending may differ from the allocation amounts for a number of reasons. First, the allocations given above are neither budgets nor spending targets for culture and related services. They are simply a component used in distributing the total block grant that the Executive provides to local authorities. Second, it is for each local authority to decide how best to allocate the resulting overall block grant across all its services, based on local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>2. Sources for Grant Aided Expenditure (GAE) are the GAE Green Books for 2003-04 to 2006-07. The GAE allocations provided are derived by aggregating over six sub-categories which together make up the cultural and related services GAE line: parks and open spaces; sports facilities and swimming pools; tourism; remainder of leisure and recreation; libraries, and museums and art galleries.</p>

  <p>3. Revenue expenditure is sourced from Local Financial Return (LFR) 2, completed by local authorities, which covers culture and related services. Expenditure figures for 2006-07 are not yet available.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>Information on in-patient/day case and out-patient waiting lists is collected via monthly censuses and published quarterly by ISD Scotland. Between census dates, thousands of patients are added to or removed from NHS boards&rsquo; waiting lists. There are many reasons for the removal of patients from lists, including for example, those seen at an out-patient clinic or admitted to hospital for treatment, those whose condition has improved and no longer require treatment, and those who move address outwith the NHS board area.</p>

  <p>In their follow up audit of <em>Planning ward nursing &ndash; legacy or design?</em> , Audit Scotland has acknowledged that significant progress has been made by the Executive and NHS boards in implementing their baseline report. This includes improvements to the information on the nursing workforce and workload, the development of a robust, standardised, national approach to workforce and workload planning. We continue to work with NHS boards, trade unions and professional bodies to ensure full implementation of all recommendations through a range of specific work streams, including the nursing and midwifery workforce and workload planning project which is scheduled to move into its final phase in April 2007.</p>

  <p>Forces monitor adherence to their custody policies through internal supervisory structures. Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Constabulary also regularly examines the care and custody of detainees, notes good practice and makes recommendations to improve prisoner care.</p>

  <p>External scrutiny is also provided by independent custody visitors (ICV) schemes. These visits are carried out regularly and without notice. ICVs are aware of the expected requirements laid out in force policies and speak to detainees during visits to confirm that their needs are being met.</p>

  <p>Please note that children are counted once for every pre-school they attend, so these figures may contain some double counting. In addition, in 2006 &quot;pre-school education&quot; was defined as &quot;in partnership with the local authority&quot; which was not the case in previous years, so figures are not directly comparable.</p>

  <p>Figures on the number of children registered for pre-school education are published each year in the pre-school and childcare statistics. The figures are based on a census taken in January of each year. The latest statistics were published in the <em>Pre-School and Childcare Statistics 2006</em> a copy of which is available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 40411).</p>

  <p>All contingent liabilities recorded in the accounts of the Executive and its agencies in each of the last five years can be found in the notes to the consolidated accounts which are available on the Scottish Executive website <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/Recent" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/Recent</a> . The contingent liabilities recorded by the Executive&rsquo;s non-departmental public bodies in each of the last five years will be found in the notes to their individual annual accounts which can be accessed at their websites. A contingent liability will be removed from the accounts if the circumstances which led to its original inclusion change and it no longer fits the criteria of a contingent liability.</p>

  <p>For the Executive and its agencies, finance teams maintain a record of all contingent liabilities throughout the year. Preparers of accounts will also consider any other information at the year-end and all items which meet the criteria of a contingent liability as outlined in the <em>Scottish Public Finance Manual</em> and the <em>Government Financial Reporting Manual</em> are disclosed in the annual accounts. This information is audited for compliance and completeness by Audit Scotland on behalf of the Auditor General. Decisions made by non-departmental public bodies are a matter for those bodies.

  <p>The Scottish ministers report to Parliament on such matters in accordance with the Budgeting Process Agreement agreed between the Executive and the Parliament: <br /> <a href="../../../business/committees/finance/Written Agreement between FC and Exec at 22.6.05.pdf">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/committees/finance/Written%20Agreement%20between%20FC%20and%20Exec%20at%2022.6.05.pdf</a></p>

  <p>The Scottish ministers must present their proposals to the Finance Committee before granting any guarantees or indemnities in excess of &pound;1 million (including those without limit). The Finance Committee will consider the proposal within 20 days and will either approve the proposal or propose an amendment. The Scottish ministers will either accept the amendment or notify the committee that they disagree and it will then be for the committee to decide to either allow the Scottish ministers to proceed or to refer the matter to the Parliamentary Bureau for a debate.</p>

  <p>The <em>Scottish Public Finance and Accountability Manual</em> (<em>SPFM</em>) sets out additional guidance on reporting contingent liabilities to Parliament. Per the <em>SPFM</em> contingent liabilities which arise in the normal course of business are not covered by the need for prior parliamentary approval unless expenditure at a later date may be of such a nature or size that the Parliament should be given notice. Consideration of whether to give notice will be on a case-by-case basis and depend on the circumstances of individual cases. Similarly, if a liability matures in respect of a previously contingent liability, ministers will consider whether to make a report to the Parliament.</p>

As a partner the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body contributed staff time and experience in helping to organise the event and established a number of internal and external working groups for the planning and organisation of the event. The costs associated with facilitating these working groups are in the region of &pound;175. In addition, the SPCB provided promotional materials about the Parliament which were distributed to all delegates at the GLF at a cost of about &pound;2,500 and contributed about &pound;1,700 towards the costs of ushering. The SPCB along with Microsoft and the Scottish Executive will meet estimated costs of &pound;6,000 between them for the youth programme at the GLF.
