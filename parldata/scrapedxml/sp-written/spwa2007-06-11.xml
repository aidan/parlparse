  <p>The Executive does not collect or hold data centrally relating to the types of empty properties in Scotland. However, an estimate of the amount of non-domestic rates not collected in respect of all empty and partially empty properties in Scotland, including industrial and commercial properties, is available from annual returns provided to the Executive by local authorities. The total audited amount reported for 2005-06 is &pound;131 million. The provisional (not yet audited) figure for 2006-07 is &pound;123 million.</p>

  <p>These figures however, are only indicative of the potential additional revenue that could be collected as these properties could be subject to revaluation following occupation, or a range of other forms of relief, depending on the nature of the business.</p>

  <p>The findings of the independent evaluation &ndash; <em>A Process Review of the Child Protection Reform Programme </em> - can be found on the Scottish Executive website&rsquo;s publications pages at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/03/13100337/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/03/13100337/0</a> .</p>

  <p>The Education Committee of the last session (13 December 2006) also considered a detailed update from the Scottish Executive on the various projects undertaken as part of the three-year reform programme and a link to that paper on the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s website is provided here at:</p>

  <p><a href="../../../business/committees/education/papers-06/edp06-27.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/committees/education/papers-06/edp06-27.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>The findings of the independent Process Review evaluation are:</p>

  <p>Documentary analysis evidenced the extent of discussion with, and involvement of, a range of stakeholders throughout the CPRP (Child Protection Reform Programme).</p>

  <p>Children and young people in Dundee have developed a resource pack about the Children&rsquo;s Charter &ndash; &quot;Charterman&quot; - as part of an Enterprise in Education challenge. The pack explains the key messages of the charter in a manner accessible to children and young people.</p>

  <p>Before child protection training, social workers in adult settings expressed anxiety about making a mistake, described feelings of being overwhelmed, and indicated the need for clarity about their roles and responsibilities.</p>

  <p>Media coverage tended to focus on adult offending and substance misuse and few explicit links were drawn between systems to tackle these and the CPRP; however, concepts relating to the CPRP were covered in the context of local authority and health board initiatives.</p>

  <p>There was an overwhelming consensus that the CPRP has been successful in meeting its aims and objectives and has lead to improvements at a national and local level.</p>

  <p>Respondents noted increased public and professional awareness of children&rsquo;s needs for care and protection.</p>

  <p>All sub-projects of the CPRP were influential; the Framework for Standards&rsquo; and guidance for CPCs tended to be singled out as particularly important.</p>

  <p>Much of the success so far was attributed to the extensive work and commitment put in by staff, at all levels in all key agencies, in taking the national policy agenda forward locally.</p>

  <p>The majority of respondents both agreed that practice to safeguard the welfare of children had improved (71%), and that policy had improved (75%); nearly two-thirds (62%) agreed that practice changes were for the better for children; two-thirds agreed (66%) that policy changes were.</p>

  <p>Of the 166 who had heard of the CPRP two-thirds (65%) agreed with the aims and 80% felt that it built on good practice.</p>

  <p>Whether professionals had specifically heard of the CPRP or not, they were clearly aware of changes in policy and practice and were largely in support of the direction of change.</p>

  <p>In both the survey and focus groups professionals described significant improvements in the amount of awareness, information sharing and joint working; they considered that there had been a rise in a sense of shared responsibility for identifying the unmet needs of children and helping to meet those needs.</p>

  <p>In the survey and in focus groups there was a strongly expressed view that increased awareness had lead to an increased workload for all professions and that this had impacted on resources.</p>

  <p>Our overarching priority is faster and more sustainable economic growth. We start from the ambition and belief that we can rank among the top 15 most competitive nations in the world and at least match United Kingdom growth in the lifetime of this Parliament.</p>

  <p>Economic success is the prerequisite of every other government priority, whether that is a world-class education system, a properly funded and respected national health service or getting people into employment as a means of fostering a sense of responsibility and social cohesion.</p>

  <p>We believe it is time for a new economic approach for Scotland, built on a shared desire to increase our nation&rsquo;s competitiveness. We will set out this New Economic Approach to Parliament and publish it in full in the autumn; this will set the context for our broader economic growth strategy and for the spending review.</p>

  <p>The findings of the Review of Scotland&rsquo;s Colleges have yet to be reported to me by the core group of stakeholders responsible for co-ordinating the review. I am grateful for the time and effort which stakeholder organisations have invested in the review, and I await their findings with keen interest.

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland has agreed Performance Standards with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations which set common standards for all social landlords. Working on behalf of Scottish ministers, our aim is to protect the interests of all tenants to make sure they receive a good standard of service, no matter where their landlord operates.

  <p>The Government is currently in the process of introducing a new NHS Pre-registration Pharmacist Scheme. It is being developed and will be administered by NHS Education for Scotland. The scheme will be introduced fully from the beginning of the 2008-09 academic year and provide funding for a similar number of places as currently required in Scotland &ndash; between 160 and 170. The scheme will provide for both hospital and community placements and, unlike at present, all places will be fully funded from Government resources.</p>

  <p>The purpose of the scheme is to ensure that every pre-registration pharmacist funded by NHS Scotland receives the same high-quality training opportunity, support and experience regardless of the practice setting, and are familiar with the practice requirements of the new community pharmacy contract.</p>

  <p>Community pharmacy contractors are required to produce a practice leaflet giving customer advice on the NHS services offered.</p>

  <p>The new community pharmacy contract is designed to make better use of the professional skills of community pharmacy in providing direct patient care. This consists of four core services, two of which are already in operation: the Minor Ailment Service (MAS) and Public Health Service (PHS). The two remaining elements of the contract will be phased in during 2008: the Acute Medication Service (AMS) and Chronic Medication Service (CMS).</p>

  <p>The two core services in place have been publicised by means of leaflets and posters for display in community pharmacies, GP practices and libraries. Patient information leaflets are planned for the two remaining core services as they are introduced.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it intends to amend planning law to allow local referenda to determine planning applications and, if so, in what circumstances and for which type of application; what distinguishes one type of planning application from any other for the purpose of a local referendum being invoked; what the status would be of professional advice and recommendations on any application by local authority or Executive officials; how any such changes will affect the rights of applicants to have their applications considered in terms of planning law; whether appeals against a decision by a local referendum could be made and to whom; who would be responsible in law for any such planning decision, and how the geographic boundaries of any area to have such a referendum would be determined.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to amend planning law as set out in the question. However, under the programme of planning modernisation following the passage of the Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006, it is clear that public participation in the planning process is important. Views of the public, where based on relevant planning matters, will be material considerations that should be taken into account when considering proposals. Local communities and their representatives are free to organise referenda to elicit such community views, and we encourage them to do so where they feel that the circumstances merit such an approach.</p>

  <p>The figures shown are rounded to the nearest &pound;0.01 million and are adjusted to take account of accruals. They are for new construction and minor improvement schemes that have been completed, and do not include maintenance costs. Preparation costs on schemes are only included where construction has been completed. The figures do not include service payments on the completed A74(M) / M6 DBFO (between Abington and the Border) and M77 Design, Build, Finance and Operate schemes.</p>

  <p>Complete figures for 1999-2000 and 2000-01 are not available. The figures for 2006-07 show the estimated outturn but some minor adjustments may still be made until the accounts for the year are closed.</p>

  <p>Expenditure on minor trunk road improvement schemes in 2006-07 on a route basis has not been published yet. However, expenditure on these schemes, split by Trunk Road Unit area, is shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>The following tables show (a) how much has been spent on accident remedial schemes on each Trunk Road in financial year 2006-07 and (b) how much has been spent in each Trunk Road Operating Company area on non-route specific safety improvements in financial year 2006-07.</p>

  <p>Road safety improvements are also delivered as an integral element of larger trunk road improvement and maintenance schemes or by national education programmes. It is not possible to quantify the proportion of the costs of these schemes which specifically relate to road safety improvements.</p>

  <p>There have been no detailed cost estimates made of dualling the A9, A96, or A77. Any future investment in these routes will emerge from the Strategic Transport Projects Review which is due to report in summer 2008. Details of the current investment programme, including the costs of building the M74 and the Aberdeen Western peripheral route, are available on the Transport Scotland website <a href="http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/defaultpage1221cde0.aspx?pageID=20" target="_blank">http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/defaultpage1221cde0.aspx?pageID=20</a> .</p>

  <p>Assessment of the costs associated with constructing a new Forth crossing is being made as part of the Forth Replacement Crossing Study. Transport Scotland is currently considering the draft reports from the study and will make its recommendation to Cabinet to allow ministers to make a decision in summer 2007.</p>

  <p>The Strategic Transport Projects Review will identify a programme of nationally strategic transport interventions for the period 2012 to 2022.</p>

  <p>Any potential improvements to the transport networks in Dumfries and Galloway, including the trunk roads will be considered on their merits within the STPR.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has the operational responsibility for this area, and can be contacted for more information, if required.</p>

  <p>Existing investment plans will see schools continuing to be built and refurbished across Scotland to the end of this decade. In the case of Aberdeenshire, several communities are already benefiting from recently built schools in line with priorities identified by the council.</p>

  <p>We recognise though that there is yet more to be done to improve the school estate across Scotland. Further financial support for that purpose will need to be considered in the context of the forthcoming spending review.</p>

  <p>Following publication of the Report last June, a COPFS Implementation Team was established to implement the fifty recommendations of the review over the three year programme to which the Law Officers committed.</p>

  <p>Fourteen recommendations have now been implemented in full. Prosecutors have been provided with new guidance on fundamental aspects of revised practice and policy, including instructions about the basis on which prosecutors take decisions about prosecution and bail in such cases. At the heart of the work scheduled over the remaining two years is the development of a programme of specialist training to found the basis of the system of certification for COPFS staff. The training will commence in spring 2008 and all staff investigating serious sexual offence cases within COPFS will be certified according to departmental criteria by June 2009.</p>
