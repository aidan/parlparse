  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-16265 by Allan Wilson on 9 May 2005 and in light of the fact that none of the CORGI council members with a Scottish mandate and very few members from the rest of the United Kingdom were consulted prior to the introduction of CORGI&rsquo;s Gaswork Notification Scheme, whether it is still the Executive&rsquo;s intention not to intervene on behalf of small business and trades people in Scotland to ensure that the needs of Scotland are fully taken into account by UK-wide quangos.</p>

  <p>The Executive has been liaising with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) about developments and I know that Lord Hunt, the UK minister responsible for the Health and Safety Commission and Executive (HSC/E), has recently written to The Scottish and Northern Ireland Plumbing Employers&rsquo; Federation (SNIPEF) encouraging it to make good use of the position it holds on the CORGI Council to raise the matters that concern the federation. He has also confirmed that it is not for ministers or the HSC/E to intervene between CORGI and its members. My officials will continue their contact with HSE on this matter.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the launch of the National Forest Land Scheme, what estimate has been made of any increased demand for funding from the Scottish Land Fund for community forest purchases additional to other community buy-outs before (a) 2007 and (b) 2011.</p>

  <p>Community take up of the opportunity to purchase land under the National Forest Land Scheme is difficult to predict with any accuracy, as is any subsequent application for public assistance in funding purchase.</p>

  <p>The Executive is aware of a small number of community groups &ndash; less than 10 - who might consider purchasing land under the new scheme.</p>

  <p>As with other community buy-outs the Big Lottery Fund Scottish Land Fund is only one source of potential public and private sector assistance available to communities considering land purchase. Decisions on awards from the fund are made by the Scottish Land Fund Committee on a case-by-case basis.</p>

  <p>Under the provisions of the National Forest Land Scheme recognised environmental, cultural heritage or recreational non-governmental organisations (NGOs) have the opportunity to buy land in certain circumstances.</p>

  <p>The Big Lottery Fund Scottish Land Fund can only consider applications for assistance from community bodies. NGOs wishing to purchase national forest land under the new scheme are not eligible for assistance from the Big Lottery Fund Scottish Land Fund.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what assessment it has made of the possible impact on voluntary organisations of receiving funding in arrears instead of in advance.</p>

  <p>Payment in arrears is in accordance with the Scottish Public Finance Manual and is intended to avoid the spending of public funds in advance of need, which is why this arrangement is preferred. There is flexibility, however, as the manual allows alternative grant payment arrangements to reduce the risk of financial difficulties for voluntary organisations. Accordingly, no assessment has been made of the impact on voluntary organisations of the Scottish Executive paying grants in arrears.</p>
