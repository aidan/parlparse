  <p>It has long been the Scottish Executive&#8217;s policy to move the emphasis of spending on learning disability services away from hospital provision. The learning disability change funds we provided from 2001-02 are a lever for moving the balance towards services in the community. There has also been a significant shift in spending away from hospital provision towards supporting people with learning disabilities to live in the community.</p>

  <p>The number of individuals with learning disabilities in long-stay hospitals has been coming down for some time, and at October 2002 was around 900. Lennox Castle near Glasgow closed in May 2002, Birkwood Hospital in Lanarkshire in September 2002, and the Royal Scottish National Hospital at Larbert closed in early 2003.</p>

  <p>Many people with learning disabilities who formerly lived in a hospital are now living in the community, with packages of care and support tailored to meet their individual needs.</p>

  <p>A Short Life Working Group of the national The same as you? Implementation Group is preparing a report on hospital closures which is due soon. Its recommendations will be intended to help ensure the 2005 target is met.</p>

  <p>As we note in our Lifelong Learning Strategy <em>Life through Learning; Learning through Life</em> , which was published in February of this year, uneven access to lifelong learning has the capacity to entrench inequalities. Our goal is to create a Scotland where people have the chance to learn, irrespective of their background or current personal circumstances and we are clear that the mainstreaming of equality into policy and legislation development is a key driver in realising this aim.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to inclusive policies that allow all students to participate fully in further education and achieve their potential. Substantial funds have been allocated towards this and compliance with the Special Educational Needs and Disability Act 2001. People with a disability affecting learning form one of the priority groups for action on the promotion of adult literacy and numeracy.</p>

  <p>&#163;4.5 million has been allocated from Beattie funding to improve support for students in further education and develop inclusiveness. The BRITE Centre initiative at Stevenson College has been established to equip staff with the skills to assess and support students with additional needs. Over 80 staff from every college are participating in the initiative.</p>

  <p>We announced on 26 September 2002 that we have commissioned research into the needs of people with learning disabilities who are in prison or secure accommodation. This will find out what type of services they receive, and identify any gaps in provision across health, education and welfare services.

  <p>The research is being done by the Scottish Development Centre for Mental Health. Work should be completed at the end of October 2003.</p>

  <p>We are keen to ensure dissemination of best practice.

  <p>We have provided funding for the establishment of the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability. Part of the consortium&#8217;s remit is to:</p>

  <p>foster and develop best practice, and make it accessible. This is available from the consortium&#8217;s homepage (Good Practice in <em>The same as you?</em> ) on its website at www.scld.org.uk This brings together information on best practice from across Scotland for everyone, including local authorities.</p>

  <p>develop a skilled and confident workforce by improving training standards and providing training. Local authority staff attend such training. All the consortium&#8217;s courses have people with learning disabilities and family carers as co-trainers.</p>

  <p>We have established the Partnership in Practice Network, comprising representatives from local authorities and the NHS across Scotland. This meets on a regular three-monthly basis to discuss current issues and to share experience, and it provides a forum for exchanging and developing good practice.</p>

  <p>We have established the Scottish Social Services Council, whose function includes to raise the standard of practice and to promote the education and training of the social care workforce, including those working in local authorities.</p>

  <p>We ran three major conferences on learning disabilities in 2002, looking at best practice and experience in learning disability databases, autistic spectrum disorders and hospital closures. These had significant attendance form local authorities across Scotland.</p>

The guidance issued by HM Treasury and Office of the Deputy Prime Minister suggests a number of high-level business, technical and communications issues that local authorities should consider to assist in their euro preparations. The nature of this work is similar to that which other public sector bodies have undertaken which has not required incremental additional expenditure.</p>

  <p>Following the chancellor&#8217;s statement on 9 June 2003, a Scottish Euro Preparations Committee has been established. The role of the committee will be to provide leadership on euro preparations in Scotland. COSLA will represent local authorities on this committee.</p>

  <p>The provision of services tailored to meet individual need and in an appropriate setting is a cornerstone of community care policy. Local authorities have a duty under the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to assess the needs of, and provide appropriate services to, people who appear to need them. This would qualify non-elderly disabled people for respite care where the local authority assessed this as necessary.</p>

  <p>In 1999 the Scottish Executive doubled the funds available to local authorities for respite care and the support of carers from &#163;5 million per year to &#163;10 million through the <em>Strategy for Carers</em>. The Executive has made available additional resources, rising to &#163;11 million per year, in response to the <em>Royal Commission Report on Long Term Care</em>. It is up to local authorities to decide how these resources should best be deployed to meet local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>I can, however, confirm that wind farms are not excluded from Ministry of Defence TTAs. The policy of the MOD is that each proposal to construct a wind farm in the UK (including within a TTA) is considered on its own merits and the Planning Authority is advised accordingly.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to working with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) communities in Scotland in order to ensure that our work is informed of the issues of concern to these communities. Some examples of mainstreaming for LGBT communities include:</p>

  <p>The Your Scotland project run by Equality Network and funded by the Scottish Executive. This project is developing structures to widen and improve consultation with LGBT people across Scotland, undertaking consultation with the LGBT communities, and strengthening the LGBT communities' input to policy-making.</p>

  <p>A complementary project, Have Your Say, is being taken forward through LGBT Youth Scotland to engage with LGBT young people.</p>

  <p>To inform the consultation process, the Scottish Executive has funded Beyond Barriers to produce a database and directory of grassroots LGBT organisations across Scotland, and other organisations with an interest in LGBT equality.</p>

  <p>In addition, a major research project examining the availability of data on LGBT communities and the need for further data and information is helping us to identify research priorities and informing our approach to LGBT equality work.</p>
