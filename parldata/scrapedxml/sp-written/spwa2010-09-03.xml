  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what services are not proposed to be part of the 12-week guaranteed maximum waiting time contained in the Patient Rights (Scotland) Bill; what guarantees will be for a shorter period than 12 weeks, and for what provisions.</p>

  <p>The Patient Rights (Scotland) Bill was introduced to the Scottish Parliament on 17 March 2010. The policy content of the bill is set out in the Policy Memorandum. The bill is now going through the parliamentary process and the final shape of the bill will be a matter for Parliament.</p>

  <p>The current waiting time standards and targets which are less than 12 weeks are access to the GP practice team, key diagnostic tests, cancer, accident and emergency, drug rehabilitation. The Scottish Government expects NHS boards to deliver on these standards and targets as well as implementing recommendations on access contained in clinical guidelines.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether, under the Patient Rights (Scotland) Bill, it will retain a waiting time guarantee for diagnostic procedures as at present or have a specific guarantee included under the overall referral to treatment guarantee.</p>

  <p>The current waiting time standard of six weeks for key diagnostic tests is a milestone target towards delivery of the 18 weeks referral to treatment target. Recently published waiting time statistics for 30 June 2010, showed that NHSScotland effectively delivered a four week wait for the key diagnostic tests.</p>

  <p>It is intended that by late Spring next year to publish data showing NHSScotland&rsquo;s performance against the 18 weeks referral to treatment time target. We will however continue to publish stage of treatment waiting times, including waits for key diagnostic tests to ensure that all patients are accessing these services quickly.</p>
