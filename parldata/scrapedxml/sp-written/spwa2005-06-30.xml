  <p>I am pleased to announce that we are today publishing our detailed response to the report of the second phase of the adoption policy review, which was published on 10 June 2005.</p>

  <p>The Executive accepts almost all of the report&rsquo;s recommendations, and strongly supports its central proposal for a new legal framework for those children who can no longer live with their families, to complement adoption. Responses to the consultation paper are invited by 31 October 2005.</p>

  <p>The report is available at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/06/27140607" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2005/06/27140607</a>.</p>

  <p>Printed copies of the report and our consultation paper will be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre in the next week (Bib. numbers 36862 and 36863 respectively).</p>

Part of VisitScotland&rsquo;s international marketing budget was spent, however, on campaigns which promoted direct access routes.

  <p>The Route Development Fund does not currently provide marketing support for new air routes. The criteria used by VisitScotland for route prioritisation and marketing investment are, however, as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>Importance of the market &ndash; current size of the market to the UK and to Scotland; growth potential outbound in general and to Scotland; product fit for the touring, city breaks, golf, walking, ancestral and business tourism portfolios.</p>
<p>Scope of service to increase inbound traffic &ndash; number of seats and percentage of those inbound, attractiveness of fare structure, and the scope to generate visitors from those areas of a country which have greatest propensity for outbound tourism.</p>
<p>Opportunity to make an impact in the market &ndash; whether VisitScotland already has a base of activity in the market place, and active investment by airlines in the promotion of Scotland routes.</p>

  <p>The Route Development Fund (RDF) channels its support to routes which deliver a net economic benefit for Scotland. These will be to routes which are likely to enhance business connectivity or which have the potential to bring appreciable numbers of inbound tourists to Scotland. The level of investment in new routes is determined by the results of route economic appraisals.</p>

  <p>The criteria are:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>The proposed route must be a new route;</p>
<p>The route must deliver a net economic benefit to the Scottish economy based on its projected carryings of inbound and outbound business passengers and inbound leisure passengers;</p>
<p>An international route serving Aberdeen or Dundee airports must be operated year-round, at an average frequency (over two consecutive scheduling seasons) of at least three round trip services per week. Key UK domestic air services can also be supported; </p>
<p>An international route serving Edinburgh and Glasgow Airports must be operated year-round, at an average frequency (over two consecutive scheduling seasons) of at least five round trip services per week, and</p>
<p>The level of frequency for new air services in the Highlands and Islands is flexibly applied and the fund can be used to support intra-Scotland, intra-UK and seasonal services. This reflects the ability of the areas to sustain air services in the long-term and the Executive&rsquo;s aim that the fund should be inclusive and embrace all of Scotland&rsquo;s diverse communities.</p>

  <p>The minimum frequency thresholds for support from the Route Development Fund (RDF) have been reduced in the case of international routes from Aberdeen and Dundee, in recognition of their relatively limited catchment sizes, relative lack of international services, and distance from the Edinburgh and Glasgow International Airports.</p>

  <p>The Housing Bill currently before Parliament would require those selling a domestic property to provide certain information to potential purchasers. The information in this purchaser&rsquo;s information pack will be prescribed in regulations. We expect it to include a property condition survey &ndash; the Single Survey - and documents such as a Property Enquiry Certificate, details of factoring arrangements and warranties, guarantees and planning permissions for major works including extensions, roofs and timber treatment, all of which are presently provided to the purchaser towards the end of the transaction. As householders are not generally required to have gas or electrical safety certificates, we do not plan to include them in the requirements for the pack. We do, however, expect the Single Survey to include information relating to the general condition and functionality of the gas and electrical appliances.</p>

<p>The answer to S2W-17037 incorrectly gave the link to the Reliance contract. The correct link to the Kilmarnock Contract is: <a href="http://www.sps.gov.uk/keydocs/kilmarnock/ContractSchE.htm" target="_blank">http://www.sps.gov.uk/keydocs/kilmarnock/ContractSchE.htm</a>. </p>
