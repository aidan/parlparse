<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-04-29.S3W-33229.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80393" speakername="Stewart Stevenson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0429.htm#3">

  <p>The text of the letter to the UK Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, issued on 13 April 2010, is as follows.</p>

  <p>I understand that the UK has been invited to a meeting of the Major Economies Forum on Energy and Climate in Washington on 18-19 April.</p>

  <p>In light of the current General Election and the uncertainty over UK policy direction, Scottish Ministers consider that it would be more appropriate for a Scottish minister to represent the UK on this occasion. As you know, there are recent precedents for Scottish ministers representing the UK abroad.</p>

  <p>Scotland has an excellent basis from which to engage with the international community on climate change. We have made the commitment to act as a model of international best practice in tackling climate change and to a world-leading level of ambition of 42% cuts in emissions by 2020. We have particular strengths in renewable energy, carbon capture and storage and forestry all of which are important to the international agenda. Developing countries in particular need to hear more examples of high ambition from the developed world at what is a crucial time for re-invigorating the international negotiations. Of course, we were disappointed that Scottish ministers did not have a place on the UK delegation to Copenhagen but the forum presents an excellent opportunity for the UK Government to more fully involve all parts of the UK in its international work.</p>

  <p>There are further areas where actions in Scotland will be of particular interest to the international community. The UK Government&rsquo;s International Climate Change Action Plan published last week sets out the need for new alliances between developed and developing countries and also the position of small island states that are in the front line of the impacts of climate change. In Copenhagen, the First Minister and the President of the Maldives, an observer on the forum, made a joint statement announcing a Partnership on climate change that won the praise of the international community. Since then, our co-operation with the Maldives on the partnership has made good progress and a further announcement will be made at the earliest opportunity. Partnerships like this are a vital link between those countries strongly committed to tackling climate change and countries which are particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, and such partnerships can underpin broader international negotiations.</p>

  <p>The action plan also in several places mentions the importance of forestry globally. As a tangible outcome from the Copenhagen conference, the Scottish Government has pledged that 100 million trees will be planted in Scotland by 2015 as Scotland&rsquo;s contribution to a pledge by The Climate Group States and Regions Alliance to plant 1 billion trees to persuade governments, businesses and communities worldwide to plant a tree for everyone on the planet. I hope you will agree that this is another excellent practical example of concrete action within the UK designed to maintain the momentum from Copenhagen.</p>

  <p>As you may know, Scotland has been an active member of The Climate Group&rsquo;s States and Regions Alliance for many years and has many useful international contacts in that network. During the UNFCCC meetings in Barcelona and Copenhagen, the First Minister and our Minister for Climate Change made a number of very useful bilateral contacts, including from the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, France, Germany, Spain, Ireland and Norway.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers are determined to play our part in the UK and EU international leadership effort to secure significant progress during 2010 towards Cancun and a legally-binding treaty. You can be reassured that Scottish Ministers will continue to work with and support the UK Government in this important international agenda and I look forward to a positive response to my proposal that the Scottish Government should represent the UK at the forthcoming meeting.</p>

  <p>Any violence in schools in unacceptable. The Scottish Government is committed to helping schools create peaceful and positive learning environments and is working to tackle serious indiscipline and violence in a variety of ways.</p>

  <p>Behaviour in Scottish Schools Research 2009 shows that local authorities and schools use a wide range of approaches to promote positive behaviour and deal with negative behaviour including; developing a positive ethos; whole school approaches such as restorative and solution oriented approaches; curricular programmes in social and emotional wellbeing; broad curriculum and individualised learning packages, and additional support and provision within and beyond the school. We fund the positive behaviour team (&pound;600,000 pa) to support local authorities in promoting and embedding these approaches.</p>

  <p>PFI revenue costs accounted for 5.0% of total gross local authority education expenditure in 2008-09. This is a rise of 1.2% on the previous year and compares with 0.4% in 2000-01.</p>

  <p>I have accepted the unanimous advice from the Curriculum for Excellence management board that the implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence programme by August 2010 is realistic and achievable. The board includes representation from the Association of Headteachers and Deputes in Scotland, the Educational Institute in Scotland, School Leaders Scotland and the Scottish Secondary Teachers&rsquo; Association amongst others.</p>

  <p>The EIS alone favoured a one year delay to the introduction of the new qualifications. I met with them on 29 April to continue discussions on addressing their concerns.</p>

  <p>We are also progressing with the 10-point action plan I announced on 30 March to provide establishments and individual teachers with the necessary support for implementation of Curriculum for Excellence.</p>

  <p>Yes. Figures published as part of the Teacher Census in 2009 confirm that pupil to teacher ratios in publicly-funded schools remain close to their lowest ever levels in Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition to the existing provisions for continuing professional development (CPD) for teachers (under which each teacher must engage in 35 hours CPD per year and participate in five in-service days per year), the Scottish Government has acted to increase the capacity for teachers to engage in professional development focused on Curriculum for Excellence. This has included enabling the provision of four additional in-service days, over three school years, for every teacher.</p>

  <p>Besides the impact on Scottish employers in the private sector the increase in national insurance contribution rates will result in approximately &pound;104 million of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s budget being returned to the Treasury in the form of higher tax payments. Were the money to stay in Scotland it could pay for approximately 2,300 more police officers or 4,000 more nurses each year.</p>

  <p>We have made it clear that we disagree with this increase especially when the country is emerging from a long and severe recession. We will continue to protest that this cut should be reversed to avoid further burdens on Scottish employers and protect front line public services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Supplier collaboration, including consortia bidding, is one of a number of key procurement issues being considered by the recently established Supplier Engagement Working Group. The group brings together representatives from the public, private and third sectors and is exploring additional ways to enhance the economic impact of public procurement and improve access to contract opportunities, particularly, by smaller organisations. The group, chaired by Liz Cameron of the Scottish Chamber of Commerce, will report on progress to the Public Procurement Reform Board at its next meeting in June.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will be responding to the EU consultation on sport policy. The UK Government is co-ordinating the response.</p>

  <p>However, Sport is a devolved responsibility and Scotland is recognised as having a different approach and the Scottish Government will ensure that the interests of Scottish Sport are represented in any UK wide response to the consultation. That makes it even more important for us to feed into the development of any UK-wide response to the consultation. We are actively engaged with the UK Government on how Scotland can help shape the UK position.</p>

  <p>The Water Industry Commission for Scotland (WICS) is the independent economic regulator for the water industry in Scotland. Its detailed operating costs, including subsistence and entertainment costs, are matters for WICS to determine. I have asked Alan Sutherland, Chief Executive of WICS, to respond to you directly on the detail of your questions.</p>

  <p>I met with Sir Ian Byatt, WICS&rsquo; chair, on 14 April 2010 and reminded him that ministers, and the public, expect a high level of financial stringency from our public bodies, particularly in the current challenging economic climate.</p>
