  <p>The Scottish Executive is preparing draft freedom of information legislation, which will be published for consultation and pre-legislative scrutiny prior to its introduction to the Parliament. This and last year&#8217;s consultation exercise should help raise awareness in the public sector and beyond of the forthcoming Scottish freedom of information legislation.</p>

  <p>Detailed preparation of the public sector for implementation of freedom of information needs to be associated with the development of the legislation. Accordingly, the Executive is progressing with arrangements to establish a working group to oversee the work on preparing the way for the successful implementation of the legislation.</p>

  <p>It is envisaged that the Scottish Information Commissioner will play a key role in promoting freedom of information, raising awareness of the legislation and preparing the public sector for its implementation.</p>

  <p>Regulation of abattoirs is primarily within the remit of The Food Standards Agency. The agency has informed me that the chances of infectivity entering an abattoir are very small. Checks operated by the Meat Hygiene Service ensure that each bovine animal entering the abattoir is subject to official inspection and all suspect BSE cases, and cattle aged over thirty months, are excluded by abattoirs processing meat for human consumption.</p>

  <p>In addition, Regulations require that the equipment used for the removal of Specified Risk Material is dedicated to that purpose and is not used on meat destined for the human food chain.</p>

  <p>The agency has two relevant projects that are nearing completion. One project is looking at procedures for stunning and pithing and the other is investigating aerosol production when splitting carcasses. The agency is fully committed both to openness of information and to the overriding need to safeguard consumers. They will therefore urgently advise on any required action arising from the results of such research.</p>

  <p>The Church of Scotland&#8217;s concern about the cost of criminal record checks for their volunteers is being considered by the Part V Voluntary Issues Review Group which is chaired by Jackie Baillie, Deputy Minister for Communities. The review group, which includes a representative from the Scottish Churches Committee, is considering the impact of the introduction of criminal record checks under Part V of the Police Act 1997 on voluntary organisations and is reviewing charging issues and policies as they apply to the voluntary sector. Progress is being made and we hope that the group will reach conclusions later this year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress has been made with providing the Scottish Environment Protection Agency with the additional regulatory powers for any necessary strengthening of existing water pollution control legislation as identified in the report <i>Improving Scotland&#8217;s Water Environment</i> which the Minister for Transport and the Environment launched last year.</p>

  <p>I am determined to reduce water pollution. The environmental quality of Scotland&#8217;s waters is generally very good, but there are some significant problems, for example in some bathing waters. We need to ensure that SEPA has the tools to tackle those.</p>

  <p>A consultation paper will be released today on new powers for SEPA to serve Enforcement Notices on holders of discharge consents where a condition of consent is being contravened or where a contravention is likely. These powers will be used as part of SEPA&#8217;s regulatory and enforcement procedure and will not preclude prosecution. They will enable the agency to require action to be taken before pollution occurs. Such notices will be powerful and flexible tools, which will benefit the environment directly by promoting improvements in the quality of discharges and the operation of processes.</p>

  <p>Enforcement Notices form part of a series of measures which we have in hand to strengthen the powers of SEPA to protect and improve the water environment. Earlier this year I announced proposals to enable SEPA to issue anti-pollution works notices to polluters or potential polluters requiring them to clean-up or take precautionary measures. I also announced consultation on measures extending SEPA&#8217;s powers to serve notices requiring appropriate work to certain farm storage structures, which will also relax existing rules to encourage maintenance of these structures on farms. I intend to make regulations soon which will bring these proposals into effect.</p>

  <p>It is for the Lord Advocate and the court in each individual case to determine whether or not an error in a search warrant renders court proceedings inappropriate or unsafe. The courts have discretion to excuse irregularities which are not fundamental to the validity of the warrant. The Lord Advocate has already reviewed the procedures governing the preparation of search warrants. Under new procedures which came into effect in October 1999, the Procurator Fiscal is involved in the preparation of requests for search warrants in all but the most exceptional cases, and almost all applications are now dealt with by sheriffs rather than justices. These procedures are designed to ensure that applications are properly scrutinised before they are granted.</p>

  <p>The recently published independent research, <i>An Evaluation of Electronically Monitored Restriction of Liberty Orders</i> , by David Lobley and David Smith concluded that the electronic equipment used to monitor offenders&#8217; compliance with their orders had worked well and that contractors&#8217; staff responded promptly and efficiently in response to violations of the restriction requirements.</p>

  <p>Violation of any of the terms of an order is detected promptly by the monitoring equipment and notification sent immediately, via a phone line, to the monitoring centre. Contractors are required to follow up any such violation and to follow agreed procedures in reporting violations to the court for further action. The effectiveness of contractors in carrying out these procedures is monitored carefully by the Executive.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether and why police officers are allowed to keep firearms in their own home, whether this practice has given rise to any security or public safety issues and whether it has any plans to review any existing guidance.</p>

  <p>Police officers may keep personally owned firearms, such as rifles or shotguns, in their own homes provided that they have an appropriate certificate issued by the relevant chief constable. They are not permitted to keep police issue firearms in their own homes under any circumstances.</p>

  <p>Police issue firearms are always stored within secure accommodation by forces at all times. Firearms are only issued on the authority of a senior officer for a specific purpose and only to an authorised firearms officer. Thereafter the weapons are signed out to the authorised firearms officer and on completion of the operation returned to the security of the force armoury. There are no plans to review existing guidelines.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The number of prisoners held per hall or dormitory changes frequently depending upon the prisoner population and operational requirements. Comparable figures of the number of halls and dormitories and the number of supervisors per establishment is shown in the table below.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-7182 by Sarah Boyack on 3 July 2000, whether ownership and entry to the land in question has now been taken; whether all necessary statutory consents are now in place; what progress has been made in establishing the viability of the proposed Public/Private Partnership, and when it now considers a start on site to be likely.</p>

  <p>Ownership of the land covered by the Compulsory Purchase Orders for the M77 Fenwick to Malletsheugh scheme has been transferred to the Scottish Ministers and entry has been taken to the land. The exception is Eastwood Golf Club&#8217;s land where entry will be taken in 2002 for the reasons explained in my answer to question S1W-7182. Compensation payments to the previous landowners are being negotiated as soon as additional works such as fencing and access arrangements are agreed.</p>

  <p>Consultants are undertaking an audit of the design of the M77 on behalf of the department to ensure that the design satisfies current road and environmental standards. This is likely to result in minor areas of additional land being required in addition to that covered by the Compulsory Purchase Orders. The results of that audit are expected in the autumn.</p>

  <p>Four orders remain to be made that have been through public inquiry and are not contentious. These orders are two de-trunking orders that return the existing A77 to the local authorities once the M77 is built and two minor road closure orders. A further minor order will be necessary to remove an anomaly at the junction of the M77 Fenwick to Malletsheugh scheme and the existing M77 Ayr Road Route.</p>

  <p>Consultants are advising the department on the likely viability of the proposed Public/Private Partnership. This work is expected to be completed by the autumn. It is intended that tender documents for the Public/Private Partnership will be issued in the summer of 2001, with the award of a contract in 2002 and a start on site in 2002.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will have regard to the Statement of Practice in any contract to be let by the Scottish Ministers, having regard to the particular circumstances of each contract.</p>

  <p>For the contracting exercise for the management and maintenance of the trunk road network, the Scottish Executive will require, as a term of the contract, that contractors take into account obligations imposed by statutes, including TUPE. The Instructions for Tendering which define how the contracting exercise should be undertaken will seek from tenderers an appropriate undertaking of compliance. Staff transfers consequential to the legislation should take place.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what were the total costs of the publication (design, photocopying, printing, Internet connection of text, distribution and cost of launch) of the Renewing Local Democracy Working Group report.</p>

  <p>I refer Mr Keith Harding to the answer I gave to question S1W-8350 on 12 July which dealt with publication costs. The launch was held in the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Media Centre and the only cost involved was for tea, coffee and biscuits which was met centrally by Media and Communications Group. <br /></p>
