  <p>The Accountant in Bankruptcy has never reported on numbers of petitions for bankruptcy as she does not collate this information herself.</p>

  <p>The Accountant in Bankruptcy does, however, collate and report on the number of awards of bankruptcy following both petitions to the court and debtor applications considered by the accountant herself. Information on awards of bankruptcy can be found on the website at <a href="http://www.aib.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.aib.gov.uk</a> in the annual report or in the quarterly Insolvency Statistics press release.</p>

  <p>2. Banks, building societies and credit card companies.</p>

  <p>The information provided has been collected by the Scottish Court Service and cannot be searched electronically. A manual trawl of the 1,118 cases was undertaken in order to provide the figures quoted above, but more detailed information giving the names of individual creditors, where allowed under the Data Protection Act, could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>Not all petitions presented to the courts result in award of bankruptcy.</p>

  <p>These documents are currently being finalised and should be available shortly.</p>

  <p>Responses to a consultation undertaken by the Scottish Government on behalf of the Community Council Work Group (CCWG) showed that there is substantial support from both local authorities and community councils for a Model Scheme of Establishment of Community Councils and Code of Conduct for Community Councillors.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, along with key partners, will promote and encourage the adoption of the finalised documents by all Scottish local authorities. It is recognised that if the Model Scheme is adopted by local authorities it will allow for more consistency and parity throughout Scotland whilst at the same time allowing individual local circumstances to be reflected.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises the important role, within the wider community empowerment agenda, that community councils can play in local life. Adoption of these documents will also give every community council in Scotland the opportunity to build their capacity and to engage more effectively with their local authority as well as the community that they represent.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will be providing local government in Scotland with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11. The vast majority of the funding, including the funding for self-directed support, is provided by means of a block grant.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it to achieve agreed outcomes, and the Scottish Government will monitor performance to make sure that our shared national priorities are achieved. It is not for the Scottish Government to intervene in how local authorities organise these services. However, Orkney Islands Council and NHS Orkney are working with the Scottish Government Joint Improvement Team to look into redesigning services to support more integrated working across health and social care.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Government is funding three local authority test sites (Dumfries and Galloway, Glasgow and Highland Councils) to evaluate the effectiveness of three different interventions to increase the uptake of self-directed support, including bridging finance (investing to save).</p>

  <p>Ofcom defines media literacy as the ability to access, understand and create communications in a variety of contexts. Curriculum for Excellence identifies literacy skills as a key theme across the curriculum with all teachers having a role in promoting language and literacy development. The experiences and outcomes for literacy capture the range of skills young people will need to engage fully in society and learning in the 21st century, taking account of the changing forms of language and communication. Curriculum for Excellence also facilitates more creative approaches to learning and teaching; the new curriculum framework encourages innovative partnerships with those well placed to support education, enabling schools and authorities to engage in partnership with the creative media industries.

  <p>The Scottish Centre for Financial Education (SCFE) is funded by the Scottish Government and the Financial Services Authority. It has a remit to produce financial education teaching resources for schools and to support continuing professional development of teachers through a programme of workshops, seminars and conferences. It also arranges meetings of the Scottish Centre for Financial Education Advisory Group which is an information forum for key organisations in the financial sector in Scotland with an interest in financial education in schools. The Advisory Group has had two meetings since May 2007 (23 November 2007 and 24 June 2008) and many of its membership attended a financial education conference, supported by the SCFE, in December 2008. The promotion of financial education and money management in schools were discussed on all occasions and the Scottish Government was represented at all meetings.</p>

  <p>The main vehicle for home insulation measures is through the UK Government&rsquo;s Carbon Emission Reduction Target. This places an obligation on the Energy Supply companies to meet a carbon reduction target through a range of free and subsidised energy efficiency measures including home insulation. It is for the individual energy companies to decide how to meet their carbon targets. We are working with the energy suppliers, through the Scottish CERT Strategy Steering Group, to ensure that Scotland receives its fair share of CERT activity not only in terms of population, but also to meet our distinctive energy needs.</p>

  <p>The new Energy Assistance package [which commences 6 April 2009] will do more to help rural households by including a wider range of measures which will benefit rural homes including air source heat pumps for those off the gas grid and a wider range of insulation measures for homes which cannot take traditional measures such as cavity wall insulation. To ensure that these more expensive measures can be installed the grant maximum has been raised by &pound;500 to &pound;4,000 and the upper grant has been raised by &pound;1,000 to &pound;6,500 for homes which have particularly poor energy efficiency. The measures will be available to private sector households where; the householder or partner is aged over 60 and has no central heating or where the householder lives in a home with poor energy efficiency, and is either aged over 75 or aged over 60 and receiving one of a range of passport benefits or tax credits. For the first time, families in homes with poor energy efficiency who receive one of a range of passport benefits or tax credits and have a child under five or a disabled child under 16 will also be eligible.</p>

  <p>In the recent budget we announced proposals for the first phase of an ambitious area-based home insulation scheme supported by &pound;15 million of new Scottish Government funding plus &pound;15 million from other sources. The scheme is currently being developed and is expected to launch in the autumn.</p>

  <p>We also intend to bring forward proposals for a significant loan mechanism. This will assist householders wishing to undertake more expensive measures, such as solid wall insulation and installing renewable technologies.</p>

  <p>The recovery and disposal of CFCs in demolition waste forms part of a European Commission proposal to recast and amend the existing EC Regulation covering the elimination of man-made ozone-depleting substances (ODSs). The Scottish Government is working with the UK Government, SEPA, the Scottish Building Standards Agency, industry and other stakeholders to assess methods for recovery/disposal of materials containing ODSs from buildings that are being demolished.</p>

  <p>Quantifying the amount of embodied ODSs in buildings in the form of building foams is difficult due to lack of clear trade data. Most foams form part of the fabric of existing buildings and as such, the bulk of ODSs used in building foams continue to be locked in the foam. The importance of quantifying the emissions arising from building materials and assessing the level of threat posed is acknowledged. The Scottish Government supports the UK Government&rsquo;s position that the European Commission is best placed to undertake this work.</p>

  <p>The classification of waste as hazardous or otherwise is not a matter for the Scottish Government. Waste is hazardous if it displays one or more of the hazardous properties listed in Annex III of the revised Waste Framework Directive (2008/98/EC), which replicates almost exactly Annex III of the Hazardous Waste Directive (91/689/EC). Application of these provisions is a matter for SEPA. SEPA gives guidance on the likely hazardous properties of ODS, and similar issues of interest to the construction industry, at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.sepa.org.uk/waste/waste_regulation/guidance_and_position_statemen.aspx" target="_blank">http://www.sepa.org.uk/waste/waste_regulation/guidance_and_position_statemen.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>The Special Waste Regulations 1996, which govern the removal of hazardous waste, are enforced by SEPA. However, a substance does not become waste until it is discarded, or its holder intends to or is required to discard it. Waste regulation is irrelevant to standing buildings: the Waste Framework Directive specifically excludes from its scope &quot;land (in situ) including unexcavated contaminated soil and buildings permanently connected with land&quot;. The removal of ODSs for recovery or disposal following demolition is, however, subject to the 1996 Regulations. The safety or otherwise of the act of demolition is a matter for the Health and Safety Executive, a reserved matter.</p>

  <p>The actual disposal or recovery of hazardous waste is also covered by a variety of environmental regulatory regimes, notably the Landfill (Scotland) Regulations 2003, the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1994, and the Pollution Prevention and Control (Scotland) Regulations 2000.</p>

  <p>I have written to Joan Ruddock asking about arrangements for the next meeting of the UK &ndash; wide Ministerial Group on Fuel Poverty and suggesting this issue as a useful topic for discussion at that meeting.</p>

  <p>We have also asked the Scottish Fuel Poverty Forum to engage with fuel poverty advisory groups in the other administrations on reserved issues. Their report in October 2008 recommended to the UK Government that a review of both Cold Weather Payments and Winter Fuel Payments is needed to ensure a better fit with fuel poverty.</p>

  <p>The purpose of child care discretionary funds is not to meet every demand for the cost of child care from every student. They are intended to provide institutions with a source of additional funding which colleges and universities can then use to assist students with the costs of child care who are in financial difficulty and who are at risk of not completing their courses.</p>

  <p>As part of the Single Outcome Agreement (SOA) approach, Councils (for the 2008-09 SOA) and Community Planning Partnerships (for subsequent SOAs) will be expected to report to the Scottish Government and their local communities each year. Reports for 2008-09 will be due in September 2009. These reports will describe progress made towards local outcomes, including those outcomes relating to health and physical activity, and show how this progress contributes to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s National Outcomes.

  <p>Section 11 of the Homelessness etc (Scotland) Act 2003 requires landlords and creditors to notify local authorities when raising proceedings for possession. The section does not apply directly to local authorities by virtue of section 11(1)(a) and does not place particular requirements on local authorities on receipt of notices.</p>

  <p>The timetable for section 11 coming into force on 1 April 2009 was agreed with COSLA and guidance on the action to be taken when receiving notices has been developed in consultation with local authorities and other stakeholders and is currently available in draft on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website. This will be finalised, taking account of further comments from stakeholders, by the end of this month. Broader guidance on the prevention of homelessness, developed jointly with COSLA, will also be published shortly. Scottish Government officials have undertaken a number of awareness raising activities to ensure that landlords, creditors, local authorities, advice agencies and others are aware of section 11 coming into force, including distributing fliers; establishing bespoke web pages, and attending conferences and seminars.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is carefully considering how it can respond to the various recommendations addressed to it in the Housing Supply Task Force report. Planning Circular 1/2009, published on 16 February, provides planning authorities with advice on the production of development plan action programmes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has taken a number of measures to ensure that there is adequate legal protection for home owners facing repossession.</p>

  <p>We have established a Repossessions Group, comprising representatives of the legal system, lenders, advice agencies and consumer interests. The group has been asked to provide advice to ministers by 30 April 2009 on whether the legal protection for homeowners in Scotland at risk of repossession provided through UK and Scottish legislation is adequate. If required, the group has been asked to make specific recommendations on ways in which either reserved or devolved legislation should be strengthened.</p>

  <p>We are also improving access to legal advice and legal aid for those facing repossession, debt and other financial difficulties. We have made an additional &pound;3 million available over the next two years to expand our in-court advice and other legal advice services, and we have agreed to increase the disposable income limits for civil legal aid, so that over a million more Scots can become potentially eligible from this spring.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has taken a number of non-legislative measures to protect home owners in financial difficulty.</p>

  <p>The &pound;35 million Home Owners Support Fund helps those who cannot access support elsewhere to stay in their homes through the Mortgage to Rent and Mortgage to Shared equity schemes. The report of the evaluation of the Mortgage to Rent scheme was published in January on the Scottish Government website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/12/11115931/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2008/12/11115931/0</a>, and a revised scheme will be launched on 16 March, alongside the new Mortgage to Shared Equity scheme.</p>

  <p>We have also funded a &pound;400,000 awareness raising campaign for National Debtline, including TV and online advertising, to encourage people to tackle debt problems at an early stage. An evaluation of the campaign is underway.</p>

  <p>We are providing an additional &pound;1 million to Citizens Advice to increase the capacity of face to face debt advice services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Repossessions Group will also consider whether any further legislative or non-legislative measures could be taken to protect home owners at risk of repossession.</p>

  <p>From 1 April 2009, under section 11 of the Homelessness etc (Scotland) Act 2003, lenders will be required to inform the relevant local authority when they call in a mortgage or take court action for repossession. This will give authorities early notice of households who might be at risk of homelessness and allow them to provide appropriate advice and assistance. We are also developing new guidance for local authorities on prevention of homelessness which will be published by the end of March. The 1 April implementation date for the introduction of section 11, and the guidance on prevention, have both been agreed with COSLA to ensure that local authorities are appropriately prepared.</p>

  <p>In addition, mortgage rescue schemes (Mortgage to Rent and Mortgage to Shared Equity) are operated nationally by the Scottish Government under the &pound;35 million Home Owners Support Fund. Scottish local authorities with social landlord functions may participate in Mortgage to Rent, purchasing homes from people eligible for the scheme and providing a tenancy in return.</p>

  <p>I have asked Karen Watt, Chief Executive of The Scottish Housing Regulator, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The first set of directions was issued in April 2006 under section 68A of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001. At that time, we said that we would carry out a review in year two of their operation. We issued a consultation paper on the terms of our review in January 2009, and it is now underway.</p>

  <p>It would not have been appropriate to carry out our review of the directions and Remodelled Management Agreement (RMA) until now. When we inspected Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) in 2007, we recommended that it carry out a fundamental review of its purpose and direction. It has been important for us to take account of GHA&rsquo;s emerging proposals for future tenant empowerment and its progress with Second Stage Transfer when considering our proposals for the future management of directions.</p>

  <p>The timescales set out by the GHA Board in October 2007 have been subject to discussion with the Local Housing Organisations pursuing second stage transfer. No detailed timescales were set for ballots in October 2007, only estimated timescales for the submission of business plans from purchasers in three diets (but no future diets).</p>

  <p>Progress with each SST is a matter for GHA and the respective Local Housing Organisation. The timescales need to be realistic and reflect a pace of activity which both parties can meet.</p>

In accordance with our published guidance, we required GHA to submit an improvement plan to us within eight weeks of publication of the report. An initial version of the plan was submitted within this timescale, on 13 November 2007.</p>

  <p>We provided GHA with our comments on the plan, as is usual practice. GHA produced subsequent revisions and a final version was submitted on 1 February 2008. This version of the plan was then agreed by us.</p>

  <p>I have asked Karen Watt, Chief Executive of The Scottish Housing Regulator, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>In January 2009, the Scottish Housing Regulator issued a consultation paper setting out the proposed terms of its review of directions issued under section 68A of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001. The paper sets out proposals for issuing new directions to Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) and local housing organisations (LHOs) when their current management arrangements come to an end between April and September 2009.</p>

  <p>We asked GHA, the LHOs and other interested parties to give feedback on our proposals by 27 February. We are currently considering this feedback and will issue our final proposals by the end of March.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government does not prescribe the actual rents a Registered Social Landlord (RSL) should charge, but for appraisal purposes we assume a benchmark rent in our grant calculation as we have a responsibility to ensure public money is used in the most efficient and effective fashion. This is a national benchmark and it is based on assessed affordability to a household with a single earner on the national minimum wage. Some RSLs choose to charge lower rents than others. Where an RSL chooses to charge actual rents below our benchmark assumption then it could have difficulty in raising the necessary private finance.</p>

  <p>Junior doctor training posts fall into two broad categories: Two Year Foundation Programmes, introduced in 2005, followed by Speciality Training Programmes, introduced in 2007. For both categories, training programmes commence in August each year and the selection and recruitment processes are therefore designed to fill vacancies before that date.</p>

  <p>Information on vacancies broken down by NHS board is not centrally available because recruitment to training programmes is managed on a regional basis, with junior doctors subsequently rotating across sites as they progress through their programmes. Regional data available from NHS Education for Scotland are as follows.</p>

  <p>Foundation Programme Vacancies</p>

  <p>Posts have remained at around 800 each year since 2005, split by Postgraduate Deanery region as follows:</p>

  <p>As for previous years, all posts for 2009 have been offered and accepted. Subject to unexpected withdrawals, no vacancies are expected from August 2009.</p>

  <p>Specialty Training Vacancies</p>

  <p>Recruitment prior to 2007, to what were then Senior House Officer and Specialty Registrar posts, was managed locally by NHS boards and regional data are therefore not available before then. Annual post figures by Postgraduate Deanery region since 2007 are:</p>

  <p>Interviews for, and offers of, Speciality Training posts are currently under way and it is therefore too early to say whether all 2009 vacancies will be filled in the first instance. Any remaining vacancies at the end of the current interview schedule will be re-advertised in good time to ensure that any continuing vacancies in August are kept to a minimum.</p>

  <p>The terms of insurance policies are matters between individuals and insurance companies. Insurance companies are regulated by the Financial Services Authority, and if a customer is dissatisfied with the way an insurer deals with their claim they can refer the matter to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Consequently, the Scottish Government does not have powers to compel insurance companies to make payments in individual cases.</p>

  <p>However, the Association of British Insurers, following discussions with the Scottish Government, has provided advice to insurance companies about dealing with claims relating to cleaning homes after homicide. This guidance cannot override the terms and conditions in an insurance policy that may be relevant in a particular case.</p>

  <p>Telehealth has great potential to help patients and NHS staff. New telehealth products require the same evaluation as any other health technology, i.e. a Health Technology Assessment*. Implementation in the NHS would be driven by the same policy considerations as guide the implementation of any other new technology.</p>

  <p>In developing and proving a telehealth application, a number of steps are required in order to show that the application is ethical, legal, feasible, acceptable to the users, safe, and finally clinically and cost effective. The early stages are normally carried out in the laboratory, pilot trials are then done which involve patients or volunteers, and then clinical trials with patients are carried out to assess the costs and benefits.</p>

  <p>Note: *Health Technology Assessments apply to all interventions used to promote health, prevent and treat disease, and improve rehabilitation and long-term care including:</p>

  <p>Drugs: such as antidepressants, contraceptives, antibiotics;</p>

  <p>Devices: such as pacemakers, dialysis machines, hearing aids;</p>

  <p>Procedures: such as surgical techniques, acupuncture, counselling;</p>

  <p>Settings of care: such as general practice, hospitals, care homes, and</p>

  <p>Screening: for cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, stroke.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Before the proposed HMP Highland opens, the Scottish Prison Service needs to select and acquire a suitable site, obtain planning permission for the proposed development, conduct a procurement process for the design and construction of the prison and then prepare the prison for operation. These steps will take a number of years, with the date of opening being largely dependent on the time required to acquire a site and secure planning permission. A target date for HMP Highland opening will be set following completion of these key stages.</p>

  <p>Yes. A Scottish sustainable procurement action plan to support the public sector&rsquo;s move to more sustainable behaviour is currently in development. The EU Energy Services Directive and forthcoming Cleaner and More Efficient Vehicles Directive will require public authorities and certain public transport providers to take into account energy efficiency and environmental impacts when purchasing road transport vehicles.</p>

  <p>Awareness of the National Care Standards was measured at 15% in a survey of the general population in November 2004. The Scottish Government launched a campaign to raise awareness of the National Care Standards on 30 June 2008. This included television, radio and press advertising and a national theatre tour which visited care homes for older people and day care centres across Scotland. A campaign helpline and website was also set up. Promotional leaflets and posters were widely distributed to venues, including every GP surgery in Scotland and day care centres.</p>

  <p>Research carried out in late August 2008 near the end of the first phase of the campaign indicated that awareness of the National Care Standards in the general population had more than doubled. Demand for copies of the appropriate National Care Standards increased by an average of 170% during the first phase of the campaign.</p>

  <p>Phase two of the campaign was launched on 2 February 2009. It includes all the elements of the first phase plus engagement with social work professionals aimed at encouraging them to make their clients aware of the standards and how to use them.</p>

  <p>We intend to re-measure awareness levels when the campaign concludes in April.</p>

  <p>Higher Education Discretionary Fund allocations for each year are intended to provide institutions with a source of additional funding which they can then use to assist students in financial difficulty and who are at risk of not completing their course. The funds are intended to be spent within the year in which they are allocated, thus providing the maximum sum available to students in each individual year. Any unspent funds are returned for redistribution in the following academic year and are thus put straight back into the discretionary funds system.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of funds should therefore be exhausted in the academic year for which they are allocated.</p>

  <p>Academic Year 2006-07</p>

  <p>A total of five institutions exhausted both their Higher Education Discretionary and Childcare Funds. These were:</p>

  <p>Ayr College</p>

  <p>Barony College</p>

  <p>Glasgow Metropolitan College</p>

  <p>North Glasgow College</p>

  <p>Banff and Buchan College</p>

  <p>John Wheatley College</p>

  <p>Newbattle Abbey College</p>

  <p>Edinburgh College of Art</p>

  <p>St Andrews University</p>

  <p>A further three institutions exhausted only their Childcare Fund:</p>

  <p>Borders College</p>

  <p>Queen Margaret University College</p>

  <p>In June 2008, Aberdeen City Council agreed to the transfer of Aye Can to Inspire, a third sector organisation based in Aberdeen. Inspire expects to open the new Aye Can in April 2009. As with most new ventures there have been some unexpected delays, however the majority of these have now been overcome. It would not be appropriate to make a statement to Parliament on the matter as this is a commercial arrangement between Aberdeen City Council and Inspire.</p>

  <p>The essence of volunteering is that people just do it, often outside any formal setting or organisation, and without any requirement to register. Consequently there can be no precise quantification of the numbers.</p>

  <p>Research by Volunteering Development Scotland suggests that the number of volunteers in Scotland lies in the range 1.3 to 2 million. The Scottish Household Survey also collects some information about rates of volunteering.</p>

  <p>The number of voluntary organisations in Scotland, which by definition will use volunteers in some capacity, can not be identified with accuracy. The Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) has estimated there may be about 45,000 and the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator has over 23,800 charities on its register. However, neither of these figures will include the huge number of informal local groups who come together to pursue a common interest.</p>

  <p>Informal guidance from the European Commission has clarified their view that small populations of an animal species introduced deliberately or accidentally by man to locations to which they would not have spread naturally in the foreseeable future, should be considered to be outside their natural range. Consequently, any animals released in this way would not be covered by the provisions in domestic legislation which implement the strict protection measures specified in Article 12 of the Habitats Directive and which apply to species identified in Annex IV of the Directive including the beaver ( <em>castor fiber</em> ).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is implementing the recommendations of the review of the arrangements for preventing, detecting and prosecuting wildlife crime &quot;Natural Justice&quot;. Revitalising the Partnership for Action Against Wildlife Crime and strengthening law enforcement in this area will have a beneficial effect on birds of prey, which historically have been subject to significant levels of criminal activity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is currently consulting on improvements to legislative protection which could be achieved by extending Schedules 1A and A1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 to provide year-round protection for nesting sites and protection from harassment for specified birds, including some birds of prey of high conservation value.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has also classified the following Special Protection Areas (SPAs) under the EU Wild Birds Directive for birds of prey since May 2007: Renfrewshire Heights (classified December 2007 for breeding hen harrier), Strath Carnaig and Strath Fleet Moors (classified July 2008 for breeding hen harrier) and an extension to the Orkney Mainland Moors SPA (classified in July 2008 for breeding hen harrier and short-eared owl as well as for breeding red-throated diver).</p>

  <p>(a) A sentenced child may be temporarily held in a young offenders&rsquo; institution if at the time of sentencing by the court there is no place available in secure accommodation. The longest period that a sentenced child has been detained in these circumstances is:</p>

  <p>2006 &ndash; 1 day</p>

  <p>2007 &ndash; nil</p>

  <p>2008 &ndash; 24 days.</p>

  <p>The period of 24 days in 2008 was due to the closure of one of the secure units which resulted in a temporary loss of 30 places in the secure estate.</p>

  <p>It is the joint responsibility of local authorities and Scottish Government, as the purchasers of secure accommodation, to ensure sufficient places to meet the needs of young people in Scotland. The Scottish Government are continuing to work closely and imaginatively with providers and local authorities to ensure that this first class accommodation continues to be put to good use in improving the outcomes of young people and their communities.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS is committed to providing equality of opportunity for all young offenders and where possible seeks to provide young offenders with access to a wide variety of learning opportunities tailored to their needs. For example our education providers have access to a wide range of educational tools which enable them to respond to individual learning requirements.</p>

  <p>A very specific example of how HMYOI Polmont has supported young offenders with learning disabilities is through the provision of an on-site speech and language therapy service, which is provided two days a week. Local NHS Community Speech and Language Therapy Services provide similar support to young offenders located at HMP and YOI Cornton Vale and Friarton young offenders annex at HMP Perth. The primary role of the speech and language service is to provide direct intervention for communication disorders.</p>
