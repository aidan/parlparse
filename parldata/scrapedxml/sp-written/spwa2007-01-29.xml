  <p>The total of agricultural subsidy payments in each year since 2003 are as follows:</p>

  <p><table width="25%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">
<tr>
<td width="30%" align="center" valign="top">Year</td>
<td width="70%" align="center" valign="top">Amount</td>

<td width="30%" align="left" valign="top">2006</td>
<td width="70%" align="right" valign="top">&pound;25,965,016.56</td>
</tr>
</table></p>

  <p>The fluctuation in payments between 2005 and 2006 arises for two reasons. Firstly, payments under the Single Farm Payment Scheme, which replaced the previous eight subsidy schemes, commenced on 1 December 2005 and a significant proportion of expenditure fell into 2006. Secondly, the Single Farm Payment Scheme contained provisions to increase payments in comparison to amounts paid under the previous regime.</p>

  <p>It is the responsibility of retailers across Scotland to sell alcohol responsibly and act within the law. The Scottish Executive is working with representatives of retailers as part of its partnership with the alcohol industry announced in September 2006.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive has supported the roll out of the Young Scot branded accredited Proof of Age Standards Scheme (PASS) card so that retailers can operate a &quot;no proof no sale&quot; policy to help them avoid unwittingly making underage sales.</p>

  <p>An additional &pound;19.3 million funding was provided by the Executive to support the four year project of modernisation of NHS audiology services across Scotland (2003-07). A financial audit of the modernisation project was recently completed and the report includes data showing that the funds allocated, by category, to NHS Lothian are as follows:</p>

  <p><table width="25%" border="1" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="0" bordercolor="#CCCCCC">

</table></p>

  <p>Recurring funding of &pound;5 million is allocated to NHS boards on an Arbuthnott basis and ring-fenced for 2006-07 and 2007-08. Lothian&rsquo;s allocation for 2006-07 was &pound;365,713. In future years this will become part of each NHS board&rsquo;s general allocation. It is a matter for boards to meet the needs of their patients and this should include ensuring that waiting times targets for audiology services are met.</p>

  <p>Many people remaining in Scotland through the <em>Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland</em> scheme meet the eligibility requirements for direct employment in the Civil Service. These requirements are outlined in the Civil Service Nationality Rules, which are a reserved matter.</p>

  <p>These rules permit, for example, the employment of Commonwealth and Irish citizens, British Protected Persons and nationals of EU member states, who are exempt from the statutory prohibition on the employment of foreign nationals. Full details of restrictions and exemptions can be accessed at the following website:<br /> <a href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/careers/nationality rules/publications/pdf/annexa.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/careers/nationality rules/publications/pdf/annexa.pdf</a></p>

  <p>People remaining in Scotland through the <em>Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland</em> Scheme who do not meet the eligibility requirements of the rules are therefore not eligible for direct employment in the Civil Service. However, those with suitable skills and qualifications may be employed in other capacities, for example through an employment agency or as a temporary contractor or consultant.</p>

  <p>General dental practitioners are independent contractors who are free to choose whether to join the dental list of an NHS board and whether to provide NHS dental treatment to each individual patient. Patient registrations can be withdrawn for a number of reasons including the dentist moving to another area or retiring, non-payment of charges by the patient, the patient allowing their registration to lapse, or entry into a private arrangement.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has reported that in the last five years they have recorded one instance of significant damage to a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) on land owned by the Scottish Executive or any body accountable to Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>The damage occurred on the Balerno Common SSSI on land owned by Scottish Water and resulted from the drawing down of the reservoir to undertake necessary maintenance work. SNH has advised that although efforts were made to restore the water level, the problem was exacerbated by unseasonably low rainfall. Action is underway to prevent a similar situation arising in future.</p>

  <p>The Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004 requires public bodies and office holders to consider the impacts of any and all their activities on the protected natural features of SSSIs.</p>

  <p>Under section 12 of the act, public bodies and office holders must consult SNH in relation to the exercise of any function is so far as it affects any land which is or forms part of an SSSI.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive to what extent the circumstances in which rainbow trout may be introduced to inland waters are regulated and may be further regulated under the Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Bill or any other proposed freshwater fisheries legislation.</p>

  <p>Movements of rainbow trout to and from aquaculture facilities are subject to the provisions of the Diseases of Fish Acts 1937 and 1983.</p>

  <p>The Import of Live Fish (Scotland) act 1978 requires that species of fish specified in subordinate legislation made under that act may only be introduced where permission has been given by the Scottish ministers.</p>

  <p>Although rainbow trout are not native to Scotland, waters have been stocked with these fish for angling purposes since the mid-19th century. Given this long-established practice, rainbow trout have not been specified under any Statutory Instrument made under the 1978 act.</p>

  <p>In recent years, many more fisheries have been established, and there continues to be growth in this sector. To address this expansion, and any possible impacts that stocking with rainbow trout may have, the Aquaculture and Fisheries (Scotland) Bill makes provision for a more effective system that will allow for regulation of such movements, but with a minimal impact on businesses. In addition, the bill brings in regulations to ensure that fish farms, including freshwater trout farms, have satisfactory measures in place for the containment of fish and to prevent the escape of fish.</p>

  <p>For a species to be truly native, it should have reached and established in an area by natural means. Despite having been established in Scotland since the 19th century, it has not established any self-sustaining populations, and relies for its presence on artificial rearing and stocking. For these reasons, the rainbow trout cannot be described as a native species in the United Kingdom. The rainbow trout is native to rivers in North America and Russia that flow into the Pacific Ocean.</p>

  <p>Rainbow trout can pose threats to other native species. They may predate on smaller native fish, compete with native fish for food and space. Unregulated introductions pose the threat of introducing diseases, parasites or other species that may be transported with the trout.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage has advised that the spread of river water-crowfoot (Ranunculus fluitans) in the Spey may be having some impact on freshwater pearl mussel and Atlantic salmon but that the extent of the threat which this represents for the integrity of these species is not clear.</p>

  <p>I understand that Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency will be meeting with the Spey Fishery Board in the near future to discuss the matter and possible actions for the management of the situation.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Following the announcement of the successful Inverclyde Stock Transfer ballot result on 1 December 2006, Inverclyde Council, River Clyde Homes and Communities Scotland have been meeting regularly and at various levels to progress the transfer of the houses to the new landlord as quickly as possible. The target date for transfer is 1 October 2007. The actual subsidy to be paid to River Clyde Homes will reflect the requirements of its final business plan as assessed and appraised by Inverclyde Council and Communities Scotland.</p>

  <p>NHS 24 rolled out across Scotland from May 2002 to November 2004. The call figures listed in the following table therefore relate to partial coverage of Scotland until November 2004. The abandoned calls figures is measured by collecting data on the number of calls that are abandoned after the threshold of 30 seconds following the end of the welcome message.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to tell how many callers abandoned their calls because of a slow response time and there could be a number of reasons for their decision to hang up.</p>

  <p>In November 2006, the last available reporting date, 99.9% of calls to NHS 24 were answered within 30 seconds with the average time to answer three seconds and number of calls abandoned after threshold was six in total (0.01%).</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p># Information provided by NHS 24</p>

  <p>*Until 2005, NHS 24 used a different formula to calculate calls abandoned, therefore the figures reported at the time are different to those shown in the table. The 2002-05 figures have been calculated using the new formula, which was introduced in April 2005, so that they can be compared against the more recent performance.</p>

  <p>The Wishaw General Hospital PFI Project has not been subject to refinancing.</p>

  <p>Had the hospital been procured by a traditional procurement route additional annual costs would be incurred including capital charges and costs for the provision of hard and soft FM services.</p>

  <p>The current annual charge for Hairmyres is &pound;16.4 million after accounting for re-financing gain of &pound;440,000 and the annual inflation uplifts since the hospital opened. NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s current year income is &pound;860 million and therefore the Hairmyres costs represent 1.9% of this. The impact of re-financing is a reduction of 0.05%.</p>

  <p>The refinancing of Hairmyres Hospital in August 2004 provided an opportunity for both Prospect and NHS Lanarkshire to work in partnership and capture the considerable benefits from the reduced risks inherent in the project following the successful completion of construction and the experience gained of operating the hospital.</p>

  <p>There are three distinct categories of termination. These are client default/voluntary termination, force majeure; and contractor default.</p>

  <p>Under each of these, there are defined liabilities that the board is contracted to pay in the event the Concession Agreement terminates. The contractual definition of these liabilities did not change post refinancing. The first of these is considered to be within NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s control. The second is essentially outwith either NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s or the contractor&rsquo;s control. Based on Prospect&rsquo;s (the contractor), and their bankers&rsquo; commitment to the project and the due diligence undertaken by the bankers in agreeing the refinancing, the probability of default by the contractor was considered to be low.</p>

  <p>The potential termination liabilities under these scenarios were subjected to a detailed value for money analysis and scenario modelling which focused on the trade off between a potential increase in liabilities and NHS Lanarkshire&rsquo;s share of refinancing gain. This analysis suggested that there needs to be a high probability of contractor default before the VFM was eroded. Whilst there were some consequential changes to the termination sums under contractor default, the termination sum payable under such a default scenario is expected to be lower than had the refinancing not taken place.</p>

  <p>The refinancing agreement increased the amount of borrowing by &pound;20.4 million and the total debt is repaid over a longer time period. However, the actual sum paid at termination would be determined by the actual date of termination.</p>

  <p>The refinancing provided substantial financial gain for NHS Lanarkshire and was undertaken in line with the Code of Conduct issued by the Office of Government Commerce in July 2002. Partnerships UK (PUK) Refinancing Task Force confirmed the business case complied with the terms of the code.</p>

  <p>The new NHS eye examination which was introduced in April 2006 allows for the management of a wide range of common conditions in the community and promotes optometrists/ophthalmic medical practitioners as the first point of contact for eye problems. The new NHS eye examination was introduced as part of a wider review of community eyecare services in Scotland which was commissioned in 2004.</p>

  <p>The aim of the review is to encourage the development of integrated eyecare services to ensure patients receive a good quality and efficient service, in a convenient setting without undue wait. I launched the final report of the Review of Community Eyecare Services in Scotland on 14 December 2006. The report emphasises the important role of the community optometrist/ophthalmic medical practitioner in local eyecare networks.</p>

  <p>The offenders in question were released subject to the provisions of the Prisoners and Criminal Proceedings (Scotland) Act 1993. They had all been sentenced to four years or more. Offenders sentenced to terms four years or more are eligible to be released on parole licence at the direction of the Parole Board after serving one half of the sentence and will be released on licence at the two thirds stage of sentence.</p>

  <p>The Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Bill, currently before Parliament, proposes to end the current system of unconditional early release and replace it with a system based on an individual assessment of risk. There will be no change to the current law covering the treatment of life sentence prisoners.</p>

  <p>In determining applications for consent under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 in respect of offshore wind farms, Scottish ministers would consult widely inviting representations from statutory bodies and other interested parties including fishermen&rsquo;s and other organisations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not received any recent applications for consent of any proposed offshore wind farm development, consequently no recent consultations have taken place.</p>

  <p>However, the Executive received a request from AMEC Wind Energy for advice on the preparation of an Environmental Statement for the Aberdeen Offshore Project which is at pre-application stage. In order to produce this advice, we consulted local planning authorities, statutory bodies and other interested parties including organisations with an interest in navigation and maritime safety issues.</p>

  <p>Further, we will be conducting a Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) for offshore wind this year. This SEA will examine how we can develop our offshore wind potential sustainably and site offshore wind farms while minimising impacts on the environment and existing users of the coastal area. As part of this process we will be contacting all relevant stakeholders, including fisherman&rsquo;s organisations in the marine environment for their views.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-30108 by Rhona Brankin on 5 December 2006, whether it considers that the <em>Scottish Red Squirrel Action Plan</em> would be more effectively executed if directed by an individual with specific responsibility for its implementation.</p>

  <p>The <em>Scottish Squirrel Action Plan</em> was prepared by a Working Group comprising Forestry Commission Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Executive. Successful implementation of the plan will call for a similar level of co-operation and partnership working between these bodies who have the lead responsibility as well as others with an interest. I do not think that the appointment of a single individual to direct implementation of the plan would enhance the partnership approach that is required.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, whether it has any indication of what the energy efficiency rating of the Parliament might be under the EU Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (2002/91/EC) now that the Scottish Executive has adopted the use of the asset-based energy rating methodology, Simplified Building Energy Model (SBEM), as the principle non-domestic method for assessment of energy rating for non-domestic buildings.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Building Standards Agency has issued the 2007 Technical Handbook, which will come into force on 1 May 2007. The handbook specifies that the Simplified Building Energy Model (SBEM) is the methodology which is to be used to assess the energy rating of non-domestic buildings. Once the agency finalises the model for use in Scotland by 1 May 2007, we will commence work to calculate the rating for the Parliament building.</p>

  <p>I refer to my answer to question S2W-31152 for information on how compliance to article 7, regarding the calculation of the building's energy rating, will be achieved at the Parliament. As to Articles 8 and 9, on inspection of boilers and air conditioning plant respectively, the Scottish Buildings Standards Agency has not confirmed the implementation requirements for organisations. When it does so, we shall integrate these requirements into our environmental management system, which is the mechanism used to ensure on-going compliance with any new environmental requirements.</p>
