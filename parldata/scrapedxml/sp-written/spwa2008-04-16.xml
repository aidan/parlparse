  <p>The Scottish Government strongly welcomes the report by Scotland&rsquo;s Commissioner for Children and Young People. The important issues identified therein are consistent with the key themes identified and work being taken forward through <em>Looked After Children and Young People: We Can and Must Do Better</em> . We are considering the recommendations contained within the children&rsquo;s commissioner&rsquo;s report and will continue to work with local authorities to ensure that the transition from being in care to independent living is a positive experience for young people.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much additional expenditure will be required to meet the capital costs of implementing its P1 to P3 class-size reduction policy, broken down by local authority.</p>

  <p>We have made clear that the pace and scale of changes which will be needed to meet our commitment to reducing P1 to P3 class sizes is subject to further discussion with COSLA. As was the case with previous class size changes, the full implications for physical accommodation will only become clearer as these discussions progress and as individual local authorities assess the situation at each school at which accommodation may be a factor.</p>

  <p>We allocated &pound;40 million extra in the last financial year for capital expenditure linked to class size reduction. Under the terms of the Concordat signed with COSLA on 14 November 2007, almost &pound;3 billion of capital resources has been made available to authorities over three years including an extra &pound;115 million in this, the first year, to secure investment in schools and other infrastructure.</p>

  <p>EventScotland works to secure and support major cultural and sport events in Scotland and provides funding through its international and regional programmes.</p>

  <p>Music industry events with confirmed support through EventScotland&rsquo;s regional programme for 2008 are:</p>

  <p>Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival, Callandar Jazz and Blues Festival, Creetown Country Music Festival, Dundee Jazz Festival, East Neuk Festival in Fife, Ullapool&rsquo;s Loopallu, Nairn International Jazz Festival, Northern Nashville Caithness Country Music Festival, Schubertiad in Perth, Sound in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire, Orkney&rsquo;s St Magnus Festival, and the World Ceilidh in Dumfries and Galloway.</p>

  <p>The international programme will support Piping Live! in 2008 and 2009, and the World Pipe Band Championships in 2010, 2011 and 2012. In addition to these, EventScotland is in discussion with a number of event owners and organisers about supporting other music industry events as part of the international programme and further information will be made available as negotiations are concluded.</p>

  <p>For 2009 EventScotland is developing the programme of events for the Homecoming Scotland celebrations and has received a number of funding applications from music industry event organisers. Information about which events will be included in the programme will be available when it is launched at the end of May.</p>

  <p>EventScotland does not categorise its funding in this way. Events are supported either through the international programme, if they attract visitors from outside Scotland or generate international media profile for the country, or through the regional programme if they help to drive domestic tourism. All events are funded according to their fit with the criteria set out in these programmes.</p>

  <p>We are developing dental outreach training centres throughout Scotland, including Aberdeen, Inverness and Dumfries and Galloway. In addition, we are increasing the number of dental students in training and opening a third dental school for Scotland in Aberdeen which will further increase the number of dental students. Such students are also able to apply for a dental bursary of &pound;4,000 per year subject to a commitment to work in NHS dentistry in Scotland for up to five years following graduation.</p>

  <p>Under the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA), it is the responsibility of all NHS boards to support their staff to identify, understand and remove the barriers facing disabled people when they use NHS services. In recognition of the relationship between the Executive&rsquo;s strategic role and NHS boards&rsquo; role in the delivery of services, significant work has been done centrally to support boards and ensure they meet their DDA requirements.</p>

  <p>The NHS (Scotland) Reform Act 2004 created a specific duty on NHS boards to promote equality and this commitment to promoting equality and tackling disability discrimination has been reaffirmed explicitly in the Better Health Better Care action plan.</p>

  <p>Good practice guidance aimed at supporting NHS boards to understand and meet their responsibilities under Part 3 of the DDA and developed by the Fair for All &ndash; Disability team is available at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.healthscotland.com/uploads/documents/4683-Achieving%20Fair%20Access%20guidance.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.healthscotland.com/uploads/documents/4683-Achieving%20Fair%20Access%20guidance.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>Fair for All - Disability have undertaken a review of progress of work to achieve disability equality by all boards, based on Disability Equality Schemes published by each board and have made recommendations for progress as well as sharing good practice. The advice and support previously provided by the Fair for All - Disability team is now provided through an integrated Equalities and Planning Directorate established within NHS Health Scotland.</p>

  <p>Improved outcomes for disabled people as a result of these actions will be measured by: the Scottish Health Council&rsquo;s annual assessment of the patient focus public involvement responsibilities of boards; a national programme of patient experience surveys, disaggregated by disability and, monitoring NHS boards revised Disability Equality Schemes.</p>

  <p>The decisions on both the share of European Structural Funds to come to Scotland from the European Regional Aid budget, and the allocation between Priorities within each Scottish 2007 to 2013 programme were taken before the election of the current Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>A number of stakeholders across a range of sectors and individual organisations have raised concerns about the level of the reduction &ndash; almost halving the funds available. Most of these concerns have been around the reduction in ESF Priority 1 which has the objective of helping people progress into employment.</p>

  <p>On 8 April 2008, I announced &pound;158 million of funding for the first main round of Lowlands and Uplands Scotland ERDF and ESF programmes. In making the decision on the amount of funding to be made available at this stage of the programmes, the Programme Monitoring Committee and ministers took into account a number of ways to lessen the impact of the overall funding reduction on the ESF Priority 1 client group:</p>

  <p>1. The amount of Priority 1 funding going into individual projects has been front loaded. In LUPS that amounts to &pound;21.6 million in this round, in addition to &pound;10 million announced in 2007 for a Shadow Round for Priority 1 projects dealing with vulnerable client groups, and</p>

  <p>2. A further &pound;42.1 million funding has been made available from ERDF Priority 3 and ESF Priority 1 for co-ordinated two year strategic plans from Community Planning Partnerships for employment and regeneration.</p>

  <p>More help was offered by the government to address wider concerns raised by the Third Sector in the Scottish Budget which allocated a &pound;93.6 million transformational package for the Sector in order to support the development of an innovative, sustainable and inclusive third sector. The Third Sector Development Programme is &pound;63.3 million over three years, and the Scottish Investment Fund is &pound;30 million over three years.</p>

  <p>The reduction in European Social Fund money available to Scotland under the 2007 to 2013 Highland and Islands, and Lowlands and Uplands Scotland programmes was agreed prior to the election of the current Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>Mindful of this overall reduction in funds, we have taken a number of measures to reduce the risk to projects which help previously unemployed people into employment and achieve their full potential.</p>

  <p>The funding to be made available for the first main round of the Lowlands and Uplands Scotland programme was announced on 8 April 2008. Priority 1 ESF has been front loaded with &pound;21.6 million being offered to individual projects, and an additional &pound;42.1 million being offered to 11 Community Planning Partnerships for joint ESF Priority 1 and ERDF Priority 3 employability and regeneration plans.</p>

  <p>Scotland Week provides a significant opportunity to highlight Scotland as a dynamic market with great investment potential. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s international framework is due to be published later this month and will highlight the potential for a more co-ordinated approach to trade and cultural missions. In the meantime, it is important to capitalise on the very significant opportunities that exist in North America by encouraging major US and Canadian companies to look to Scotland as their global partner of choice, and by supporting Scottish-based companies wishing to grow their business in North America.</p>

  <p>As part of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to increased sustainable economic growth, the First Minister, the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism, and I took every opportunity during Scotland Week to engage with businesses in nine locations across North America, promoting the investment and business opportunities that exist in Scotland. During the most ambitious programme of events ever undertaken by Scottish ministers, the First Minister, Mr Mather and I in private meetings, at receptions, in speeches and through the media, sought to engage with potential new investors, with existing investors in Scotland, and with Scottish companies already trading in the US and Canada. We estimate that over 50 private sector companies with commitments in North America were active during Scotland Week and ministers met with many more.</p>

  <p>In addition to their interactions with major Scottish companies like the Wood Group, HBoS, RBS America, and Standard Life, ministers supported a diverse range of smaller Scottish businesses. The First Minister met three Scottish companies, SI Associates (management consultants), ClinTec (life sciences) and Visionware (IT), who have signed up to take advantage of Scottish Development International&rsquo;s incubator facilities in Boston and he congratulated two Scottish software companies, Integrated Environmental Solutions and Vamosa, who are now ready to graduate from the incubator and will be opening offices in Boston. The First Minister and I also met at the Inter-American Development Bank members of a 21 strong Scottish education and trade mission visiting Washington to explore trade opportunities.</p>

  <p>After the flooding in parts of England during the summer of 2007, the Minister for Environment wrote out to each of the eight regional strategic co-ordinating groups (SCG) asking for confirmation that they were adequately prepared to respond to similar events, should they occur in Scotland. All SCGs indicated they had assessed the flooding risk in their area, and had undertaken planning for such eventualities. In January 2008, a further self-evaluation was commissioned by the Scottish Government from SCGs in relation to their planning for a wider set of extreme weather events that might arise as a result of climate change, including coastal and inland flooding. Responses are currently being collated and evaluated by the Scottish Government. Further work is planned to enhance the measurement of preparedness for a range of emergencies.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has detailed corporate emergency response arrangements in place and operates a proportionate response to major incidents affecting Scotland. In the event of a major widespread flooding event arising in Scotland, the Scottish Government emergency room would be activated to liaise with local responders, assess the impact and co-ordinate the corresponding activity of government. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s emergency committee structures, which include official and ministerial groups, would be activated as required to: provide strategic direction and national overview for the activity of government, and to inform and support the local response by ensuring that any issues for government are considered and actioned promptly.</p>

  <p>There are no standing arrangements for a flood recovery co-ordinating team, as the existing emergency committee structures are designed to be flexible and adaptable for a range of emergencies. Any decision to set up a such a team would depend on the extent and range of impact of any flooding incident, the expectations and wishes of Scottish ministers and the actual activity required of Scottish Government. This decision would be taken by the Cabinet sub-committee (SEER), on which both the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth and the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment sit. This ministerial group would advise, depending on the nature of the impact, which minister would be best placed to chair these arrangements.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for local emergency preparedness is a matter for those responders specified as having a legal duty to prepare for emergencies under the Civil Contingencies Act 2004. Accordingly, whilst the Scottish Government provides support to responders in developing exercises, there is no centralised record of local civil contingencies exercises.</p>

  <p>At a national level, the Scottish Government oversees a national programme of exercises to address a range of risks. A Scottish-level extreme weather exercise is planned for 2009.</p>

  <p>The SFC&rsquo;s allocation to UHIMI is made direct to the institution, and not through Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE).</p>

  <p>In 2007, a one-off additional capital funding allocation of &pound;250,000 in 2006-07 and &pound;250,000 in 2007-08 was however made to Highlands and Islands Enterprise, specifically to support the development of UHIMI facilities at the North Highland College campus in Dornoch.</p>

  <p>Note: The figures in the table should be treated with some caution. For example, the surveillance systems used to compile the data for the Scandinavian countries above are derived from the European Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance Scheme (EARSS). Health Protection Scotland, who collect the data for NHSScotland, uses the UK definition of 14 day episodes while EARSS records one episode per quarter.</p>

  <p>Consequently, the surveillance system used in Scotland may result in a patient who experiences more than one bacteraemic episode per quarter being counted for each episode, whereas the EARSS definition used by the other countries in the table means that each of their patients is counted only once during a quarter, even if they have more than one bacteraemic episode per quarter.</p>

  <p>It is encouraging that the most recent &ndash; but as yet unpublished - results for Scotland from HPS data for the last calendar year indicate that the Scotland figure for the proportion of antibiotic non-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus isolates has reduced considerably to 26%.</p>

  <p>Our consultation paper, <em>A Fairer Local Tax for Scotland</em> , invites comments on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s proposed definition of &quot;Scottish taxpayers&quot;. A Scottish taxpayer living in Scotland and working in England will no longer have to pay council tax, but will be liable to pay a local income tax instead.</p>

  <p>Scotland has taken a joined-up approach to looking at the service development needs in relation to different populations and conditions. We have done this by building on the doing well by people with depression programme which ran from 2003 to 2006 with &pound;4.5 million investment.</p>

  <p>Based on the evidence from this programme, work is being undertaken through NHS Education for Scotland (NES) around cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT), family therapy and child psychotherapy as well as psychodynamic psychotherapy. NES has funded an additional 20 supervisors places and 0.5 WTE staff in each NHS board to support supervision and training. Fifty additional places have also been created to increase the capacity within the south east of Scotland and Tayside CBT programmes.</p>

  <p>At an individual NHS board level, work is underway to scope out the capacity of trained staff, and match this to demand, so that patients need can be met more effectively. Work has also been commissioned to establish an evidence base for psychological therapies in relation to different conditions and patient groups to assist NHS boards in their planning.</p>

  <p>A pilot of a telephone based CBT programme will commence shortly, alongside the roll out of an evidence-based CBT guided self help programme. In addition, work is on-going with the Royal College of General Practitioners to assess the management of patients with depression who also have a physical condition such as diabetes and or coronary heart disease. These initiative will cover all Scotland and will cost around &pound;3.5 million.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are free to use the independent sector to meet short-term pressures or to address temporary reductions in capacity, to ensure that NHS patients are treated quickly.</p>

  <p>We do not expect any NHS board to require to enter into long-term (block) contracts with independent health care providers for the provision of secondary care services. The Health Delivery Directorate&rsquo;s Access Support Team works very closely with NHS boards to ensure that the waiting times reductions set out in their Local Delivery Plans are met, including agreeing capacity plans, and will therefore be aware of any plans to make use of private sector capacity.</p>

  <p>Where an application for planning permission has been made to the planning authority and has been refused, approved with conditions, or the authority has failed to make a decision on the application within the set period, the applicant may appeal to Scottish ministers. Appeals are handled by inquiry reporters in the Directorate for Planning and Environmental Appeals.</p>

  <p>In most cases the inquiry reporter will prepare and issue the decision letter on behalf of Scottish ministers. In a small number of cases, however, the reporter will not issue the decision but will send a report with a recommendation to Scottish ministers. The decision on the appeal would be taken by the Planning Minister, Stewart Stevenson. If the Planning Minister were debarred from the decision-making process, e.g. by having a constituency interest or by having publicly expressed a view about the case, then another minister would make the decision on his behalf.</p>

  <p>The core Scottish Government has since December 2007 dealt with, or is in the process of dealing with, more than 175 parliamentary questions and 130 freedom of information requests about issues relating to these planning proposals. Responding to these, along with the range of other enquiries received, has had significant resource implications for those staff tasked with responding to them. It is not possible to quantify precisely the amount of time or expenditure dedicated to these responses, as officials do not routinely record time spent on individual tasks.</p>

  <p>However, given the unprecedented level of political interest in our handling of enquiries on these two particular applications, I have asked the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Planning Decisions Division to provide a retrospective estimate of costs. Officials in that Division estimate that, to date, they alone have spent well in excess of 2,000 staff hours &ndash; at a cost of over &pound;50,000 &ndash; since December 2007 on matters such as the many parliamentary questions, freedom of information requests, the Local Government and Communities Committee&rsquo;s inquiry and other associated tasks and communications relating to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s involvement in these two proposed developments. This estimate does not include time spent on the normal processing of the planning application for the Menie Estate, called in for determination by the Scottish Government, or handling of routine correspondence relating to the application. The estimate does not include the significant contributions made by officials from various other areas of the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>Local authorities will have flexibility to deploy teachers on the basis of local circumstances. This may mean that in some circumstances, access to a teacher will not be on a daily basis, although there will be expectation of an increase in the level of quality teacher input overall.</p>

  <p>Local circumstances will vary and it is essential that local authorities are given the flexibility to make decisions on how best to deploy teachers. It may be, therefore, that various models of teacher deployment, including peripatetic models, are part of the solution at local level.</p>

  <p>Research evidence indicates that greater levels of teacher involvement lead to improved outcomes for children but there is little research on the minimum level of teacher involvement needed to do so.

  <p>We will be providing local government with record levels of funding over the period covered by the spending review 2008-11. The vast majority of the funding will be provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority to allocate the total financial resources available to it on the basis of local needs and priorities having first fulfilled its statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and the full terms of the concordat. This includes extending entitlement to free school meals to all primary school and secondary school pupils whose parents or carers are in receipt of both maximum child tax credit and maximum working tax credit from August 2009, subject to the necessary legislation being passed by the Parliament.</p>

  <p>SEPA has a general duty under section 32 of the Environment Act 1995 to have regard to the economic needs of any area when formulating proposals relating to any of the agency&rsquo;s statutory functions. SEPA is also required to adhere to statutory guidance on Sustainable Development which requires the agency to ensure its actions do not unnecessarily constrain economic development, and to enforce high environmental standards whilst having regard to economic considerations.</p>

  <p>When responding to planning consultations, SEPA takes into account sustainable development considerations including, if relevant, the financial and employment imperatives involved. The statutory guidance on Sustainable Development also makes clear that SEPA&rsquo;s involvement in development planning is crucial in helping planning authorities to protect communities from inappropriate development and degradation of their local environment.</p>

  <p>SEPA, like other public bodies, needs to be aligned with, and prioritise, the strategic objectives of the Scottish Government which include &quot;Wealthier&quot; as well as &quot;Safer&quot; and &quot;Greener&quot;.</p>

  <p>Any question about how SEPA carried out its functions in relation to an individual case should be directed to its chief executive.</p>

  <p>All student teachers in publicly funded places are guaranteed a one-year teaching post on the teacher induction scheme. This affords them the opportunity to reach full registration in one school year.

  <p>Security in relation to children resident in secure care is a matter for secure units and those who place children and young people in their care. This includes local authorities, who place young people on remand or through the Children&rsquo;s Hearings system and Scottish ministers who place children and young people sentenced to detention under sections 205(2) and 208 of Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995. Scottish Government holds information in relation to the sentenced young people it places and can report that since St Mary&rsquo;s opened in 2000, one sentenced young person has absconded. In the light of that incident, we are currently seeking assurance on the management of sentenced young people by St Mary&rsquo;s.</p>
