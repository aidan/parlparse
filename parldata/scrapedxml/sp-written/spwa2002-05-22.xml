  <p>The Scottish Executive does not plan to make any representations to the UK Government, Civil Aviation Authority or BAA Scottish Airports on airport tax/charges. BAA Scottish Airports has, and is continuing to have, considerable growth in passenger numbers.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much of the &#163;10 million released to NHS boards for community care as announced on 22 February 2001 was allocated (a) to audiology services and (b) specifically for digital hearing aids.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-05-22.8.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80216" speakername="Mrs Mary Mulligan" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0522.htm#4">

  <p>The &#163;10 million was primarily intended to reduce pressure on hospital beds and allow people to be discharged from hospital, directly into the community, and support them in maintaining their independence. No specific sum was designated for audiology services but it was one of the areas suggested where this allocation could be used.</p>

  <p>We are aware of four NHS boards which took advantage of this and allocated a total of &#163;350,000 to audiology services. No information is held centrally on how much of this was used for digital hearing aids.</p>

  <p>I would also refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-24850 on 19 April 2002, which announced additional funds of &#163;750,000 for audiology services during 2002-03.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mr Bob Millar, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland does not operate a specific percentage target for home ownership. Local programmes are developed in close consultation with partners and reflect a broad range of existing partnership arrangements. Local programmes are based upon local housing market and needs analysis to identify, consistent with our strategy, the demands, needs and opportunities for housing investment. It is this local analysis that dictates the requirement for home ownership in an area.</p>

  <p>Under our Carers Strategy we have made &#163;10 million a year available to local authorities from April 2000 for services to support carers, including respite. Authorities are also being given substantial new resources to provide an extra 22,000 weeks of short break services each year across Scotland by 2003-04.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not discussed these specific issues with either COSLA or the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA). Following the publication of the report of the Action Group on Languages, <em>Citizens of a Multilingual World</em> , the Scottish Executive Education Department provides funding to local authorities to support the learning and teaching of any language other than English. The SQA makes provision for a range of languages including Japanese and Russian.</p>

  <p>The Freight Facilities Grant scheme aims to encourage the transfer of freight from road to rail and waterborne modes of transport by helping companies invest in the facilities needed to compete in financial terms with road transport. This scheme is an important part of the Scottish Executive's transport policy which involves a doubling of resources to &#163;36 million in the three-year period up to 2003-04.</p>

  <p>The opportunity to take advantage of this grant scheme already exists for companies moving mail originating in Scotland. However, the decision about whether to transfer mail from road to rail is a commercial matter for individual companies to make.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how the members of its Advisory Panel for the Review of Management and Decision-Making in NHSScotland were selected; why no patients' representative was included on the panel; how it will ensure that patients' interests are being addressed by the panel, and what budget has been set aside to cover the costs of the panel.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-05-22.21.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80140" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0522.htm#15">

  <p>The Advisory Panel for the Review of Management and Decision-Making is intended to act as a high level reference group which will inform the overall strategic direction of the review. Its membership is not intended to be representative, and members have been invited to serve in a personal capacity for their individual expertise and particular experience, much of which brings a perspective from outside NHSScotland.</p>

  <p>Since the provisional announcement on 3 April, an additional member has accepted my invitation to participate. She is an experienced carer and user of health services.</p>

  <p>The review itself will be conducted throughout in an open and inclusive manner. A central objective will be to engage effectively with a wide range of stakeholders, including patients' groups.</p>

  <p>The only costs directly associated with the advisory panel will be reimbursement of reasonable travel and subsistence expenses incurred in connection with attendance at quarterly meetings.</p>

  <p>The Remote and Rural Areas Resource Initiative (RARARI) has invited bids for project support in two bidding rounds held in 2000 and 2001. No bids were received from Stirling or Clackmannanshire. Details of the projects for which it has agreed to provide funding are available direct from RARARI or from its website at:</p>

  <p>I am announcing today the Executive's initial response to the Report of the Legal Advice and Information Provision in Scotland Working Group. I very much value the work carried out by the working group and broadly agree with the key issues and their proposals for the immediate way forward. I am therefore launching a practical programme of development work which picks up on many of the recommendations made by the group. This should provide the information which the Executive requires to take strategic decisions on the provision of legal advice services with the ultimate aim of improving access to justice, by creating a more joined-up, quality-assured network of advice, information and help for the people of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Any fine imposed on the UK by the European Court of Justice resulting from a failure to meet an EC obligation would be borne by the UK Government as the member state. If the fine was a result of a breach of EC law on a devolved matter in Scotland, then paragraph B3.25 of the Concordat on Co-ordination of European Policy Issues would apply. Further liability for the breach would depend on the individual circumstances of the breach.</p>

  <p>In relation to domestic legislation, it is the general rule that Scottish Water is liable for any fine arising from the failure of its water supply and wastewater operations to meet legal requirements, subject to any defences available to it under the relevant legislation. With regard to wastewater discharges, however, there are circumstances where Scottish Water can reduce or transfer the risk associated with prosecution. These include the use of trade effluent consents or agreements and also within some Public/Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements, whereby the discharge consent rests with the PPP concessionaire.</p>

  <p>Section 129 (5) of the Roads (Scotland) Act 1984 makes it an offence to cycle on a footway which has not been redetermined for use by both pedestrians and cyclists.</p>

  <p>It is of course a matter for the police and for Procurators Fiscal to proceed as they deem appropriate when any offence has been committed.</p>

  <p>The answer to S1W-24643 should in fact have read 15 times. The actual and planned uses of section 57(1) of the Scotland Act 1998 are contained in the following lists:</p>

  <p>Section 57(1) of the Scotland Act 1998 has already been used in the following cases;</p>

  <p>The Sea Fishing (North-East Atlantic Control Measures) Order 2000 (SI 2000/1843) which implemented Council Regulation 2791/1999.</p>

  <p>The Feeding Stuffs (Enforcement) Regulations 1999 (SI 1999/2325) which implemented Council Directive 95/53/EC, Commission Directive 98/68/EC and, in part, Council Directive 1999/20/EC.</p>

  <p>The Export Restrictions (Foot-and-Mouth Disease) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/498). These regulations implemented the European Union ban on exports immediately following the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease (initially Commission Decision 2001/145/EC).</p>

  <p>The Export Restrictions (Foot-and-Mouth Disease) (Amendment) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/627). These regulations simply extended by one day the above regulations without further amendment.</p>

  <p>The Foot-and-Mouth Disease (Export of Vehicles) (Disinfection of Tyres) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/887). These regulations implemented another part of the European Union export ban.</p>

  <p>The Biocidal Products Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/880). These regulations implemented Directive 1998/8/EC of the European Parliament and of the council concerning the placing of Biocidal Products on the market.</p>

  <p>The Environmental Protection (Controls on Injurious Substances) (Amendment) Regulations 2001 (SI 2001/3141). These regulations implemented, in part, Commission Directive 1999/51/EC adapting to technical progress for the fifth time Annex 1 to Council Directive 76/769/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations, and administrative provisions of the member states relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (tin, PCP and cadmium.)</p>

  <p>Ozone Depleting Substances Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/528). These regulations implemented Regulation 2037/2000 of the European Parliament and of the council of 29 June 2000 on substances that deplete the ozone layer.</p>

  <p>The Hemp (Third Country Imports) Regulations 2002 (SI 2002/787) which implemented Regulation 245/2001.</p>

  <p>It is planned to use section 57(1) of the Scotland Act 1998 to implement the following obligations:</p>

  <p>Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the council concerning the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations (Dangerous Preparations Directive).</p>

  <p>Commission Directive 2001/58/EC amending for the second time Directive 91/155/EEC defining and laying down the detailed arrangements for the system of specific information relating to dangerous preparations in implementation of Article 14 of European Parliament and Council Directive 1999/45/EC and relating to dangerous substances in implementation of Article 27 of Council Directive 67/548/EEC (safety data sheets).</p>

  <p>Commission Directive 2001/59/EC adapting to technical progress for the 28th time Council Directive 67/548/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous substances.</p>

  <p>Commission Directive 2001/60/EC adapting to technical progress Directive 1999/45/EC of the European Parliament and of the council concerning the approximation of the laws, regulations and administrative provisions of the member states relating to the classification, packaging and labelling of dangerous preparations.</p>

  <p>Commission Directive 2001/91/EC adapting to technical progress for the eighth time Annex 1 to Council Directive 76/769/EEC on the approximation of the laws, regulations, and administrative provisions of the member states relating to restrictions on the marketing and use of certain dangerous substances and preparations (hexachloroethane).</p>

  <p>Commission Directive 2001/78/EC of 13 September 2001 concerning the use of standard forms in the publication of public contract notices.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has made no direct contributions to the project Caring in Craigmillar. I can confirm, however, that the Craigmillar Social Inclusion Partnership (SIP) has agreed to contribute the sum of &#163;64,000 to Caring in Craigmillar from its 2002-03 SIP Fund allocation.</p>

  <p>The City of Edinburgh Council has confirmed that Caring in Craigmillar will manage a service level agreement covering support to the elderly from April 2002. The service prior to that date was delivered by the project Phonelink.</p>

  <p>Craigmillar SIP has also supported Phonelink from its SIP fund allocation as follows:</p>

  <p>As previously outlined in the answer given to question S1O-4974 on 28 March 2002, nursery teachers are paid on the same scale as other teachers employed by local authorities. Their salaries are reviewed and negotiated by the Scottish Negotiating Committee for Teachers.</p>

  <p>Guidance on best practice for traffic management, and other road-related issues, is contained within the <em>Design Manual for Roads and Bridges</em> published by HMSO. The guidance and advice contained within this series of documents has been agreed and published jointly by National Overseeing Departments, which includes the Scottish Executive, and is intended for use by local authorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive also hosts regular Traffic Signal User Group meetings for local council practitioners where advice on best practice is discussed and disseminated.</p>

  <p>General advice on traffic signalled junctions is contained in the <em>Design Manual for Roads and Bridges</em> , in <em>Local Transport Notes</em> and in Traffic Advisory Leaflets.</p>

  <p>For pedestrian crossings guidance suggests a minimum spacing of 100 metres to adjacent signals, depending on local circumstances.</p>

  <p>There is no specific guidance on the maximum number of sets of traffic signals in a defined area. This would be determined by the density and other characteristics of the road network being managed.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for traffic management on local roads is a matter for determination by the individual traffic authorities.</p>
