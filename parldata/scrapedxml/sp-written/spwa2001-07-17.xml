  <p>The <i>International Adult Literacy Survey</i> suggested that 23% of adults in Scotland may have low literacy and numeracy skills.</p>

  <p>On 2 July I published the Adult Literacy Team&#8217;s report, <i>Adult Literacy and Numeracy</i> <i>in Scotland. </i>I am now considering the report&#8217;s 21 key recommendations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has already committed &#163;22.5 million over the next three years to the task of raising literacy and numeracy levels. &#163;18.5 million of this will be channelled through local authorities to community learning strategy learning partnerships to raise to around 80,000 the number of Scottish learners who will be assisted over the next three years.</p>

  <p>The Education and Training (Scotland) Regulations 2000 determine the qualifying arrangements regarding eligibility for an Individual Learning Account (ILA). These regulations require that an individual must be resident in Scotland on a temporary or permanent basis, and, where such residence is temporary he is ordinarily resident within the European Economic Area.</p>

  <p>In the case of an asylum seeker, his residence in Scotland is dependent on the outcome of a petition for asylum. Until such times as the outcome is known, he cannot be regarded as being permanently resident in Scotland and he would not, therefore, be eligible for an Individual Learning Account. If he were later granted permission to remain in Scotland he would then be eligible for an ILA from that date.</p>

  <p>We believe there would be considerable benefit for all concerned in establishing the central body within an existing organisation that already has a strong connection with volunteers and the voluntary sector. With that in mind we have been examining with Volunteer Development Scotland (VDS) whether that organisation could assume the role of the central body. VDS has agreed in principle to act as the central body and for the body to be located within and as part of its organisation. A draft specification has been prepared and VDS has been invited, on an informal basis at this stage, to consider its terms.</p>

  <p>Directive 98/04/EEC, which predates devolution, makes relatively minor technical amendments to an existing directive on utilities procurement which has already been given effect in UK law. Separate implementation for Scotland would create two sets of amendments to existing UK regulations. This would cause unwarranted complications for those wishing to interpret the legislation and, given that there is no particular Scottish dimension here, I have agreed that implementation should be on a UK basis.

  <p>The report of the Expert Panel on Sex Offending chaired by the Honourable Lady Cosgrove was published on 12 June 2001. It made a total of 73 recommendations including a recommendation that the Crown should consider leading evidence to assist the jury in a sexual offence trial to understand the likely behavioural impact on the victim of a sexual crime.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office is currently considering the report and recommendations. It is anticipated that evidence of this nature would not seek to comment on the credibility or reliability of the individual victim but would simply provide a jury with general evidence in relation to characteristic behaviour of victims which would assist the jury to evaluate their evidence.</p>

  <p>The prosecution of crime is itself a specialised activity. However, the prosecution of sexual offences requires not only the knowledge of the relevant law, which is common to all criminal law practitioners, but also understanding of the effect on the victim and skills in handling such cases. Relevant training is given to all prosecutors and care is taken in the allocation of such cases particularly at precognition stage. Particular issues arise in the case of offences against children and for these cases each region has highly trained, specialist legal and precognition staff who provide a resource for dealing with such cases.</p>

  <p>There is no such information available. Modern Apprenticeships were introduced in Scotland to address the skills needs at intermediate level and lead to a SVQ Level 3. Skillseekers provides training opportunities for young people at SVQ Level 2, at a similar level to Foundation Modern Apprentices in England. These are funded from within the block grant-in-aid provided by the Scottish Executive to Scottish Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Enterprise.</p>

  <p>Following a thorough review of the options for relocating the Scottish Public Pensions Agency (SPPA), I can announce today we have decided that the SPPA will be located in the Galashiels area of the Borders, subject to the successful conclusion of negotiations for suitable premises.</p>

  <p>The move of the Scottish Public Pensions Agency will create around 175 posts in the Borders. We anticipate that the actual move will take place in the latter part of 2002. We have considered carefully a number of options and believe that relocation to the Galashiels area meets the criteria for the location of public sector work set out by the then First Minister in his answer to question S1W-1558 on 15 September 1999.</p>
