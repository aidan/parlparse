  <p>It is not possible to predict what information will be made available as a result of the provisions of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Bill. Consideration of whether requested information would be disclosed will be on a case-by-case basis.</p>

  <p>The bill will, if enacted, establish a statutory right of access to all information held by a wide range of Scottish public authorities. The right of access would be enforced by an independent Scottish Information Commissioner, who would consider appeals and have powers to order the disclosure of information. The bill would replace the non-statutory <i>Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information</i>.</p>

  <p>In relation to information held by the Scottish Administration relating to the formulation or development of policy, the bill provides that, once a policy decision has been taken, any statistical information used to provide an informed background to that decision is not to be regarded as exempt from disclosure.</p>

  <p><i>Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change</i> confirmed the Executive&#8217;s commitment to working with others to move the focus of health policy and health services from treatment to prevention.</p>

  <p>While occupational health and safety is a reserved matter, it has a strong bearing on many devolved areas, such as health, local government, transport and the environment. The Executive has been tackling this broad agenda in partnership with the UK government, Scottish local authorities, NHSScotland, the CBI, the TUC, the Federation of Small Businesses, the British Chambers of Commerce, Scotland&#8217;s Health at Work, the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and others. This joint activity includes, for example, the <i>Revitalising Health and Safety</i> initiative; <i>Securing Health Together - a long-term occupational strategy for Scotland, England and Wales</i>; <i>Towards a Safer, Healthier Workplace</i>, the occupational health and safety strategy for NHSScotland, and <i>Tomorrow&#8217;s Roads - safer for everyone</i>, a strategy to reduce the number of people killed or seriously injured in road accidents in Great Britain by 40% by 2010. The Health and Safety Executive is also contributing to the Job Retention and Rehabilitation Pilot, led by the Department of Work and Pensions.</p>

  <p>Listed Building Consent for the works at the John Muir Birthplace in Dunbar has not been granted by Scottish ministers; consent for the works has been given by East Lothian Council as planning authority.</p>

  <p>Prior to issuing the consent, East Lothian Council notified the application to ministers under the requirements of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997. Notification permits ministers to consider whether an application raises issues, such as national planning policy matters, which merit its being called-in for determination by them rather than the planning authority. In this instance, ministers decided on the basis of the information before them, including advice from their officials in Historic Scotland, that it would be appropriate to leave the decision on the application to East Lothian Council. Advice given by civil servants to ministers is confidential.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Executive Health Department has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health services and patient care within the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>CSO received no requests for funding research into these issues during 2000-01.</p>

  <p>A three-year research project funded by CSO&#8217;s Health Services Research Committee is under way, based at Ninewells Hospital, Dundee. A randomised controlled trial to evaluate a specialist nurse-led model of early discharge from hospital following axillary clearance surgery for breast cancer will measure impact on patients and carers, cost effectiveness, efficacy and acceptability from primary and secondary care perspectives. This project is due to end in December 2002.</p>

  <p>This reflects increased ministerial priority for the provision of affordable rented housing and the temporary suspension of the Grants for Rent or Owner Occupation programme.

  <p>Whilst no such assessment has been carried out, the Executive&#8217;s commitment to promoting renewable energy embraces a wide spectrum of technologies. We will continue, working within a UK framework for energy research and development, to encourage support for a range of renewable technologies in Scotland, including solar heating.</p>

  <p>Both the previous and current trunk road operator had/have access to resources in addition to dedicated gritters for the trunk roads.</p>

  <p>Snowblowers are likely to be required less often on the trunk roads in the Fife area and therefore no snowblowers are dedicated to these routes. However, both the previous and current trunk road operators had/have access to such equipment if required.</p>

  <p>The Performance Audit Group (PAG) is appointed by the Scottish Executive to audit and monitor the activities of BEAR Scotland Ltd. BEAR&#8217;s physical performance is monitored and audited throughout the year by PAG&#8217;s Field Engineers. During winter months PAG pays particular attention to reviewing BEAR&#8217;s strategic planning as described in their Winter Maintenance Plan. This involves monitoring the management of BEAR&#8217;s plant and labour resources and the deployment of these resources. PAG communicates its observations to the Executive by means of various reports either periodically or as particular matters arise.</p>

  <p>It would be inappropriate for the Executive to provide information which would harm the frankness and candour of discussion and advice, including between the Scottish Executive and legal advisers.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that UK tax law applies on the wind-up of occupational pensions schemes, including the Scottish Transport Group pension schemes. The Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 applies. For tax purposes, beneficiaries will be responsible for reporting the receipt of the ex-gratia payments to the Inland Revenue in the normal manner. The tax payable on payments made to beneficiaries will depend on the personal tax circumstances of individuals.</p>
