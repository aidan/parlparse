  <p>The Scottish Government will continue to be advised by the Food Standards Agency on this matter and they in turn are advised by their scientific advisory committees. The Food Standards Agency is aware of the review of iron and health being carried out by Scientific Advisory Committee on Nutrition (SACN). This review was initiated by SACN in 2002 and should be available in 2008.</p>

  <p>The World Cancer Research Fund advice on meat consumption goes further than current Food Standards Agency&rsquo;s advice which recommends that some meat should be consumed as part of a healthy balanced diet. Meat is a good source of iron, zinc, B vitamins and protein but should be eaten in moderation due to its high saturated fat content.</p>

  <p>Under the concordat agreed between Scottish ministers and COSLA, funding for community safety and antisocial behaviour will be absorbed into the main local government settlement from 1 April 2008.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will be providing local government with record levels of funding over the period covered by the Spending Review 2008-11. The vast majority of the funding, including funding for community safety and antisocial behaviour will be provided by means of a block grant. It is the responsibility of each local authority, in conjunction with their Community Planning Partners, to allocate funding on the basis of their local needs and priorities &ndash; having first fulfilled their statutory obligations and the jointly agreed set of national and local priorities, including the Scottish Government&rsquo;s key strategic objectives and manifesto commitments. We will continue to set the direction of national policy and ensure through national and local outcome agreements that these priorities are being delivered.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held by the Scottish Government. The Scottish Government is committed to modernising the justice system to fully support victims and witnesses, to increase support and improve standards of treatment for vulnerable witnesses to help them participate in legal proceedings and give their best evidence.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service is responsive to the needs of intimidated witnesses and works closely with other agencies including the Witness Service and the Scottish Court Service to ensure that, where appropriate, special arrangements are in place for such witnesses including making particular arrangements for the witness to enter and leave from court via a staff door or waiting in area that is separate from the witness waiting room.</p>

  <p>Following implementation of the Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004, the Crown can apply for special measures for adult vulnerable witnesses whose quality of evidence will be diminished by fear or distress in connection with giving evidence at court to make it easier for them to give their evidence.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available as it is not held on the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) database.</p>

  <p>A number of measures have already been or are being introduced in 2008 as part of the Summary Justice Reform programme to ensure that summary trials are not disrupted because of witnesses failing to appear.</p>

  <p>Firstly, in relation to obstructive witnesses, the Criminal Proceedings etc. (Reform) (Scotland) Act 2007 will introduce new provisions to allow warrants to be granted for obstructive witnesses, to release witnesses on bail until they give evidence and to create a new offence of failing to appear as a witness when on bail.</p>

  <p>Secondly, in relation to witnesses who might feel intimidated, the 2007 act also provides a new standard bail condition that an accused on bail does not behave in a manner which causes, or is likely to cause, alarm or distress to witnesses. In considering whether or not to oppose bail, the Procurator Fiscal will take into account and present to the court any relevant information which suggests a risk of intimidation.</p>

  <p>Any criminal behaviour involving intimidation of witnesses will be taken very seriously by COPFS.</p>

  <p>Finally, to improve the way in which witnesses are cited, COPFS launched the postal service of witness citations in October 2004. Postal citation is more convenient for a witness than having a police officer attend at their door to deliver a witness citation by hand.</p>

  <p>The Stocktake of Alcohol and Drug Action Teams (ADATs), which was published this summer, found that performance management of ADATS should be strengthened and made a number of recommendations on performance and accountability. The Scottish Government is working with stakeholders to develop arrangements for greater accountability and a more robust performance management system that will allow partners to better demonstrate what they deliver.</p>

It is likely that the new OPITO Oil and Gas Academy will also prove an important partner for Skills Development Scotland.</p>

  <p>We recognise the need to provide stability and continuity for the delivery of our national training programmes during the period of transition to the new body.

  <p>I have approved the reduction in the cost of a modacrylic wig in line with the reduction in prescription charges leading to abolition of the charge from 1 April 2011. Where the clinician prescribes a human hair wig to meet the patient&rsquo;s clinical need, the charge levied will be the same as a prescription charge. Patients who are exempt from payment of prescription charges will also be exempt from paying a charge for their prescribed wig.

  <p>Scottish Enterprise has approved funding of up to &pound;12.869 million to the Ravenscraig project for infrastructure costs in phase one.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland has not entered into any legal commitment to provide financial support to Ravenscraig, but has indicated its intention to provide Housing Association Grant to support the development of 350 affordable houses during the lifetime of the project.

  <p>There is no plan to set a target for the reduction of the rate of undiagnosed HIV infection. An HIV sub-group of the National Sexual Health Advisory Committee has been looking at issues relating to the diagnosis and prevention of HIV among men who have sex with men (MSM), the group for which the issue is most relevant, and although recommendations around HIV testing are being considered, these do not include target setting. The reason for this is that, in recent years much has been done to improve the uptake of HIV testing among MSM and heterosexual men and women, including those attending antenatal clinics.</p>

  <p>Two relatively recent policies have improved, dramatically, testing uptake and thus diagnosis of HIV. In 2003, the introduction of routine HIV testing among women attending antenatal clinics occurred and since then, only one or two HIV infections among pregnant women have remained undetected during their pregnancy; this means that the transmission of HIV from mother-to-child in Scotland is now rare.</p>

A health care model targeted at deprived and other areas with high numbers of disadvantaged children will be developed in 2008.

  <p>The national sexual health strategy, Respect and Responsibility included an action for NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) to take forward the development of appropriate clinical standards for dealing with sexually transmitted infections. NHS QIS produced draft standards for consultation in July 2007. These include standards for chlamydia testing and partner notification. A specific piece of work was undertaken to ensure that the draft standards met the needs of remote and rural areas. The final standards will be published in March 2008 and will be taken forward by NHS boards.</p>

  <p>Community planning already entails local engagement with individuals and organisations in the area of each partnership, including the voluntary sector. As I mentioned in my parliamentary statement, the Scottish Government will provide community planning partnerships with advice and encouragement to help all sectors to play their part in cultural delivery, and to add value through cultural activity.</p>

  <p>Local authorities provide financial resources to voluntary arts and crafts sector bodies in their area in relation to a range of activity. In 2005-06 (the latest figures available) the total amount of local authority grant aid to the voluntary arts sector amounted to about &pound;11.3 million.</p>
