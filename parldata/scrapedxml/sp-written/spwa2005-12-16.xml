  <p>The Scottish Executive provides funding to Road Safety Scotland for the development of key road safety education initiatives and publicity messages. Road Safety Scotland provides publicity to complement enforcement campaigns, focussing on drink driving, organised by the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland. Road Safety Scotland has arranged radio advertising, beer-mats and posters in support of the police festive drink drive campaign launched on 5 December.</p>

  <p>Road Safety Scotland&rsquo;s current strategy for drink drive publicity is informed by research, published by the Scottish Executive in 2004, on the <em>Evaluation of the 2003-04 Festive Drink Drive Campaign</em> undertaken by the Association of Chief Officers of Police in Scotland. The research is enabling Road Safety Scotland to target specific messages at key groups. Copies of the research report are available in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 34045).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of proposed dismissals of Irish seafarers by Irish Ferries, part of the Irish Continental Group, what additional safeguards will be put in place during the pre-qualification process for the contract to run the Clyde and Hebrides lifeline ferry services in order for the Executive to fulfil its commitment to protecting the interests of the workforce and the communities dependent on the lifeline services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to protecting the interests of the workforce of Caledonian MacBrayne and the communities it serves.</p>

  <p>In line with the relevant regulations (the Public Service Contracts Regulations), prospective bidders at the pre-qualification stage may only be required to show that they understand the project&rsquo;s requirements and are likely to be able to undertake the work adequately. At the pre-qualification stage a contracting authority cannot take into account which providers it thinks are likely to submit the best proposals for carrying out the specific project, or (for example) has the best, or better, employment policies than other bidders.</p>

  <p>However, in relation to protecting the interests of the workforce the subsequent Invitation to Tender document will invite bids on the basis that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (TUPE) applies. This provides some protection for the CalMac workforce. However, we are also aware that TUPE offers protection only at the point of transfer. It is still possible that a prospective operator could contemplate replacing the current staff with others on different terms and conditions. Consequently, we will include provisions in the contract, and make it clear to the bidders that, if this were pursued, the new operator would have to pay for any redundancy or other compensation involved, and that such payments would not qualify for subsidy. These would have to be met from the operator&rsquo;s own resources. In addition, any saving of staff costs that arose would be clawed back through an equivalent reduction in subsidy. This will create a disincentive to an operator to propose an approach involving replacement of the existing staff.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the proposed dismissals of Irish seafarers by Irish Ferries, part of the Irish Continental Group, what other factors besides costs will be considered when evaluating bids for the contract to run the Clyde and Hebrides lifeline ferry services and what measures will be put in place to ensure a rigorous pre-qualification process.</p>

  <p>Potential operators and their proposals will be heavily scrutinised. The first stage of that process, the pre-qualification stage, considers their ability to provide the service. This involves looking at their financial standing, standards of ability and technical capacity including experience and safety record. For those bidders that pass the first stage, the second stage requires them to put together a very detailed bid explaining how they would provide the service. The proposals will be scrutinised closely. To pass this stage, operators must convince the Executive that the standard of service for users would be at least as good as that currently provided by CalMac. The final stage looks at the bid for subsidy. However, only those bidders who have demonstrated that they are capable of delivering the service to the required standard will reach this stage.</p>

  <p>The Executive is of the view that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (TUPE) is likely to be applicable to any staff transfer arising from the tendering of the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services. This means that transferring employees would be entitled to be employed on the same terms and conditions as they had at the point of transfer. However, the contract will also include mechanisms to protect the terms and conditions of the existing workforce during the contract period.</p>

  <p>It is for Caledonian MacBrayne as employer of the staff concerned to consider such matters and I understand that it has made a detailed assessment of the effect of a decision to introduce offshore crewing would have on the staff concerned.</p>

  <p>The company wrote to all of its staff 4 November 2005 as part of a 90 day consultation process on its offshore crewing proposals, providing a detailed explanation of the implications for terms and conditions and the right to state benefits. In doing so, it confirmed that the terms and conditions of staff employed through an offshore company would be unchanged and would transfer, together with continuous service rights, to an offshore crewing company that would be established as a subsidiary of Caledonian MacBrayne.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what examination it has carried out into whether the transfer of Clyde and Hebrides ferry workers contracts offshore could further jeopardise security of employment for these workers in the event of Caledonian MacBrayne not gaining the contract to run the lifeline services.</p>

  <p>Should Caledonian MacBrayne proceed and implement their offshore crewing proposals prior to the start of the new contract this will have no impact on the security of employment for the Caledonian MacBrayne workforce. The Invitation to Tender will invite bids on the basis that the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations (TUPE) applies and the staff will transfer, should another operator win the contract. Recent case law strengthens the view that TUPE will apply. In addition, offshore status will not affect the more general protection available to employees under UK employment law. Employees would continue to be employed within the UK and on UK flagged vessels. As such they would continue to have the same statutory rights they currently enjoy in relation to their employment.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are responsible for safety on local roads in their area. Scottish ministers provide local authorities with revenue and capital allocations for expenditure on a number of services, including roads and transport, which may be used for local road safety projects. Specific support has been provided since 2000 for cycling, walking and safer streets projects, including safer routes to school (CWSS): prior to that there was no specific grant schemes in this area. Support has been provided since 2003 for 20mph schemes around schools, related safety projects and home zones (20mph); a child pedestrian training pilot in West Dunbartonshire (CPTP), and funding for new school travel co-ordinator posts (STC). Accident investigation and prevention (AIP) measures have also been carried out on trunk roads in West Dunbartonshire. The level of support by financial year is given in the following table.</p>

  <p>It is too early to say what properties will qualify for compensation. An allowance has been made for compensation within the overall scheme budget which will be subject to detailed negotiations once the detailed design is complete.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-12-16.S2W-21709.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80077" speakername="Mr Tom McCabe" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa1216.htm#8">

  <p>The <em>Construction Procurement Manual</em> will be published on the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s website today. Along with complementary changes to the <em>Scottish Public Finance Manual</em> , the revised guidance addresses a number of measures relating to the procurement and management of major capital projects including: mandatory use of the independent Gateway Review process on high-risk or mission-critical projects exceeding &pound;5 million budget, clearer decision-making and accountability in relation to choice of procurement route, and clarification of appointment processes for design teams in accordance with EU procurement rules.</p>

  <p>As Lord Fraser&rsquo;s report acknowledged, the circumstances of the Holyrood project might be regarded as exceptional. Since 1999 many improvements have already been implemented by the Executive, including publication of the <em>Construction Client Pack</em> and the introduction of Gateway Reviews. The further improvements incorporated in the new <em>Construction Procurement Manual</em> and in the revisions to the <em>Scottish Public Finance Manual</em> should help ensure that other Scottish public projects do not experience similar difficulties in future.</p>

  <p>The <em>Construction Procurement Manual </em>will be available at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/topics/Planning-Building/Construction" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/topics/Planning-Building/Construction</a>.</p>
