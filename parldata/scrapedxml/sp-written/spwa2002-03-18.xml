  <p>Responsibility for assessing the economic impact of taxation matters lies with Her Majesty's Treasury. No specific estimate has been made of the percentage increase in construction costs of public sector projects in Scotland. However, the cost of aggregates is normally a small fraction of overall costs, and the impact of the tax can be minimised by use of recycled materials or alternative building techniques.</p>

  <p>This is primarily a matter for Strathclyde Police who work in partnership with other local bodies to reduce crime.</p>

We announced the formulated awards last October. Inverclyde will receive &#163;259,073, and Renfrewshire will receive &#163;362,215 over the next three years. The variable award for 2002-03 was announced on 15 March and Inverclyde and Renfrewshire will both receive a further &#163;26,783.</p>

  <p>Dalmuir STW (PFI)</p>

  <p>at a total cost of over &#163;95 million.</p>

  <p>Schemes in the current investment plan 2002-06 that will improve or maintain water quality are as follows:</p>

  <p>Bothwellbank STW Upgrading</p>

  <p>Allers STW</p>

  <p>Carbarns STW</p>

  <p>Helensburgh Sewerage Scheme</p>

  <p>Dalmarnock STW</p>

  <p>Daldowie STW</p>

  <p>Hamilton STW</p>

Migratory salmon now regularly return to the Clyde, Cart and Kelvin systems.</p>

  <p>The multi-million pound programme of improvements, described previously, to CSOs will ensure that this improvement continues, and SEPA is confident of continued improvements in water quality.</p>

  <p>The available information is given in the table. Other crime categories, such as possession of an offensive weapon and robbery, may also involve firearms. However, the numbers of such cases cannot, from the information held centrally, be separately identified from the total numbers of prosecutions and convictions for these crime categories.

  <p>The number of students undertaking post-graduate research in Scottish higher education institutions has increased in recent years. A key objective of our Science Strategy is to ensure that enough people study science to a standard which will enable the future needs of the country to be met. Currently, the Executive is participating in the Robert's Review of the Supply of Skilled Scientists and Engineers in the UK, the findings of which will be published shortly. Interim findings for the review were published last November. These suggest that the greater participation rates in higher and further education in Scotland have benefited the supply of scientists and engineers.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide any reliable estimate because there are several possible permutations of circumstances and the outcome in each case will depend on the precise circumstances applicable in the individual case. Even if an existing complaint cannot proceed it will be possible in many cases to re-commence a prosecution so that the case itself will not be lost. What can be said with certainty is that in Scotland as a whole, as at 21 February, 18 cases had been identified as completely unable to proceed.</p>

  <p>I have asked John Ewing, Chief Executive of the Scottish Court Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The four largest courts have a CCTV system permanently installed. All others have access to mobile systems which can be deployed to the courts as required. The information is given in the following table.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Law Commission last considered the definition of a vulnerable witness in its Report No. 125 of 1990. Since then, work on this issue has been taken forward by the Scottish Executive through the <i>Towards a Just Conclusion</i> Action Plan, published in June 2000. A number of discussions have taken place with relevant voluntary organisations. A consultation paper including a section on this topic is scheduled for publication this spring.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.

  <p>The Loch Lomond and The Trossachs Interim Committee also continues to undertake a programme of work aimed at providing a properly managed infrastructure for visitors.</p>

  <p>Planning applications, notified to the Scottish ministers, are recorded by planning authority area. Since 1 May 1999, 830 have been referred, but it is not possible to accurately identify these by parliamentary constituency. This is because the information on the planning application form is not always sufficiently precise to do so.</p>

  <p>In the current session, 2001-02, local authorities receive funding at the rate of &#163;1,254 for a fully loaded part-time pre-school education place. They are free to top slice this level to meet the costs of services provided to their partner providers. The minimum recommended level for the purchase of places in the voluntary and private sector is &#163;900.</p>

  <p>Funding for the police, which is currently at record levels, is allocated in total to each force. It is for police authorities, in consultation with chief constables, to set budgets for individual forces. Once a budget has been agreed, the use of that budget to meet the operational needs of each force is a matter for individual chief constables.</p>

  <p>On 25 February, I awarded an extra &#163;20 million in grant in financial year 2001-02 to local authorities to speed up assessment and repair work to local roads and bridges. This is in addition to the extra &#163;70 million included in capital allocations between financial year 2001-02 to 2003-04 to tackle the backlog of repairs and maintenance to local roads and bridges.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities to prioritise the upgrading of any bridges and to allocate the necessary funding from the resources available to them. It is also their responsibility to take forward any action required to complete the Bridgeguard 3 assessment programme and to carry out any necessary work identified by the programme.</p>

  <p>I have asked the Chief Executive of West of Scotland Water to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The plans for the new Water Treatment Works at Milngavie take into account the need to conserve and enhance the existing reservoirs. For example, no above ground construction is planned, except behind the tree belt around the site at Barrachan. Additional planting is also to be established to reinforce this tree line.</p>

  <p>One of West of Scotland Water&rsquo;s environmental objectives is to improve public access to its properties, as far as this does not compromise water quality, public safety or essential maintenance activities. Once the new plant is in service, this will take all operational and maintenance activities away from the existing works at the south of the reservoirs, along with personnel access and chemical deliveries. This will remove the conflict between public access and operational requirements, leading to a possible reduction in the existing restrictions on public activities.</p>

  <p>Some further tangible evidence of delivery of the authority&rsquo;s Environmental Strategy in the Craigmaddie/Mugdock area, include improving path networks and signposting within accessible areas, by December 2002. Suitable locations for bat boxes have also been identified in the locale and will be pursued in due course. When the project is completed, the need for bird scaring on the reservoirs will also be removed.</p>

  <p>The authority and East Dunbartonshire Council have undertaken to discuss the long-term future of public access to Milngavie reservoirs. These future discussions will help formulate how to best meet the needs of the population, with respect to the reservoirs, Mugdock Country Park, access between them, and car parking.</p>

Up to &#163;21.75 million of this sum is targeted at supporting facilities and programmes designed to promote the role of sport, in diverting young people from criminal activity or behaviours likely to lead to this type of activity. I expect the detailed arrangements for the disbursement of these funds to be announced by NOF shortly.</p>
