  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-26241 by Malcolm Chisholm on 6 June 2002, what the average percentage of patients in Angus requiring ambulance transfer within one or two hours who were not transported within this timeframe was in (a) 1996-97, (b) 1997-98, (c) 1998-99, (d) 1999-2000 and (e) 2000-01.</p>

  <p>The average percentage of patients in Angus requiring ambulance transfer within one or two hours, who were transported within this timeframe in 2000-01, was 83.4% for those within one hour and 91.3% for those within two hours.</p>

  <p>In the years prior to 2000-01, the information was gathered on an overall basis and a breakdown of the percentage of patients transferred within one or two hours is not available. The table therefore shows the average percentage of patients in Angus requiring ambulance transfer, who were transported to hospital within 15 minutes of the time agreed between ambulance control room staff and the GPs requesting the transfer.</p>

  <p>The Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme is a UK-wide tariff based scheme. In January, the Westminster Government (in consultation with the Executive, the Northern Ireland Office and the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority) responded to a consultation paper issued by the European Union about compensation for victims of violent crime. The main aim of this EU initiative is to improve access to state compensation by victims within the European Union by agreeing common minimum standards. The UK scheme is the most generous of its kind in Europe and we will play an active role in future discussion of these issues.</p>

  <p>Good practice guidelines for public authorities were published by the Scottish Translation Interpreting and Communication Forum in March 2002. The guidelines consider BSL as well as other community language issues. The Scottish Executive is funding a development worker, managed by the forum, to take this work forward. The worker is based in the Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive are also encouraging sign language training and interpreting through funding of voluntary organisations under section 9 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has issued guidance on educational provision and support for pupils with special educational needs, including dyslexia. The guidance, Circular ED 4/96 <em>Children and Young Persons with Special Educational Needs - Assessment and Recording</em> and the <em>Manual of Good Practice in Special Educational Needs</em> , has been disseminated widely, including to all local authorities and schools. Both documents are available in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. numbers 4386 and 3984). In addition, a number of local authorities issue guidance specifically on dyslexia.</p>

  <p>Guidance has also been issued by the Executive in relation to students at further education colleges with disabilities or learning difficulties. Circular FE 13/95 is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 22033).</p>

  <p>Following devolution, the Scottish Executive undertook a review of existing housing legislation from the ECHR perspective.

The consultation paper asked for views on the definition of fuel poverty. Comments were required by 31 May and they will be considered carefully before a statement is published.

  <p>There are no statutory provisions allowing claims for compensation for contamination specifically by a genetically modified organism (GMO). Therefore, organic farmers would have the same remedies available to them under general law if a crop were contaminated by a genetically modified organism as they would if the crop were contaminated by any other substance which prevented the crop being sold as organic.</p>

  <p>If the presence of GM material arose through a breach in the terms of a consent to release GMOs, there are powers under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 for the consent holder to be prosecuted.</p>

  <p>Review of medicines available on the UK market is an on-going process. Medicines are granted a marketing authorisation (previously product license) if they meet the Medicines Control Agency&#146;s (MCA) standards of safety, quality and efficacy. Marketing authorisations are usually granted for periods of up to five years and have to be renewed at the end of that time. On renewal each marketing authorisation must reflect current knowledge about the product.</p>

  <p>Information about the work of the MCA can be found on their website:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.mca.gov.uk/">www.mca.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>Additionally, in Scotland, the Health Technology Board for Scotland will consider any proposal to assess the clinical and cost effectiveness of specific medicines that have been in use for many years.</p>

  <p>The Chief Executive of NHSScotland wrote to NHS trusts in November 2001 to inform them that, where PRHO posts are found to drift from compliance on an on-going basis, postgraduate Deans would be required to take action to ensure offending posts were permanently withdrawn from the process used to allocate medical students to their hospital placements.</p>

  <p>None. This case relates to a planning application for a private dwellinghouse which was granted permission in March 1999 and for which Fife Council subsequently submitted a Modification Order to have the vehicular access discontinued due to concerns about road safety. As the owner of the property objected to the order, the case was heard at a public local inquiry by a reporter of the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters Unit.</p>

  <p>The reporter concluded that there were no clear-cut and compelling road safety grounds for confirming the Modification Order and that the householder should have the right to maintain vehicular access onto Aberdour High Street. The Scottish ministers accepted the reporter&#146;s recommendation and therefore refused to confirm the Modification Order seeking the discontinuance of vehicular access. None of the parties involved chose to exercise their right of appeal to the Court of Session to have the decision quashed and therefore the matter is now closed.</p>

  <p>As with all social inclusion partnerships (SIPs), appraisal of the work and performance of Inverclyde SIP is carried out as per the SIP Monitoring Framework issued by the Scottish Executive in 1999.</p>

  <p>All SIPs are required as part of their terms and conditions of grant to submit an annual report to Communities Scotland by 30 June each year. In these reports SIPs provide the Executive with:</p>

  <p>information on their activities in the previous year</p>

  <p>a forward look to their plans for the future</p>

  <p>financial information in relation to how they have used their grant allocation</p>

  <p>monitoring information in relation to thirty-nine compulsory core indicators (where available locally) aimed at measuring the effectiveness of SIPs in their area of activity.</p>

  <p>On Inverclyde specifically, the last annual report was due on 30 June 2001 and was received by the Executive shortly after this deadline. This report was used to appraise Inverclyde SIP&#146;s performance in 2000-01. As with all SIPs, Inverclyde are due to submit their next annual report on 30 June 2002.</p>

  <p>As well as the annual report Communities Scotland officials do maintain contact with SIPs throughout the year, attend board meetings, visit SIP projects, and meet with both the SIP support team and community representatives associated with the SIP.</p>

  <p>There were three items in the archive section of the news website on 31 May 2002. The announcement on Scotsheep 2002 was one of them but was accidentally over-written by another item - &#163;2 million boost for pig industry - which was posted the same day. When this error was discovered at a later date the Scotsheep 2002 item was deleted. It has now been restored.</p>

  <p>The item on the Judicial Appointments Board was meant to be posted on 31 May but a transmission error meant it was never received for posting on the website. When this omission was noted the release was issued on June 12, a note explained it should have been made public on May 31. The news website then placed the item under the original date, May 31. The presence of the Judicial Appointments Board release in the archive has no bearing on what happened to the Scotsheep item.</p>

  <p>All teachers who have not trained in Scotland who wish to teach here must seek admission to the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS) register of persons entitled to teach in Scotland.</p>

  <p>I have asked Matthew MacIver, Chief Executive of the GTCS to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Those teachers who hold Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) with a teaching qualification from England recognised by the GTCS as fulfilling the council's requirements with regards to academic qualifications, professional training and relevant experience should have no difficulty in gaining registration to teach in Scotland. Those who hold QTS with a teaching qualification from England that the GTCS does not consider meets the standards required to teach in Scotland, such as some employment based routes, will be advised by the GTCS as to what course of action is required for registration to teach in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Education authorities must check that all teachers employed in publicly funded schools in Scotland are registered with the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS). Qualified Teacher Status does not give automatic acceptance to the GTCS register of those entitled to teach in Scotland. To gain entry to the register a teacher must satisfy the GTCS of their academic and professional fitness to teach.</p>

  <p>Data for 2001 is not yet available. Prior to 1996, the source of data on numbers of male and female FTE teachers is the periodic teacher census which ran in 1992 and 1994, hence there is no information on gender split available for years 1993 and 1995.</p>
