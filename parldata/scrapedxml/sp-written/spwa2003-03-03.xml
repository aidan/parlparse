  <p>The Grants Panel allocated &#163;922,000 for community environmental renewal grants to 38 projects. We believe that there is demand for the grant scheme and that there are good projects which can come forward. Were there to be any carry forward, then its use would be a matter for the incoming administration after the election.</p>

  <p>Part of the proceeds of the aggregates levy is available to support communities affected by aggregates extraction through community environmental renewal grants. Grants are available to projects which address the environmental effects of past or present aggregates extraction, involve the local community and have demonstrable social and/or economic benefit to the local community. It is open to any community affected by aggregates extraction to devise a project in accordance with the criteria.</p>

  <p>Grants were allocated according to merit by a Grants Panel, rather than on a geographical basis or in proportion to the amount raised by the levy in a particular area. The panel included representatives from COSLA, community councils, the aggregates industry, Scottish Natural Heritage and Scottish Environment Protection Agency.</p>

  <p>Any geographical or pro rata allocation of the proceeds of the levy would to some extent be arbitrary. For example, basing allocations on the current proceeds of the levy would disadvantage those areas that are affected by former extraction sites no longer in production. For that reason, we believe that a single national scheme to which all communities have equal access is the best approach.</p>

  <p>Further grants will be available in 2003-04. I will be looking to Forward Scotland, who will administer the 2003-04 scheme, to promote the scheme to communities which have not benefited from grants this year.</p>

  <p>I attended the one-day Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 20 February 2003, together with Lord Whitty and Mike German.</p>

  <p>There were no fisheries items on the agenda on this occasion.</p>

  <p>On agriculture, a 10-year extension of the feed additive avilamycin was agreed by qualified majority, the UK supporting the proposal.</p>

  <p>The Commission outlined its timetable and plans for GM seeds, co-existence between GM and non-GM agriculture and GM authorisations. On the last of these, the UK supported the Commission&#146;s preference for a case-by-case approach under existing GM legislation. On co-existence, the Commission plans to adopt a communication on 5 March 2003 to inform later debate.</p>

  <p>A Commission proposal for consolidating and updating the current EU rules on official food and animal feed controls was also presented. There was no substantive discussion and the Council remitted the dossier for technical discussion.</p>

  <p>The Commission reported on recent developments on agriculture in the World Trade Organization (WTO), in particular, on ministerial discussion in Tokyo which had focussed on the first draft of the "modalities" paper prepared by the Chairman of the WTO Agriculture Negotiating Group. Commissioner Fischler criticised the draft as unbalanced but stressed that the EU would continue to negotiate with trading partners on the basis of the EU proposal submitted in January 2003. The UK endorsed this line while noting that agreement on Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) Reform would be the key to development of the EU position.</p>

  <p>The Presidency gave a brief report of official level work on the CAP Reform proposals published in January. There was no discussion. A full Council discussion is planned for the March meeting.</p>

  <p>Under other business, the Italians signalled their intention to seek approval of a state aid to farmers in serious financial difficulty following the bankruptcy of certain agricultural co-operatives, and Greece reported that extreme weather conditions had caused widespread damage to its farming industry in recent days.</p>

  <p>NHS boards are able to use their normal financial allocations to advertise for and attract dentists to their region, including from overseas. As dentists working in the UK must be registered by the General Dental Council, it would not be appropriate to provide subsistence payments pending registration.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graham Donaldson, Chief Executive of HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>HMIE is working towards the generational cycle whereby a primary school will be inspected once every seven years and a secondary school will be inspected once every six years. We are aiming to complete the delivery of the first generational cycle by 2008 for secondary schools and 2009 for primary schools. To ensure delivery of this target, we are giving priority to schools which have yet to be inspected. For those primary schools which have been inspected twice, the average time between inspections has been 14 years. For those secondary schools which have been inspected at least twice, the average time between inspections has been nine and a half years.</p>

  <p>The Radioactive Substances Act 1993 (RSA 93) provides the legal basis for environmental monitoring and, in Scotland, this is the responsibility of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA). The Ministry of Defence (MoD) has Crown exemption from RSA 93, and so monitoring is a matter for, and is undertaken by, MoD and its contractors, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (DSTL). I understand that details of the environmental monitoring programme are available from DSTL.</p>

  <p>In response to these recent test firings, the Scottish Executive has asked SEPA to satisfy itself that an appropriate level of environmental monitoring is in place, and to continue its normal liaison with MoD on this matter. We have also written to the Secretary of State for Defence asking that SEPA be provided with all the relevant information it needs.</p>

  <p>The regulation and safety of medicines is reserved and is the responsibility of the Medicines Control Agency (MCA).</p>

  <p>The MCA/Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) Yellow Card Scheme collates reports of suspected adverse reactions to medicines. The Yellow Card Scheme provides for voluntary reporting of suspected adverse drug reactions by general practitioners, hospital doctors, dentists, coroners, pharmacists and nurses. The MCA receives approximately 18,000 reports of suspected adverse reactions to medicines each year via the scheme. As the scheme is voluntary, not all adverse reactions are reported. The MCA also collates reports of suspected adverse reactions to vitamins and minerals.</p>

  <p>It is important to remember that a report of a suspected reaction does not necessarily mean that the vitamin or mineral caused it.</p>

  <p>Vitamin and mineral products are often supplied without prescription, and are often taken without advice from doctors or pharmacists. It is generally recognised that the reporting rate for <strong>medicines</strong> supplied over the counter (OTC) is lower than that of suspected adverse reactions associated with prescription <strong>medicines</strong>. To encourage reporting of suspected adverse reactions with OTC <strong>medicines</strong>, the Yellow Card Scheme was recently extended to include nurses as reporters, and will be extended to include patient reporting via NHS Direct in the near future.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what consideration it has given to the judgement in the case considered in the Supreme Court of the United States of America, <em>Kumho Tire Co</em> v <em>Carmichael</em> (US 137 1999); whether it agrees that a court&#146;s &quot;gatekeeping&quot; function in respect of the reliability of expert evidence applies to all expert evidence, whether or not it is given by scientists, and, if so, what steps it is taking to ensure that such a function is exercised in the same way in Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what consideration it has given to the recent amendment to the Federal Rule of Evidence No 702 as adopted by the United States Congress which took effect on 1 December 2000 for courts in the United States of America and, in particular, the provision in this rule that states &quot;if scientific, technical, or other specialised knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise, if (1) the testimony is based upon sufficient facts or data, (2) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods, and (3) the witness has applied the principles and methods reliably to the facts of the case&quot;; whether it will assess the present rules of expert evidence in Scotland against these criteria; whether the Scottish rules fall short of this standard and, if so, in what ways, and whether it will bring forward proposals to improve rules of evidence based upon this standard.</p>

  <p>We have considered the recent developments in the law of expert evidence in the United States of America, including the judgements in the Daubert and Kumho Tire Co cases and the Federal Rule of Evidence No 702. The rules of evidence in Scotland in relation to skilled witnesses are comparable in many respects, but we do not consider that they have any implications for the use of expert evidence, including fingerprint evidence, in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We have, however, set out proposals for the greater use of expert evidence in some types of case. These are contained in <em>Vital Voices, Helping Vulnerable Witnesses Give Evidence: Policy Statement</em>, paragraph 2.31, published by the Scottish Executive on 27 February 2003. Copies are available from the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 26600).</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s recently published strategy <em>Life Through Learning; Learning Through Life</em> has a key goal of ensuring that everyone has the chance to learn, irrespective of their personal circumstances. Our policy on widening access to further education aims to break down barriers faced by all groups including carers. Our aim is to ensure that social prejudice plays no part in who gets to benefit from further education. We have delegated to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) the duty to secure adequate and efficient provision of further education in Scotland. We expect SFEFC to allocate budgets to individual colleges, and offer other support and guidance, in a way that takes account of that duty. Community Learning and Development Partnerships, including of course voluntary sector organisations, also play a crucial role in widening access into learning.</p>

  <p>Only certain patients with a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis are likely to benefit from beta interferon treatment and patients&#146; eligibility for this treatment depends on the clinical judgement of the specialist concerned. Health Department Letter (HDL) (2002) 6, which introduced the risk-sharing scheme for the supply of disease modifying treatments for multiple sclerosis on the NHS, explains the arrangements NHS boards are required to make to implement the scheme locally. This includes the arrangements necessary to enable eligible patients in their area to receive beta interferon treatment. The Executive expects the NHS boards to implement the scheme.</p>

  <p>Data collected under the risk-sharing scheme is maintained by the scheme co-ordinator Sheffield University&#146;s School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR). We have requested access to the data collected by ScHARR, on an anonymised basis, which will identify to us the rate of implementation in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Our discussion with ScHARR has not identified that there are any difficulties particular to Scotland. The Director of ScHARR has visited the Scottish specialist centres and he has indicated that progress in Scotland was satisfactory in all areas.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Performance points have not been applied in 13 such cases referred to the police because, so far as can be ascertained, there were no court proceedings and consequently no convictions. A trial is under way in one case and investigations are on-going in another 11 cases. It is not possible to say why there were no proceedings in the 13 cases, for the reasons given in the answer to question S1W-33537 on 11 February 2003.

  <p>We have already part-funded the work of the City of Edinburgh Council in developing its Integrated Transport Initiative and committed &#163;15 million for the development work on three tram-lines. We are now able to guarantee the availability of &#163;375 million of central Government funding which the preliminary business case for the Integrated Transport Initiative requires.</p>

  <p>Our commitment ensures that funding for at least the first tram-line will be available as soon as the council produces a robust final business case. That support is not conditional on the introduction of congestion charging, which the council is considering in order to reduce traffic levels in and around the city.</p>

  <p>I am not in a position to comment on the detail of charges to individual customers of Scottish Water. The Executive&#146;s policy on water charges is that the revenue raised under a charges scheme for a particular year should not exceed the revenue cap specified by the Water Industry Commissioner for that year in his Strategic Review of Charges; that by no later than 2005-06 charges within a scheme should be harmonised on a geographical basis across Scotland, and that tariffs within schemes should be broadly cost-reflective. A series of discounts and reliefs are available to customers in specific circumstances. These are not specific to care homes.</p>

  <p>I am unable to comment on the charges paid by an individual customer of Scottish Water. This is a matter for Scottish Water and the Water Industry Commissioner who are jointly responsible for agreeing the scheme of charges in any particular year.</p>
