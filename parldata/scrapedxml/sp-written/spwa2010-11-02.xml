  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to introducing a Scottish Statutory Instrument (SSI) by the end of this Parliament that will amend Part 7 of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 (the Act), making it easier for local authorities to issue antisocial behaviour notices to owners of party flats and bring a case to court with the improved prospect of a successful verdict. Development of this approach is being assisted by ongoing dialogue with City of Edinburgh Council officials.</p>

  <p>Once a draft SSI has been prepared, the proposed approach will be shared with Lothian and Borders Police, and City of Edinburgh Council. The SSI will be laid under the order making power within section 68(6) of the Act, which allows the provisions of the Act to be modified to suit the circumstances of holiday lets. This order making power is subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are only expected to apply this legislation in a small number of cases, and to date reaction from stakeholders has been positive. In view of the limited and technical nature of the proposals it is not intended to carry out a full public consultation. However, Community Safety Partnerships, the Scottish Tourism Forum, and Visitscotland will be advised of the proposed change to the legislation.</p>

  <p>The Home Office (2003) Code of Practice on Police Use of Firearms and Less Lethal Weapons is binding on police forces in England and Wales and is also applied by police forces in Scotland. The Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland (ACPOS) voluntarily complied with the code by publishing, in 2004, a statement of intent on police use of firearms and less lethal weapons. The police use of firearms in the operational context is governed by the manual of guidance on the management, command and deployment of armed officers. This document is produced by the National Policing Improvement Agency which is issued by the Home Office and endorsed by ACPOS.</p>

  <p>The Scottish House Condition Survey (SHCS) is the largest single housing research project in Scotland. The survey samples around 3,000 households each year and provides key statistics about the occupied housing stock in Scotland. The survey consists of two parts, a social survey and a physical survey. This allows us to look at the physical condition of Scotland&rsquo;s homes as well as the experiences of householders.</p>

  <p>In 2008 (the latest SHCS data available) 3,015 households were surveyed, 680 of these households were situated in rural areas. Fuel poverty estimates as well as whether the dwelling is on or off the gas grid is available from this survey.</p>

  <p>From April 2009, with the introduction of the Energy Assistance Package, we have for the first time included solid wall insulation and air source heat pumps in the measures available through the fuel poverty programme. We have raised the maximum grant for individual installations under the Energy Assistance Package to &pound;6,500; measures which are of particular benefit to people in rural areas.</p>

  <p>We have allocated &pound;25 million this financial year to ensure that area-based home insulation schemes providing free or discounted loft and cavity wall insulation are available in every local authority area in Scotland, including rural locations. The installation of the energy efficiency measures available are leading to reductions in fuel bills of around &pound;50 per annum for householders. In addition, one local authority will use its successful bid for Scottish Government funding under the universal home insulation scheme to connect over 500 village properties to the gas grid.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-36452 by Fiona Hyslop on 30 September 2010, whether it considers an in-house review of existing research and statistical evidence an adequate measure to assess and explore the factors affecting the decisions of both immigrants and emigrants.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-11-02.S3W-36815.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80330" speakername="Fiona Hyslop" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa1102.htm#4">

  <p>The Scottish Government considers the in-house review to be sufficient in the current financial climate. The review found that across existing studies, labour market opportunities emerged as the key driver of migration and settlement decisions for all migrant groups, with lifestyle factors and place attractiveness as important secondary factors. This consistency suggests that while data availability is limited, there is no immediate need to commission further work at this time. The Scottish Government will continue to monitor emerging evidence and may commission further work in future. The existing in-house review will be published early in 2011.</p>

  <p>Vaccination uptake over the past three years for people under the age of 65 in an at-risk group is shown in the following table.

  <p>This information is not held centrally as seasonal flu vaccination of NHS staff is the responsibility of individual employers. However a study carried out in 2002 suggested that the level of vaccination uptake amongst health workers was around 20% on average. This is likely to be significantly higher in some areas, such as paediatrics.</p>
