  <p>It should be noted that there has been a significant increase in the overall number of Senior House Officer positions available in NHS Scotland. Posts have increased from 2,021 positions in 2000, to 2,729 positions in 2004. This represents an increase of 24% over four years.</p>

  <p>International migration is on the increase and the market for healthcare professionals has become global. Individuals are at liberty to apply for a post for which they are suitably qualified from anywhere in the world. Appointments to medical training positions are made via an open recruitment process, for which those from overseas are eligible, and NHS employers do not give preferential treatment to any applicant on the basis of their country of origin.</p>

  <p>The consultation paper refers to a case raised by the European Commission, who do not consider the current definition to fully implement Article 6(1) of the EIA Directive. The UK Government received a letter of formal notice, which is the first stage of proceedings under Article 226 of the Treaty, from the European Commission in October 2003. In the letter the Commission refers, as an example, to a hypothetical development situated in England but close to the Scottish border in order to illustrate what they see as a potential weakness in the transposition of Directive 85/337/EEC with regard to the definition of &quot;consultation bodies&quot;. Consistent with the approach adopted by the ODPM on this issue, the Executive is proposing the changes outlined in the above consultation paper as a means of ensuring the definition is sufficiently transparent.</p>

  <p>A record of Scottish Ministerial attendance at EU Council of Ministers meetings since 1999 can be found on the Scottish Executive website at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/InternationalRelations/Europe/Page6" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/Government/InternationalRelations/Europe/Page6</a> .</p>

  <p>To date Scottish Ministers have attended Council of Ministers meetings on 68 occasions. Ministerial attendance at Councils is an important aspect of the Executive&rsquo;s European Strategy and, where appropriate, the participation of Scottish Ministers can play a significant role in promoting Scottish and UK interests. Scottish interests are of course represented at all Councils by the UK delegation. In addition where devolved issues are concerned the Executive works closely with the UK Government to ensure that Scottish circumstances and concerns are reflected in the UK&rsquo;s negotiating position.</p>

  <p>Such assistance has recently been made available. The Farm Business Development Scheme Variation (Scotland) Scheme 2005 (SSI 219/2005), which came into force on 1 June 2005, extended the scope of the scheme to allow the payment of grant aid for specific additional measures to support eligible farmers with the aim of assisting them to restructure or re-orientate their agricultural business. These changes offer farmers in other parts of Scotland the same opportunity to invest in their businesses as those within the Highlands and Islands Special Transitional Programme area.</p>

  <p>The funding of GP Registrar (GPR) training places changed on the establishment of NHS Education for Scotland in 2002 when the number of places was set at 250. In 2002-03 the number was increased to 280 and has been maintained at that level each year including 2005.</p>

  <p>The number of doctors who were in GPR training in each of the last 10 years is shown in the following table. It should be noted that there is some movement around the number of places to accommodate those doctors who require flexible arrangements for GP training, e.g. part-time. For that reason, actual numbers of GPRs can exceed the number of places aimed for. Early indications are that there will be around 316 GPRs in 2005.</p>

  <p>This is a matter within the operational responsibility of the board and therefore there is no need or requirement to consult the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>I understand from NHS Grampian that the changes are part of work to redistribute beds between specialties to match bed usage which, once complete, will deliver an improved service for patients. The transfer of resource between surgery and medicine addresses the current imbalance which results in some medical patients being cared for in surgical beds. The changes should reduce patient movements between wards during their stay, and specialties will be more appropriately co-located for effective and efficient working. The reduction in general surgery inpatient beds will be accompanied by the development of a new Short Stay Surgery Unit to support more day surgery.</p>

  <p>This is part of work by NHS Grampian to redistribute beds between specialties to match bed usage. The board is clear that these changes will have no adverse effect on waiting times, including those for cancer treatments, and that will enhance overall service provision. The redesignation of beds at ARI is part of ongoing service redesign which once complete will deliver an improved service for patients. The transfer of resource between surgery and medicine addresses the current imbalance which results in some medical patients being cared for in surgical beds.</p>

  <p>Yes, the changes will apply in the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The civil service Order in Council governing the appointment of special advisers has been amended to the effect that special advisers are appointed to provide &quot;assistance&quot; to Ministers. Previously the word used was &quot;advice&quot;. There is however no change to the fundamental principle that special advisers can only commission work from civil servants on behalf of their Minister.</p>

  <p>The change of wording has been reflected in a revision to the code of conduct for special advisers which forms part of the model contract for special advisers in the Scottish Executive. The change was recommended by the Public Administration Select Committee and accepted by the Government.
