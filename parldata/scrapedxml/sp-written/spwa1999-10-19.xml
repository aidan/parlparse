  <p>Bovine tissues that are known to, or might potentially, harbour detectable levels of BSE infectivity in infected animals are classified as Specified Risk Material (SRM). Under statutory controls, SRM must be disposed of by prescribed and controlled methods that include rendering or incineration. Any bovine animal clinically diagnosed as suffering from BSE is compulsorily slaughtered under official control. All suspect carcases are destroyed by incineration.</p>

  <p>Only two of the four mammalian renderers in Scotland are approved to process SRM. In both cases the plants dispose of rendering condensate as effluent via their waste water system. It is the responsibility of the operator to dispose of all by-products of the rendering process in accordance with statutory provisions. Enforcement rests with the appropriate local authority while the Executive&#8217;s veterinary staff monitor compliance on a regular basis. Waste water disposal is subject to conditions imposed by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA).</p>

  <p>We have no current plans to issue guidance on that section of the legislation. We are supporting authorities in tackling non-attendance in a number of ways through sharing good practice and promoting a positive ethos in schools. Attendance is one of the key priorities of the Scottish Schools Ethos Network, which is funded by the Scottish Executive to support schools by sharing examples of good practice. We also published &quot;Close to the Mark&quot; in December 1997 which highlights examples of schools which have been successful in tackling non-attendance.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive continues to fund Alzheimer&#8217;s Scotland Action on Dementia and the Dementia Services Development Centre as the best and most informed agencies to provide specific information, guidance and support for those suffering from Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease and of course their carers.</p>

  <p>More generally, the Health Education Board for Scotland, Health Boards, NHS Trusts and Scottish Local Authorities all share the support and responsibility of adding and improving awareness of local and national advice among all vulnerable groups and carers.</p>

  <p>Advantage is also taken of national days and weeks set aside for the promotion of awareness for individual care need groups.</p>

  <p>I will be announcing shortly details on how a Strategy aimed at supporting carers will be taken forward in Scotland.

  <p>The Scottish Executive has provided local authorities in Scotland this year with over &pound;1.1 billion for social work services. Further increases of &pound;43.4 million (4%) in 2000-01 and &pound;35.7 million (3.1%) in 2001-02 are planned. It is up to local authorities to allocate these resources to meet local needs and priorities, including the need for respite care for people with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to the agenda set out in <i>Modernising Community Care: An Action Plan</i> which requires local authorities to develop, as a priority, effective respite services, meeting users&#8217; and carers&#8217; needs. &pound;5 million, out of the &pound;1.1 billion, has been allocated to local authorities specifically on the basis of their response to the Action Plan. This figure will increase in future years and will continue to be allocated on the basis of individual authorities&#8217; progress on this modernising agenda.</p>

  <p>Respite is essential in helping informal carers of people with Alzheimer&#8217;s disease to take a break. I will be announcing shortly to Parliament details on a Carers&#8217; Strategy which will also address this issue.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are also able to use the Specific Grant for Social Work Training to provide training for staff working with people with a sensory impairment</p>

  <p>The employment of British Sign Language Interpreters is the responsibility of all employers who wish to ensure wide access to their services.</p>

  <p>I understand that, following a review, the Greater Easterhouse Social Inclusion Partnership Board has agreed that a new organisation should be established to support community and voluntary sector involvement in Greater Easterhouse, and that accordingly funding support for the Greater Easterhouse Council of Voluntary Organisations should not be continued beyond February 2000. The decision not to continue funding was a matter for local decision by the Board, and the Executive has no plans to intervene.</p>
