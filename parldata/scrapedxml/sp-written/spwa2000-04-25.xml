  <p>Waiting lists for maxillofacial surgery at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary remain open. The Infirmary is continuing to receive routine referrals and I have been assured that patients who require urgent treatment are being seen and treated quickly.</p>

  <p>However, the Department of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery at the Infirmary is experiencing a significant increase in referrals and at present has vacancies in two key consultant posts. As a result, fewer patients than normal are being seen and treated and waiting times are consequently longer than the Department would wish. Grampian University Hospitals NHS Trust is working closely with Grampian Health Board to make good the staff shortages as quickly as possible. Meantime, the Trust is making arrangements for locum cover for a specific range of procedures.</p>

  <p>NHS care is not rationed on the grounds of cost. The services provided to meet the needs of particular patients is a question of individual clinical judgement, taking account of the evidence of clinical and cost effectiveness of alternative treatments. Health boards and NHS Trusts have to plan and deliver services which meet the needs of their local population within the resources allocated to them, taking account of national and local priorities. The Scottish Executive is committed to year-on-year increases in NHS spending in real terms.</p>

  <p>In spite of unprecedented levels of activity in many parts of Scotland, the NHS acquitted itself extremely well in the light of recent winter pressures through a combination of sound planning and the sheer commitment and hard work of its staff.</p>

  <p>However, there is no room for complacency. As part of its aim of continual improvement of services for patients, the NHS in Scotland will, with its planning partners, be reviewing winter planning arrangements. As part of these arrangements, I have already intimated that I am commissioning a group representing a wide range of interests to consider how those arrangements can be improved in future.</p>

  <p>I expect to be in a position to commission that group shortly so that its recommendations can inform planning for next winter.</p>

  <p>Ministers are precluded from directing SHEFC in its allocation of funding to institutions for specific courses.</p>

  <p>However, in my recent letter of guidance to SHEFC, I encouraged the council to develop a clear strategic framework within which it can help the development and delivery of a knowledge economy. Specifically, I encouraged the council to develop IT in teaching and learning.</p>

  <p>In the years 1999-2000 and 2000-01, no funding is available from the Scottish Executive to train (a) lip-readers and (b) teachers of lip-reading.</p>

  <p>We do not know what funding is available for this purpose from local authorities, as this information is not collected.</p>

  <p>Currently no publicity is funded by the Scottish Executive to promote awareness of lip reading. However, the Social Work Services inspectorate published in 1998 an Inspection Report <i>Sensing Progress</i> , on social work services to people who are sensorily impaired. This report drew attention to lip-reading and the benefits it gave for deaf and hard of hearing people. This report has been widely circulated. In addition the Scottish Executive provides funding for a range of voluntary organisations which provide services for deaf people.</p>

  <p>Mental illness is equated with the specialities of General Psychiatry, Adolescent Psychiatry, Child Psychiatry and Geriatric Psychiatry.</p>

  <p>The information available from health boards regarding expenditure on mental illness treatment is provided on the basis of patient category i.e. inpatient, outpatient, day-patient and community. It is therefore not possible to identify the<strong> </strong>expenditure on patients treated in psychiatric hospitals alone.</p>

  <p>The information provided in the following table groups the expenditure for inpatients, outpatients and day-patients to provide a total hospital figure.</p>

  <p>The health board expenditure reflects the costs of services purchased, and may not equate exactly with the cost of treatment for mental illness.</p>

  <p>The table provides per capita expenditure, per health board, for hospital and community provision of mental illness treatment for the period 1996-97 up to and including 1998-99.</p>

  <p>The cost of printing the consultation document on the draft National Parks (Scotland) Bill was &pound;22,000. There were also unquantified Scottish Executive staff costs included in the preparation and distribution of the document. Over 2,500 copies of the document have been distributed. Cost of paper was not a factor in determining the number of copies printed. The Bill was also published on the Intranet.</p>

  <p>Pay settlements are determined in light of the particular circumstances of each individual group of staff. The terms of reference for Pay Review Bodies require them to take account of the need to recruit, retain and motivate staff; the funds available to organisations as set out in Departmental Expenditure Limits; targets for the delivery of services, and the UK Government&#8217;s inflation target of 2.5%. These same factors provide the basis for the Scottish Executive&#8217;s approach to the pay of all other public sector groups for which Ministers are responsible.</p>

  <p>The rail network is in the private sector. Investment in the network is funded in various ways, including direct funding from the public sector and charges paid by train operators who are themselves supported by the public sector. The table below shows the amount of public sector funding going into, or contributing towards, the rail network in Scotland and which comes from sources outside the Assigned Budget.</p>

  <p>At the time of letting the franchises it was not the Government&#8217;s intention to direct cost savings to investment in the rail network but rather to secure the provision of the existing level of service provision (i.e. the Public Service Requirement), plus agreed enhancements, at a reduced level of public sector support.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions and the Shadow Strategic Rail Authority concerning publicly funded investment in the rail network.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to conduct a feasibility study. Railtrack is committed to a programme of structural works which will increase line speeds between Inverness and Perth. In conjunction with the introduction of faster trains by ScotRail, these improvements will provide an initial journey time reduction of five minutes between Inverness and Edinburgh by 2004. In addition, GNER and Virgin Trains have made bids to replace the current inter-city franchise serving Inverness. Each has proposed introducing faster diesel trains on routes north of Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>To date there have been six awards for RPP in total of which, in Scotland, one award of &pound;800,000 has been made for Edinburgh Crossrail. Two further Scottish schemes have pre-qualified for investment under the scheme.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise has carried out research into the business opportunities offered by renewable energy, and has presented the results to Scottish companies using a series of roadshows. These events have attracted interest from a variety of companies and, as a direct result, several of these companies are already pursuing opportunities for new business.</p>

  <p>Road traffic law, including vehicle safety standards, is a reserved matter under the Scotland Act. In particular, the UK Parliament is responsible for changes to the legislation governing the use of the signs required to be displayed by school buses when transporting children to and from school.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-3820 by Sarah Boyack on 16 February 2000, whether, if the pilot projects using relatively inexpensive engineering measures show such measures to be ineffective, it will consider funding more expensive measures designed to reduce road deaths.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive provides local authorities with a block allocation for expenditure on a number of services. It is for each council to consider the priority to be given to the installation of traffic-calmed 20mph zones, in terms of all the services for which it is responsible, and to allocate resources accordingly. These arrangements give local authorities flexibility to determine what measures are required to meet local needs and circumstances.</p>

  <p>As I made clear when announcing the conclusions of the Strategic Roads Review, further consideration of the M74 scheme is for the relevant local authorities. This consideration should be set in the context of the authorities&#8217; Local Transport Strategies and should involve a review of alternative transport solutions in the area.</p>
