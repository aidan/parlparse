  <p>Any farmer or land manager with land in Scotland may choose to apply under Land Managers Options (LMOs) provided they also submit a single application form (SAF). Together with any existing ongoing five year commitments under land management contracts menu scheme (LMCMS), the total must not exceed a total allowance calculated in accordance with the amount of land they have. Of the 51,000 farm holdings in Scotland, around 21,000 claim CAP funds through the single application and IACS. Of those, around half choose to apply for LMCMS and LMOs. Currently, around one third of the total LMCMS and LMO applicants have applied for LMOs. This figure is likely to rise as existing five year LMCMS commitments end.</p>

Fire and rescue authorities who are the enforcing authorities are currently in the process of implementing this new regime across Scotland.

  <p>Legislation on the English side of the Solway Firth is a matter for the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.</p>

  <p>Landings of tope by Scottish vessels are at a very low level, totalling 12 tonnes since 2000. Therefore the Scottish Government sees little practical advantage at this point in introducing legislation to ban the landing of tope.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Scottish Government&rsquo;s view is that it is better to place the issue of tope fishing within the wider context of fishing on all elasmobranches (sharks, skates and rays) rather than consider the issue on a species-by-species basis.</p>

  <p>We will keep this situation under review.</p>

  <p>Our proposals, which were widely welcomed, give effect to the devolution of fisheries management in the Scotland Act 1998.

  <p>Where we have been asked to consider fish quota transfers outwith Scotland in exceptional circumstances, and where, on the basis of information supplied, we have concluded that there are indeed exceptional circumstances, we have allowed such transfers to take place.</p>

  <p>The moratorium was put in place to preserve Scottish fishing rights whilst work continues to deliver distinct quota management and licensing arrangements in Scotland. The moratorium has been kept under continual review during the on-going process of consultation to ensure that its continued existence in its current form is objectively justified.</p>

  <p>To this end, I announced recently that the transfer of 10 metre and under licences/entitlements would be exempted from the moratorium provisions as well as the transfer of over 10 metre licences/entitlements where no FQA units are attached.</p>

  <p>The introduction of an SSI is a significant step and one that could only be taken where we believe that a failure to act would represent a real and present danger to the tope stock.</p>

  <p>Moreover, the Scottish Government&rsquo;s view is that it is better to place the issue of tope fishing within the wider context of fishing on all elasmobranches (sharks, skates and rays) rather than consider the issue on a species-by-species basis.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what progress is being made towards the target of planting around 9,000 to 10,000 hectares of new forests and woodlands annually.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-09-19.S3W-16112.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80381" speakername="Michael Russell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0919.htm#7">

  <p>Earlier this year, Forestry Commission Scotland (FCS) indicated in its Scottish Forestry Strategy Implementation Plan that a sustained programme of around 10,000 hectares of new planting would be required each year to achieve the strategy aspiration of 25% woodland cover by the second half of the century. FCS estimated that the private sector would plant 80% of the annual programme, while the remainder would be planted on the national forest estate. It is therefore too early to assess progress against this programme, particularly as the incentives to help delivery, the forestry measures within the SRDP, have just been put in place after the closure of the Scottish Forestry Grant Scheme last year. Progress will, however, be monitored closely over the coming years, and the figures will be published. Planting on the national forest estate will be mainly carried out on land acquired by FCS through its repositioning programme &ndash; the acquisition of land with potential for high public benefit, funded by the disposal of land with lower public benefit &ndash; which was also introduced earlier this year.</p>

  <p>In the meantime, FCS has published a discussion paper which sets out the benefits that woodland expansion can deliver and how this fits with the Government&rsquo;s objectives across various portfolios. It explores a number of critical wider land use issues that affect how the aspirational target can be achieved, and discusses how the delivery mechanisms can be used. The closing date for comments on the paper is 30 September 2008.</p>

  <p>The discussion paper can viewed on the FCS website at <a href="http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-7FWEQ5" target="_blank">http://www.forestry.gov.uk/forestry/INFD-7FWEQ5</a>.</p>

  <p>I have already met twice with the families of those affected by the Clostridium difficile outbreak at the Vale of Leven Hospital on 7 and 12 August 2008. I am aware of their views concerning a public inquiry, and am willing to meet with the families again, following the conclusion of the investigation of the Area Procurator Fiscal for Argyll and Clyde, should they wish to do so.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why Health Protection Scotland&rsquo;s Report on Review of Clostridium difficile Associated Disease Cases and Mortality in all acute hospitals in Scotland from December 2007-May 2008 has recommended an age of 15 for the minimum limit for the extension of the national surveillance programme for Clostridium difficile-associated disease.</p>

  <p>I am advised by Health Protection Scotland (HPS) that existing testing methods for Clostridium difficile are not recommended for children under the age of 15. Younger children are carriers of Clostridium difficile without any symptoms and the disease does not appear to occur in childhood. Given the lack of appropriate tests and the probability that this group of individuals is at very low risk it does not seem appropriate to recommend testing which is unproven and could lead to unnecessary treatment. HPS will, however, keep the situation under review.</p>

  <p>The Lord Advocate has asked the Area Procurator Fiscal for Argyll and Clyde to make urgent enquiries into the circumstances of the deaths at the Vale of Leven and report its findings to Crown Counsel. It will then be a matter for Crown Counsel to consider what further action is required in light of the circumstances which have emerged.</p>

  <p>The Procurator Fiscal will be required to consider the terms of the expert reports carefully, as well as carrying out his own independent investigations in consultation with Crown counsel. Given the number of deaths involved, it is not possible to put a timescale on the inquiries, however, in light of the concerns which these matters have given rise to, the investigations will be completed as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>I have asked Karen Watt, Chief Executive of the Scottish Housing Regulator, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>According to information supplied by registered social landlords (RSLs) in 2006-07 a total of 125,895 RSL dwellings met the Scottish Housing Quality Standard (SHQS) at that time.</p>

  <p>From the 18 local authority Standard Delivery Plans (SDPs) submitted in 2004-05, we know that around 130,000 local authority dwellings met the SHQS at that time. We can also confirm that according to the information submitted to us by local authorities 20,533 local authority dwellings were brought up to the SHQS in 2006-07, slightly above their originally projected target of around 19,700 dwellings.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government colleagues are working with a number of local authorities who have still to submit a finalised SDP. When these are assessed we will have a fuller picture of the number of dwellings which already meet the SHQS.</p>
