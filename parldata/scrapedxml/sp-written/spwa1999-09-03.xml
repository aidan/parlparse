  <p>It is for Greater Glasgow Health Board to assess and provide the health care services to meet the needs of their local population. To date no firm decisions have been made in relation to the future configuration of acute health care services in Glasgow. However, when considering the possible reconfiguration of acute services, the Board will ensure that access to local services is balanced against the need to provide acute services at the highest level. The Health Board will, of course, consult in due course on any proposals for change.</p>

  <p>The current target is that no junior doctor on an on-call rota should be contracted to work for more than an average of 72 hours per week. On 31 March 1999, 98.1% of junior doctors working in Scotland met this target. The number contracted to work in excess of 72 hours is now 76 (out of 4053) and continues to fall.</p>

  <p>We have announced joint plans with the BMA to accelerate compliance with working hours targets and other improvements to junior doctors&rsquo; working conditions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is firmly committed to the Breast Screening Programme. At present, women aged 50-64 are invited every 3 years and women aged over 64 can attend on request, either through their General Practitioner or by calling their local breast screening centre.</p>

  <p>Scotland is participating in UK-wide demonstration projects to assess the implications of extending the upper age limit of invitation. The Scottish project has been undertaken in the West of Scotland and is due to report by the end of the year. The other UK sites will issue an interim report in January 2000. I await the findings of the projects.</p>

  <p>Under the EC Novel Foods Regulation (258/97) rigorous safety assessments are required before any novel food, including genetically modified (GM) food can be placed on the market. In the UK such safety assessments are carried out by an expert scientific committee &ndash; the Advisory Committee on Novel Foods and Processes (ACNFP) &ndash; which reports to Scottish as well as to UK Ministers.</p>

  <p>The safety assessments follow the approach set out by EC Guidelines. Wherever possible the GM food is compared to its conventional counterpart to identify similarities and differences. Differences are examined in detail to establish if the GM food is as safe as its conventional counterpart. A wide range of information is used in the comparison from agronomic data through to compositional data on nutrients and toxicants.</p>

  <p>The ACNFP is looking at the feasibility of setting up a pilot scheme to monitor novel foods after they have reached the market. This monitoring would be in addition to the existing statutory monitoring and enforcement provisions of Section 5 of the Food Safety Act 1990.</p>

  <p>Police grant-aided expenditure for 1999-2000 was set at a level which assumed full use of Government funds available for expenditure on police services. However, while forces must plan to meet their expenditure from within the resources available to them, the funding position is kept under review and, if additional resources are identified, any police needs would be taken into account in distributing those.</p>

  <p>The operation of the Glasgow Underground is a matter for the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Executive. It is for the Executive and Glasgow City Council to consider appropriate contingency arrangements to accommodate service alterations or cancellations on the Underground.</p>

  <p>The Government&rsquo;s Preliminary Guidance on Local Transport Strategies encouraged local authorities to set out their plans for park and ride in their interim strategies which were due to be submitted in July 1999. The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Public Transport Fund encourages local authorities to develop projects promoting the use of public transport such as the establishment of park and ride sites and associated bus priority measures. In the first round of the Fund, 3 projects involving new park and ride sites were successful in securing additional capital allocations. Applications to the second round of the Fund are currently being considered.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Transport White Paper gave a commitment to ensure that our transport policies fit with our priorities in combating social exclusion. A number of public transport operators already offer discounted travel for participants in the New Deal programme. We shall explore with operators whether these principles can be applied more widely to other low income and unemployed people. We shall legislate to encourage the introduction of simpler fare structures and better through ticketing arrangements, so as to improve the overall effectiveness of bus services. The Government will also be seeking to ensure there are affordable air and sea links to Scotland&rsquo;s islands communities.</p>

  <p>At present, under legislation concerning concessionary fares schemes, each Scottish local authority can decide the discount offered to the different eligible groups set out in statute. We will, however, encourage the improvement and integration of concessionary fares schemes for pensioners and those with special needs.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will bring forward to the Scottish Parliament, later this session, a Transport Bill proposing changes to the way bus services are organised. We wish to provide local authorities with powers and duties to ensure that proper timetable information is available in their areas for the benefit of bus passengers.</p>

  <p>In addition we are committed to working with transport operators, local authorities and user groups to develop a practical and effective Scottish National Public Transport Timetable. We envisage that this will include all internal Scottish bus, coach, rail, air and ferry services and will help promote the better integration of public transport services.</p>
