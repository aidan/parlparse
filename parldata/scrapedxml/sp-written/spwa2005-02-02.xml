  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-13299 by Rhona Brankin on 19 January 2005, how alcohol detoxification and rehabilitation programmes are audited to determine funding allocations at both local and national levels on the basis of outcomes.</p>

  <p>Local alcohol action teams provide details of services within their respective areas within a Corporate Action Plan submitted annually to the Executive. There is currently no national system in place to audit alcohol services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>National funding for alcohol services in 2004-05 was 70%, based on the Arbuthnott formula, and 30% distributed equally between the 15 boards. Local funding decisions are the responsibility of Alcohol and Drug Action Teams and their partners within NHS boards.</p>

  <p>An announcement on future funding and the proposed methodology for allocation will be made shortly.</p>

  <p>Information is not collected on the number of blind women aged over 70. The table shows the proportion of registered blind women who are over the age of 65 for each local authority.</p>

  <p>No information is held centrally on what percentage of these women receive contact from social work services at least once a week.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to reduce from 100 years the exemption in the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 applying to access to individuals&rsquo; census records.

  <p>The Care Commission is required under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 to inspect each care service at least once a year or at least twice a year where the service includes the provision of overnight accommodation.</p>

  <p>Within that legislative framework the Care Commission has developed an approach to regulation that takes account of risk. This includes:</p>

  <p>The development of a pre-inspection return which incorporates a self-evaluation for providers.</p>

  <p>A phasing of consideration of a set of National Care Standards (for example the care standards for care homes for older people) over three to five years, rather than assessing compliance with all aspects of the standards every year.</p>

  <p>A risk-based approach based on pre-inspection returns, previous inspections and other criteria. Based on that, providers will receive either a standard inspection, which will include assessment against all of the legal requirements and against the core standards identified for any inspection year; or a concise inspection, which will focus on the legal requirements of the act and associated regulations.</p>

  <p>In relation to day-care services for children, the joint inspection arrangements with HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) have been further refined so that only one officer (either Care Commission or HMIE) inspects small services (i.e. services providing 10 or fewer places to children at any one time).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not allocated funds to non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to support their work following the tsunami but has taken other actions to respond swiftly and appropriately.</p>

  <p>We met NGOs in the days after the disaster to ask how we could assist their efforts to support the emergency relief work. At their request, we immediately seconded 11 Scottish Executive staff to meet an urgent need for administrative assistance at the British Red Cross, SCIAF and Mercy Corp. We also co-ordinated advertisements for the Scottish Emergency Appeal, which appeared in a range of Scottish papers. The Deputy Chief Medical Officer&rsquo;s team has co-ordinated Scottish offers of specialist medical help to the World Health Organisation, including the option to second Scottish Executive specialist medical personnel. Ten Scottish police officers have been deployed in support of the Metropolitan Police casualty bureau.</p>

  <p>The First Minister indicated to the Parliament on 12 January that the Scottish Executive is committed to assisting the longer term reconstruction effort, as the assessment of need in the affected region becomes clearer. The Scottish Executive has maintained a dialogue with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for International Development and public services in Scotland to facilitate assistance from public services to the areas affected by the tsunami. We are in discussion with Scottish based international aid agencies and public service organisations about how this can be taken forward.</p>

  <p>Ritalin (methylphenidate hydrochloride) is authorised for use in children aged six years and over for the treatment of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).</p>

  <p>In the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) is responsible for the assessment of all requests for authorisation to market drugs. Before a new marketing authorisation, or a variation to an existing authorisation can be granted, data from pre-clinical and clinical trials must be submitted to the MHRA by the applicant.</p>

  <p>The agency has advised that Ritalin was assessed for quality, safety and efficacy at the time of authorisation. The product information for Ritalin contains comprehensive information on the recognised side-effects of treatment.</p>

  <p>As with all medicines, the safety of Ritalin is continually monitored by the MHRA and the expert independent advisory body the Committee on Safety of Medicines.</p>

  <p>More information about the MHRA and the medicines licensing process can be found on: <a href="http://www.mhra.gov.uk">www.mhra.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO), within the Scottish Executive Health Department, has responsibility for funding and supporting research into health and healthcare needs in Scotland. The CSO is currently funding research into treatment with methylphenidate in boys with ADHD. The research will investigate whether chronic treatment with methylphenidate leads to tolerance or sensitisation, two processes associated with the development of substance misuse problems.</p>

  <p>The National Research Register (NRR), a UK-wide research database, records that there are 11 on-going research projects in the UK on ADHD. Details of these projects are available from the NRR, a copy of which is in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 17404).</p>

  <p>The Price Waterhouse Coopers report identified wide variations across the country on unit costs and service provision. It confirmed the view emerging from reviews in England that significant efficiency savings were possible, particularly as unit costs are higher in Scotland. The wide variations in per capita funding across Scotland emerging in the report also reinforced the need to move towards a fairer distribution of resources across Scotland. Funding is now redistributed on a more objective basis using a new formula.</p>

  <p>Barrier-free housing and surrounding environment is a key element of the Executive&rsquo;s social inclusion agenda.

  <p>Funding to increase barrier-free housing is available from the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Housing Investment Programme, which is administered by Communities Scotland. In 2004-05, this programme amounts to &pound;284 million.</p>

  <p>The distributions of both out-patients and in-patients/day cases and outpatients are very skewed making the median the more appropriate measure. The mean is highly sensitive to the small number of unusually high values in the long tail of the distribution. A significant number of those waiting for a long time will have been delayed due to failing to attend, cancelling an offer of an appointment or having medical/social constraints that prevent admission for treatment.</p>

  <p>Neither the mean nor the median are targets for NHSScotland and they are only summary measures for patients awaiting in-patient/day case hospital care where reducing maximum waiting times is the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s priority. They take no account of the annual 465,000 emergency admissions, where patients are admitted immediately and they take no account of the annual 26.5 million face-to-face contacts with the primary care team.</p>

  <p>The percentage increase in rates paid by a hypothetical tenant occupying a property whose rateable value has risen by the &quot;Scottish average&quot; at the 2005 Revaluation will be 7.0%. This takes no account of the impact of the small business rate relief scheme which will vary according to the rateable value of the subject occupied.</p>

  <p>The Financial Inclusion Action Plan refers to the Executive&rsquo;s six closing the opportunity gap (CTOG) objectives, announced on 12 July 2004. One of these is: to increase the chances of sustained employment for vulnerable and disadvantaged groups.</p>

  <p>The CTOG objectives are underpinned by targets identifying key aspects of poverty and deprivation on which progress is required. Details are available on the Executive&rsquo;s CTOG website: <br /> <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/topics/people/social-inclusion/17415/opportunity">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/topics/people/social-inclusion/17415/opportunity</a>.</p>

  <p>Specific CTOG targets refer to workless people dependent on Department of Work and Pension benefits in key areas, 16 to 19-year-olds not in education, training or employment, employees of public sector and large employers on low wages, young people leaving care and residents of the most deprived neighbourhoods. The definition of &quot;vulnerable and disadvantaged groups&quot; is a wide one, however, and includes people with a wider range of characteristics such as disability or caring responsibilities. Some people have multiple such disadvantages. It is not possible, therefore, to give overall numbers, nor to break these down by year or local authority area.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Prison Service (SPS) is not responsible for the roads and lighting at Upperton village.</p>

  <p>When the former Longriggend Remand Unit was sold in October 2003 the purchaser assumed shared responsibility, together with the individual owners of the residential properties, for the repair and maintenance of the roads and lighting system.</p>

  <p>Although the SPS had no statutory or other obligation to do so, it had carried out routine repairs and maintenance to the street lighting system within the village on a goodwill basis. On being advised, shortly before selling the land, that a number of the lights were not working, SPS agreed to repair them as its final contribution prior to the transfer of obligations to the new owner. This work was completed as promised.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The SPS needs to become more competitive, to use taxpayers money to achieve better value for money and to make a contribution to building a fit for purpose prison estate. This will also improve long-term job security of SPS staff. The SPS has therefore initiated a 5% efficiency target across the service for 2004-05 and 2005-06.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>*The Autogas+ programme provides a grant of &pound;800 towards the conversion of petrol vehicles (cars and light vans) under six years to Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG).</p>

  <p>Financial information is gathered by fiscal year rather than calendar year.</p>

  <p>There is no Scottish Executive scheme called &quot;Autogas&quot;.</p>
