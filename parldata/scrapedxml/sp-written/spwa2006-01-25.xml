  <p>The buy-out of the Inverness Airport PFI is expected to be achieved through the purchase of Inverness Air Terminals Limited (the PFI concession company) by Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (HIAL). As a consequence, the PFI contract will come under the control of HIAL. Completion of the purchase will take place immediately after agreement between HIAL and the PFI owner is executed.

  <p>Our legal advisers have successfully secured an abandonment of the debate which was due to take place on 27 to 30 September 2005 and secured an award of expenses in our favour. They are currently pressing the court and other parties to confirm a final hearing on the issue of liability and quantum of damages, which will be determined by the court if the parties are unable to reach agreement. However, our legal advisers have made it clear to the other parties involved that we are open to any method of dispute resolution within or outwith the litigation process. Thus far, the other parties have declined to provide any proposals and while the matter remains unresolved, liability for interest on the outstanding sums continues to accrue.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has the operational responsibility for this area, and can be contacted for more information if required.</p>

No estimates have been made of the cost of extending the scheme to full-time mature students or all mature students. Such estimates would require detailed analysis of bus, rail and ferry usage by mature students, and discussions with key stakeholders in local transport authorities and the bus, rail and ferry industries.</p>

  <p>Information on the targeting of other Executive education and training programmes is not held centrally. Funding for programmes such as Skillseekers and Modern Apprenticeship programmes is demand led, and therefore not targeted at specific groups. Funding for Community Learning and Development (CLD), including Adult Literacy and Numeracy is allocated through local CLD Partnerships who make funding decisions based on local need.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive allocated an additional &pound;5.4 million (&pound;1.4-&pound;2 million to &pound;2 million) to the Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) between 2001-04 to fund asylum seekers. This allowed the waiving of the three year residency rule for these students so that they would be eligible for funding, fee waiver and hardship funds to attend college. &pound;2 million was added to the SFEFC baseline in 2004-05 as part of Spending Review 2004.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise Borders has provided a financial contribution of &pound;419,000 over a four year period from 2001-05 to the Borders based Cashmere Club. This is in addition to &pound;130,000 from Scottish Borders Council and up to &pound;632,000 from the EU. This funding was used for brand promotion and enhancing the brand image.

The CBI has also issued a Diversity statement, which offers information and advice to employers on how best to embed diversity in their organisations. The CBI&rsquo;s Equality Forum meets three times a year to discuss legislative developments and exchange best practice on gender equality and other diversity issues.</p>

However, the proposals were not considered any further by the Executive as they were overtaken by the Executive&rsquo;s proposals for the Gourock to Dunoon service as announced on 8 December 2004.

I agreed to meet the company as part of a series of meetings in which I engaged with stakeholders across the transport industry. Given that the meeting was initiated by Western Ferries, the Executive did not set any specific objectives for the meeting. However, as a consequence of the meeting, I gained more of an understanding of the company&rsquo;s views.</p>

  <p>The process of Assess, Compare, Evaluation and Verify (ACE-V) is the description of the scientific approach to fingerprint analysis adopted by fingerprint professionals and criminal justice agencies world-wide. It is a qualitative approach rather than an arbitrary quantitative approach whereby the likelihood of error is minimised because the quality of the mark is the basis from which the identification is made.</p>

  <p>Information on how many meetings officials and ministers have had with the STUC since 1999 is not held centrally and could only be obtained at disproportionate cost.</p>

  <p>There have been a very significant number of meetings since 1999. The Scottish Executive recognises the important role that trade unions play in promoting economic development and representing workers interests in Scotland and we work closely with the STUC on matters of mutual interest. In April 2002, the Executive signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the STUC and this underpins the Executive&rsquo;s commitment to working with the STUC across a wide range of policy issues.</p>

  <p>Under the terms of the memorandum, ministers meet formally with the STUC twice a year to exchange information about policy issues. Ministers also meet with the STUC, as necessary, to discuss specific issues around their portfolios. In addition, the Executive&rsquo;s Permanent Secretary and Management Group meet the STUC on an annual basis, and other officials engage regularly with STUC to discuss specific policies.</p>

  <p>Earlier versions of the SPT programme for delivery envisaged a submission/introduction for the Private Bill in spring/summer 2005. In consultation with the Scottish Executive, it was agreed that they, and TIE Ltd the promoters of the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link, should utilise the Parliament&rsquo;s summer recess (2005) to:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>consult further with the Private Bills Unit (PBU);<br />
              await the report from the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill Committee, and thereby<br />
              ensure that they had learned from the experiences of previously submitted transportation legislation in drafting the GARL Bill and accompanying documentation, thereby making the most efficient use of the Parliament&rsquo;s time and resources.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>Subsequently the Parliament&rsquo;s Procedures Committee was minded to consider changes to the Private Bills process which would allow the appointment of an Inquiry Reporter to hear the detailed objections at the Consideration stage. It was therefore agreed that the Private Bills for the airport rail links should not be submitted until the committee was in a position to finalise its consideration and recommendation to Parliament.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland has incurred no additional cost as a result of this, as the projected end date for the GARL project remains unchanged.</p>

  <p>SPT have advised that they have approved an additional &pound;350,000, or 10% of the previously advised costs for the development of the GARL project and subsequent support through the Parliamentary process. The additional costs are as a result of (i) the additional work undertaken by SPT and their consultants over the summer recess in consulting with the PBU, and subsequent revision to the Bill and accompanying documentation, and (ii) to comply with the Presiding Officers determination with regard to consulting with Scottish National Heritage, Scottish Environment Protection Agency and Historic Scotland in respect of the projects Environmental Statement.</p>

  <p>At present we believe that no sections of the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route will be single carriageway, but that a wide single carriageway with overtaking sections would be sufficient for the traffic predicted to use the 13km Stonehaven to Milltimber spur.

  <p>All buses, whether used for school transport or general service, must meet certain regulatory requirements that set out the minimum standards that operators must comply with to ensure that their vehicles are operated safely. This includes requirements with regard to the fitting of safety belts. The enforcement of these statutory requirements is a matter for the police and the Vehicle Inspectorate.</p>

  <p>School transport is normally provided under contracts let by local authorities. It is open to local authorities to stipulate, in negotiating these contracts, that only vehicles equipped with safety belts will be accepted. If buses without seat belts were provided in breach of such a stipulation it would be for the local authority concerned to decide what action was appropriate.</p>

  <p>Legislation relating to the fitting of seat belts in vehicles is the responsibility of the UK Government.</p>

  <p>All coaches and mini-buses carrying groups of children aged three to 15 years on organised trips (including dedicated home-to-school transport) are required to be fitted with lap belts as a minimum. However, this requirement does not apply to other buses, including public service buses engaged on organised school trips.</p>

  <p>Since 1 October 2001, seat belts have been required in the forward and rearward facing seats of all new minibuses, coaches and buses (other than those specifically designed for urban use with standing passengers). The requirements are:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>minibuses and buses with a gross weight of 3,500kg or less &ndash; three-point belt in forward facing seats and three-point belt or retractable lap belts in rearward facing seats;<br />
              minibuses and buses with a gross weight of more than 3,500kg &ndash; three-point belts or retractable lap belts in forward and rearward facing seats, and<br />
              coaches &ndash; three-point belt or retractable lap belt in all forward and rearward facing seats.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive does not collect information routinely which monitors links between the science and technology base in Scotland and elsewhere. Such links can take a very wide variety of forms, ranging from informal networking and conferences to formal collaborations between universities, businesses and research institutes. An important example is the Edinburgh to Stanford link, funded by a &pound;6 million grant from Scottish Enterprise, which is making excellent progress. The Executive has recently asked the Scottish Funding Council and Universities Scotland to consider the feasibility of collecting information routinely to monitor research collaborations between universities here and outside Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what specific actions have been taken to implement its commitment, referred to in <em>A Science Strategy for Scotland</em> , to ensure the effective use of scientific evidence in policy formulation and resource allocation by government and to review regularly the policies and spending of each of its departments against the key objectives of the strategy and related priorities; what early results have been achieved by these actions, and what the responses have been from the academic and business communities to such actions.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive subscribes to all the principles of the Government Chief Scientific Adviser&rsquo;s Guidelines on the use of science in government, and implements these as fully as it can.</p>

  <p>The Executive uses scientific evidence, along with many other forms of evidence, as an integral and fundamental part of the policy-making process. An example is the work by the Health Economics Research Unit, funded by the Scottish Executive, to help inform policy on banning smoking in public places. Since <em>A Science Strategy for Scotland</em> was published in 2001, the Executive&rsquo;s departments which spend significantly on scientific research have developed strategies to help target spending more effectively on research which will help to improve the health and quality of life of the people of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Executive has formed an independent Scottish Science Advisory Committee, drawn from the academic, business and other parts of the science community, to advise it on priorities for science. This committee has published a number of reports evaluating the Executive&rsquo;s progress on meeting science priorities. The Executive has also improved internal co-ordination through regular meetings of the Science Cross-cutting Group, comprising senior officials having responsibilities for managing science.</p>

  <p>The Executive will be further strengthening its management of science this year by appointing a Lead Chief Scientific Adviser. The post-holder will oversee activity to improve further the management of science in the Executive, in partnership with the recently appointed Chief Scientific Adviser in the Environment and Rural Affairs Department and the Chief Scientist in Health Department.</p>

  <p>The Executive plans to publish a report very shortly detailing progress on all areas of the science strategy, which will provide further details and examples of the use of science in policy-making. The Executive intends over the course of the next year to refresh the science strategy.</p>

  <p>Media coverage of the launch of <em>A Science Strategy for Scotland</em> in August 2001 was very positive.</p>

  <p>The Science Strategy commits the Executive to supporting initiatives that enable the media, scientists and policy makers to work more closely together to effectively promote science to the people of Scotland. The Executive supports a wide range of public science initiatives which frequently attract helpful media attention, for example Science Week and the Edinburgh International Science Festival. The Executive is supporting the British Association&rsquo;s Science Communication Conference in April, which will in part consider how to engage the media in a better coverage of science issues. The Executive plans to publish a report shortly, detailing progress on all areas of the Science Strategy, which will provide further details of activities in this area.</p>
