  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, if it is successful in its bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games, whether Scotland, as the host nation, can nominate sports for inclusion in the Games and, if so, whether it will nominate rugby union for inclusion and locate the competition in the Scottish Borders.</p>

  <p>The information requested on the Commonwealth Games Sports Programme can be found at the following URL as at 26 January 2006 <a href="http://www.thecgf.com/faq/faq12.asp" target="_blank">http://www.thecgf.com/faq/faq12.asp</a></p>

  <p>Men&rsquo;s rugby 7&rsquo;s is one of the compulsory sports in the Commonwealth Games Sports Programme.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and Glasgow City Council have received advice from the Commonwealth Games Council for Scotland indicating that the prospects for Scotland&rsquo;s bid to be successful are maximised if the events venues are as close together as possible and if the use of these facilities is maximised where possible.</p>

  <p>Therefore it is likely that, should Scotland be successful in its bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games, the majority of sporting events would be based within or close to Glasgow and this includes the rugby 7&rsquo;s event. All of the bid partners are committed to ensuring the games, if awarded to Glasgow, involve and benefit the whole of Scotland. Benefits will accrue not just from the particular location of an event but also from the siting of training camps and holding camps.</p>

  <p>This issue is devolved to the Scottish Executive. However, given the single UK fuel market in which we operate, we have agreed to a UK-wide target for the uptake of biofuels. EU Directive 2003/30/EC on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable transport fuels requires member states to set targets for biofuel sales in 2005 and 2010. The Directive also set non-binding &quot;reference&quot; values for member states to take into account in setting their own sale targets; they are respectively 2% for 2005 and 5.75% for 2010. The UK Government has set a UK-wide renewable transport fuel target for 2005 of 0.3% of total fuel sales.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is involved, through my membership of the Ministerial Low Carbon Group (MLCG), in work at a UK level looking into ways to promote the development, introduction and take-up of low carbon vehicles and fuels. The MLCG published its second annual report in October 2004 and a copy is available from the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib number 35679).</p>

  <p>The Department for Transport has recently commissioned a feasibility study on the possible introduction of a Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) for biofuels and other renewable transport fuels, and is currently consulting with stakeholders at UK level. The Scottish Executive is closely following this work and considering its implications for Scotland.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, the Executive is supporting Scotland&rsquo;s first large-scale biodiesel plant by the Argent Group. The plant is likely to increase biofuel sales in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Under section 75 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997, a planning authority may enter into an agreement for the purpose of regulating the development or use of a particular piece of land. The agreement is with anyone who has an interest in that land. Section 75 agreements may provide for financial payments by developers. These can contribute to the cost of providing necessary facilities required in the near future as a consequence of or in connection with the development.</p>

  <p>Section 69 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 is a general power for local authorities to do anything which is calculated to facilitate, or is conducive or incidental to, the discharge of their functions. This enables local authorities to enter into a wide range of agreements, which can include agreements with developers to levy charges in relation to specific development. Such agreements must, however, be ancillary to some function of the local authority. In the context of development, they could be related to the specific development, or, more widely, to the general well-being of the area.</p>

As has been stated previously in my answer to S2W-22351, no specific, credible or reliable information has, to date, been brought to the attention of the police that the &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; of any individual has been unlawfully facilitated through a Scottish airport.

  <p>It is known that the shooting of mountain hares takes place in Scotland. In terms of Article 15 of the Habitats Directive, it is only an offence to kill a mountain hare using an indiscriminate means of killing capable of causing the local disappearance of, or serious disturbance to, the species. Shooting mountain hares does not constitute such an indiscriminate means.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21559 by Rhona Brankin on 21 December 2005, what duties are placed on it by virtue of these species being listed on Annexes IV and V of the Habitats Directive.</p>

  <p>Article 12 of the Habitats Directive requires that member states take the requisite measures to establish a system of strict protection for the animal species, in their natural range, that are listed in Annex IV (a) of the Directive. These measures must prohibit the capture, killing, disturbance and sale of those species.</p>

  <p>Article 15 of the Habitats Directive requires that, with regard to those species of wild fauna listed in Annex V (a) of the Directive, member states shall prohibit the use of all indiscriminate means capable of causing local disappearance of, or serious disturbance to, populations of such species. It prohibits in particular the means of capture and killing and modes of transport listed in Annex VI (a) and Annex VI (b) of the Directive.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-21559 by Rhona Brankin on 21 December 2005, how its consideration of applications for licences, the issuing of licences for killing mountain hares and pine martens and any other measures it has in place meet the requirements of the Habitats Directive.</p>

  <p>In its consideration of such licence applications, and the issuing of any such licences, the Executive takes account of the three tests outlined in Article 16 of the Directive.</p>

  <p>These tests are:</p>

  <p>that any licence issued is for a purpose outlined in Article 16 of the Directive;</p>

  <p>that there is no other satisfactory solution, and</p>

  <p>that the granting of a licence will not be detrimental to maintaining the population of the species concerned at a favourable conservation status in their natural range.</p>
