  <p>The Scottish Executive, in partnership with the Association of Directors of Social Work, COSLA and the Accounts Commission, is currently undertaking a major review of information requirements for social work in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The first stage of the review undertaken by the Social Work Information Review Group was to specify a list of local and national information requirements. The number of assessments of children in need was identified as a national information requirement. A report of the group&#8217;s work was published on 25 August 2000 and is available on the Scottish Executive website at www.scotland.gov.uk. The second stage of the review, which is currently under way, will involve agreeing common definitions and standards to ensure that information can be collected on a consistent basis across all local authorities.</p>

  <p>I am satisfied that the slaughter of sheep stocks within infected areas is based on sound veterinary advice.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what specific advice the Chief Veterinary Officer has given in relation to the airborne transmission of the current foot-and-mouth disease virus and whether it will make this advice publicly available, in particular that advice which relates to (a) the likelihood of airborne transmission, (b) whether any case of infection is believed to have been as a result of airborne transmission and (c) the maximum distance over which the virus can be transmitted by air.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-04-02.7.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80155" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0402.htm#se_Minister">

  <p>Information from the Office International des Epizootics (OIE), the world organisation for animal health in Paris indicates that airborne spread of foot-and-mouth disease can be as much as 60 km overland and 300 km by sea. Those are maximum distances under favourable conditions. In practice the possibility of aerosol spread depends on a number of factors including number and species of the affected host animal and weather conditions (wind speed, air temperature, relative humidity). Aerosol spread overland is also subject to variation caused by land features which might disrupt the plume of virus.</p>

  <p>However, insofar as this particular strain of virus is concerned, initial studies based on observations made in other countries suggest that aerosol transmission from infected premises has not been a prominent feature. So far this would appear to be being borne out in this country, as the spread appears to be by direct contact particularly through sheep. The position obviously is being monitored very carefully as the outbreak continues.</p>

  <p>The &#163;30 million funding for ICT support announced in the UK White Paper on Business and Skills will not be allocated specifically to geographic regions, since it will focus on UK-wide marketing activities, web-based assistance and sector specific work.

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to achieving universal access to the web by 2005. It is technically possible now for anyone with a telephone line and a PC to purchase web access, but income and a range of other factors are currently affecting take-up by certain groups. We are therefore considering a range of options to achieve universal access which include both home-based access and community facilities.</p>

  <p>There are two projects currently supported by the Health Education Board for Scotland (HEBS). <i>Rosie&#8217;s World </i> is <i> </i> a resource pack which explores issues of mental well-being and is aimed at very young children. <i>Confidence to Learn </i> is <i> </i> a classroom guide for teachers to enable them to extend health education, which includes emotional health, in the primary school.</p>

  <p>HEBS are also closely involved with the Health Promoting Schools concept which covers all aspects of school life, curriculum, environment and relationships, in promoting the health and well-being of staff and pupils.</p>

  <p>In addition to work centred in schools, HEBS also leads an annual campaign, Scottish Mental Health Week. Last year&#8217;s campaign, from 9-16 October, was targeted at young people aged 12-16 and the two main strands were publication of <i>Cool Heads/Stress Central </i>for children/teenagers and funding of 17 small local projects which involve children and teenagers in addressing mental well-being issues.</p>

  <p>MGF projects are scheduled to run until March 2002. All of the projects will be monitored, with regular updates and results published on the Scottish Executive&#8217;s 21st Century Government website.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive uses a number of measures of poverty which apply across Scotland.

  <p>As indicated in response to question S1O-2686, the identification of key indicators of rural poverty is amongst the aims of the Rural Poverty and Inclusion Working Group, which is due to report shortly.

  <p>The decision to separate the maintenance of the trunk road network from the local road network was inherited by the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The statutory provisions of the Trunk Roads Act 1936 drew the distinction between trunk roads and local roads.</p>

  <p>Up until 1996 management and maintenance of trunk roads were undertaken by local authorities on behalf of the then Secretary of State under the terms of Agency Agreements. Thereafter contracts were let for the management and maintenance of the Central Belt (Premium) network and the management of the remaining (All Purpose) rural network following a decision taken in 1995 by ministers in line with European Directives to seek competitive tenders on a contractual basis.</p>

  <p>Trunk road contracts lie outwith the functions of local government and are not catered for in the local government financial settlement. Local authorities have known since 1996 when the previous contracts were awarded that they could fail to secure the trunk road work. Some of the management work was lost in 1999. The contracts for the Operating Companies stood to be renewed in 2001. Agency agreements had been awarded without competition and could not therefore extend indefinitely.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently considering the detail of the arrangements for collecting the Graduate Endowment.

  <p>Graduates who wish to take out an income contingent loan to discharge their liability for the Graduate Endowment will do so on the same terms and conditions as loans for living costs. The Inland Revenue pay quarterly in advance for collected student loans, based on an agreed projection for the year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive <a name="QuestionText">what it means by &quot;the income arising from the graduate endowment&quot; in section 2 of the Education (Graduate Endowment and Student Support) (Scotland) (No.2) Bill, and whether this includes the extra revenue that will arise from the collection of the endowment.</a></p>

  <p>Under section 2 of the Education (Graduate Endowment and Student Support) (Scotland) (No.2) Bill, the income arising from the graduate endowment means the full amount payable by each liable graduate in the spring following the completion of their course. For those who start a degree in academic year 2001-02 the amount payable will be &#163;2,000. Graduates may draw on the facility of the income-contingent student loan scheme to discharge this liability.</p>
