  <p>Official functions are those held in furtherance of Scottish Executive business or in providing hospitality to guests of the Scottish Executive or HM Government.

  <p>There is no formal distinction between the public and the private areas of Bute House. Official functions are normally held in the drawing room and the dining room. There is a limited amount of office accommodation to provide support when Cabinet meets or other official functions are being held. The First Minister is entitled to use any part of his official residence for private purposes.</p>

  <p>The GVA figures used in Government Expenditure and Revenue in Scotland (GERS) are those published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), which are used to apportion certain items to Scotland based on share of UK GVA.</p>

  <p>New estimates of regional GVA were published by ONS on 30th April this year. A comparison of the Scottish percentage of UK GVA derived from the previous publication in August 2003 (used in the latest GERS calculations) with these latest ONS figures is shown in the table below. This shows that the revisions are very small, and will not have a significant effect on the estimates in GERS.</p>

  <p>A full analysis for the most recent five years based on the most up-to-date information, including the most recent ONS GVA estimates, will be given in the GERS publication in December 2004.</p>

  <p>As stated in answers to S2W-6394 and S2W-6395 on 29 April 2004, the revisions to the Scottish Executive GDP index are not relevant as they are not used in the GERS analysis.</p>

  <p>Our broadband strategy for Scotland has accelerated the roll-out of affordable broadband across Scotland and we reached the coverage target of 70% of households announced in December 2002 ahead of time and below budget. A new coverage target for the whole of Scotland, which will include communities in the Borders, is being considered and we shall be announcing our plans shortly.</p>

  <p>Scottish Borders Rural Broadband, a project we supported under the UK Broadband Fund, has brought an innovative wireless broadband service to seven selected communities in the Borders, ahead of planned commercial provision.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps are being taken to ensure that the proposed Scotscorps initiative will be a good use of taxpayers&#8217; money and will support, rather than compete with, existing volunteer-involving organisations.</p>

  <p>A key principle of Project Scotland concerns the need to complement rather than compete with existing volunteering organisations. The proposals are grounded in discussions with stakeholders in the private, voluntary and public sectors, and these will continue as programme arrangements are finalised over the coming months.</p>

  <p>In order to ensure maximise the effectiveness and efficiency of the programme, the proposals also draw upon an assessment of a number of existing full-time volunteering programmes both within the UK and overseas, and extensive market research with young people.</p>

  <p>In addition the Scottish Executive will protect its investment in Project Scotland through the development of robust monitoring and evaluation arrangements. These include:</p>

  <p>the identification of annually agreed targets as part of the Scottish Executive&#8217;s grant conditions;</p>

  <p>an annual review meeting and report, and</p>

  <p>an independent evaluation in year three of Scottish Executive funding to examine the overall effectiveness of the programme, the extent to which it has met original objectives, and the effectiveness of organisational arrangements.</p>
