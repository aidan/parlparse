  <p>Disability access standards are not governed by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995. The standards are contained within <em>Accessible Train and Station Design for Disabled People: A Code of Practice</em> , published by the Department for Transport and Transport Scotland in 2008.</p>

  <p>Compliance with the code of practice is only required when major station improvement work takes place and does not apply retrospectively.</p>

  <p>There are 124 stations across Scotland that can be viewed as not having step free access to all platforms, and therefore are not fully accessible for people with reduced mobility. These can be broken down by Regional Transport Partnership as:</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands &ndash; 20.</p>

  <p>North East &ndash; 3.</p>

  <p>South East &ndash; 17.</p>

  <p>South West &ndash; 1.</p>

  <p>In 2004, ScotRail surveyed all 347 stations in Scotland to gather information about station facilities, which included disabled access to and within each station. This information is reviewed and updated on an annual basis and is included in their Disabled Persons Protection Policy which is published each October and is available online and at every staffed station across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Throughout 2009, the Association of Train Operating Companies (ATOC) has carried out surveys at every station across Scotland. The surveys will be used for a new online service for disabled passengers as well as for the general public. It is expected to go live in October 2009.</p>

  <p>In 2008-09, Network Rail has completed detailed disabled access surveys at 28 stations across Scotland as part of Transport Scotland&rsquo;s Access for All small schemes programme.</p>

  <p>Further stations will undergo small scale disabled access improvements through the Access for All small schemes fund and through ScotRail&rsquo;s Minor Works. These are annual budgets where improvements will be identified as a rolling programme over the next five years.</p>

  <p>Twelve new stations will be built to the current disabled access standards as required in the next five years.</p>

  <p>Ongoing validation of concessionary travel claims by bus operators means that claims are routinely scrutinised by the concessionary travel and integrated ticketing unit. This process can result in adjustments being made to claims submitted by bus operators. However, these adjustments are not always as a result of intentional overclaims and, on occasion, can result in an increased payment to that which was originally claimed.</p>

  <p>The total claimed against the scheme from 2006 is in the region of &pound;510 million and the total reimbursed is in the region of &pound;506 million.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland does not automatically reimburse bus operators on the figures submitted in their claim. Staff within the concessionary travel and integrated ticketing unit undertake a regular programme of audit inspections to examine the claim compilation and submission procedures being used by operators, and to carry out checks on the detailed information behind the claims which is available from the operators&rsquo; ticketing systems.</p>

  <p>In addition, a programme of on-bus surveys is currently in place whereby information is collected about the general operation of the scheme, various details of the cardholders&rsquo; journeys and in particular cardholders&rsquo; boarding and alighting points.</p>

  <p>The output from these surveys is used to provide information to Transport Scotland&rsquo;s reimbursement and validation staff for comparing with the revenue foregone or average fare data submitted in the operators&rsquo; claims. If discrepancies are found, the reimbursement is adjusted accordingly.</p>

  <p>SPP11 was revised in November 2007 to strengthen policy on open space protection. SPP 11 continues the presumption against redevelopment of valued open space, with new requirements for sportscotland to be consulted on a wider range of applications for developments affecting outdoor sports facilities. As required by SPP11, local authority open space audits and strategies are now feeding into the development plan process, providing a more comprehensive approach to identifying, protecting and enhancing open space which meets community needs. The SPP states that it is particularly important to ensure that disadvantaged communities have accessible open space of good quality.</p>

  <p>The reporters appointed to conduct the public local inquiry, and to report to Scottish ministers into objections received against the proposed Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route, have considered all objections passed to them by Transport Scotland. The remit of the inquiry was set by Scottish ministers and in preparing their report to ministers, the reporters have only reported on matters that fell within this remit. Approximately 10,000 letters of objection were considered by the reporters and many of these letters contained multiple objections. The reporters did not keep a record of the number of letters or objections that fell outwith the remit of the inquiry.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland automatically collects daily traffic count information from a number of sites within the Rosyth area. The data can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/road/traffic-count/map-application" target="_blank">http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/road/traffic-count/map-application</a>.</p>

  <p>This data assists with the ongoing monitoring of traffic flow and volume throughout the trunk road network. In addition, during the last 10 years, specific separate traffic count, journey time and noise monitoring surveys were carried out along the A985 between 2004 and 2005.</p>

  <p>As local authorities have responsibility for monitoring air pollution levels, Fife Council is required to monitor air quality throughout Fife. Fife has three locations which measure air quality every hour using automatic monitoring equipment. These are located at Dunfermline, Cupar and Rosyth. The data can be found at:</p>

  <p>Park and Ride/Park and Choose schemes are delivered by local authorities and Regional Transport Partnerships.</p>

  <p>However, within the first six months of the 2007 election, the Scottish Government signed a concordat with CoSLA which provided local authorities with record levels of funding over the spending review period 2008-11. This will empower local authorities to deliver improved local transport solutions through increased freedom over how they plan, manage and fund services on the basis of their assessment of local needs and priorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has published <em>Park and Ride for Buses: A National Framework </em>on 30 June 2009 and has also enhanced its manifesto commitment by taking Park and Ride/Park and Choose into account through Intervention 8 of the Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR) which includes indicative Park and Ride/Park and Choose sites at Halbeath and Pitreavie (near Rosyth).</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland will therefore continue to engage with local authorities and SESTRANS in taking the park and choose recommendations for Halbeath and Pitreavie forward.</p>
