  <p>The Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010 legislates for the new community payback order. The aim of the alcohol treatment requirement which can be imposed as part of the community payback order is to ensure that offenders address their alcohol dependency through treatment which is appropriate to their individual needs.</p>

  <p>A community payback order will specify that an offender must submit to treatment under the direction of a person with the necessary qualifications or experience, with a view to reducing or eliminating the offender's dependency on alcohol. The order may specify residential or non-residential treatment and treatment by or under the direction of a specified person, but will not otherwise specify the nature of the treatment.</p>

  <p>We have no plans to pilot alcohol treatment and testing orders. Scottish courts are already able to impose a condition of alcohol treatment or education as part of a probation order where they consider it appropriate. 1,062 such conditions were imposed in 2008-09.</p>

  <p>With the introduction of the community payback order (CPO) in the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010, courts will be able to impose a CPO with an alcohol treatment requirement for offenders who are dependent on alcohol. For those who are not dependent, but for whom alcohol is nevertheless a factor in offending behaviour, a CPO can include alcohol counselling or education under either a supervision requirement or a programme requirement. The legislation for CPOs also contains provision for courts to carry out discretionary review hearings at any stage during the order. Evaluations of drug treatment and testing orders have found that reviews are one of the most successful features of that order.</p>

  <p>The Minister for Schools and Skills, Councillor Harry McGuigan, representing COSLA, and I met with Chris Grayling MP, Minister for Employment in the UK Government on 28 October 2010. Discussion covered a range of welfare reform issues.</p>

  <p>Giventhe impact of the proposed benefit changes on Scottish people and devolved services at all levels it is crucial that the Scottish Government has a formal role in Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) policy formulation. We will therefore pursue our commitment to meet regularly on a tri-partite basis to make representations to the DWP to ensure that the needs of Scotland are fully considered including the proposed weekly benefits cap of &pound;500 for an adult couple or lone parent household.</p>

  <p>The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) anticipate that in the first instance the proposed cap is likely to be delivered by local authorities through housing benefit payments. In the longer term the cap will be administered as part of the new universal credit system.</p>

  <p>It is clear that the proposed changes in the welfare regime will place additional pressure on devolved services like health, housing and social care, many of which are delivered by local authorities and it is important that the Scottish Government and COSLA are involved in DWP policy development. To that end, we intend that these will be the subject of regular discussions with the DWP and COSLA and the administration of the benefits cap will be an important consideration.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally. However it may be helpful to clarify that it is not necessary to revoke a Tree Preservation Order (TPO) for the purposes of granting full planning permission. Any work affecting protected trees that is necessary to implement a full planning permission does not require the consent of the planning authority under the TPO. The TPO is a material consideration in the consideration of the planning application.</p>

  <p>Information on the employment status of housing benefit recipients is available from the Single Housing Benefit Extract (SHBE) managed by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). From an analysis of this source provided to us by DWP, of 468,960 housing benefit recipients in Scotland in July 2010, there were 42,220 (9% of all housing benefit recipients) whose benefit was not passported and for whom the local authority recorded employment income from either the main claimant or partner in calculating the housing benefit award.</p>

  <p>Another potential source of information on the characteristics of people on housing benefits is the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS provides information, among other things, on the characteristics and circumstances of households which identify themselves in the survey as receiving housing benefit. In the 2008-09 survey 8% of housing benefit recipients in the survey in Scotland were recorded as having either the main applicant, spouse or both in employment. It should be noted that this is a sample survey and that there will be related levels of uncertainty around these estimates. There is also evidence of under reporting of benefit receipt in the survey.</p>

  <p>The best source of information on housing benefit claimants is the Single Housing Benefit Extract (SHBE) collected by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). However information from this source does not separately identify housing benefit recipients who are unemployed. It should be noted that the definition of those who are unemployed is people who are out of work and actively seeking work. The information available to us from this source is given in the following table. This distinguishes those who receive housing benefit which has been passported because they receive other benefits (including sickness and disability benefits as well as unemployment benefits) and, for those whose housing benefit has not been passported, whether or not they are employed. The footnotes to the table explain the basis of the analysis.</p>

  <p>Of the non passported claimants who are not in employment the SHBE does not separately distinguish those who are unemployed and for those who are otherwise out of work (known as the economically inactive). It is therefore not possible to give an estimate from this source of the number who is unemployed.</p>

  <p>Another potential source of information on the characteristics of people on housing benefits is the Family Resources Survey (FRS). The FRS provides information, among other things, on the characteristics and circumstances of households which identify themselves in the survey as receiving housing benefit. In the 2008-09 survey 11% of housing benefit recipients in the survey in Scotland were recorded as unemployed. A further 40% of housing benefit recipients were recorded as being economically inactive and of working age. It should be noted that this is a sample survey and that there will be related levels of uncertainty around these estimates. Also there is evidence of under reporting of benefit receipt in the survey.</p>

  <p>2. The figures have been rounded to the nearest 10.</p>

  <p>3. SHBE is a monthly electronic scan of claimant level data direct from local authority computer systems. It replaces quarterly aggregate clerical returns. The data is available monthly from November 2008 and July 2010 is the latest month for which data is available.</p>

  <p>4. People receiving housing benefit which has been passported are receiving Income Support, Job Seekers Allowance, Employment Support Allowance, or Pension Credit (guaranteed credit).</p>

  <p>5. People claiming Housing Benefit not in receipt of a passported benefit are recorded as being in employment if their local authority has recorded employment income from either the main claimant, or partner of claimant (if applicable), in calculating the housing benefit award.</p>

  <p>6. The analysis covers all housing benefit recipients in social housing and private rented accommodation.</p>

  <p>7. Passported Status does not include recipients with unknown passported status.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-11-08.S3W-36898.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa1108.htm#11">

  <p>Expenditure on victims and witnesses is incurred across a range of criminal justice agencies. For example, engagement with victims and witnesses is a core part of the functions of the police, Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and Scottish Court Service. However, spending on such work is not separately identified within their budgets, and it is therefore not possible to disaggregate total expenditure on victims and witnesses within the Scottish justice budget. In addition, a number of services are delivered to both victims and witnesses as there is an overlap between the two categories.</p>

  <p>Support and services for victims and witnesses are also provided by agencies funded by other parts of the Scottish Government, and include over &pound;44 million over the period 2008-09 to 2010-11 to combat violence against women including funding for Rape Crisis Scotland, Scottish Women&rsquo;s Aid, and the Rape Crisis Helpline.</p>

  <p>Expenditure that is specifically earmarked solely for victims and witnesses within the Scottish justice budget is listed in the following table:-</p>

  <p>We can only give specific figures for asylum, to any degree of accuracy, after April 2008.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) has responsibility for administering the legal aid scheme. It has recorded payment figures in the immigration and asylum category going back to 2001. However, a specific category within the advice and assistance scheme to separately identify cases of asylum seekers was only introduced just over two years ago, in April 2008.</p>

  <p>In the separate scheme for civil legal aid, which pays for representation in relation to judicial hearings, the most specific subject matter SLAB has is to identify judicial or statutory reviews relating to immigration or asylum proceedings. There is no further breakdown and therefore we need to estimate specific asylum costs. The figures shown on the following table use these estimates as described and have combined the costs of advice and assistance and civil legal aid. The breakdown of the total paid is shown in terms of solicitor&rsquo;s fees, counsel&rsquo;s fees and outlays to cover expenses and items such as expert witness reports. Figures are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>There is some income received to cover costs in asylum and immigration. In 2009-10, 4% of the gross costs in this area were recovered.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Legal Aid Board (SLAB) has responsibility for administering the legal aid scheme.</p>

  <p>SLAB has reparation cases coded on its systems going back to 2001. In 2005, it introduced a category code to identify cases of reparation with a specific medical negligence component. However, it does not categorise the type of opponent.</p>

  <p>Medical negligence cases take between one and two years on average to result in an account being submitted. As can be seen in the following table the first two years after the introduction of the new system saw a build up in the level of identified expenditure, and will not be an accurate representation of the amount of legally aided work related to medical negligence in any particular year.</p>

  <p>The figures quoted are for all opponents that appear to be a part of the wider National Health Service, i.e. they include health boards, health trusts, individual doctors, dentists etc as well as the Scottish Ambulance Service, the Blood Transfusion Service and NHS 24.</p>

  <p>Exclusions have been made for cases against obvious private companies and non-medical bodies, for example the Scottish Prison Service.</p>

  <p>The figures shown in the table have combined the costs of advice and assistance and full legal aid.</p>

  <p>The breakdown of the total paid is shown in terms of solicitor&rsquo;s fees, counsel&rsquo;s fees and outlays to cover expenses and items such as expert witness reports. Figures are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds.</p>

  <p>SLAB recovers a considerable part of the costs of medical negligence cases. In 2009-10 it recovered 30% of the total gross cost of these cases through expenses being awarded against opponents and through contributions from assisted persons. These gross figures therefore do not represent the net cost on the legal aid fund.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s recent consultation <em>Review of the Control of Entry Arrangements</em> considered a wide range of issues, including those related to dispensing GP practices. The Summary Report was published on 20 October 2010, and can be found on the Scottish Government&rsquo;s website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/10/20143448/0" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/10/20143448/0</a> .</p>

  <p>The Summary Report sets out our intentions to amend the NHS (Pharmaceutical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2009 in a number of areas, and will ensure, for instance, that dispensing GP practices are informed directly when applications are made to open a community pharmacy in the relevant neighbourhood. We intend to lay amendment Regulations before the Scottish Parliament for its consideration prior to the end of the year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also in negotiations with the British Medical Association Scottish General Practitioners&rsquo; Committee (SGPC) with a view to establishing future funding arrangements for dispensing practices. The impact of dispensing income on practices in remote and rural areas is being considered as part of this.</p>

  <p>The use of accelerated restricted procedures allows public bodies to reduce the overall time allowed for bidders to respond to contract notices and tender documents. Any decision to reduce the timescales for a tendering exercise has to recognise the value and complexity of the individual contract and whether the reduction in the timescale might have an adverse impact on the ability of companies to respond. Given the large size of contracts typically awarded by the Scottish Government, it has not been deemed appropriate to reduce the time of the tendering procedure and the accelerated procedure has not been used in 2009 or to date in 2010. Information from the Public Contracts Scotland portal shows that, across the wider Scottish public sector, accelerated procedures have been applied in 49 awards of contract in 2009 and 27 awards so far in 2010.</p>
