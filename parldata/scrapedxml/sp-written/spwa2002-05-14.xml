  <p>The Scottish Executive is providing substantial funding in support of policing in Scotland and police numbers are now at record levels. Within these resources, tackling crime and disorder in particular areas is an operational matter for chief constables to decide in consultation with local communities. In addition to the funding provided to police authorities, the Executive is investing &#163;12 million over the next three years in a Community Safety Award Programme to allow council-led Community Safety Partnerships to tackle local issues such as disorder and anti-social behaviour. For 2002-03, the Inverclyde Partnership has been allocated over &#163;113,000. Measures to tackle anti-social behaviour within communities in a housing context include provisions in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001 and an Executive-funded sociable neighbourhood initiative. Interim Anti-Social Behaviour Orders are proposed in the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill currently before the Parliament, to provide immediate protection pending the process of applying for a full Anti-Social Behaviour Order.</p>

  <p>The Executive has regular discussions with chief constables, police authority conveners and others on a range of policing matters. The most recent meeting with chief constables was on 1 May 2002.</p>

  <p>As our Programme for Government made clear, our policies are designed to promote equality of opportunity, eliminate deprivation and disadvantage and make our country safer and our people feel safer. So, for example, funding for the police service is now at record levels, as are police numbers. However, how various types of crime, including street crime, are tackled locally is primarily an operational matter for chief constables to decide in consultation with the local communities.</p>

  <p>Yes. Orders in Council under section 30 of the Scotland Act must be laid in draft before, and approved by resolution of, the Scottish Parliament and each House of Parliament at Westminster before a recommendation to make the order can be made to Her Majesty in Council.</p>

  <p>Since March 2000, the Domestic Abuse Service Development Fund has supported or is still currently supporting, over 80 local multi-agency projects set up to tackle domestic abuse. A large number of these projects include preventative elements. However, funding for projects that could be described as primarily concerned with prevention is as follows:</p>

  <p>2000-01 financial year: eight projects at a total cost of &#163;153,930.</p>

  <p>2001-02 financial year: seven projects at a total cost of &#163;109,545.</p>

  <p>2002-03 financial year: seven projects at a total cost of &#163;249,360.</p>

  <p>In addition the Scottish Executive provided &#163;56,552 in the financial year 2000-01 and &#163;29,440 in the financial year 2001-02 to the Zero Tolerance Charitable Trust, to fund the piloting of the respect package in schools and youth groups in Edinburgh and Glasgow. The aim of this package is to raise awareness amongst young people of the issues around domestic abuse.</p>

  <p>There are two statutory regulations which require companies, including some biotechnology companies, to pay money to the Executive or its agencies. The Scottish Agricultural Science Agency (SASA) provides statutory services for seed certification and seed testing on a fee paying basis and the pesticides industry, including many biotech companies, pays a compulsory levy under section 18(3) of the Food and Environment Protection Act (1985). The SASA undertakes Pesticides Usage Surveys, foodstuffs surveillance and investigations under the Wildlife Incident Investigation Scheme (WIIS), all of which are funded from this levy.</p>

  <p>Training and development standards are constantly monitored within the fingerprint service and reviewed in light of emergent changes and practices. A strategic reassessment of how training is delivered was carried out in 2000 by the Association of Chief Police Officers (Scotland) (ACPOS) Presidential Review Group, Change Management Review Team. Arising from their recommendations, which have now been implemented, all national training is now procured through national fingerprint courses at the National Training Centre for Scientific Support to Crime Investigation, Durham.</p>

  <p>The competency of all experts within the Scottish Fingerprint Service is assessed annually by the independent, external organisation, Collaborative Testing Services Inc.</p>

  <p>Under ACPOS direction, a training forum has been established to consider the development of common practices, procedures and standards relating to fingerprint training issues across Scotland. Issues such as continuous professional development, court presentation training and the re-assessment of training delivery are being currently examined.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not collect information on funding allocated by NHS boards for schemes to tackle alcohol problems. These are funded from within boards&#8217; general allocations and cannot be separately identified.</p>

  <p>Information on the expenditure reported by each NHS board to tackle drug misuse, submitted by NHS boards to the Executive with their annual accounts for the years 1998-99 to 1999-2000 is shown in the table. The returns may include expenditure from general health allocations. They may exclude some funding allocated for drug misuse which has been used to fund drug-related HIV/AIDs prevention work, for example the funding of needle exchanges. Similar information is not available for 2000-01.</p>

  <p>Financial returns for 2001-02, which will report expenditure on drug misuse services and HIV prevention, will be available later this year. Financial information for 2001-02 is also currently being sought through Drug Action Team Corporate Action Plans.</p>

  <p>The implications for local authorities of the increase in employers&#8217; National Insurance contributions will depend on a range of factors which relate to councils&#8217; staffing and pay levels. We are discussing the total future funding requirements for local government with COSLA as part of the spending review process.</p>

  <p>The overall annual financial impact of the increase in employers&#8217; National Insurance contributions for the public sector in Scotland as a whole is estimated to be no more than &#163;80 million. For any individual organisation such as the enterprise bodies, the impact will be roughly equivalent to 1% of the pay bill. Details of how much individual public sector organisations spend on pay is already made available through a wide range of published documents, including for example bodies&#8217; annual reports and accounts.</p>

  <p>For both 2001-02 and 2002-03, bids for general funding submitted by Scottish police forces have been met in full. In addition, the Executive has provided additional funding to meet certain new demands. These have included:</p>

  <p>&#163;220,000 to Fife Constabulary in 2001-02 for the policing costs of the new European ferry at Rosyth;</p>

  <p>&#163;117,000 to Lothian and Borders Police in 2001-02 to meet the costs of its Parliamentary Policing Unit when the Parliament is not sitting, and</p>

  <p>&#163;1.4 million spread across all forces in 2001-02, including Grampian Police, to meet additional policing pressures following the events of 11 September 2001.</p>

  <p>Funding for the police service in Scotland is now at record levels, as are the number of police officers. Within the totals made available, an extra &#163;24 million has been provided over the last three years by the Executive specifically to boost police recruitment. It is for police authorities to set budgets and for chief constables to make decisions about operational requirements within their force areas.</p>

  <p>There is no separate target for Scotland under the EC Packaging Waste Directive. However, the Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced today that the UK has narrowly failed to meet the 50% overall recovery target for 2001 set by the EC Packaging Waste Directive.</p>

  <p>The full text of his reply is:</p>

  <p>The UK narrowly failed to meet the overall packaging waste recovery target in 2001, but met the overall recycling target and the material-specific recycling targets for all materials.</p>

  <p>The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 (as amended) and parallel legislation in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland implement these targets in the UK. The regulations place recovery and recycling obligations on producers to enable the UK to attain the directive recovery and recycling targets. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Environment Agency have reported that one compliance scheme and a number of individually registered businesses failed to meet their tonnage recovery obligations under the packaging regulations - a total shortfall of 263,832 tonnes against a combined total obligation of 823,003 tonnes.</p>

  <p>The Executive has made unprecedented levels of funding available to support the cost of residential care as part of an overall package of over &#163;1.3 billion for social services for 2002-03. There are no plans at present to raise the capital limits used in assessing a person&#8217;s ability to contribute towards the cost of their residential care but these limits are reviewed on a regular basis.</p>

  <p>Currently, care home residents with capital above the lower limit of &#163;11,500 are required to contribute from their capital toward the cost of their care and those with capital above the upper limit of &#163;18,500 are required to pay their fees in full. After 1 July those residents will still be required to pay accommodation charges but all in need of nursing care will be able to benefit by &#163;65 per week and all older people will be able to benefit by up to &#163;145 per week towards the cost of personal care.</p>

  <p>A Rural Enabler is currently working in a number of village settlements across Dumfries and Galloway to help determine further the housing circumstances and needs of those villages. Once the studies are concluded Communities Scotland and Dumfries and Galloway Council will review the findings and determine appropriate responses. This may include using the Rural Home Ownership Grant. The anticipated level of resources will depend on the outcome of the review of findings.</p>

  <p>The information available centrally relates to offenders convicted with an aggravated sentence recorded in respect of their having committed an offence while on bail, or who had a charge proved under the Bail (Scotland) Act 1980 for re-offending while on bail. The number of such convictions recorded for offenders aged under 21 was 4,035 in 1998, 3,567 in 1999 and 2,973 in 2000. The completeness and quality of the data on bail aggravated sentences will be reviewed as part of on-going research into the bail reoffending provisions introduced by the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1995.</p>
