  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what plans it has to extend the cervical cancer screening programme to women over the age of 60 and to reduce the number of deaths from cervical cancer through such routine screening.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2000-08-29.3.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80146" speakername="Susan Deacon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-00/wa0829.htm#3409">

  <p>Cervical cancer screening has been well established in Scotland since the late 1980s and eligible women aged 20-60 are routinely invited for a cervical smear at least once every five years. Women may be offered a smear test outwith the age range if clinically indicated or if a woman requests it. This age range was determined as a result of a review in 1985 of the evidence which indicated that the most benefit from screening was in this age range due to the natural history of cervical cancer. There are no plans to extend the age of routine invitation.</p>

  <p>Since 1986, there has been a 34% drop in incidence and in mortality of invasive cervical cancer and much of this can be attributed to the effectiveness of the screening programme.</p>

  <p>Locate in Scotland does not keep records of how many jobs are created by individual companies each year. The figures, therefore, reflect the number of jobs planned by a company when its decision to proceed with a project was made. In addition, the figures refer only to projects in which Locate in Scotland and its partners had significant involvement in attracting the project to Scotland. The figures below relate to projects where the company made a decision to locate or expand in Dundee and where manufacturing is the main activity carried out. All jobs in manufacturing projects are not necessarily manufacturing jobs.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to a strategic approach to its funding of the voluntary sector, and is committed to three-year grant offers. We are also working with other funders to develop a stable funding environment, including discussing with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities arrangements for introducing three-year budget settlements to assist councils&#8217; budget planning, including their support for voluntary organisations.</p>

  <p>For projects like Genesis, whose main activities over the last three years were funded from the European Social Fund assistance and which has now ceased, we have recognised the need to provide gap funding until such time as the new Objective 3 scheme begins later this year. We have put in place an interim funding scheme, and have invited voluntary sector agencies to apply for assistance, including the Genesis project.</p>

  <p>There are two sources of capital allocated to police forces. The capital allocations, issued under section 94 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 and financed by borrowing, determines the amount of capital expenditure a police authority may undertake in a given year. In addition, five forces use revenue to fund capital expenditure - known as capital from current revenue (CFCR). CFCR is funded by a combination of police grant and general revenue. It is used mainly for expenditure on vehicles and other items with a relatively short asset life. Forces may also use capital receipts e.g. arising from the disposal of assets to augment their capital spending. Capital allocations for 2001-02 have not yet been determined.</p>

  <p>The information requested, at 2000-01 prices, is shown in the table below:</p>

  <p>Police Capital Resources: Section 94 and CFCR at 2000-01 Prices</p>

  <p>No such estimate of costs has been made. Capital allocations are issued annually on the basis of bids submitted by forces. Following the distribution of the allocations it is for forces to determine their spending priorities.</p>

  <p>As a consequence of the additional funding for forces which I announced on 18 May and the extra officers being provided at force level through the funding for the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency, Strathclyde Police will have additional funding for the equivalent of 195 extra officers. However, decisions on the deployment of officers within his force area is an operational matter for the chief constable.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service to respond. Mr Cameron&#8217;s response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Yes, we have done so. The Scottish Prison Service&#8217;s new drug strategy, published in June 2000, sets a target of year-on-year reductions in the positive testing rate for prisoners misusing drugs within prison. Targets for previous years were published in the SPS Corporate Plans in 1998 and 1999.</p>
