  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-980 by Fiona Hyslop on 3 July 2007, why, if formal statistics of participation in higher education are not available for the whole of the period since the Reformation, the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning stated to the Parliament on 13 June 2007: &quot;The age participation index, which measures the proportion of young Scots who are engaged in higher education, has fallen since the graduate endowment fee was introduced from 51.5 per cent in 2001-02 to 47.1 per cent in 2005-06. Believe it or not, for the first time since the reformation, there has been a drop in the share of the population studying in higher education in Scotland.&quot; ( <em>Official Report</em> c. 629).</p>

  <p>I was making the point that the Scottish education system has been leading by example for centuries. The Member may be interested in the facts and statistics described in a book by Prof R.D. Anderson: Scottish Education since the Reformation, Studies in Scottish Economic and Social History No 5, Edinburgh 1997.</p>

  <p>The Executive has commissioned an independent review of Energy Efficiency Support in Scotland which is due to report in October 2007. This review will provide evidence on the effectiveness of the current process and framework of energy efficiency advice in Scotland and its impact in terms of cost effectiveness and carbon savings. It will look for any gaps, overlaps, duplication or unhelpful competition and any barriers to effectiveness. It will also look at different options for improving the delivery of energy efficiency support in Scotland including the option of a single Energy Efficiency Agency for Scotland. I will consider the results of this review as soon as it is available.</p>

  <p>At the British-Irish Council (BIC) Summit on 16 July 2007, members of the council reviewed and discussed how the BIC might develop its work.</p>

  <p>Recognising the potential of the BIC to strengthen relations between its members and to develop cooperation further between them across a range of sectors of mutual interest and benefit, all agreed it is now opportune to review the future direction of the BIC. In this context, Alex Salmond proposed energy as a useful work area of the BIC and offered to lead on this.</p>

  <p>The BIC tasked the secretariat, in consultation with member administrations, to undertake a strategic review of the council&rsquo;s work programmes, working methods and support arrangements, including arrangements for a standing secretariat, and report back with firm proposals as soon as possible.</p>

  <p>As with previous summits, the meeting also received progress reports and agreed a plan for future work on the other subjects being taken forward by council members. These are demography, e-Health, drugs, environment, knowledge economy, minority and lesser&ndash;used languages, tourism, transport and social inclusion.</p>

  <p>Not all of the information requested is held centrally.</p>

  <p>(a) and (b):</p>

  <p>The latest information available for Scotland is published in the Scottish Perinatal and Infant Mortality and Morbidity Report (SPIMMR) 2005. This report is due to be updated later this year.</p>

  <p>This 2005 SPIMMR report is available via:<a href="http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/servlet/FileBuffer?namedFile=mat_spimmer_2005.pdf&amp;pContentDispositionType=inline" target="_blank"><br /> http://www.isdscotland.org/isd/servlet/FileBuffer?namedFile=mat_spimmer_2005.pdf&amp;pContentDispositionType=inline</a>.</p>

  <p>Tables 31 and 32a (pages 29-30) show the number and rates of singletons born in Scotland and detected with congenital anomalies (including figures for spina bifida) at birth <em>or </em>during infancy, 1995-2004. The figures included in these tables do not however include spina bifida pregnancies that were terminated.</p>

  <p>Spina bifida is one of the conditions screened for during pregnancy and if a termination is carried out for this reason it is recorded on the Abortions Act data form. Table 32b (page 30) provides spina bifida rates per births and abortions. The total number of pregnancies used to derive the rates presented in table 32b are not included in the report.</p>

  <p>Spina bifida pregnancies resulting in miscarriage will not be included in these statistics.</p>

  <p>(i):</p>

  <p>Comparable information for the United Kingdom is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The National Congenital Anomaly System does however hold data for England and Wales. The estimated number of babies born in England and Wales during 2005 with spina bifida was 56. This equates to an incidence rate of 9 per 100,000 live births.

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>However, background information relating to this request is available from a number of sources.</p>

  <p>Dundee University:</p>

  <p>The UK Cystic Fibrosis Database is developed and maintained from Dundee University. Information about the database is available from: <a href="http://www.cystic-fibrosis.org.uk/background.htm" target="_blank">http://www.cystic-fibrosis.org.uk/background.htm</a></p>

  <p>Personnel at Dundee University are also driving the collation of comparable figures for EU member states. The latest available information on data collated for the member states is available from: <a href="http://www.eurocarecf.eu" target="_blank">www.eurocarecf.eu</a></p>

  <p>Personnel at Dundee University have contributed to Chapter 2 of the recently published 3rd edition of <em>Cystic Fibrosis</em> (Authors: D Geddes, M Hodson, A Bush). This chapter presents an overview of estimated birth prevalence for Scotland, UK and a number of EU member states and OECD nations. In summary:</p>

  <p>Around 20-25 babies are born with cystic fibrosis in Scotland each year, which equates to a birth prevalence rate of just under 1 in 2,000 live births.</p>

  <p>For the United Kingdom, the number of babies born each year is approximately ten times the Scotland figure at 200-250. The birth prevalence rate in the UK as a whole is estimated to be slightly lower than that observed in Scotland at around 1 in 2,400 live births.</p>

  <p>Cystic fibrosis is a genetic condition and birth prevalence rates vary between ethnic groups within countries. For example, in the United States the birth prevalence amongst the white population is estimated to be approximately 1 in 3,400 live births, compared with a birth prevalence for the non-white population of around 1 in 12,000 live births.</p>

  <p>Information Services Division of the NHS (ISD Scotland):</p>

  <p>It is likely that patients with cystic fibrosis will have contact with healthcare services in a number of healthcare settings including, GP practices or as inpatients or day cases in an acute, general hospital.</p>

  <p><em>Acute Hospital Discharge Information:</em></p>

  <p>The incidence and number of patients discharged from acute, general hospitals in Scotland with a diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>Incidence, Incidence Rate and Number of Cases of Cystic Fibrosis in Patients Discharged from Acute, General Hospitals in Scotland, Scottish Residents<sup>1</sup> - Year Ending 31st March 2006</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Excludes residents out with Scotland, of no fixed abode or unknown.</p>

  <p>2. Incidence is defined as a patient&rsquo;s first ever discharge with the specified diagnosis screened backwards through the patient&rsquo;s discharge history for 10 years (1996).</p>

  <p>3. Up to six diagnoses (one principal and up to five secondary) are recorded on SRM01. All six diagnoses have been used to identify cystic fibrosis employing the International Classification of Diseases, 10th revision (ICD10) code E84.</p>

  <p>4. Based on GRO(S) mid year population estimate for Scotland, 2005.</p>

  <p>5. Patients discharged with diagnosis of cystic fibrosis (includes incident cases).</p>

  <p>General Practice Information.</p>

  <p>The incidence of GP contacts with diagnosis of cystic fibrosis is not available centrally because numbers are too low to calculate meaningful, national estimates based upon a sample of general practices from practice team information data.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to doubling the international development budget, but this will be done in the context of an appraisal of the current International development policy and the spending review.</p>

  <p>In line with our manifesto commitment to work with Scotland&rsquo;s aid agencies, I have taken initial soundings from key stakeholders and over the coming months, I will consult more widely to draw on the extensive knowledge base that exists in Scotland before deciding how best to take forward the international development policy.

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>However, a number of sources provide background data related to this request.</p>

  <p>(a)</p>

  <p>The incidence of multiple sclerosis, MS, (number of people newly diagnosed) in Scotland is not held centrally. However, national estimates based on a variety of sources are available on the Scottish Public Health Observatory (ScotPHO) website: <a href="http://www.scotpho.org.uk/web/site/home/Healthwell-beinganddisease/Multiplesclerosis/ms_keypoints.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotpho.org.uk/web/site/home/Healthwell-beinganddisease/Multiplesclerosis/ms_keypoints.asp</a></p>

  <p>This information is derived from statistics on primary care consultations collected as part of the Practice Team Information scheme (PTI), from hospital discharge data and from specific survey data. Due to the natural course of MS, both PTI and hospital discharge statistics represent significant underestimates of the true prevalence and incidence of the disease. However, survey data is believed to provide more reliable estimates.</p>

  <p>(b)</p>

  <p>Based on PTI data, the estimated number of patients contacting GP practices for multiple sclerosis in the financial year 2005-06 (the most recent year for which figures are available) was 5,300. This equates to a rate of 98 per 100,000.</p>

  <p>It is important to note that this PTI estimate is based on only those patients who have consulted their general practice in the year. It is likely that many patients with MS would not consult their practice within a given year; care required by MS patients often being managed by hospital clinics. Thus, these estimates are likely to be a substantial underestimate of the true prevalence of the condition.</p>

  <p>Hospital discharge data to calendar year 2006 (provisional) is available at:<br /> <a href="http://www.scotpho.org.uk/web/site/home/Healthwell-beinganddisease/Multiplesclerosis/ms_data/ms_secondarycare.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotpho.org.uk/web/site/home/Healthwell-beinganddisease/Multiplesclerosis/ms_data/ms_secondarycare.asp</a></p>

  <p>It should be noted that, as with PTI data, this information is likely to considerably underestimate true incidence because many people with MS will receive their care at out-patient clinics and so will not be included in these admissions data.</p>

  <p>Information on outpatient clinic attendances for MS is not centrally available, as specific diagnoses are not recorded.</p>

  <p>(i), (ii) and (iii)</p>

  <p>Comparative information on MS for the United Kingdom, EU member states and OECD nations is not held centrally. A discussion of the difficulties associated with making international comparisons is made on the ScotPHO web site, but no specific data are presented.<br /> <a href="http://www.scotpho.org.uk/web/site/home/Healthwell-beinganddisease/Multiplesclerosis/ms_data/ms_international.asp" target="_blank">http://www.scotpho.org.uk/web/site/home/Healthwell-beinganddisease/Multiplesclerosis/ms_data/ms_international.asp</a></p>

  <p>Funding allocations for smoking cessation services are agreed by the Scottish Ministerial Working Group on Tobacco Control and include an additional adjustment to take account of social deprivation, which is closely linked to smoking rates, in each health board Area.<br /> <br /> An uplift of &pound;2 million was allocated to health boards in 2007-08 in order to expand cessation services. In addition to the pro-rata increase this year, Greater Glasgow and Clyde Health Board would have received a further uplift in funding to take account of its share of funding for Clyde area residents, and Highland Health Board has received funding in respect of Argyll residents.<br /> <br /> Keep Well aims to increase the rate of health improvement in deprived communities and includes a specific funding stream for smoking cessation activity.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to a zero tolerance approach to underage sales. We have been working in partnership with all 32 local authorities to introduce a Scotland-wide national entitlement card that includes accreditation under the British Retail Consortium&rsquo;s Proof of Age Standards Scheme which will enable retailers to operate a &quot;no proof, no sale policy&quot;.</p>

  <p>In addition the change in Scottish prosecution policy in 2005 to allow evidence from test purchasing of age restricted goods to be admissible in court means that local authority trading standards departments have an additional useful tool to combat underage sales.</p>

  <p>Furthermore, I intend to publish a five-year Smoking Prevention Action Plan by Spring 2008 which will cover targets to reduce smoking among young people; reducing availability of tobacco to young people; discouraging young people from smoking and enabling young regular smokers to stop.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to reducing the incidence of smoking among children and young people. The smoke-free legislation is, of course, expected to drive cultural change by making smoking less attractive to young people and we acted quickly to reinforce the dangers associated with smoking by laying legislation to raise the age of purchase for tobacco products from 16 to 18 with effect 1 October 2007. We now propose to build upon the achievements made in reducing the incidence of smoking among young people by publishing a comprehensive five-year Smoking Prevention Action Plan by Spring 2008. This plan will set out new targets for reducing smoking among young people and outline a range of measures to underpin this including to reduce the availability of tobacco to underage young people through stricter enforcement of the law; to discourage young people from smoking; and to enable young regular smokers to stop.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available for single years.</p>

  <p>The preferred source for smoking prevalence data is the Scottish Household Survey. The sample is drawn such that results are available at Scotland level on an annual basis and at local authority level for the two year periods 1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2003-2004 and 2005-2006.</p>

  <p>The sample sizes for Glasgow Maryhill parliamentary constituency over the two year periods are reasonable, but the survey is not designed to give representative results at parliamentary constituency level. Therefore, the figures presented below should be interpreted with caution.</p>

  <p>Scotland level figures for the same two year periods are included as a reference.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the announcement made by the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills giving a guarantee, the Higher Education Student Support Guarantee, that recipients of the educational maintenance allowance will know what student support they would be entitled to receive prior to applying to university, what plans the Executive has to introduce a similar initiative.</p>

  <p>This is part of the announcement made by the Secretary of State for Innovation, Universities and Skills on 5 July 2007. There are currently no plans to introduce a similar guarantee in Scotland but we will examine the proposals.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will continue to support the 2009 Year of Homecoming.</p>

  <p>This Government&rsquo;s primary aim is sustainable economic growth right across Scotland, and we see Scottish tourism playing a key role in achieving that aim. As part of that aim we are committed to making Homecoming Scotland a success.</p>

  <p>We will work with tourism businesses which share that ambition to grow revenues, with VisitScotland, EventScotland and the enterprise agencies collaborating to attract more visitors to Scotland through world class marketing and innovative product development. Homecoming Scotland in 2009 will play an important part in stimulating tourism growth, reaching out to people all over the world who feel an affinity with Scotland, including but not limited to the Scottish diaspora. We will use the interest which these affinity Scots have in Ancestral Tourism, Robert Burns, Golf, Whisky and the Scottish enlightenment to motivate them to come to Scotland in 2009 for an inspirational celebration of Scotland&rsquo;s many great contributions to the world.</p>
