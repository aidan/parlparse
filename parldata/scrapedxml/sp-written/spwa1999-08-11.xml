  <p>Meat products are defined in EC law and the labelling requirements are largely harmonised at EC level. These requirements are implemented in Scotland by the Food Labelling Regulations 1996. They require that the particulars of country of origin or provenance be provided on a label if failure to give such particulars might mislead the purchaser to a material degree as to the true origin or provenance of the food. Meat products can contain a variety of ingredients, many of which will not derive from Scotland (for example herbs and spices). It is not therefore appropriate to label meat products in the way suggested.</p>

  <p>It is for the Scottish Ambulance Service and Tayside Health Board to determine the level and configuration of emergency ambulance service provision across the Tayside Health Board area. This is being looked at as part of a wider review of Acute Services that is being carried out by the Health Board in consultation with the Scottish Ambulance Service, local hospitals, general practitioners, the health council and service users.</p>

  <p>Neither the Treaty of Rome nor the rules of the World Trade Organisation allow Scotland to ban the import of meat products that have not been produced to the same husbandry standards as required here.</p>

  <p>However, a new EC Directive, agreed in June 1998 and which must be implemented by the end of this year, will encourage a more level playing field by requiring minimum standards on welfare, inspection, feeding etc for all farmed animals.</p>

  <p>That same Directive also recognises the importance of widening consensus on animals welfare, requiring the European Commission to produce a report comparing EU welfare conditions with those of third country suppliers.</p>

  <p>At present there are no weight restrictions on bridges which are the responsibility of the Scottish Executive. The assessment of 4 structures has still to be completed. Out of a total of 1024 bridges in the trunk road assessment programme, 94 did not pass the initial assessment. It is expected that many of these will pass when reassessed using more sophisticated techniques. Replacement or strengthening of the remainder will be programmed over a number of years on a prioritised basis in line with available funding. In the interim it is unlikely that any of these bridges will need to be weight restricted.</p>

  <p>Information about bridges on the local road network is not held centrally since responsibility for their maintenance rests with individual Councils as local roads authorities.</p>
