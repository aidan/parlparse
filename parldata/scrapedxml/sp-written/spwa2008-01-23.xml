  <p>Success will ultimately be determined by the experiences of children and families in how help is co-ordinated and delivered to them, how they are involved in these decisions and what the improvements in children&rsquo;s outcomes are. This will form part of the evaluation process on which we expect an interim report this spring. However, considerable progress has been made in implementing Getting it right for every child (GIRFEC) both in the pathfinder areas and in moving the agenda forward nationally. The pathfinders for children and young people experiencing domestic abuse and their project boards have been established and training of staff is underway in the new approach and forms, building on the work in Highland and in the National Domestic Abuse Delivery Group. Children and families have been engaged in the development of materials and protocols. In Highland, business processes have been streamlined. Guidance has been prepared, including a model for assessment of needs and risk and is being used in the training of staff initially in Inverness and subsequently across Highland. Since June 2007, revised procedures based on the GIRFEC approach there have resulted in 70% of children brought to the attention of the police for non-offending issues having their needs met other than by referral to the reporter. Nationally, we are promoting a Learning Community to enable areas to share and exchange experiences and have established a communication network to underpin this. All of these are milestones in some of the work streams needed to implement the GIRFEC approach.</p>

  <p>Whilst local government had flexibility to allocate other resources to this area, the specific amounts allocated to local government to support pilot initiatives aimed at improving the educational attainment of looked after children from 2003 to 2007 were as follows:</p>

  <p>2003-04: Nil</p>

  <p>2004-05: Nil</p>

  <p>2006-07: &pound;2,466,549.</p>

  <p>Some spending on children and young people will have been subsumed within budgets that covered services to people of all ages &ndash; e.g. community health &ndash; and as such, it is not possible to identify the total budget for children and young people over this period. It is not therefore possible to present this as a percentage of the budget for children and young people.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the Deputy First Minister and Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing&rsquo;s ministerial statement on health strategy on 12 December 2007, whether it will include Clydebank in the pilot scheme for a nurse-led minor injuries clinic.</p>

  <p>The <em>Better Health, Better Care Action Plan</em> which I announced on 12 December 2007 sets out our commitment to improve access to health care services. This includes a pilot to provide walk-in access to a range of primary care services, such as nurse-led minor injury clinics and simple diagnostic tests, through community pharmacies. These will be available during normal pharmacy hours and, in some cases, extended to include out-of-hours periods such as evenings, Saturdays and Sundays.</p>

  <p>The pilot will take place in five NHS board areas: NHS Grampian, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, NHS Lanarkshire, NHS Lothian and NHS Tayside. We will agree the locations of pilot sites with each board but the focus in the first instance will be major commuter points and shopping areas. We expect all pilot sites will be up and running by the end of March 2008.</p>

  <p>The pilot sites will be subject to on-going evaluation to determine how best community pharmacy walk-in service models could be applied in other areas; the sustainability of community pharmacy walk-in services and any future development of walk-in services.</p>

  <p>The funding of services for those suffering from Huntington&rsquo;s disease is a matter for NHS boards.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government values the services which the Scottish Huntington&rsquo;s Association provides for those living with the condition, and their families and carers, as well as the professionals involved in their care. These exemplify the good working relationships between the third sector and statutory agencies which we described in the Better Health, Better Care Action Plan, and which need to underpin our general approach to the management of all long-term conditions.</p>

  <p>There are good examples of constructive partnerships between NHS boards and the association delivering services for those of their resident populations who have Huntington&rsquo;s disease, and I would expect all NHS boards to follow those examples.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government, through the Section 16b of the voluntary grant scheme, is currently committed to a three year funding scheme with the Scottish Huntington&rsquo;s Association. The total allocation for the grant is &pound;60,000.</p>

  <p>The current HEAT target, agreed with NHS boards and local authorities, is to eliminate all inappropriate delays outwith the six week discharge planning period by April 2008. Following that we expect that to be maintained as a standard, thereby ensuring no patient is inappropriately delayed in hospital for more than six weeks.</p>

  <p>There have been no such discussions at ministerial level. The Scottish Government will be looking to engage with national governments to place Scotland as a nation rather than a region, but we will continue to cooperate with EU regions in areas where there is sufficient interest, goodwill and mutual benefit. We are currently developing a European Strategy which will include the Scottish Government&rsquo;s engagement with our European partners.</p>

  <p>1. The information requested is given in tables 1 to 5 of <em>Destinations of graduates from Scottish universities: 2002-03 to 2005-06</em>, a copy of which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 44474).</p>

  <p>2. The Destinations of Leavers from Higher Education (DLHE) is a voluntary annual survey conducted by Higher Education Statistics Agency (HESA) of all graduates and their destinations six months after graduation. The data contained within the survey refers only to those graduates who responded to the survey.</p>

  <p>3. The coverage of the DLHE survey is limited to qualifiers of UK and other European Union (EU) domicile<a name="footnote3" id="footnote3"></a>. It excludes those domiciled outside the EU. Qualifiers from part-time study programmes are included.</p>

  <p>For DLHE in 2005-06 there were 262,635 valid responses in the UK from a possible total of 350,995 qualifiers from full-time programmes, a percentage with known destinations of 74.8% (2004-05: 76.0%; 2003-04: 77.3%). There were 65,120 valid responses from a possible total of 94,920 qualifiers from part-time programmes, a percentage with known destinations of 68.6% (67.5%; 68.2%). In total there were 327,760 valid responses from 445,910 qualifiers, giving a survey-wide figure of 73.5% (74.2%; 75.5%). There is no evidence that response numbers from Scottish universities are different.</p>

  <p>Funds recovered using the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 will be reinvested to create an exciting programme of activities for young people throughout Scotland. Particular attention will be paid to those communities that have suffered most from crime. The organisations charged with delivering the activities, such as the Scottish Football Association, have committed to work with the Police Service and Community Safety Partnerships to identify these communities. It will be for those agencies to make this assessment but it is likely to utilise a mixture of local and national statistics including those published as part of the Recorded Crime in Scotland 2006-07 statistical bulletin.</p>

  <p>The eHealth budget funds a number of key national systems supporting the operation of NHS Scotland, such as Screening Programmes, General Practice IT systems and the communications infrastructure. In addition, it supports boards in making the changes to IT which will underpin the wider improvements signalled in Better Health, Better Care; such as 18 weeks and improvements to the management of long-term conditions. The priorities for future improvement will be set out in a new eHealth Strategy scheduled for the spring of 2008.</p>

  <p>A reduction of &pound;12.5 million per annum, unless the shortfall was made up by NHS boards from their general allocations, would mean a reduction in existing services and commitments in both 2008-09 and 2009-10. In 2010-11 it would reduce the scope for the new eHealth Strategy to enable the improvements in patient care to which we are committed.</p>

  <p>The preferred option proposes the involvement of an independent expert panel at beginning of the public engagement process when a board is beginning to gather evidence and develop options for consultation. The panel would assess the information and evidence available, and ensure that the full range of safe and sustainable options were being identified and evaluated in a clear and transparent way.</p>

  <p>The panel&rsquo;s report would be published before the formal consultation stage, and the board would be required to reflect its conclusions in the final proposal for public consultation.

  <p>We place great importance on public involvement in the design and delivery of NHS services and this is reflected in our recently published <em>Better Health Better Care Action Plan</em> which puts the interests of those who use the services at the heart of all that we do to improve health and health care in Scotland. The action plan is available at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/12/13102832/0" target="_blank"> http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/12/13102832/0</a> .</p>

  <p>The independent scrutiny panel which considered revised proposals for service change in Ayrshire and Lanarkshire was established after a period of extensive public consultation which clearly identified that the public&rsquo;s view was that Accident and Emergency services should be retained at Ayr and Monklands Hospitals. Consequently, the priority for the panel was to deliver robust scrutiny and engagement whilst minimising delays and uncertainty around these services.</p>

  <p>Care home providers are required by regulations to ensure that staff employed in the care home receive training appropriate to the work they are to perform. <em>The</em> <em>National Care Standards - Care Homes for Older People </em> also require that the care which residents receive is provided by management and staff whose professional training and expertise allows them to meet the residents&rsquo; needs. The Care Commission as the national regulator of care services ensures that regulations and Standards are met.</p>

  <p>Qualifications criteria for registration by the Scottish Social Services Council take account of the roles undertaken by managers and the skills they require. Recognised qualifications must meet the principles of integration of practice and learning, be recognised within the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework (SCQF), and underpin a knowledge and value base that is consistent with the Code of Practice for Social Service Workers. Once registered a worker will be required to undertake Post Registration Training and Learning to maintain and update their skills and knowledge</p>

  <p>I have no current plans to meet with Aberdeen City Council to discuss the proposed swimming pool in Aberdeen.</p>

  <p>Sportscotland has accepted an invitation to join the project board, which has been set up to take forward the swimming pool proposal and a meeting has been scheduled for 28 January.</p>

  <p>The majority of jobs will be relocated to Glasgow, it is anticipated that approximately:</p>

  <p>80 to 100 jobs will go to Glasgow</p>

  <p>30 to 35 jobs will remain in Edinburgh</p>

  <p>five to 10 jobs will go to Aberdeen</p>

  <p>five to 10 jobs will go to Stirling.</p>

  <p>It should be noted these figures are indicative and illustrative and final numbers will not be available until meetings with sportscotland&rsquo;s management team, human resources team and staff are complete.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the Minister for Communities and Sport&rsquo;s ministerial statement on the future of sportscotland on 9 January 2008, what the overall costs will be of the relocation and dispersal of sportscotland&rsquo;s staff to the Glasgow, Edinburgh, Stirling and Aberdeen hubs.</p>

  <p>The previous Executive&rsquo;s plan for the relocation of sportscotland is estimated at a cost of &pound;15 million at today&rsquo;s prices. No money was identified in the previous administration&rsquo;s budget to cover the costs of this relocation.</p>

  <p>The cost of sportscotland&rsquo;s relocation will now be approximately &pound;7.9 million. However, it is intended to sell Caledonia House, sportscotland&rsquo;s headquarters, the current market price of which is approximately between &pound;4 to &pound;6 million. Sportscotland will retain the receipts from this sale to re-invest in sport.</p>

  <p>However, it will not possible to provide exact and final figures until the process has been completed. The final figures will be released as soon as they become available.</p>
