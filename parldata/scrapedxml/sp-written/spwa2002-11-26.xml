  <p>As advised in the answer given to question S1W-26106 on 24 June 2002, about the Executive&#8217;s support for CCTV, Community Safety Partnerships can allocate resources from their annual allocations from the award programme to both the capital and current element of CCTV in their areas if they choose to do so.</p>

  <p>I understand that an application for CCTV has been submitted by a community group in West Renfrewshire to the Rural Challenge Fund, one of the three elements that make up the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund, and that the Environment and Rural Affairs Department is currently in the process of assessing all bids received including that one, with ministers&#8217; decisions expected to be announced in January 2003.</p>

  <p>The Executive wrote to Chief Executives of Local Councils and Chief Constables on 30 October 2002 advising them that Scottish ministers have agreed to allocate additional funding of &#163;2 million within the current financial year 2002-03, to extend, improve, integrate and modernise existing CCTV systems in their areas and to assist police forces in Scotland to introduce Automatic Number Plate Recognition Systems technology linked to the CCTV systems as a crime prevention initiative to combat serious crime, improve crime management and enhance criminal intelligence. Local councils are co-ordinating the applications which they must submit by 29 November 2002. However, new "stand-alone" systems will only be considered if councils can demonstrate that these systems will be, or are part of, a strategy which has or aims to have all systems operating in the area integrated and monitored from the same station.</p>

  <p>We were aware, prior to publication of the British Lung Foundation study, that cannabis carries potentially serious health risks, including risks posed by levels of carcinogenic tars, gases and chemicals which exceed those found in tobacco.</p>

  <p>As part of our Drugs Communications Strategy, we published, in July, a <i>Know the Score</i> booklet on cannabis. The booklet sets out the legal position in Scotland, and the risks to physical and mental health associated with this drug. The text already makes it clear that smoking cannabis may be more harmful than smoking tobacco, since cannabis has a higher concentration of certain chemicals which can cause cancer. We printed 45,000 leaflets, and it is now being reprinted to meet demand. We will also publish a shorter version, perhaps credit-card sized, aimed specifically at young people.</p>

  <p>The free and confidential Know the Score Informationline can also provide advice on cannabis, and information can be accessed on the Know the Score website.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>For internal purposes, reports of job losses by companies, local enterprise companies and newspapers are monitored. However, the Executive cannot vouch for the accuracy and completeness of this information and therefore does not consider that it should form the basis of a response to the question.</p>

  <p>The funding to run the business activities of the General Register Office (GROS) for Scotland is given by the Scottish Executive to GROS, which in turn allocates funding to a number of business areas within the department. Records Enterprise is a branch of GROS. Its remit is to make available public records about individuals to customers, including genealogists. It does so by giving access to records held by the Registrar General which are open to the public, and charging for searching and for copies of the records in line with the statutory fees. Prices are set to recover the costs of Records Enterprise.</p>

  <p>Section 96 of the Crime and Disorder Act provides that, where it is proved that any offence was racially aggravated, that aggravation should be taken into account in sentencing. A guide to those provisions was issued by the then Scottish Office Home Department on 25 September 1998. The guidance made it clear that in cases involving racial aggravation the judge, whilst sentencing, would be expected to impose a higher sentence within the maximum available.</p>

  <p>The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service pursue a robust prosecution policy in cases of racist crime and area procurators fiscal are personally responsible for monitoring its implementation. In the last year prosecutors received 1,315 cases from the police which either included charges of racially aggravated harassment and behaviour or separate statutory racial aggravations. Proceedings which included either a statutory charge or aggravation were taken by procurators fiscal in 95% of these cases.</p>

  <p>The first annual report of the strategy referred to St&ograve;rlann &#8211; a national resource for Gaelic teaching materials. In 1999-2000 the Executive provided &#163;80,000 to St&ograve;rlann; in 2000-01 &#163;120,000, in 2001-02 &#163;145,000, and in 2002-03 &#163;160,000.</p>

  <p>I can also report that since 1999 the Scottish Arts Council has granted a total of &#163;2,312,392 towards education resources designed to encourage language diversity in Scots and Gaelic.

  <p>Further support of resources encouraging language diversity and learning is evidenced in the Executive&#8217;s specific funding of Gaelic-medium education, modern language teaching resources, and of Glasgow&#8217;s International Language School: &#163;7,902,000; &#163;1,145,532, and &#163;962,000 respectively covering the three-year period from April 1999 to March 2002.</p>

  <p>As stated in the first annual report of Scotland&#8217;s National Cultural Strategy, published October 2001, the Executive considered the proposal to establish such a group in light of a commitment in the Executive&#8217;s Equality Strategy&#8217;s to develop consultation methods acceptable to minority ethnic communities, and also in light of the Equal Futures Project and November 2001 conference. The Executive is exploring ways to develop more effective consultation and dialogue with minority ethnic communities. In the meantime we have concluded that the best approach is to pursue the Equal Futures Project. This aims to bring together children and young people to explore issues of identity, ethnicity and culture, and address racism, empowering all Scotland&#8217;s young people to celebrate the positive benefits of a multi-cultural society. To support this, the Executive has invested &#163;150,000 in the project over a two-year period, to March 2004.</p>

  <p>As reported in the National Cultural Strategy Annual report 2002, the New Opportunities Fund award of &#163;4 million to Resource for Learning in Scotland, a consortium of the National Library of Scotland, the National Archives of Scotland, the Scottish Resource Access Network, and over 100 Scottish archives and libraries will create tens of thousands of newly digitised multimedia resources. The Scottish Library and Information Council (SLIC) has also funded digitisation programmes in Perth, East Dunbartonshire and the Royal Botanic Garden. The Ayrshire Libraries Forum, with SLIC funding, is developing a collaborative framework for the procurement of generic Scottish material. SLIC has also established a group to "bookmark" websites covering a wide range of subjects including Scottish material.

  <p>This is a matter for individual roads authorities. Section 131 of the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991(the act) gives roads authorities powers, in the event of a failure by a utility company to reinstate the road properly, to issue a notice to the utility company requiring it to carry out remedial works within a prescribed period. Should this notice not be complied with, the authority may carry out the necessary works and recover the costs reasonably incurred by them in doing so.</p>

  <p>Additionally, section 130 of the act requires that a utility company executing road works shall, in reinstating the road, comply with such requirements as may be prescribed by the road authority as to the specification of materials to be used and the standards of workmanship to be observed. This specification is currently contained in the <i>Specification for the Reinstatement of Openings in Highways Code of Practice</i>. Failure to comply with section 130 is an offence which, on summary conviction, is liable to a fine not exceeding level 3 (&#163;1,000) on the standard scale.</p>

  <p>The impact on voluntary organisations of the introduction of criminal record checks under Part V of the Police Act 1997 was examined by the Voluntary Issues Review Group set up by the Scottish Executive in 1999. YouthLink Scotland was represented on the Group.</p>

  <p>The group&#8217;s principal recommendation was that volunteers working with children (up to the age of 18) in the voluntary sector should be able to get criminal record certificates without cost to them or to the voluntary organisations concerned. The group also recommended that a Central Registered Body should be established to process applications for free checks and to provide guidance and advice for the voluntary sector to help the sector make the best possible use of the Part V certificates. Ministers accepted both these recommendations and agreed to make available the necessary funding to cover the costs of implementing them.</p>
