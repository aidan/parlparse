  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action has been taken to ensure that the repeated large-scale release of pheasants and red-legged partridges into the countryside poses no harm to local flora and fauna and what consultations have taken place with the European Commission regarding these practices, as required by Article 11 of the 2009 EU Directive on the conservation of wild birds.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will consider any evidence of significant damage to flora and fauna resulting from releases of pheasants or red-legged partridges. Scottish Natural Heritage is responsible for monitoring the condition of designated sites which protect many of Scotland&rsquo;s most important flora and fauna, including identifying any activities which appeared to be having a negative impact on the condition of such sites.</p>

  <p>Article 11 of the EU Directive on Conservation of Wild Birds (79/409/EEC) is concerned with the introduction of any species of bird which do not occur naturally in the wild state in the European territory of the member states and does not therefore apply to pheasants and red-legged partridges.</p>

  <p>The review of the Care Commission&rsquo;s complaints procedure is a matter for the commission. Under the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 the commission is required to establish a complaints procedure to deal with complaints about care service provision and complaints about how the Care Commission undertakes its work. The commission must keep the procedure under review, varying it as and when appropriate, in accordance with the 2001 act. The procedure and any variation must be approved by Scottish Ministers. The complaints procedure which currently applies was approved by Scottish Ministers in 2004.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action is being taken by (a) the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, (b) Scottish National Heritage and (c) Scottish Water to restrict the sites where Japanese knotweed and giant hogweed are prevalent and reduce their spread.</p>

  <p>A brief summary of actions being taken by these three bodies in relation to Japanese knotweed and giant hogweed is as follows:</p>

  <p>(a) The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) is responsible for co-ordinating River Basin Management Plans required under the Water Framework Directive. The plans are required to identify measures which will prevent deterioration or which will improve the ecological condition of a waterbody and may therefore include measures for management of invasive non-native species where these are or are likely to become deleterious to ecological condition. SEPA may also fund projects including control of bankside and instream plant species (where these impact on morphological aspects of the waterbody) through their restoration fund. In addition, SEPA have produced guidance for waste management operators on the on-site management of Japanese knotweed and associated contaminated soils.</p>

  <p>(b) Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) takes action to control Japanese knotweed and giant hogweed and other invasive non-native plants in National Nature Reserves. Where designated land (Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and Special Areas of Conservation (SACs)) is affected by these species, particularly where the effects are such that the site is in consequence classified as being in unfavourable condition, SNH seeks to encourage land managers to put in place appropriate management to control or eradicate these species. In addition, SNH supports other actions to control invasive non-native plants thorough awareness raising and training events, including the Sharing Good Practice programme, as well as working closely with other agencies, utilities managers and the construction industry.</p>

  <p>(c) Scottish Water aims to deal with Japanese knotweed and giant hogweed in carrying out capital projects as well as in the course of undertaking operational and maintenance work.</p>

  <p>During the 2010 UK General Election campaign all Scottish Government civil servants are bound by guidance on their role and conduct during the election period (the date between the commencement of the campaign period and the election). The full guidance can be found at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/04/UKElectionGuidance" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2010/04/UKElectionGuidance</a> .</p>

  <p>In line with this guidance, no civil servant is involved in statements relating to the party political aspects of the election. A civil servant could be involved if the First Minister were commenting on the impact on Scottish Government responsibilities of proposals made by participants in the election.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will review the National Health Service (Pharmaceutical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2009 to take account of situations where dispensing GP practices in rural areas have no representation on their Area Pharmaceutical Committee and no account might be taken by it of the impact on a GP practice of the loss of dispensing income, as is the case with Newcastleton GP practice.</p>

  <p>The National Health Service (Pharmaceutical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2009 state that, when an application is made to a Health Board to open a community pharmacy in its area, its Area Pharmaceutical Committee and its Area Medical Committee must be notified, and that they may make written representations to that Board and their Pharmacy Practices Committee. It is the Pharmacy Practices Committee which considers such applications on behalf of the Board. As part of that process, GPs, including dispensing GPs, can make their views known through the Area Medical Committee.</p>

  <p>It is not possible under the current legislative framework to allow a Health Board&rsquo;s Pharmacy Practices Committee to take into account the financial effect on dispensing GP practices in cases where an application to open a pharmacy in the area is successful. This would require amendment to a number of pieces of legislation, including the National Health Service (Scotland) Act 1978. Our current consultation <em>Review of the Control of Entry Arrangements</em>, published on 22 March 2010, is looking at the National Health Service (Pharmaceutical Services) (Scotland) Regulations 2009. Any further views on these issues are welcome.</p>

  <p>There is not a centrally held budget for the Better Together inpatient survey fieldwork. The Better Together inpatient survey fieldwork was commissioned individually by each NHS board in Scotland. Each individual NHS board therefore has their own budget for the survey. However, we will be collating costs of running the inpatients survey from each NHSScotland health board later this year.</p>

  <p>Edinburgh is a safe city and initiatives such as the Edinburgh Violence Reduction Programme enable partners to work together to make the city even safer. For example, the number of homicides in Edinburgh in 2008-09 was at the lowest recorded level in 20 years. Recent analysis carried out by Lothian and Borders Police found that the overall number of incidents involving a knife was low in comparison to some other parts of the country, but that in Edinburgh as a whole, areas in the north of the city had a higher number of incidents of criminal use and possession of knives and bladed articles.</p>

  <p>Lothian and Borders Police use an intelligence-led policing model to target resources on those most likely to be carrying and using weapons. We know from local performance information that this approach has contributed to a 33% reduction in crimes involving the possession of offensive weapons in Edinburgh in 2009-10 compared to 2006-07.</p>

  <p>Sentencing in individual cases is entirely a matter for the sentencing judge, who hears all the facts and circumstances surrounding the offence and the offender, and is able to take into account any factors which he or she considers to be relevant.</p>

  <p>An increasing number of people who are caught carrying knives are being convicted and are receiving custodial sentences and the length of those sentences is also increasing &ndash; in the last two years jail terms for knife carrying have increased by two thirds. The courts have the powers needed to impose substantial sentences of up four years for possession and, should a judge weigh up the circumstances and decide that a four-year sentence is appropriate, he or she will go ahead and impose it.</p>

  <p>The overall decrease in crimes of handling an offensive weapon of 11% since 2006-07 indicates that this tough approach, combined with record investment in<strong> </strong>violence reduction initiatives and action on knife crime, is having a positive impact on knife crime on our streets.</p>

  <p><span lang=""><strong>Kenny MacAskill: </strong>Parliament agreed that violent offenders who would fall within the Multi Agency Public Protection Arrangements (MAPPA) must have been convicted on indictment of an offence inferring personal violence and be subject to a Probation Order or subject to statutory supervision on release from prison. In framing the legislation, stakeholders secured an undertaking to ensure that before MAPPA was extended to this group of offenders, the Risk Management Authority would develop an agreed approach to assessing the risk of harm posed by violent offenders. This work is underway.</span></p>

  <p>We have also accepted the recommendations in the report of the Multi-agency Inspection: Assessing and managing offenders who present a high risk of serious harm 2009, which notes that the first priority in relation to violent offenders is to build up the capacity of individual agencies to manage risk more effectively and consistently.

  <p>The Scottish Government has no current plans to publish such a report.

  <p>Part 2 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003, which allows rural communities in Scotland the opportunity to register a pre-emptive right to buy land, provides a mechanism to address patterns of private land ownership.</p>

  <p>Enhance connectivity between the main centres of business on each side of the Border served by this route for the mutual benefit of the Scottish and UK economies, and</p>

  <p>The efficiency saving of &pound;0.7 million for the Rural Payments and Inspections Directorate (RPID) was achieved mainly through two measures. The first was the implementation of a &quot;multifunctional&quot; approach to farm inspections whereby multiple inspections for different purposes were consolidated into a single task for inspectors. This approach reduced the number of visits required for inspections and the overall workload for this activity. The second was the ongoing promotion of the option for scheme applicants to use the online version using the Single Application Form rather than the paper form. The usage of the online form increased from 17% to 24% of all applications between 2007-08 and 2008-09. This reduced the workload for administration staff in RPID&rsquo;s area offices who are engaged in entering the data on paper forms into the computer system.</p>

  <p>The savings were realised as cash savings in that there was a reduction over the year of around 7% in staff numbers for both inspections staff and administration staff in RPID&rsquo;s area offices.</p>

  <p>Voluntary modulation has been permitted by European rules since 1999. Modulation is the transfer of EU CAP funds from Pillar 1 (market support expenditure and single farm payments) to Pillar 2 (rural development and agri-environmental schemes). Since 2005, modulation has applied on a compulsory basis in member states, and in 2007 agreement was secured to enable the UK and Portugal to continue to levy an additional (voluntary) national rate of modulation, over and above the compulsory EU rate.</p>

  <p>The efficiency saving of &pound;35.7 million returned in the Efficiency Outturn Report for 2008-09 is the value of the transfer of funding through voluntary modulation from Pillar 1 to Pillar 2. As set out in the report, the efficiencies were achieved without material detriment to the quality or quantity of service provided, which was maintained through delivery of agri-environmental benefits under cross compliance rules in Pillar 1.</p>

  <p>Therefore the introduction of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s delivery of public benefits through the Single Farm Payment has been unaffected. The resources freed up through voluntary modulation were used to support a number of important commitments, most notably under the Rural Priorities delivery mechanism of the Scotland Rural Development Programme<em>.</em></p>

  <p>The Fisheries Research Services achieved &pound;0.793 million efficiency savings in 2008-09 through more effective asset management, accessing wider Scottish Government arrangements for the provision of services, rationalising internal processes and procedures and more effective procurement.</p>

  <p>As a consequence of the Rowett Research Institute merging with the University of Aberdeen the Scottish Government no longer has to make financial provision of &pound;2 million annually for depreciation and cost of capital charges for the Rowett. This accounting change has not affected the volume of research undertaken by the Rowett for the Scottish Government.</p>

  <p>The efficiency savings arise entirely from the securing of co-funding for research projects while obtaining 100% of the contract outputs.</p>
