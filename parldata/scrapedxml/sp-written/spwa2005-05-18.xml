  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the Operational Research Consultancy (ORCON) standards have been for the Scottish Ambulance Service in each year since 1999, broken down by NHS board area.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-05-18.5.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80057" speakername="Mr Andy Kerr" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0518.htm#2">

  <p>Prior to the introduction of the priority-based dispatch system which rolled out across mainland Scotland between August 2002 and April 2004, 999 emergency calls to the Scottish Ambulance Service were dealt with on a &quot;first come first served&quot; basis. The speed of response depended not on the condition of the patient but on the volume of calls being responded to and the ambulance resources available at the time. The performance standards applied by the Scottish Ambulance Service varied according to population density &ndash; as with other ambulance services in the United Kingdom. These are known as the ORCON standards. In Scotland, to ensure that the standards reflected local demography, they were applied based on local authority areas. The standards were:</p>

  <p>High Density (more than 3.0 persons per acre) &ndash; 50% of calls to be responded to within seven minutes and 95% within 14 minutes;</p>

  <p>Medium Density (less than 3.0 but more than 0.5 persons per acre) &ndash; 50% of calls to be responded to within eight minutes and 95% within 18 minutes;</p>

  <p>Sparse Density (less than 0.5 persons per acre) &ndash; 50% of calls to be responded to in eight minutes and 95% within 21 minutes.</p>

  <p>Under the priority based dispatch system, which is used in all mainland board areas, 999 emergency calls are processed using well proven, clinically approved, screen based software (called Automatic Medical Priority Dispatch System). Based on the responses of the caller, the software assigns the call a response category. The categories and standards applied are:</p>

  <p>Category A &ndash; clinically defined as &quot;immediately life threatening&quot;. The target is that by March 2008, 75% of such calls should be responded to within eight minutes across mainland Scotland. The ambulance service has phased the introduction of priority based dispatch and is progressing towards this target.</p>

  <p>Category B &ndash; clinically defined as &quot;not life threatening but still serious&quot;. The target for this category of calls is that 95% should be responded to within either 14, 19 or 21 minutes depending on the population density of the health board.</p>

  <p>The ambulance service continues to apply ORCON standards to their responses to calls from NHS Western Isles, NHS Shetland and NHS Orkney.</p>

  <p>The term &quot;grey boats&quot; (or &quot;grey vessels&quot;), as the Executive understands it, refers to boats or ships which have a naval/military function. Defence is a matter reserved to UK Ministers and, as such, the Executive does not have any responsibility for &quot;grey boats&quot;.</p>

  <p>It should be noted that Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency patrol boats are civilian vessels which have no military role or capacity.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive has carried out other activities overseas to promote specific employment opportunities. For example, the Executive&rsquo;s teacher recruitment campaign has undertaken advertising in targeted press in England. In addition, promotional material for the campaign was made available at the Fresh Talent stands at the careers fairs in Poland in March, and an official from the Executive&rsquo;s Teachers&rsquo; Division has appeared on Polish television to promote teaching in Scotland as a career. Scottish Development International and Talent Scotland have also undertaken considerable overseas activity to promote job opportunities in Scotland.</p>

  <p>To date, the Relocation Advisory Service has received over 1,000 enquiries from Poland. As Poland is a member of the European Union, individuals do not need to apply for a work permit to take up employment in the United Kingdom. They are therefore not eligible for the Fresh Talent: Working in Scotland scheme which is designed to assist nationalities who are subject to work permit requirements.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-15849 by Mr Tom McCabe on 5 May 2005, why Poland was selected for promotion of the Fresh Talent initiative; whether there are plans to conduct similar promotional activities in other European countries and, if so, in which countries and when the promotional activities will take place.</p>

  <p>We selected Poland as an early target for our Fresh Talent promotional activity as it was the largest of the EU Accession States, and from the evidence available, had a large and skilled pool of workers who might be interested in coming to work in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We are currently evaluating our early promotional activity, with a view to reaching decisions about future activity, including whether to include other European countries in our future plans.</p>

  <p>One of the most significant effects of endometriosis is infertility and the Executive has taken forward work on infertility services through the report of the Expert Advisory Group on Infertility Services in Scotland. The Executive has reviewed criteria for access to services and will report on this over the next few weeks.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist has funded a research project at the University of Aberdeen on the relationship between endometrial proteins and endometriosis.</p>

  <p>We have assisted voluntary organisations in identifying relevant sources of funding for which they can apply.</p>

  <p>In relation to the professional guidelines developed by the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, we expect all bodies within NHS boards with responsibility for clinical governance to have regard for clinical guidelines.</p>

  <p>The latest available information on unoccupied dwellings comes from council tax billing systems as at 6 September 2004. This indicates that there were a total of 109,591 unoccupied dwellings in Scotland. Houses can be empty for various reasons. The figure quoted covers both the social-rented and private sectors and includes second homes, holiday lets and dwellings awaiting improvement or demolition.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive continues to pursue a range of initiatives to bring empty properties back into use. Local authorities are required to produce local housing strategies to tackle the housing problems in their areas. This can include assessing the need for action on empty homes if it is a priority for their area. The Empty Homes Initiative returned around 1,400 properties between 1997 and 2002. Communities Scotland is responsible for the Rural Empty Properties Grant and Lead Tenancies Empty Property Lease Scheme which also supports the letting or re-occupation of empty houses. Empty houses in the local authority and housing association sectors will be addressed, whether through demolitions or improvements through Scottish Housing Quality Standard delivery plans. We are also encouraging public sector landlords to minimise transitional vacancies through efficient letting processes.</p>

  <p>Meeting the clinical needs of all patients in Lothian is the responsibility of Lothian NHS Board. Among the recommendations arising from NHS Lothian&rsquo;s recent public consultation on proposals for acute hospital services, services for older people and mental health services, is the replacement of the Royal Edinburgh Hospital. As part of the replacement programme, NHS Lothian plans to move acute adult inpatient mental health services to new facilities on the Royal Edinburgh site and to St John&rsquo;s Hospital in Livingston.</p>

  <p>Major changes are also planned in East Lothian, which will result in a new Haddington Hospital, to replace the existing buildings at Roodlands and Herdmanflat. There will, of course, be community mental health services in place before the acute services are closed.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to provide a cost per prisoner place for each public prison as there are a number of significant costs which are met centrally for SPS as a whole. The annual running cost of private prisons and the annual average cost per prisoner place are given in the SPS Annual Report and Accounts for 2002-2003 and 2003-2004 copies of which are available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (references SE/2003/190 and SE/2004/131 respectively) or via the Scottish Prison Service website <a href="http://www.sps.gov.uk/keydocs" target="_blank">http://www.sps.gov.uk/keydocs</a>.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally for Aberdeenshire. The only figures that are available to the Department are those from the local health board NHS Grampian. NHS Grampian covers three local authority areas: Aberdeenshire; Aberdeen City, and Moray.</p>

  <p>However, the department is aware of the difficulties that some NHS boards are experiencing in securing some specialist professional staff to undertake the various duties within the health service across whole of Scotland. These workforce shortages are being addressed rigorously and NHS boards as employers are pursing several initiatives on behalf of the health service that will make the NHS in Scotland, as an exemplar employer, an attractive career option so to recruit and retain more staff.</p>
