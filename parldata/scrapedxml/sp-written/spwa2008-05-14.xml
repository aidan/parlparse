  <p>The budget for road safety advertising in 2008-09 has not yet been determined. However, the focus in 2008-09 is on rural road driving and the safety issues surrounding this. Where possible, advertising will support drink drive messages but until the budgets are set, the amount of support is unknown at this time. Non-paid for media will be used where possible, with the aim of maintaining a high-level of public awareness of the issue.</p>

  <p>In addition, Road Safety Scotland&rsquo;s budget includes &pound;60,000 for publicity in support of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland enforcement campaigns, some of which focus on drink driving.</p>

  <p>Before the appointment of the panel which produced the Sullivan Report, officials consulted with the Energy Saving Trust, Friends of the Earth, Energy Action Scotland, Sustainable Development Commission, WWF and the Carbon Trust. These stakeholders were invited to consider issues for the built environment which needed to be addressed by the panel and some also suggested appropriate candidates for membership. Meetings took place during July and August 2007 and all stakeholders highlighted the importance of addressing the need to reduce emissions from existing buildings as part of the wider issue of improving the energy performance and reducing the carbon dioxide emissions of Scotland&rsquo;s buildings.</p>

  <p>We are not planning any changes to the remit and operations of Scottish Development International (SDI) beyond the internal restructuring that is already underway.</p>

  <p>We are, however, raising the level of ambition for what SDI can do for Scotland. <em>The Government Economic Strategy</em> sets out how we will focus government and public services, including SDI, on creating a more successful country through increasing sustainable economic growth.</p>

  <p>Ministers also routinely join SDI professionals during parliamentary recess, and for example, in supporting events such as Scotland Week, to help promote Scotland and Scottish companies.</p>

  <p>No. The remit of the study into road equivalent tariff does not include an assessment of the future use of public service obligations. The aim of the study is to consider the impact of a reduction in the cost of ferry travel in Scotland by setting ferry fares at a road equivalent tariff.</p>

Our internal review of these programmes is nearing completion and we will share its outcomes with the Parliament shortly.</p>

  <p>Higher fuel prices represent a significant cost burden upon rural communities and businesses; such as agriculture, the road haulage industry and the wider economy. The Scottish Government continues to press for introduction of a fuel duty regulator which would see greater protection for motorists and the road haulage industry.</p>

  <p>We are also aware that the high price of fuel is currently causing great concern to the fishing industry and a five-point plan of action to help counter the effects of rising fuel costs was agreed between the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment and industry representatives on Monday. As part of this plan, the Scottish Government will establish a task force to develop steps to help the industry, meet with the UK Government to discuss impact of fuel prices, continue to press the EU for a level playing field on subsidies, and work with industry to develop a fuel efficiency scheme. We have already committed &pound;300,000 to extending payment of the warranty for vessel monitoring systems, and further immediate help will be provided with &pound;400,000 for the annual maintenance of life raft costs on every vessel in Scotland.</p>

  <p>HM Treasury&rsquo;s response to a letter from the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth confirmed that fuel duty is a UK-wide central government tax and that the UK Government has no plan to introduce regionally differentiated rates of duty. The Scottish Government is concerned about the impact of fuel duty rises on rural communities and businesses - such as the road haulage industry - where fuel costs represent a significant cost burden, and on the wider economy.

We shall make sure that organisations which represent the interests of those with aphasia, such as Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland, Speakability and CONNECT, are included in the consultation.</p>

  <p>We have also made available funding to help provide training which will allow those who have had a stroke, including those with aphasia, to take part in the work of the stroke Managed Clinical Network which acts as the main vehicle for the local delivery of the strategy in each NHS board area. This will allow people with aphasia to make a direct contribution to the development of the services they need, drawing directly on their own experience.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for enforcing legislation on the licensing of houses in multiple occupation (HMOs) rests with local authorities and they have a range of powers available to them to ensure that private landlords comply with licensing requirements. New HMO licensing provisions, set out in the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006, will increase the maximum fine for a landlord found guilty of operating an unlicensed HMO from &pound;5,000 to &pound;20,000 and allow local authorities to use rent penalty notices to prevent unlicensed HMO landlords from collecting rent from their tenants. The Scottish Government does not currently collect information on enforcement action taken by local authorities in relation to HMO licensing.</p>

  <p>In relation to planning permission for HMOs, the Scottish Government believes that sufficient enforcement measures are in place already to allow local authorities to take action where there has been a breach of planning control. Again, it is for local authorities to apply these measures. The Planning etc. (Scotland) Act 2006 extended existing powers and introduced new enforcement powers. We have recently consulted on these; the consultation is closed and we are considering how to take this forward.</p>

It is the case that significant reserves remain in the North Sea and that the Scottish oil and gas industry, which is of enormous economic importance to Scotland, will remain a vital sector of our economy for decades to come.</p>

  <p>However, we are also clear that Scotland needs to make a transition to a low carbon economy, with an energy supply that is diverse and sustainable and which contributes to Scotland&rsquo;s wealth. The National Planning Framework is a strategy for Scotland&rsquo;s long term spatial development and the recent discussion draft sets out our ambitions for Scotland&rsquo;s development over the next quarter century including our commitment to tackling climate change and the introduction of new technologies.</p>

  <p>The draft NPF2 recognises that a growing long-term imbalance between supply and demand for oil and gas products would have profound implications for the global economy in a whole range of areas including transport and economic development. We therefore recognise the need to reduce dependency on fossil fuels over time. Such a strategy is consistent with our approach to reducing carbon emissions by 80% by 2050 to help tackle climate change.</p>

  <p>However, we are also clear that Scotland needs to make a transition to a low carbon economy, with an energy supply that is diverse and sustainable and which contributes to Scotland&rsquo;s wealth. Supporting and developing our food production capacity is in our national interests and will help build a sustainable economy. Whilst the Scottish Government is conscious that our generation has not experienced food shortages, we should never take food for granted and that is why we are currently developing the nation&rsquo;s first ever strategic food policy, to ensure we have a fully joined up, consistent and coherent approach to food production and consumption.</p>

  <p>In responding to the challenge of making the transition to a low carbon economy, we must put our intellect and entrepreneurial skills to use to cultivate better and more environmentally friendly ways of producing food.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>New registrations for Scottish residents are only entered on to the NHS Organ Donor Register after their NHS number is matched with each individual. Currently there is a delay in this matching process, and this has led to the temporary under-reporting of Scottish registrations from mid-February 2008.</p>

  <p>The figures are also subject to slight change, as the information is constantly updated.</p>

  <p>There is currently no requirement for planning authorities to routinely advise the Scottish Government of the nature of their decisions on planning applications where particular bodies have objected. However, in some circumstances, planning authorities must notify the government where they propose to grant planning permission.

  <p>It is wholly a matter for Post Office Ltd to decide which post offices it considers to be sustainable. Post offices are reserved under Schedule 5 (Section C11) of the Scotland Act 1998. The Scottish Government cannot fund post offices directly.

  <p>A catch-up exercise was carried out at the time that the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was introduced into the childhood schedule. In total 88% of the children who were offered catch-up immunisation at this time have been immunised appropriately for their age. Among the youngest of these children, who were aged two to eight months at the time, 95.9% have been immunised.</p>

  <p>There are no further catch-up plans at this time. In the longer term it would be for the joint committee on vaccination and immunisation to consider the evidence and provide advice on whether or not a further period of catch-up vaccination was required.</p>

  <p>The NHS in Scotland continues to reinforce the message that the recommended way to protect your child is through the combined MMR vaccination.</p>

  <p>Communication from a trusted health professional is key in supporting uptake and minimising parent anxiety. NHS Health Scotland continues to support NHS boards and Health Protection Scotland to achieve good MMR uptake rates through the provision of a range of accessible information for parents and health professionals, along with supporting materials.</p>

  <p>The revised MMR discussion pack will be launched later this year. It will build on the positively evaluated first edition and will further reinforce the importance of maintaining open and ongoing communication with parents about MMR.</p>

  <p>In addition, the <em>MMR: it's never too late</em> campaign materials are supplied by NHS Health Scotland to NHS boards to support local activity and include specific information for parents whose children have had single vaccines as well as those who have missed either one or both MMR doses.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, following recent reports that almost 50% of children opted for six single MMR injections and did not complete the course, what action is being taken to encourage vaccination of these children.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-05-14.S3W-12548.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0514.htm#27">

  <p>The recent report referred to in the question details a large cohort of children from the UK, including 1,740 from Scotland, who had their immunisation records examined. 5.2% of the total individuals included in the study (14,578) had opted for at least one single vaccine. In Scotland this was 2.8% (51 out of the 1,780 people included).</p>

  <p>Of the 634 people who had chosen single vaccines, only 52% of the children had received all of their immunisations. Therefore almost 50% of those children who opted for single vaccines, did not complete the course. The report does not suggest that 50% of all children opted for single injections and then did not complete the course.</p>

  <p>The most recent statistics collected by the Scottish Government indicate that uptake of one dose of MMR (MMR1) by 24 months for children born in the fourth quarter of 2005 is 91.8% Quarterly uptake of MMR1 by five years old is 94.4%, just below the World Health Organization (WHO) target of 95% and uptake of the second dose of MMR (MMR2) by five years old for children born in the fourth quarter of 2002 is 87.1%.</p>

  <p>Evidence shows that positive and effective communication from a trusted health professional is a key factor in influencing a parent&rsquo;s decision to immunise their child. The NHS in Scotland continues to reinforce the message that the recommended way to protect your child is through the combined MMR vaccination. NHS Health Scotland continues to support NHS boards and Health Protection Scotland to achieve good MMR uptake rates through the provision of a range of accessible information for parents and health professionals, along with supporting materials.</p>
