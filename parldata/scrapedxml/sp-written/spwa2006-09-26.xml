  <p>Work is continuing with NHS Education for Scotland on establishing a course to start as early as possible in 2007. This is to enable dental technicians to gain the clinical skills they need to register with the General Dental Council in order to practise as clinical dental technicians. The course will require to be approved by the General Dental Council, and its viability will have to be demonstrated for the Scottish education sector. Interest to date is low.</p>

  <p>The Scottish satellite was to be of the course being run by the Royal College of Surgeons of England for those with a qualification from the George Brown University in Canada. However, only a single candidate has been identified in Scotland, and discussions are currently being held with him with a view to agreeing the best way of ensuring that individual can pursue the course.</p>

  <p>When the Scottish Executive became aware that the replacement system would not be delivered by March 2004 a number of steps were taken to improve management of the project.</p>

  <p>Firstly, Scottish Police Information Strategy (SPIS) was brought within the governance arrangements that were put in place by the establishment of the Common Police Services (CPS) Programme Board in April 2004. This was followed by the appointment to Real Time Engineering Ltd to assess the state of the project. Their report in April 2005, highlighted the poor state of the project management and the unreliability of financial information on the project and made proposals about the steps that would need to be taken to deliver the replacement system.</p>

  <p>In April 2005, a senior civil servant was appointed as the interim director of SPIS. In May 2005 more robust reporting arrangements about the progress of the project and its financial management were put in place. In addition, regular reports were provided to Justice Department officials and the CPS Programme Board.</p>

  <p>In October 2005, the CPS Programme Board was satisfied with the progress made during the previous five months and endorsed the continuation of the CHS project. A four stage approach was adopted by SPIS, which meant that delivery would be on a slightly longer timescale but with a more robust approach to project management and delivery of the various stages of the project.</p>

  <p>The project is on track to meet the revised delivery date from SPIS to the Scottish Criminal Record Office which is scheduled for 22 December 2006. Thereafter there will be a period of user acceptance testing with the intention that the new system will in use by June 2007.</p>

  <p>The McClelland Report makes a number of recommendations which are designed to deliver improvements in procurement practice which will in turn ensure that vfm savings are secured. Delivery of planned Efficient Government savings is not considered to be dependent on establishing comprehensive central records of procurement expenditure by all public bodies. For example, the Report recommends focussing, initially at least, on a small number of goods and services which are common requirements across different organisations.</p>

  <p>The report highlighted the lack of consistent data as a concern. In implementing the report&rsquo;s recommendations the Executive intends to undertake additional work on identifying procurement expenditure across the public sector. It should be noted, however, that this work will focus initially on larger organisations with higher levels of procurement spending and that comprehensive central data is not expected to be available for some time.</p>
