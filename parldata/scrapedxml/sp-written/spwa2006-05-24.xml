  <p>Only dentists, dental hygienists and dental therapists can currently undertake the practice of dentistry and training programmes are in place for them. The General Dental Council is currently working with educational providers on additional training for dental technicians who wish to pursue clinical dental technician roles. There is no reliable information available on the number of denturists currently practising illegally.</p>

  <p>No assessment was made of the possible impact of the amendments to the <em>Dentists Act 1984 </em> on the making and fitting of dentures by a dental technician, as such practice is illegal.</p>

  <p>The <em>Dentists Act 1984</em> was amended in 2005 to provide for the future regulation of further professionals complementary to dentistry, in addition to the present professionals regulated by the General Dental Council, i.e. dentists, dental therapists and dental hygienists. One of the new professionals for which regulation will be introduced shortly is the clinical dental technician, who will be able to make and fit dentures once registered. At the same time regulation will also be introduced for dental technicians, dental nurses and orthodontic therapists. The new amendments to the 1984 act were made in the interests of patient safety and to enable these staff to make an increasing contribution to the dental care of patients.</p>

  <p>No information is available on this. The making and fitting of dentures by a dental technician is illegal as only dentists, dental hygienists and dental therapists may currently undertake the practice of dentistry. There is no formal mechanism for complaints by patients regarding the illegal practice of denturism.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it agrees with the Association for the Promotion of Denturism&rsquo;s statement that the independent denture supply sector is &quot;the one dental sector which is not currently in trouble&quot; and that &quot;due to the rise in tooth decay and the difficulty many are experiencing in seeing a dentist, numbers of full or partial dentures are set to rise steeply in the next few years&quot;.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-05-24.S2W-25805.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80064" speakername="Lewis Macdonald" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0524.htm#4">

  <p>Declining trends in total tooth loss indicate that the number of full dentures required in future is likely to fall considerably rather than to rise.</p>

  <p>As more people retain some natural teeth into older age, the complexity of treatment required will increase. Restoration of missing teeth is likely to include a range of potential treatments, including partial dentures, bridgework or implants. Therefore, there is no clear indication of whether the number of people with partial dentures will rise or fall.</p>

  <p>The definition in relation to the enhanced allowances for NHS committed practices states that the practice must treat all categories of patients and have on average a minimum of 500 registered NHS patients per dentist, of whom at least 100 must be fee-paying adults. Each dentist in the practice must have on average a minimum of &pound;50,000 gross NHS earnings. Part-time dentists may fall into this earning bracket via a declaration process that deems them to be committed. Otherwise, general dental practitioners who are part of a practice that does not meet the NHS commitment criteria will not receive enhanced allowances.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have granted consent for two wind farm developments located within the Glasgow and Clyde Valley Structure Plan (draft 2006) potential areas for wind energy development. These were Blacklaw, which is entirely within a potential area for development, and Whitelee, partly within such an area. No other proposals have been granted consent.</p>

  <p>The Executive has made no representations and there have been no discussions about the objection by BAA plc, dated 2 September 2003, to this wind farm proposal. Correspondence between the Executive and BAA on this matter has been restricted to an e-mail from the Executive and an e-mail reply both also dated 2 September 2003.</p>

  <p>There have been informal discussions between the Executive and BAA plc, most recently in March this year, about the latter&rsquo;s position on a number of wind farm proposals in the area, including the Greenock wind farm proposal, during which the question of conditions that would address BAA&rsquo;s concerns has been discussed.</p>

  <p>National Air Traffic Services Ltd has not objected to the proposal and there have therefore been no discussions or correspondence between them and the Executive on this matter.</p>

  <p>There are no specific regulations governing the secondment of staff from the Scottish Executive to outside organisations. The Scottish Executive&rsquo;s policy and procedural documentation is based on the <em>UK wide Cabinet Office Good Practice Guide (September 2000).</em> The Scottish Executive produced its own interchange policy and guidance HR <em>Interchange-Way Forward</em> in October 2004. A second edition was released in April 2006. The document is available in the Scottish Parliament&rsquo;s Information Centre (Bib. number 39655).</p>

  <p>For the purposes of answering this question the response is based on the position in the Scottish Executive only. The Scottish Executive does not hold information relating to other public bodies.</p>
