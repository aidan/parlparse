  <p>Meeting the December 2005 cancer waiting times target is a big challenge for the NHS. We have set a stretching target and recognise it will be difficult to meet.</p>

  <p>A National Delivery Plan agreed with NHS boards will be published soon. This sets out additional actions that will be taken, aimed at achieving the 2005 waiting times target by the end of the year.</p>

  <p>New waiting times standards for diagnostic tests announced on 21 June will also help drive down waiting times for cancer treatment.</p>

  <p>The scale of knife attacks in Glasgow is monitored by the Violence Reduction Unit in Strathclyde Police, which is adopting a multi-agency approach to tackling knife crime in the Glasgow area. Additionally, the homicide statistics collected centrally distinguish homicides committed with a sharp instrument and the statistics collected centrally on crimes of handling an offensive weapon show the scale of knife carrying identified by the police.</p>

  <p>Disclosure certificates are already processed this way. The Police Act 1997 requires that applications for disclosures are made and processed in the applicant&rsquo;s name. The information that appears on the certificate is about the applicant or it is stated on the certificate that no record is held in the applicant&rsquo;s name. When Disclosure Scotland issue an enhanced disclosure both the applicant and the registered body receive a copy of the certificate. Each party is made aware of the fact that the other has been sent a copy.</p>

  <p>The total funding set aside for the implementation of the act is &pound;12 million in 2004-05 and &pound;14 million in 2005-06. Funding has not been allocated specifically for the training of parents since they have been included in consultation and raising awareness seminars with practitioners since 2004. Local authorities have been using their allocation of funding (&pound;8 million in 2004-05 and &pound;9.5 million in 2005-06) to inform parents about the act and to update their information and advice materials for parents.

  <p>The table shows an estimate of the number of people with Crohn&rsquo;s disease based on the number of people with an in-patient or day case episode for Crohn&rsquo;s disease at some time in the period since 1981 who are still alive in 2005.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist&rsquo;s Office (CSO) is currently funding three research projects relating to Crohn&rsquo;s disease at a total cost of &pound;334,000. Two of the projects, namely, &quot;Gene-environmental interactions in inflammatory bowel disease&quot; and &quot;An investigation of the genetic determinants of susceptibility of Crohn&rsquo;s disease in the Scottish population&quot; are being carried out at the University of Edinburgh. The third project, namely, &quot;Magnetic Resonance Imaging of small bowel in Crohn&rsquo;s disease: evaluation of a novel orally administered hypersomolar bowel-distending agent&quot; is being carried out at the University of Dundee.</p>

  <p>The CSO works closely with the Medical Research Council (MRC), the main agency through which the UK Government supports medical and clinical research. It is an independent body deciding what research to support on its own expert judgement. In 2003-04, the MRC spent &pound;1.4 million on research relevant to Crohn&rsquo;s disease. This included a recently completed project entitled &quot;Microbiology of the gastrointestinal tract&quot; carried out at the University of Dundee.</p>

  <p>Details of these projects can be found on the National Research Register (NRR), which is a database of on-going and recently completed publicly funded research projects. this can be accessed at <a href="http://www.nrr.nhs.uk/search.htm" target="_blank">www.nrr.nhs.uk/search.htm</a>. The NRR shows that in Scotland, in addition to the projects already mentioned, there are a further three projects researching Crohn&rsquo;s disease taking place at the University of Edinburgh.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the basis is for its estimate of a housing need figure of 15,000 per annum, in light of Homes for Scotland&rsquo;s calculation that the current level of building of 24,000 new homes per annum is insufficient to meet demand.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-06-24.12.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80018" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa0624.htm#8">

  <p>The figure of 15,000 does not represent a Scottish Executive estimate for total housing supply requirements, and is not comparable with the house building figures quoted by Homes for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Fifteen thousand is a working estimate of the number of new homes per annum which over the period 2006-14 will require entirely new strategic water and sewerage infrastructure, taking account of growth trends. It does not, therefore, include new housing which will be serviced by existing capacity.</p>

  <p>The figure derives from <em>Investing in Water Services 2006-2014: Scottish Water</em> <em>Assets</em>, a report by the Quality and Standards (Q &amp; S) 3 Board, which can be found at: <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/environment/iwswp2swa.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/environment/iwswp2swa.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>New strategic infrastructure was discussed as part of the Q &amp; S 3 process with a range of stakeholders, including Homes for Scotland.</p>

  <p>We will keep the estimates used for strategic water capacity requirements under review and revise these in the light of further evidence.</p>

  <p>The existence of this organisation&rsquo;s website became known to the Scottish Court Service through a leaflet being distributed to members of the public.

  <p>No demands were made of the internet service provider. The decision to terminate the service was made by the service provider.</p>

  <p>The balance of the efficiency savings (&pound;151.5 million in 2007-08) are for councils themselves to identify and it will be for councils to decide how best they can work together to deliver these efficiencies, the bulk of which will then be available to them to reinvest in front line services.</p>

  <p>I have asked Tony Cameron, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The financial value over the lifetime of the contract was given in answer to <br /> S2W-7558. This value is the estimated cash value based on a seven-year life following completion of the implementation phase, excluding VAT.</p>

  <p>The net present value of the public sector comparator was given in response to S2W-11075. This was the net present value, in accordance with Treasury guidance, based on a seven-year life following completion of the implementation phase exclusive of VAT.</p>

  <p>The response to S2W-16951, answered on 6 June 2005 correctly confirmed that VAT was not included in the financial value stated in response to S2W-7558. However, both the question and answer mistakenly referred to this value as a net present value rather than an estimated cash value.</p>

  <p>VAT is applicable at the standard rate, but is fully recoverable by the SPS.</p>

  <p>The SPS has no figure for the actual cash value as it will be determined by a number of variables over the contract period including the volume of activity undertaken by the contractor and price inflation.</p>

  <p>We hope to establish a multi-agency law enforcement campus to bring together key agencies engaged in the fight against serious and organised crime. The SDEA would be part of this. A possible site has been identified near Gartcosh, but a final decision will be made when we have all the necessary information about Gartcosh and any other potential sites.</p>

  <p>The commission&rsquo;s report is currently being considered. When it was published I stated that the Executive would respond formally in the summer. That remains our intention.</p>

  <p>We have already made provision to allow a court to impose electronic monitoring as a condition of bail in murder and rape cases. This is currently being piloted. This is a significant tightening of the previous law where bail could be granted for those convicted of murder or rape without any such additional safeguard.</p>
