  <p>Over 7,000 copies of the draft Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill have been sent out. Every school in Scotland &#150; mainstream, grant-aided, self-governing and independent &#150; has been sent a copy, as have all education authorities, parent teacher associations, and many voluntary sector organisations. Head teachers were encouraged to inform parents of the new proposals, and to invite their comments. It is not intended to ask each school or education authority to report on the action taken in the consultation process.</p>

  <p>Fourteen seminars have been held in six towns/cities across Scotland, with 1,210 delegates attending. Additionally, Scottish Executive officials have been invited to talk and listen at various discussion groups involving parents.</p>

  <p>A report on the written responses to the consultation will be published in due course.</p>

  <p>In response to the National Debate on Education, hundreds of events were held across Scotland ranging from small group discussions to large conferences. About one quarter of debate responses indicated that parents were present at an event or discussion, including feedback from 176 school boards and a further 73 responses predominantly from parents or parent organisations. We believe that parents were involved in many more responses.</p>

  <p>Guidance will be issued to all education authorities, setting minimum standards for identifying and meeting the needs of pupils. H.M.

  <p>The draft Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill introduces new duties on education authorities to identify and address the additional support needs of pupils. There is also a duty to keep under consideration the adequacy of provision in meeting the needs of the child. An overall framework for intervention will be developed to replace current advice and to incorporate other intervention systems.</p>

  <p>For those within the public system, with the most complex needs, who require it, a Co-ordinated Support Plan (CSP) will be drawn up. This will be a statutory document that will detail the agreed long- and short-term learning outcomes for the child. The provision stated in the CSP will be subject to appeal to the Additional Support Needs Tribunal.</p>

  <p>For those who are being educated outwith the public system, education authorities will have a power to make such arrangements as they consider appropriate, in order to identify those who might have additional support needs.</p>

  <p>The information requested is shown in the following table; the data for Glasgow Springburn is based on publicly funded schools within the constituency rather than pupils living within that area. The schools included are: All Saints Secondary School; Smithycroft Secondary School; Springburn Academy; St Roch&#146;s Secondary School, and Whitehill Secondary School.</p>

  <p>Percentages are given for ease of interpretation, although the small numbers from these centres mean that care must be taken when making comparisons across years and against other areas.</p>

  <p>The school improvement framework requires all local authorities and their schools to establish local targets for school pupils achieving national qualifications. The targets are to be set for the period 2002-05 and should be stretching, but realistic.</p>

  <p>The introduction of the National Qualifications framework enables students to build up qualifications flexibility over time and improves progression routes between standard grade and higher. The Scottish Executive has also encouraged education authorities and schools to make greater use of flexibility within the school curriculum to meet learners&#146; needs. We will continue our efforts to help all students reach their full educational potential by taking forward the outcomes of the national debate.</p>

  <p>The Executive recognises that we need to increase the number of women led businesses in Scotland. We are committed to this in our strategic document <em>Smart, Successful Scotland</em> that sets out the direction and priorities for the Enterprise Networks.</p>

  <p>To help improve our performance I recently announced the formation of a National Women&#146;s Enterprise Unit within the Enterprise Networks. The unit will have a strategic focus in supporting more women into business and, as its first task, will review existing support mechanisms across the networks. The unit will be assisted by an advisory group of leading women entrepreneurs who will have a key advocacy role in encouraging more women to consider setting up in business.</p>

  <p>It is also encouraging that Scottish Enterprise aims to increase the number of start-ups by women assisted by the network to 40% by 2004-05, when the overall performance target will have increased to 9,000 start-ups.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with relevant officials in Northern Ireland on a variety of air quality issues. These contacts have included discussions about the opencast lignite mine and power station near Ballymoney, the proposals for which are only at a very early stage. Such contacts will continue with a view to ensuring that any planned development meets the required environmental standards laid down by the relevant legislation.</p>

  <p>Provision for expenditure related to EU funding channelled through or claimed direct by the Scottish Administration is included in Scotland&#146;s Assigned Budget. Common Agricultural Policy-related expenditure is classified as Annually Managed Expenditure (AME) and the level of provision can therefore be adjusted annually and in-year to reflect the actual level of payments.</p>

  <p>All other expenditure related to EU funding channelled through or claimed direct by the Scottish Administration falls within Scotland&#146;s Departmental Expenditure Limit (DEL).</p>

  <p>During the debate on Glasgow's acute services review on 12 September 2002, Malcolm Chisholm endorsed a commitment to keep named services at Stobhill General Hospital and the Victoria Infirmary over the next five years, and to have this monitored locally. I have now had the opportunity to consider how this commitment should be discharged and have commissioned two monitoring groups, one for north Glasgow and one for south Glasgow. The remit is the same for both groups and includes an opportunity for stakeholder involvement in service design and other key implementation aspects of the acute services review.</p>

  <p>The membership of the groups, which will both meet for the first time on Friday 28 March, reflects strong local involvement of elected representatives and members of the public. The remainder of the membership comprises clinical and NHS staff representatives. Both groups have independent chairs with strong links to Glasgow throughout their careers.</p>

  <p>I believe that this is the best balance to deliver the commitment made during the debate and will ensure that local people have an opportunity to be fully involved as decisions flowing from the acute services review are implemented.</p>

  <p>In December 2002, we provided &#163;250,000 to the Scottish Police Service for training and support for a Scottish-wide system of restorative cautions. Work is on-going to identify good practice and guidance will be produced in the coming year that will inform a further &#163;250,000 of extra funding.</p>

  <p>In addition, mediation and reparation schemes for over 16s operate in Edinburgh/Midlothian, North and South Lanarkshire and Aberdeen as part of diversion from prosecution.

  <p>Section 17 of the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 provides for a duty on local authorities, not later than three years following implementation of Part 1 of the act, to draw up a plan for a system of paths sufficient for the purpose of giving the public reasonable access throughout their area. Implementation of Part 1 of the act is expected to be in the first half of 2004.</p>

  <p>An allocation of &#163;6.5 million for 2003-04, &#163;7.4 million for 2004-05 and &#163;8.1 million for 2005-06 will be made available to local authorities in respect of access related activity. Scottish Natural Heritage is spending over &#163;21 million over the current three years to promote and facilitate access, a proportion of which will be in the form of grants to local authorities.</p>

  <p>Scottish Executive ministers have held a wide range of meetings, both formal and informal, with UK ministers since July 1999. It is not our practice to disclose details of such meetings, which are numerous and not all recorded in detail, and which may often be in the context of sensitive and confidential negotiations.</p>

This is a joint publication with COSLA in the spirit of the kind of partnership activity that the guidance advocates. The guidance explores and identifies approaches and good practice for delivering local authorities' core cultural provision and the wide range of other core activities in which culture can play an important role. The guidance is commended to all local authorities, cultural agencies and other interested parties.

It should be noted that the National Health Service (Scotland) (Injury Benefits) Regulations 1998 provide for successful applicants to receive a supplement to their income to bring their post injury income up to a proportion of their pre-injury income, that proportion depending on the degree of disability. &quot;Successful&quot; does not, therefore, mean that an additional payment is made. Reviews and appeals take into account the way the disability has developed since the original application and can be in respect of the degree of disability as well as the existence of disability. Hence, there are reviews of successful original applications.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for recruitment lies with NHS trusts as employers. The Facing the Future group, established in 2001 and chaired by me, supports trusts in this role and has introduced a range of initiatives to aid recruitment and retention of nurses and midwives in NHSScotland. NHS trusts in Tayside have benefited from these initiatives in the same way as other trusts across Scotland have. Tayside have been particularly successful, with the most recent figures showing no vacancies in either trust remaining unfilled for longer than three months.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises that there could be practical difficulties in identifying pensions and social security benefits when paid direct into a bank account if enforcement by arresting monies in bank accounts is attempted.</p>

  <p>In line with its commitment to continuing the existing principle of protecting subsistence levels of income from arrestment, the Scottish Executive included this concern in its consultation document <em>Enforcement of Civil Obligations in Scotland</em> in April 2002. An independent analysis of the responses was published in November 2002. Both these documents are available on the Scottish Executive website at:</p>

  <p>Rolled forward targets, for the areas presently covered, have been arrived at following detailed consultation with the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland and the Convenors of police authorities. These new targets are being set for the Scottish police to achieve by the year 2005-06.</p>

  <p>All of the police targets are intended to build on local plans and existing strategies and to provide a national focus for key areas. The Vehicle Crime target also encompasses the existing national target for car crime set by the UK Government in September 1998.</p>

  <p>These new targets are as follows:</p>

  <p>Serious Violent Crime:</p>

  <p>A reduction in the number of recorded incidents of serious violent crime of 5%.</p>

  <p>An increase in the detection rate of serious violent crime of two percentage points.</p>

  <p>(Baseline: annual average based on the three financial years 2000-01 to 2002-03)</p>

  <p>Vehicle Crime:</p>

  <p>A reduction in the number of recorded incidents of vehicle crime of 15%.</p>

  <p>(Baseline: annual average based on the three financial years 2000-01 to 2002-03)</p>

  <p>Drugs:</p>

  <p>An increase in the weight of Category A drug seizures of 10%.</p>

  <p>An increase in detection of offences for supply or intent to supply Category A drugs by 10%.</p>

  <p>(Baseline: annual average based on the three financial years 2000-01 to 2002-03)</p>

  <p>Housebreaking:</p>

  <p>A 5% reduction in domestic housebreaking.</p>

  <p>(Baseline: annual average based on the three financial years 2000-01 to 2002-03)</p>

  <p>Racist Incidents:</p>

  <p>An increase in the detection rate of five percentage points.</p>

  <p>(Baseline: annual average based on the three financial years 2000-01 to 2002-03)</p>

  <p>Road Policing/Safety:</p>

  <p>a reduction in the number of people killed or seriously injured in road accidents by 33%.</p>

  <p>a reduction in the number of children killed or seriously injured by 40%.</p>

  <p>a reduction in the slight casualty rate by 10%.</p>

  <p>(Baseline: annual average of five calendar years 1994-98).</p>

  <p>I have set the Registers of Scotland the following key targets for 2003-04:</p>

  <p>To achieve a return of 15% on net capital employed over the three-year period ending 31 March 2004.</p>

  <p>To reduce the standard production cost index by 2% by 31 March 2004 from its base at 31 March 2003.</p>

  <p>To continue to operate at Service First Charter Mark standards measured through market research; to increase accuracy, speed of response and value for money performance by a further 5% measured through the annual customer survey, and to process 97% of all other enquiries in compliance with the agency's customer service standard.</p>

  <p>To achieve recording and registration turnaround times:</p>

  <p>- averaging 15, but not exceeding 25 working days for Sasine Writs;</p>

  <p>- averaging 25, but not exceeding 30 working days for Dealings with Whole;</p>

  <p>- averaging 105, but not exceeding 125 working days in any quarter for domestic First Registrations, with 70% of all such applications being completed within 125 working days, and</p>

  <p>- to reduce the average age of the backlog of domestic First Registrations from 30 weeks to 26 weeks.</p>

  <p>To increase the income from the agency&#146;s information services by 5% more than income in 2002-03.</p>

  <p>To achieve a registration accuracy of at least 97% during 2003-04.</p>

  <p>Achievement of these targets will ensure that homebuyers receive an improved and more efficient service over the coming year.</p>

  <p>The transfer to the Land Register of Banff, Moray, Ross and Cromarty, Caithness, Sutherland, Orkney and Zetland on 1 April 2003 will complete the transfer of counties from the Register of Sasines to the Land Register. From that date the Land Register will be in operation across the whole of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Local authorities do not bid for capital finance, and their capital allocations are distributed as a single allocation for their non-housing capital programmes on the basis of a formula agreed with COSLA.</p>

  <p>Authorities were invited in September 2001 to submit Outline Business Cases in support of bids for financial support towards the capital cost of school Public Private Partnership (PPP) proposals. The criteria for assessing these bids were initially set out in Scottish Executive Education Department circular 8/2001, a copy of which is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre. These relate to affordability, value for money, deliverability, estate management issues and approach to community use of school facilities. It was clarified during 2002 that funding is also conditional upon use of the Standard Scottish Schools PPP contract, and upon compliance with the Scottish Executive/STUC Staffing Protocol.</p>

  <p>Figures published earlier in March show that the Executive has made clear inroads in defeating poverty. Since 1997 we have lifted over 170,000 people in Scotland out of relative poverty, which is an indicator of how the living standards of poorer families compare with those of society as a whole. We are working across the Executive on various measures to close the opportunity gap including reducing fuel poverty and developing Scotland&#146;s skillbase through programmes like education maintenance allowances and modern apprenticeships.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no plans to extend the period of consultation. Parents of children who will be affected by the legislation have expressed a range of views about the proposals in the draft Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Bill. Ministers will consider carefully all views received in response to the consultation.</p>

  <p>The introduction of the bill to Parliament will be subject to the new administration. After introduction, a further stage of consultation will begin. At this time, normal practice is that a lead committee will consider the proposals in the draft bill, and take evidence from any individual or organisation wishing to submit their views. The lead committee will also scrutinise the adequacy of the consultation process.</p>

As part of that announcement, I made clear that the consultants&#146; report found that there is an economic case for relocating <strong></strong> sportscotland&#146;s HQ. We intend to pursue this by investigating fully the case for co-locating it with a major sports facility development in the central belt area. We shall also pursue with equal vigour the case for relocation as a stand alone option. The central belt area identified by the consultants as eligible does not include North Ayrshire but it will be open to any local authority area which considers it can make a persuasive case for locating the HQ there to do so.</p>

  <p>Education features strongly in the plans to commemorate the 400th anniversary of the Union of the Crowns this year. Historic Scotland are inviting pupils from schools across Scotland to participate in a Schools Art Competition to design a crown, a sword or a sceptre for the Coronation of a King or Queen. Further details of the competition, pictures and further information on the Union of the Crowns can be found on the Historic Scotland website and in the specially commissioned Schools Art Competition brochure.</p>

  <p>In association with the Scottish Cultural Resources Access Network (SCRAN), a Union of the Crowns website has also been set up as part of the wider programme of events. The Union of the Crowns Advisory Group has overseen the arrangements for the design of the website, which provides access to a wide range of learning resources.</p>

  <p>All members of the advisory group contributed to the setting up of the Union of the Crowns programme of events. The group includes representatives from the City of Edinburgh Council, the University of Edinburgh, Unique Events, Historic Scotland, VisitScotland, the Scottish Tourism Forum, the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Scotland Office and the Scottish Executive.

  <p>The final report of the review of litter legislation has been published today (Bib. number 27094) and is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>It is clear from the report that for various reasons the existing legislation relevant to litter and flytipping is not being fully utilised. The main reasons suggested are a lack of clear understanding of the powers available, of clear guidance, particularly with regard to enforcement procedures, and the resource implications for enforcing bodies. However, it is also clear that the existing legislation, when used properly, can be effective. The report confirms that the necessary powers are generally already in place. It highlights, however, the need for improved guidance to all key stakeholders in using the powers and for the need to ensure that the public is made more aware of the legislation.</p>

  <p>In light of the recommendations contained within the report, the Executive has already provided funding to Keep Scotland Beautiful (KSB) to:</p>

  <p>update the current Code of Practice on Litter and Refuse and provide guidance on its implementation;</p>

  <p>establish and service a Scottish Flytipping Forum consisting of all key stakeholders, and</p>

  <p>pay for the first year costs for all local authorities in Scotland to participate in the Local Environmental Audit and Management System (LEAMS).</p>

  <p>In addition, we intend to increase the current Fixed Penalty Fine for littering from &#163;25 to &#163;50.</p>

  <p>A full response by the Executive to the report's findings is available in the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 27095).</p>
