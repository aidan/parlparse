  <p>There are 346 railway stations in Scotland. At present, 204 stations are considered to be fully accessible for people with reduced mobility.</p>

  <p>Disabled access to the UK rail network is a matter reserved to Westminster under the auspices of equalities legislation, such as the Disability Discrimination Act. The Office of Rail Regulation is responsible for ensuring train operating companies comply with legislation relating to disabled access at train stations.</p>

  <p>It is anticipated five stations will be made fully accessible this year, and a further three next year, through the first phase of the Department for Transport&rsquo;s Access for All programme. A further five stations will be made step free in the second phase from April 2009. The Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change recommends which stations in Scotland should be given priority for Access for All funding, following consultation with Transport Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has any plans to enhance the level of hospital nursing care provided for elderly people.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-08-28.S3W-15330.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0828.htm#2">

  <p>The Scottish Government continues to work with stakeholders to ensure that elderly and vulnerable people get the care they deserve.</p>

  <p><em>Delivering Care, Enabling Health</em>, Scotland&rsquo;s strategy for nurses, midwives and allied health professionals, reinforces the message that caring is fundamental to nursing services and should be at the heart of nursing practice so that patients, including the elderly, experience the best possible nursing care in hospital and at home. It encourages a culture where caring is fundamental to nursing and remains at the core of all nursing functions. Providing care to individual patients with compassion is a core part of nursing.</p>

  <p><em>Delivering Care, Enabling Health </em>is currently under review. Caring and enabling will remain a fundamental tenet of this policy. We will be producing a revised action plan which will outline several workstreams led at a national level by the Chief Nursing Officer. These programmes of work will support nurses in continually improving the care they deliver to patients, including older people.</p>

  <p><em>Leading Better Care</em>, the report of the review of the role of the senior charge nurse and the clinical quality indicators project, was launched by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing in June 2008. NHS boards will be implementing the revised senior charge nurse role in hospitals across NHSScotland over the next two years. This new role framework will ensure that senior charge nurses are supported in their development as guardians of quality clinical care and standards in their areas.</p>

  <p>A number of clinical quality indicators will be implemented in the majority of in-patient settings over the next two years. These include four generic quality indicators that are applicable across a wide variety of in-patient settings: food, fluid and nutrition; falls; pressure ulcer prevention, and monitoring and observation. Implementation of these indicators will lead to improvements in nursing care for all patients, and in particular for elderly people.</p>

  <p>Additionally, the national catering and nutrition specification, which was launched in July 2008 and which links directly to the senior charge nurse review, will support NHS boards in implementing the NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS) clinical standards for food, fluid and nutritional care, specifically standards 3, 4 and 5 which aim to address the risk of malnutrition in hospital patients. It will also support the delivery of a healthy balanced diet for patients who are nutritionally well.</p>

  <p>NHS QIS recently appointed a national falls manager, for a period of two years, who will scope, lead, co-ordinate and manage a multi-agency project on the prevention and management of falls in Scotland. Also, in April 2008, I launched the falls community web space, which will allow health care professionals to access evidence and share experience and good practice relating to falls.</p>

  <p>The practice development unit of NHS QIS is working with NHS Education for Scotland and the University of Edinburgh to create a network to support learning and practice development in the care of older people.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government plans two phases of consultation on the energy performance of existing buildings. We intend to launch a consultation on existing non-domestic buildings in September 2008, once the Parliament has reconvened.

  <p>The statutory instrument does not confer a function on Scottish ministers to make referrals to the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. The question of whether Pringle of Scotland is in breach of the terms of the Consumer Protection from Unfair Trading Regulations 2008 (CPRs) is for the Trading Standards Services and the Office of Fair Trading as the enforcement authorities and, ultimately, the Crown Office for the purpose of establishing whether criminal proceedings should be brought.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is concerned that units are closed to admissions when they are not already full. We urgently need to fully understand the reasons behind this, and will consider ways in which robust data can be collected, with a view to making improvements to this service.</p>

  <p>The Maternity Services Action Group will meet on 24 September 2008 to discuss the perinatal collaborative transport study, and will be asked to recommend a course of action to specifically address concerns highlighted in the report.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. It is a matter for each NHS board to plan and organise maternity care provision to meet local need, ensuring that that the most appropriate professional is the care provider at any given time.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recommends that NHS boards adopt the neonatal levels of care model set out in table 21 of the <em>A Framework for Maternity Services in Scotland</em>, when considering the provision of immediate and neonatal care.</p>

  <p>NHS Scotland is currently developing and testing a national neonatal workforce and workload tool to identify nursing needs for this vulnerable group of babies.</p>

  <p>The tool has had its first test, is currently being refined and will then be tested and modified prior to implementation.</p>

  <p>We do not anticipate that any additional junior doctor posts will be created as a direct consequence of the Working Time Regulations (WTR) requirement for average working hours to be reduced from 56 to 48 by 1 August 2009.</p>

  <p>Compliance with the reduction in working hours is the responsibility of NHS boards as employers. At the request of Scottish ministers, all NHSScotland boards have provided information on how they plan to achieve compliance with WTR for their doctors training. We will continue to monitor progress on this issue.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government seeks to support the service in this by issuing guidance, disseminating information on good practice on work carried out across Scotland and elsewhere in the UK and holding seminars. The Scottish Government continues to offer practical support to help NHSScotland to invest in the service and workforce modernisation which is necessary if compliance is to be attained. This includes:</p>

  <p>The creation of new and extended non-medical roles to help support the decrease in working hours for junior doctors;</p>

  <p>The introduction of the Hospital at Night concept;</p>

  <p>The expansion of the SAS (Speciality) Grade Doctor;</p>

  <p>Service Redesign, and</p>

  <p>Reshaping the medical workforce &ndash; a project aiming to improve longer term medical workforce planning by shifting towards service delivery by trained doctors.</p>

  <p>Workforce planning is firmly embedded into the work of NHS boards and is becoming more integrated into the wider planning function with boards continuing to build up their knowledge and expertise to meet the challenges of the future where the workforce is key to achieving change.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and VisitScotland recognise that wildlife tourism makes a valuable and growing contribution to Scottish tourism, and thus to sustainable economic growth. We are currently studying the feasibility and costs of commissioning research to assess the overall value of wildlife tourism, and a detailed timetable for the study and terms of reference, including coverage of the study, have not yet been prepared. However, we would expect to commission the study before the end of this year, with the primary field research capturing data during the course of 2009, and to report thereafter.</p>
