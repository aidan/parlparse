  <p>It is of paramount importance that the momentum in appointing sufficient, appropriately trained, professional and support staff at the Beatson Oncology Centre is sustained, and that the second phase in taking forward the plans to relocate the centre at Gartnavel General Hospital are developed and implemented by a strong management team.</p>

  <p>Decisions have yet to be taken on the future reporting structure at the Beatson. I am determined to ensure that whatever future management arrangements are in place, by working in partnership with staff, the Beatson will now continue to go from strength to strength in delivering excellent services, covering the full range of cancer specialties, for the people of Glasgow and the West of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Chief Scientist Office (CSO) within the Scottish Executive Health Department has responsibility for encouraging and supporting research into health services and patient care within the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>At present CSO is directly funding 58 research projects on cancer with a total value of &#163;5.9 million. If translational research is defined as integrated clinical-laboratory investigations designed to improve the prevention, diagnosis and/or treatment of cancer, then 51% of this funding (&#163;3 million) supports translational research. Three projects (with a total value of &#163;0.3 million) are directly concerned with Phase I trials i.e. the first stage of testing newly researched treatments, including drugs, on patients.</p>

  <p>The Executive's recent contribution of &#163;1 million per annum to support the clinical trial infrastructure required to facilitate patient entry into clinical trials in Scotland, regarded translational research as an integral part of clinical trials activity.</p>

  <p>The Executive does not plan to assess all children specifically for dyslexia. However, early assessment of children should ensure that all schools identify the learning support needs of individuals at an early stage. The fact that nearly all three- and four-year-olds now have a nursery place, along with the Early Intervention Programme and greater awareness amongst teachers about dyslexia, means that teachers and other professionals are picking up signs of dyslexia in children at an early stage.</p>

  <p>Schools and education authorities advise pupils with dyslexia and their parents about resources available to support them and should ensure that this support is put in place. In further education colleges, a student's needs will be assessed by a qualified member of staff or through an ACCESS Centre.</p>

  <p>Organisations such as Enquire and Dyslexia in Scotland also provide advice to pupils with dyslexia and their parents. In addition to this, Dyslexia Scotwest and the Scottish Dyslexia Trust have recently been awarded funding for 2002-03 and 2003-04 through the Scottish Executive Innovation Grants Programme for projects which should assist in ensuring that pupils with dyslexia receive information and support.</p>

  <p>There is now greater awareness amongst teachers and lecturers about dyslexia, which means that teachers and other professionals are picking up signs of dyslexia in children and students and providing learning support for them at an earlier stage than was the case a decade ago. Therefore, young people and adults with dyslexia should no longer leave education without having had their learning difficulties identified and supported. Against this background, failure to diagnose dyslexia should be rare and the Scottish Executive has no plans at present to make learning institutions more accountable.</p>

  <p>Both the Beattie and Cubie Committees drew a distinction between the way disabled students should be supported in further and higher education. They favoured channelling additional funding to colleges to support the particular needs of disabled students on further education courses. The Executive agreed and has made available an additional &#163;4.5 million over three years towards college costs of meeting additional study requirements such as specialist equipment.</p>

  <p>In relation to travel costs a Special Educational Needs Allowance was introduced in academic year 2001-02 by the Scottish Further Education Funding Council as a result of a request made by Scottish ministers to look into this. This allowance allows colleges to assist with disabled students additional travel costs.</p>

  <p>In higher education the Disabled Students Allowance is available to all eligible full-time, part-time and distance learning higher education students who have a disability and who by reason of their disability incur additional expenditure arising from their attendance on their course.</p>

  <p>The White Paper <em>Managing the Nuclear Legacy - A Strategy for</em> <em>Action</em> is being published on 4 July 2002 by the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI). Copies will be available from the Parliament's Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The White Paper sets out plans for radical changes to current arrangements for the clean up of the UK civil nuclear legacy. Plans include the creation of a new body - the Liabilities Management Authority - responsible to government and with a specific remit to ensure that clean up is carried out safely, securely, cost effectively and in ways which protect the environment for the benefit of current and future generations.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has been involved in the preparation of the White Paper which recognises the responsibility of devolved administrations for radioactive waste policy and its importance in the management of the nuclear legacy. The Executive endorses the open, transparent approach, which is essential to command public confidence in driving forward the systematic clean up of the nuclear legacy.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to public involvement and is publishing today the findings of research undertaken in relation to the joint consultation document <em>Managing Radioactive Waste Safely</em> published by the UK Government and the devolved administrations in September 2001. Copies of the report - <em>Managing</em> <em>Radioactive Waste Safely: Engaging Scotland</em> - and the findings of a research survey - <em>Managing Radioactive Waste Safely: Awareness and attitudes of the Scottish public</em> will be available from the Parliament's Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>DTI has consulted widely with stakeholders in the preparation of the White Paper and would welcome views on the proposed new arrangements, and how they should be implemented. Views should be submitted to DTI by 18 October 2002. Contact details are provided in the White Paper.</p>

  <p>The reopening of a railway passenger station at Reston is a local transport issue. As such we would expect the relevant local authority to take such a project forward.</p>

  <p>Local authorities may apply for funding of feasibility studies for public transport improvements from the Public Transport Fund (PTF). Studies or projects supported by the PTF would have to satisfy eligibility criteria and compete with other bids. Applications for the current round must be submitted by 12 August.</p>

  <p>As I stated in a press release on 12 June, I welcome the Accounts Commission examination of the evolving Public Private Partnership (PPP) landscape. The report is very positive about the difference which PPP projects have made to schools in Scotland. It is clear that conventional funding could not have produced the same step change in the schools estate. It is clear too that PPP has delivered real benefits in terms of project management, risk transfer and financial control and that PPP providers are delivering the schools rapidly, on schedule and with good control of construction costs.</p>
