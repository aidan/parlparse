  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what measures it will take to ensure that the world heritage site of St Kilda is fully protected from the potential threats posed by the deep water oil developments being licensed there by Her Majesty&#146;s Government.</p>

  <p>We are satisfied that the measures in place for consideration of the potential environmental impact of petroleum activities on all parts of the UK Continental Shelf ensure the protection of the St Kilda World Heritage Site. The licensing of blocks for petroleum exploration and development is a reserved matter and rests with the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry. For future licensing rounds, the Scottish Executive will be fully consulted before any new licenses are granted.</p>

  <p>The UK Government have convened a round table meeting of relevant stakeholders with a view to the preparation of a State of Conservation Report on St Kilda for the next meeting of the World Heritage Bureau due to be held in Marrakech in November.</p>

  <p>In addition, under the Offshore Petroleum Production and Pipe-Lines (Assessment of Environmental Effects) Regulations 1999, the Scottish Executive is a statutory consultee for relevant projects requiring the consent of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-586 by Mr Jack McConnell on 30 July, whether the advance planning and preparations for converting from Sterling to the Euro, and the changeover itself, will require local authorities to incur costs and, if so, what these costs are estimated to be and whether local authorities will be expected to meet these costs from their existing resources.</p>

  <p>It is too early to estimate the potential costs to local authorities, if it were decided that the United Kingdom should join the Economic and Monetary Union. As I indicated in my previous response (to Question S1W-585 on 30 July 1999) both the Scottish Executive and the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities are involved with other Departments in a Working Group to look at the potential implications for local authorities, but this work is at an early stage.</p>

  <p>The funding arrangements for the devolved administrations are set out in the Statement of Funding Policy, published by HM Treasury on 31 March 1999. The Statement provides that budgets may be exceptionally adjusted to compensate a devolved administration for costs which it incurs as a result of actions by the UK Government not already allowed for through the operation of the Barnett Formula. Budgets will not, however, be adjusted to accommodate additional costs incurred as a result of decisions by the UK Government which the UK Government is expecting its departments with parallel responsibilities to absorb within existing spending plans.</p>

  <p>Any potential new burdens on local authorities arising from decisions taken by the Scottish Executive will be discussed fully with the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities as part of the statutory consultations which take place each year on the local government finance settlement. The presumption is that where the introduction of a new policy will impose new costs on local authorities, then these should be reflected in the local government finance settlement.</p>

  <p>The North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust was formally established on 1 April 1999, the date from which remuneration was payable to its Chairman and non-executive trustees. The Chairman receives &pound;19,285 and the trustees &pound;5000 per annum.</p>

  <p>Payments to executive members serving on other NHS Trusts before Trust re-configuration on 1 April 1999 will have been made by those former employers: remuneration details will be shown in the Annual Reports of the relevant employing NHS Trust.</p>

  <p>There are no proposals to change the research funding arrangements as a result of this incident.</p>

  <p>The programme is routinely reviewed each year, and any necessary changes made to reflect shifts in priorities.</p>

  <p>The time between receipt of samples in the laboratory and the issuing of results is determined by the laboratory procedures required. Whilst automated procedures are used wherever possible, further reductions in testing times are not technically possible.</p>

  <p>The 9 courts prescribed in the Regulations were selected by application of a formula. The 15 sheriff courts with the lowest throughput of persons called to court were identified from published 1996 statistics. Those which were less than 40 miles from the nearest neighbouring court were identified and excluded. Those which could only be reached by a sea crossing were included. This left the 9 courts. The formula has now been reapplied to the Sheriff Court statistics for 1998-99 on the number of accused appearing in each sheriff court. The sheriff courts of Wick and Fort William will therefore be added to the list as well as Dunoon sheriff court where presently only the annexe at Lochgilphead attracts the extra fee. I intend to lay the amending Regulations as soon as possible after Parliament reconvenes.</p>

  <p>I intend an annual review of the list once the previous year&#146;s figures are available, but in order to maintain stability, if a court is added to the list, it will remain on the list for at least 3 years, even though the annual review might suggest its removal.</p>

  <p>Preliminary work on estimating the cost of answering Scottish Parliamentary Questions suggests an average cost of about &pound;100 per question &#150; a figure that is consistent with evidence from the UK Parliament.

  <p>I have today published two documents taking forward the commitment to collective responsibility contained in <i>Partnership for Scotland</i> .</p>

  <p>The first is the <i>Scottish Ministerial C</i>ode which provides a code of conduct and guidance on procedures for Scottish Ministers. The Code is designed to ensure the highest standards of public propriety amongst Ministers. It also underlines our commitment to working in partnership with the Scottish Parliament. We intend to draw upon the best of good practice in other countries, providing open and responsible government.</p>

  <p>The second document is <i>A Guide to Collective Decision-making in the Scottish Executive</i>. This is primarily a source of advice for officials: providing detailed guidance on arrangements for supporting collective decision-making by Ministers. These arrangements are designed to enable the efficient and effective conduct of business within the Executive: allowing Ministers to focus upon the key issues and facilitating joined-up government.</p>

  <p>Both documents will be placed on the Internet. Copies have also been sent to the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>The recent results from the first round of the Scottish Household Survey suggest that across Scotland, 12% of householders (or their partners) do not have a bank account. This conceals a wide variation: for example only 61% of single parents have some form of account. This is a matter of concern and Scottish Ministers are committed to improving access to financial services.

  <p>A network of 47 Social Inclusion Partnerships is now in place, tackling the problems of exclusion in rural and urban areas across Scotland. Of these, 26 are new Social Inclusion Partnerships, which began their work on 1 April 1999. The new Social Inclusion Partnerships are currently developing their strategies. Their finalised targets will be set out in monitoring and evaluation plans, which each new Social Inclusion Partnership will develop later this year. New guidance is currently being developed to assist the Social Inclusion Partnerships in doing this.</p>

  <p>As well as the new partnerships, 21 of the existing Priority Partnership Areas and Regeneration Programmes were designated as Social Inclusion Partnerships on 1<sup>st</sup> April 1999 following a re-focusing of their work programmes. Each of these converted Social Inclusion Partnerships has a set of targets agreed with the Scottish Executive early in its life. Each partnership sets out details of its performance against these targets every year in its annual report. Annual reports for 1998/99 have now been submitted to the Scottish Executive, and I have placed copies of the annual reports in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it is aware that on 7 July 1999 the Fort William to Mallaig road was blocked for a period of approximately 4 hours and whether it intends to make an announcement with regard to the prioritisation of an upgrading programme of the trunk routes in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive was aware of the incident. On 7 July 1999 an articulated lorry loaded with fish ran off the road, resulting in a temporary road closure between 1540 hours and 1900 hours.</p>

  <p>An announcement concerning the Strategic Roads Review will be made to Parliament<strong> </strong>after the summer recess.</p>

  <p>I hope to launch the scheme towards the end of this year, and arrangements are being put in hand by my officials.</p>

  <p>It is too early to say what the level of participation will be, but our aim is to reach a voluntary agreement with all local authorities and transport operators to provide blind people with free concessionary travel on bus and rail services throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what effect additional traffic congestion caused by the possible loss of the Underground service on match days at Ibrox Stadium is likely to have on the safe operation of Accident and Emergency services based at the Southern General Hospital.</p>

  <p>I understand that only a small proportion of football supporters use the Glasgow underground system when travelling to Ibrox. In the event that underground services are cancelled on match days this should only have a minor additional impact on traffic in the Southern General Hospital&#146;s catchment area. It is most unlikely that this would disrupt the safe operation of Accident and Emergency Services at the Southern General Hospital.</p>

  <p>A new code setting out good practice in government funding of voluntary organisations is being prepared for issue later this year. It will confirm the Government&#146;s commitment to providing 3 -year core grants, which can be renewed subject to a continuing need for the service and adequate performance. It will also state that there continues to be a place for time-limited project grants.</p>

  <p>It is already standard practice to assess the impact on services when applications are received for grants or for renewals. Given that resources are finite, a balance may then have to be struck between continuing existing grants and accepting new applications which develop new services and innovative approaches.</p>

  <p>It is estimated that public sector funding of the voluntary sector in Scotland totals approximately &pound;742 million. Most of this money will be distributed by a range of public authorities to a very large number of voluntary organisations. Given this level of activity, it is neither practicable nor appropriate for the Scottish Executive to maintain information on individual grants centrally.</p>

  <p>Clerks are currently preparing draft proposals for the establishment of a scheme to register all party parliamentary groups, to be considered by the Standards Committee. Once such a scheme is in place, the SPCB will be invited to consider what facilities might be made available to registered groups, such as access to meeting rooms in the Parliamentary buildings, and access to catering facilities. An announcement on the arrangements to be put in place will be made in the Business Bulletin in due course. <br /></p>
