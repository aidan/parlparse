  <p>The Scottish Executive is today publishing the Scottish farm income figures. The estimated figures show that Total Income from Farming (TIFF) rose by 11% in 2001 to &#163;273 million.</p>

  <p>Compensation payments for animals culled due to foot-and-mouth disease do not count towards TIFF because they are payments for the loss of capital assets. These payments, which are estimated at around &#163;165 million in Scotland, enter the accounts as capital transfers.</p>

  <p>Average Net Farm Income (NFI) is forecast to rise in 2001-02 by two-thirds to almost &#163;9,600. Dairy and general cropping farms are forecast to show the greatest improvement in their financial position while the incomes of Less Favoured Area specialised sheep farms are expected to deteriorate with negative NFIs on average. Detailed estimates of the outputs, inputs and income of Scottish agriculture at both the aggregate level and by farm type will be published this morning and will be placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 18811).</p>

  <p>There are currently no formal waiting times for children with cancer, nor for people diagnosed with leukaemia. The diagnosis of leukaemia, particularly in children, is usually a clinical emergency warranting immediate admission for urgent treatment. For those cases not requiring immediate emergency admission, treatment is mostly commenced within one week of diagnosis.</p>

  <p>Any individual who, as a result of participating in the screening pilot, has an overall positive Faecal Occult Blood test result is referred to a Specialist Nurse for explanation of their test result, potential investigations and their consequences.</p>

  <p>The patient then requires to make an informed choice about further investigations and following their agreement the nurse will refer them for a colonoscopy and where appropriate a barium enema. Following the diagnostic investigations, the patient will then follow the trust treatment protocols appropriate for their condition.

  <p>The membership of the Sounding Board and Academic Panel remains as reported in the answer given to question S1W-17829 on 30 August 2001, with the exception of Susan Dalgetty (who has withdrawn from the Sounding Board on taking up an appointment with the Scottish Executive) and Oonagh Aitken (who has been replaced by Albert Tait following her resignation as Chief Executive of COSLA and pending the appointment of a permanent replacement).</p>

  <p>Given that both bodies had been up and running for some months, it was decided that rather than add to their membership at this late stage, the views of other experts would instead be sought through bilateral contacts, city visits and the seminar programme as appropriate.</p>

  <p>Whilst opening Fife and Glenrothes Colleges' Institute of Applied Technology this morning I announced the new rates of support for students in further and higher education. I have, therefore, today placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre details of the rates of those loans, bursaries and grants, which will be available to eligible undergraduate and postgraduate students in full-time higher education in academic year 2002-03.</p>

  <p>A general uprating factor of 2.4%, in line with inflation, will be applied to the existing schemes of support in 2002-03, thus maintaining their value in real terms. We are also increasing by the same factor the standard rates of payment made to institutions by the Student Awards Agency for Scotland.</p>

  <p>These changes are consistent with those for England and Wales announced by the Secretary of State for Education and Skills.</p>

  <p>I am also delighted to announce today the introduction of a means-tested bursary of up to &#163;510 for young Scottish domiciled students from low-income families commencing full-time higher education courses elsewhere in the UK from August 2002. The full bursary will be available to students with a family income of &#163;15,360 or less. This will bring the spending power of these students into line with that of young Scottish students studying in Scotland, following the changes introduced last year, without increasing overall borrowing. The bursary will be available whether or not a student chooses to take out his or her full loan entitlement. We are also removing the anomaly whereby better-off parents are currently expected to contribute less if their children study elsewhere in the United Kingdom. From August 2002, the minimum loan for young students commencing courses outside Scotland will therefore be reduced to &#163;1,870. These changes can be introduced at no additional cost. The arrangements for these students otherwise remain unchanged.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Further Education Funding Council (SFEFC) has also agreed to maintain the alignment between the further and higher education sectors by, where appropriate, uprating the support available to further education students by 2.4%.</p>

  <p>SFEFC have also taken this opportunity to offer FE colleges some flexibility in the administration of the additional discretionary funding available to students.</p>

  <p>The selection of proposed sites where crops of GM spring-sown oilseed rape may be sown takes place independently of government. It is anticipated that the selected sites will be notified to the Scottish Executive and UK Government around 31 January and will be published immediately thereafter.</p>

  <p>The procedure for identifying possible trial sites and alerting the public to the proposals was detailed in a Scottish Executive News Release dated 18 January.</p>

  <p>NHS trusts have been reminded that maintaining rigorous hygiene and infection control practices in line with existing guidance are the key to controlling winter viruses in our hospitals.</p>

  <p>In addition, a new national system of surveillance of hospital-acquired infection has been established by the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health with funding from the Scottish Executive. The Executive is also investing in extra infection control training for nurses. Through the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland, new national standards have been set for the control of healthcare acquired infection. This year&rsquo;s first round of independent assessments of performance against this standard will lead to a report as soon as possible. These measures will help to ensure that current comprehensive guidance on infection control continues to be followed and that risks to patients and staff are reduced as far as possible.</p>

  <p>Comprehensive information on compliance with junior doctor hour&rsquo;s limits is not available prior to 1999 and does not reflect the current configuration of NHS Scotland (NHSS) Trusts or the current New Deal contract for junior doctors. The New Contract for junior doctors phases in compliance with New Deal hour&rsquo;s limits over a three-year period according to grade. Compliance for Pre Registration House Officers (PRHO) was made obligatory from 1 August 2001. Senior House Officers (SHO) and Specialist Registrars (SpR) are to be compliant from 1 August 2003.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the current configuration of NHSS Trusts (column A); and the number and percentage of compliant junior doctor posts declared by trusts for the period 1999-2001 (column B). These figures include the SHO and SpR grades for which New Deal compliance is not yet mandatory. Column C shows the % compliance of PRHO grades over the same period.</p>

  <p>The New Deal Implementation Support Group (ISG) was established by the Minister for Health and Community Care in September 1999 as a partnership arrangement between the Scottish Executive Health Department and the Scottish Junior Doctor Committee (SJDC) of the BMA. The group&rsquo;s remit is to work with NHSS trusts in identifying appropriate measures at local level to secure compliance with the New Deal.</p>

  <p>The work of the ISG has concentrated on obtaining increasingly accurate data on New Deal compliance by NHSS Trusts. These efforts are reflected in the levels of compliance recorded since 1999. NHSS Trusts, the Scottish Executive Health Department and the BMA all agree that current data on compliance is an accurate reflection of those posts that meet New Deal limits both on hours of work and rest.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the recommendations made in the report by the Accounts Commission for Scotland, <i>Full House &ndash; Theatre Utilisation in Scottish Hospitals</i> , have been implemented in full and what measures have been or will be put in place to ensure greater utilisation of hospital theatres.</p>

  <p>The Accounts Commission report <i>Full House - Theatre Utilisation in Scottish Hospitals</i> , which was published in June 1999, highlighted that hospitals were generally performing well in the delivery of services, but that there were variations in how well hospitals and surgical specialties used operating theatre time. The report made a number of recommendations for actions to maximise the use of NHSScotland theatre times.</p>

  <p>Theatre utilisation has an impact on waiting times experienced by NHSScotland patients. The Scottish Executive has made reducing waiting, particularly in the clinical priority areas of cancer and heart disease, a key priority for NHSScotland. NHS trusts are responsible for making plans and taking actions, including organising theatre capacity and availability, to achieve waiting times targets. Waiting times performance is monitored by the Health Department and NHS boards and trusts are held to account for their performance.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to be able to announce that the expert group's report, entitled <i>Adding Life to Years, </i> is published today. We are also publishing in association with it the results of a specially-commissioned MORI survey on public attitudes to the healthcare of older people and a report prepared by the Information and Statistics Division of the Common Services Agency which takes the form of a comprehensive examination of the demography, health and social circumstances of Scotland's older people over the next 30 years. Copies of each of these documents have been placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre.</p>

  <p>The work of the expert group will help us to take forward a key commitment, set out in <i>Our National Health, a plan for action a plan for change, </i>about addressing concerns regarding the healthcare of older people. Today's report tells us how we can make the shift in emphasis needed to put older people at the top of NHSScotland's agenda.</p>

  <p>To inform the review, two separate but related research projects were planned. The first was completed in June 2001 and concluded, among other things, that under half of all charges proved between April 1996 and March 2000 involving offending on bail attracted an aggravated sentence; that the practice of imposing aggravated sentences had declined slightly over that period; and that the greatest use of aggravated sentences was made by the High Court and sheriff solemn courts. The second research project is scheduled to commence in March and be completed early in 2003. We aim to complete the review in the middle of that year.</p>

  <p>The access provisions of the bill apply equally to the whole of Scotland and will not only provide the public with greater confidence to visit the Scottish countryside, but will result in more opportunities for them to do so by the creation of new paths. There is growing interest in outdoor recreation on the part of both Scots themselves and visitors from elsewhere. The legislation will help encourage greater participation in outdoor pursuits, creating opportunities for rural communities and bringing benefits to rural economies.</p>

  <p>The community right to buy will benefit rural communities in the North East, and throughout Scotland, by providing greater opportunities for them to determine their own future. It will enable them to register an interest in, and subsequently purchase, land with which they can demonstrate a connection. This will provide rural communities with a right to buy when the land which is subject to the registered interest comes to be sold, and time to raise the necessary funding. Community ownership of land can bring social, economic and environmental benefits to rural communities.</p>

  <p>The North East of Scotland parliamentary region should have the same opportunity to benefit from these proposals as other areas to which the legislation applies.</p>

  <p>We are not aware of any financial interest by East Lothian Council although it would be possible for the council to enter into an agreement with the developer for the provision of certain infrastructure associated with the development. This is standard practice where infrastructure improvements are required to support the development.</p>

  <p>The circumstances in which councils are required to notify a planning application to the Scottish ministers are given in SODD Circular 4/97, <i>Notification of Planning Applications</i>. These include any development in which the council has a financial or land interest where the proposal does not accord with the development plan or where there has been a substantial body of objection. It is for the council to consider the terms of any notification direction and to act accordingly. If the application is notified to the Scottish ministers, any decision to call it in will be based on a thorough assessment of the planning issues involved.</p>

  <p>It is for the planning authority to consider the terms of any direction requiring the notification of a particular planning application, or category of planning applications, to the Scottish ministers and to act accordingly. Where a planning authority failed to comply with such a direction, and issued planning permission, it could be leaving itself open to, for example, an application to the courts for judicial review of the planning decision, or possibly a complaint to the Ombudsman on the grounds of maladministration.</p>

  <p>An application to the Court of Session challenging a local plan may seek an interim order suspending such local plan either wholly or in part or generally or in relation to specific property owned by the applicant. If such an order were granted by the court it would have the effect of suspending the local plan to the extent set out in the order, and to that extent the planning authority would not be in a position to take the local plan or the relevant part of it into account in making a planning decision.</p>

  <p>Otherwise, it would be a matter for the planning authority to consider in the individual circumstances of each case whether or not it would be appropriate to make a planning decision taking into account a particular local plan in circumstances where although the local plan has been the subject of a court challenge, as yet undetermined, it has not actually been suspended.</p>

  <p>This report highlighted the commitment demonstrated by Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) to continuous improvement. The primary report made 17 recommendations as well as five suggestions for improvement in a variety of areas. Her Majesty&rsquo;s Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland (HMIC) found that six of the recommendations and three of the suggestions had been fully discharged. HMIC will, however, look for evidence of further development and improvement at the 3rd year review in the following areas:</p>

  <p>the arrangements for the annual performance review of senior staff;</p>

  <p>the consideration of the Director of SCRO&rsquo;s scheme of delegation as part of the repositioning of SCRO within a new common police services agreement;</p>

  <p>the development of outcome performance measures for each of the bureaux within SCRO;</p>

  <p>the development of an absence management policy, and</p>

  <p>the establishment of a service level agreement between SCRO and Strathclyde Joint Police Board detailing services and costs.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what action it is taking to implement the recommendations of the report prepared by the University of Aberdeen, <i>Pre-School Education Provision in Rural Areas</i> and, in particular, to address any gap between the number of eligible pre-school children and the provision of places in remote areas and any difficulties of access in intermediate areas, together with the level of costs involved, and to provide additional funding for the provision of pre-school provision in remote and intermediate areas.</p>

  <p>The findings of the report are based on data collected between October 1998 and June 1999. Since then, the number of three- and four-year-olds attending part-funded pre-school education has risen significantly across Scotland. All four-year-olds now have access to a funded part-time pre-school place, and we expect that all three-year-olds will have access to a place by April 2002.</p>

  <p>From April 2002, all local authorities will be placed under a duty to provide a free part-time pre-school education place to all three- and four-year-olds whose parents want one. To take account of the additional cost of pre-school provision in rural areas, the pre-school education grant, which from April 2002 will be re-integrated into the local government settlement, includes a rural weighting. For 2002-03, this rural weighting will be worth &#163;6.4 million.</p>

HMI inspections can include an examination of the existence and content of suitable anti-bullying policies in Scotland&rsquo;s schools.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Executive is working to reduce bullying in Scotland's schools by:</p>

  <p>funding the Scottish Anti-Bullying Network, which disseminates examples of good practice highlighting effective strategies for tackling<strong> bullying and provides information to</strong> <strong>teachers, parents and young people;</strong></p>

  <p>funding the Scottish Schools Ethos Network, which aims to encourage the creation of a positive ethos in schools;</p>

  <p>providing funding to underwrite ChildLine Anti-Bullying HelpLine, to ensure that the special bullying helpline continues as a free, confidential and excellent service to children in trouble, and</p>

  <p>the implementation of the 36 recommendations made by the Discipline Task Group, many of which will have a significant and positive impact on bullying in schools.</p>

  <p>The establishment of a single Scottish water authority represents the best means of ensuring sustainable employment in the public sector water industry in Scotland. Whatever the structure there is a need for substantial efficiency savings to deliver public health and environmental improvements whilst keeping customer charges under control. These efficiency savings would have been required of the three existing authorities in any case; the move to one authority should ease their delivery, and will therefore be a better guarantee of a long-term future for the public sector model.</p>
