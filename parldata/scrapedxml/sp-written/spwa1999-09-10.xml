  <p>We are currently reviewing and considering the possible options. We aim to build a system, including if necessary a judicial element, which fully meets the requirements of the ECHR. We will consult with industry before the end of the year about our plans and hope a new system will be introduced in time to deal with IACS 2000 applications.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive intends to construct a new index of rural deprivation using the detailed results of the next census of population which will take place in 2001. In the meantime, the Scottish Executive is exploring ways to examine rural deprivation by compiling proxy indicators from existing data sources, taking account, where possible, of population trends. Such information about rural Scotland will be supplemented with the results of the Scottish Household Survey as these become available early next year.</p>

  <p>It is for Drug Action Teams in both rural and urban areas to review the adequacy of local drug misuse services, and take steps to make the necessary provision available through the statutory agencies concerned.</p>

  <p>Local authorities in Scotland are budgeting to spend &pound;8.8 million on drugs and alcohol services in the community in this financial year, from a total social work budget of &pound;1.1 billion. In addition, some expenditure under other service headings will be drug related. Authorities received an increase in social work service provision of &pound;51.3m this year and will receive an additional &pound;43.4 million in 2000-01 and &pound;35.7 million in 2001-02.</p>

  <p>This year an additional &pound;2 million has been made available to Health Boards for drug treatment services. This brings the total funding in this financial year to &pound;11.3 million, (which does not include HIV/AIDS expenditure, some of which is drug related.) Health Boards are also free to draw down resources from other Hospital and Community Health Services budgets for drug misuse work, if required.</p>

  <p>Provision is being made for the support of the training and skills development sector during the transition period until the new Structural Funds programmes commence by the reallocation of unspent resources from the 1998 Objective 3 programme.</p>

  <p>I am very pleased to announce today, therefore, the provision of around &pound;8.5 million of European Social Fund grants for 388 projects. It is important to ensure that the capacity of training organisations is sustained in order to ensure that the new programmes have a smooth start.</p>

  <p>The appointment of my colleague Iain Gray as Deputy Minister for Community Care covering both health and social work responsibilities is a clear signal that the Scottish Executive is giving the need for co-ordination and joint working a very high priority. We have also reorganised the Scottish Executive to bring responsibilities for both the social work and health aspects of community care into one division within the Health Department.</p>

  <p>The Action Plan: Modernising Community Care set out a range of ways for local agencies to improve co-ordination and in particular calls for more locality based working through local partnerships. To encourage implementation &pound;5m was earmarked this year in incentive funding and we are monitoring progress. We will decide the level and distribution of the incentive fund for next year on the results of this.</p>

  <p>We plan to establish a single regulatory body to register and inspect residential and nursing homes, day care and home care.</p>

  <p>There is already some funding to pilot joint planning, funding and provision of community care. We are considering other possibilities, and ways of promoting joint training.</p>

  <p>The main criterion is to reach the decision which produces the highest quality of service for those children who require cardiac surgery. The other factors which we shall want to take into account are the effect of the decision on the range of other services currently provided at each hospital, as well as on the pattern of tertiary paediatric services in Scotland as a whole.</p>

  <p>Advice on the issue is being formulated by the Chief Executive of the NHS in Scotland and the Chief Medical Officer, based on work already carried out by National Services Division of the Common Services Agency and jointly by Greater Glasgow and Lothian Health Boards. The NSD work canvassed a broad range of opinion, including users of the service. To ensure that their advice is based on the clearest possible understanding of all the issues, the Chief Executive and CMO have recently met senior representatives of both Trusts and the Medical Schools in Edinburgh and Glasgow, as well as the 2 Health Boards.</p>

  <p>I expect to receive a report on this matter shortly and will announce my decision at that time.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will ensure that the 1999 Arable Area Payments will be made in October, as they were last year, and whether it will make representations to Her Majesty&rsquo;s Government to ensure that it will fill the funding gap which will occur when arable currency compensation becomes optional in 2000-01.</p>

  <p>We plan to make the vast majority of payments to Scottish farmers under the 1999 Arable Area Payments Scheme (AAPS) by 31 December 1999. We are aiming to issue the first tranche of payments for cereals, linseed, protein crops and set-aside on 18 October which is the earliest working day allowed under EU legislation. This date is subject to determination of the precise overshoot in the Scottish non-LFA which influences the final payment rates for this yield region.</p>

  <p>With regard to agrimonetary compensation, Member States have until the third quarters of 2000 and 2001 to notify the EU Commission of any intention to pay the optional 50% element to 1999 scheme recipients. The Scottish Executive will monitor the position and consult with the other UK Agricultural Departments nearer these times.</p>

  <p>The Intervention Board Executive Agency, whose Board answers to all the UK Agriculture Ministers, has procured storage facilities for this material at two sites in Scotland. Both the units, at Ratho and Glenrothes, have the required planning permission and statutory consents in accordance with the provisions of the Waste Management Licensing Regulations 1997.</p>

  <p>Both stores are secure, with padlocks and seals in place on all external doors. Officials of the Meat and Livestock Commission check security arrangements on a regular basis, and the seals can only be broken in their presence. Furthermore, officials from the Scottish Executive audit security on a monthly basis.</p>

  <p>Finally, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency monitor compliance with licensing conditions.</p>

  <p>The material will be held in secure storage until the Intervention Board Executive Agency, whose Board answers to all the UK Agriculture Ministers, has procured the capacity required to dispose of this material in a satisfactory manner.</p>

  <p>The Board has already awarded incineration contracts to three companies and is currently in negotiations with other interested parties. The Board estimate that the current stockpile of material will begin to be reduced at the beginning of the year 2000. They have been set a target of incinerating 60% of the MBM stocks produced under the cull by March 2002.</p>

  <p>Awards from the Lottery Sports Fund are matched by local authorities and fund the employment of a co-ordinator for one day per week. The pilot programme has highlighted that this arrangement has been very successful. Local authorities or schools are, however, able to expand the time commitment of co-ordinators if they wish to do so. Indeed, this has happened at Banchory Academy (3 days) and Portobello High School (2 days).</p>

  <p>In 1997 The Scottish Office commissioned consultants Deloitte &amp; Touche to examine future options for the provision of ferry services between Gourock and Dunoon. The report was received by the Government at the end of last year. One of the options was identified late in the research and the Government commissioned additional work to explore this more fully. This has now been received and I plan to publish the reports shortly.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is responsible for the A7 from Galashiels to the English Border. The A7 from Edinburgh to Galashiels is non-trunk and is therefore the responsibility of the local roads authorities.</p>

  <p>Some &pound;7.5 million has been spent on improvement measures on the A7 between the English Border and Hawick as part of a Route Action Plan. This included traffic calming and traffic management measures for Langholm town centre to mitigate the effects of trunk road traffic and improve road safety for pedestrians.</p>

  <p>A Route Action Plan study is also currently underway on the section of the route between Hawick and Galashiels which will identify local improvement schemes to improve safety and the environment along the route.</p>

  <p>Any further works on the A7 will be considered along with other proposals for trunk road improvement works.<br /></p>
