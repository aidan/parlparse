  <p>There is a range of both institutional and individual financial support packages available to disabled students studying within Scotland depending on whether the student is on a further or higher education course.</p>

  <p>Further education colleges in Scotland provide a broad range of courses including specialist courses for people with additional support needs as well as providing additional support for students on mainstream courses. Disabled students undertaking a further education course who have extra costs arising from their disability whilst at college in Scotland can apply for an Additional Support Needs for Learning Allowance. This allowance is not income assessed and following an assessment of needs the college decides the amount of allowance a student will receive.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have the discretionary power to pay bursaries to students studying further education outwith Scotland. Students studying non advanced courses at college in England may also be eligible for an Educational Maintenance Allowance or and Adult Learning Grant.</p>

  <p>The Disabled Students Allowance (DSA) is an non-income assessed allowance intended to cover the extra costs or expenses a student may have while undertaking a higher education course which arises because of their disability. Students can apply for this allowance if they are studying within Scotland or within the rest of the UK.</p>

  <p>Colleges and universities in the UK also have a responsibility under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (and as amended in 2005) to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that disabled students are not placed at a substantial disadvantage compared to non disabled students. This can include providing, within reason, equipment, services, appropriate access to buildings and that adjustments are made to teaching practices and assessments. This is an anticipatory duty which means that institutions need to consider adjustments for all types of disabilities.</p>

  <p>Institutions are expected to meet their statutory duties from the core funding which is allocated to them by the Scottish Funding Council. Institutions are also allocated additional funding through the Disabled Students Premium and Extended Learning Support to support all disabled students.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government encourages all colleges and universities in Scotland to offer flexible courses which respond to the needs of learners while continuing to offer a high quality and relevant learning experience.</p>

  <p>Additional support provided to students to attend college or university is based on the individual needs of the student and their needs for undertaking a particular course.</p>

  <p>Institutions are expected to provide and develop inclusive provision and to meet their statutory duties, for example under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (as amended in 2005), from the core funds which are allocated to them by the Scottish Funding Council. Institutions are also allocated additional funding through the Disabled Students Premium and Extended Learning Support to support disabled students.</p>

  <p>Disabled students can also apply for non income assessed individual allowances which are intended to cover any extra costs or expenses they may have while undertaking a course at college or university which arise as a result of their disability.</p>

  <p>We do not hold information on how many educational institutions in Scotland are specifically equipped to provide for students with cerebral palsy.</p>

  <p>Colleges and universities in Scotland are continuing to become more inclusive for all students. They undertake or arrange for an access centre to undertake a needs assessment in order to identify any specific support arrangements that are required for disabled students. These arrangements are made on an individual basis for the student and are based on their needs for undertaking a particular course.</p>

  <p>Colleges and universities in Scotland are continuing to work towards becoming more inclusive for all students including those with a disability.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continues to encourage further and higher education institutions to offer flexible provision which responds to the needs of the learner while continuing to offer a high quality and relevant learning experience.</p>

  <p>Institutions have a statutory duty under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (as amended in 2005) to publish their Disability Equality Schemes. Within many of these published schemes institutions have stated that they are aiming to provide inclusive learning environments and accessible curriculum for disabled students.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government and the Scottish Funding Council, in partnership with colleges and universities, are also undertaking two pilot schemes, one for students undertaking further education and one for students in higher education. The aims of these pilots are to improve the assessment processes involved in identifying a student&rsquo;s additional support needs for their particular course.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the location is of the nearest institution where Scottish students with cerebral palsy can study at higher or further education level; how much the attendance fees are, and what financial support the Scottish Government provides towards such fees.</p>

  <p>All institutions within Scotland are covered by the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (and as amended in 2005) and as such they are required to make reasonable adjustments to ensure that students with disabilities are not placed at a substantial disadvantage compared to non-disabled students. This can include providing, within reason, equipment, services, appropriate access to buildings and that adjustments are made to teaching practices and assessments.</p>

  <p>An individual can apply to any college or university in Scotland to undertake a course at further or higher education level as long as they meet the course entry requirements. Entry requirements vary depending on the nature and level of the course, however, they are normally based on the qualifications and experiences of the individual. The location of an institution is just one of the many considerations individuals take into account when choosing where to study.</p>

  <p>Attendance fees to undertake a further or higher education course at a college or university within Scotland are dependent upon the residency of the individual. An individual who is studying full time, who is ordinarily resident in Scotland and meets the residency criteria will have their fees paid for by either the Student Awards Agency for Scotland if they are undertaking a higher education course or by the Scottish Funding Council if they are undertaking a further education course.</p>

  <p>For a student studying part time or on a distance learning course at a Scottish college or university the student&rsquo;s fees can be waived if they are on a low income or receiving certain benefits, for example Disability Living Allowance, and the course they are studying qualifies for fee waiver from the Scottish Funding Council.</p>

  <p>I am pleased to announce the publication today of our paper <em>Changing Scotland&rsquo;s Relationship With Alcohol: A Discussion Paper on Our Strategic Approach</em> which sets out our measures to develop a comprehensive framework for tackling alcohol misuse.</p>

  <p>This government is ambitious for Scotland but the reality is that our relationship with alcohol is holding us back &ndash; as individuals, as families, as communities and as a country. But the evidence is clear &ndash; if we are to fulfil our ambitions, we must rebalance our relationship with alcohol. We have outlined a robust package of measures which together we believe can begin to change our relationship with alcohol for the better. We want to encourage people to contribute to the debate and discussion about how we can rebalance out relationship with alcohol for good.</p>

  <p>Copies of the discussion paper have been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 45788) and it can also be viewed online on the Scottish Government website at:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the sale, transportation and carrying of swords for the purposes of Scottish Highland dancing are exempt from the provisions of the Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007.</p>

  <p>The Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007 enables the Scottish ministers to prohibit the manufacture, sale, hire, etc of swords, and to make exceptions for legitimate religious, cultural and sporting purposes. No such prohibitions are yet in place. The policy memorandum for the bill made it clear that Scottish Highland dancing is recognised as a part of our rich cultural heritage and will be one of the exceptions to the general prohibitions. Highland dancers will therefore be able to continue buying swords for use at their classes and competitions.</p>

  <p>The Custodial Sentences and Weapons (Scotland) Act 2007 does not change the law on the carrying of swords in public. It is an offence under section 49 of the Criminal Law (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 1995 to have any article which has a blade or is sharply pointed in a public place without good reason or lawful authority. Any individual instance will be a matter for the police, and ultimately the courts, but transporting a highland dancing sword to and from classes or competitions would generally appear to be a &quot;good reason&quot;.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not available prior to March 2007 for all community health partnership areas. The tables present information as at March, June, September and December 2007. They do not represent the percentages of people in each Community Health Partnership who are registered.

  <p>A total of &pound;65.9 million was allocated to tackling drug misuse in 2007-08 under the Justice portfolio. This consisted of &pound;23.7 million for drug treatment and rehabilitation services; &pound;5 million to support the work of Drug Action Teams and centrally managed projects; &pound;14.1 million for criminal justice interventions, including Drug Treatment Testing Orders, and &pound;23.1 million to the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency to prevent and detect all forms of serious organised crime, which includes drug enforcement.</p>

  <p>In addition, significant resources were also spent on policing in Scotland and many police officers dealt with the effects of drug misuse.</p>

  <p>Significant resources outwith the Justice portfolio budget are also applied to tackling drug misuse. This includes expenditure by local authorities on services for those affected by drugs and/or alcohol misuse (&pound;42.3 million in 2006-07); additional expenditure by health boards on treatment services, from their unified budgets, and expenditure by local authorities on substance misuse education. The Audit Scotland inquiry into expenditure on drugs will assist in developing a full picture of current spend.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>*This is the total amount available for drug treatment and rehabilitation services and to support drug action teams and centrally managed initiatives. A decision will be made in due course about the division between the two areas of spend.</p>

  <p>**Whilst the SCDEA has a significant drug enforcement element, its statutory provisions are to prevent and detect all forms of serious organised crime so it is difficult to separate out the specific spend on drug matters. There is also a statutory requirement to consult on the Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency budget before it is allocated.</p>

  <p>Significant resources are also spent on policing in Scotland &ndash; currently over &pound;1.1 billion a year and the government is investing &pound;94 million over the next three years to deliver a more visible policing presence by recruiting 1,000 additional officers many of whom will be dealing with drug misuse.</p>

  <p>Significant resources outwith the Justice portfolio budget are also applied to tackling drug misuse. This includes expenditure by local authorities on services for those affected by drugs and/or alcohol misuse (&pound;42.3 million in 2006-07); additional expenditure by health boards on treatment services, from their unified budgets, and expenditure by local authorities on substance misuse education. The Audit Scotland inquiry into expenditure on drugs will assist in developing a full picture of current spend.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has provided guidance within <em>Included, Engaged and Involved Part 1: attendance in Scottish schools </em> which recognises that in some circumstances parents may condone absence due to difficulties in school. Guidance encourages early contact with parents through home-link workers or family support staff to build relationships and restore trust. Guidance also indicates that flexible arrangements to secure continued education should be a priority. <em>Included, Engaged and Involved</em> is available from <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/12/05100056/0" target="_blank">http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2007/12/05100056/0</a> .</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-06-17.S3W-13996.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80400" speakername="Maureen Watt" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0617.htm#8">

  <p>Whilst there is no specific statute or guidance which defines full time education, legislation does set out the parameters whereby education must be provided. Section 1(1) of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 sets out that every education authority has a duty to provide adequate and efficient school education for their area.</p>

  <p>School age is defined in section 31 of the same act as a person who has attained the age of five years and has not attained the age of 16 years and the Schools General (Scotland) Regulations 1975 require local authority schools to be open for 190 days each school year.</p>

  <p>The regulations do not define the precise length of the school day or week, which are matters left to the discretion of education authorities. A Scottish Executive Circular (No 4/2002) indicated that the widely accepted norm was a 25 hour week for primary schools and a 27.5 hours week for secondary schools.</p>

Over the next three years the Scottish Government will provide &pound;6 million across all boards to support the establishment of and access to these programmes.

  <p>The provision of &pound;25 million by the Scottish Government does not presuppose the construction of homes of a particular size or type. The Scottish Government has provided these funds as an encouragement to local authorities in the use of their own resources to fund new homes, and is currently discussing with COSLA the principles that will apply to the disbursement of these funds.</p>

  <p>I can confirm that the Scottish Government has opened discussions exploring the implications for Scotland of the national identity scheme, which includes plans for identity cards linked to a national identity register. The Scottish Government remains opposed to the introduction of compulsory identity cards, and the Parliament has voted against their use for accessing devolved services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has no evidence that First ScotRail was attempting to reduce passenger numbers. Under the &quot;cap and collar&quot; arrangements of the original agreement the franchisee was disincentivised to continue to grow the business once the 80% revenue share was reached, and the expectation was that in order to maintain margins it would instead seek to reduce costs, thereby impacting negatively on passenger growth.</p>

  <p>The previous Scottish Executive did not hold a definitive list of proposed new or refurbished school buildings because local authorities are directly responsible for strategic and future school estate plans and for commissioning school building work.</p>

  <p>The planning, procurement and then completion of construction work on school buildings involves long lead times, often spanning several years. Inevitably, therefore, some school building work will be planned or commenced during one parliamentary period but not funded/delivered until the next or later.</p>

  <p>Over the current four year parliamentary period, we expect around 250 schools to be built, funded or under construction.</p>

  <p>Some caution is needed when comparing figures between recorded crime and court proceedings as a person may be proceeded against for more than one crime and there is the possibility that the crime recorded by the police may be altered in the course of judicial proceedings. In addition a crime may be recorded by the police in one year and court proceedings concluded in a subsequent year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S3W-13505 by Michael Russell on 4 June 2008, whether the working group to develop the detail of new legislation to regulate the use of snares will be the same group as the PAW (Scotland) Legislation, Regulation and Guidance sub-group referred to in Natural Justice: A Joint Thematic Inspection of the Arrangements in Scotland for Preventing, Investigating and Prosecuting Wildlife Crime and what the membership and specific remit of that group will be.</p>

  <p>The PAW Scotland sub-group which &quot;Natural Justice&quot; recommended should be established would be an appropriate group for examining detailed issues relating to the laws regulating snaring as envisaged in the answer to S3W-13505.</p>

  <p>The membership and remit of the working group will be finalised over the coming months in consultation with the PAW Scotland steering group.</p>
