  <p>There has been a recent change in the way care services in Scotland are regulated. The Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001 set up the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care. National Care Standards covering a wide range of care services were published by Scottish ministers earlier this year, prior to the establishment of the Care Commission on 1 April 2002. The commission is required to take account of these standards in all decisions it takes under the act on the registration and inspection of care services.</p>

  <p>As part of its corporate plan for 2002-03 the Care Commission is committed to establishing a baseline of the size, number and complexity of each care service provision.</p>

  <p>Following publication of overall pass rates for 2002 showing a 2.2% drop at Higher level compared to the previous year, I asked the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) to undertake a more detailed analysis to ensure standards are being maintained across the exams system. This analysis indicated that a decrease in pass rates for English and communication and mathematics at Higher and Advanced Higher levels merited further consideration. The relevant SQA Assessment Panels have been asked to review and report on performance and assessment. The panels&#146; findings, together with principal assessors&#146; reports and marking schemes, will be published by the end of this month. The review focuses on key issues arising from this year&#146;s exam and will not include any detailed consideration of and comparison with pass rates for English and communication and mathematics in the SCE Higher grade exam and syllabus format.</p>

  <p>Units in the Standard Grade and Higher courses offer many opportunities to study aspects relating to Scottish figures and issues. However, it is important that young people learn about Scotland&#146;s history in a UK, European and international context to understand better Scotland&#146;s role in the world. Therefore, Standard Grade and Higher history courses should comprise a balance between Scottish, UK, European and international examples.</p>

  <p>I am advised by the Food Standards Agency that there is currently no definition in European law of GM-free for any food. However, the introduction of such a term is currently being considered in Europe and this is supported by the UK including all devolved administrations.</p>

  <p>In 2001, a survey of progress by NHSScotland in implementing Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidelines was carried out by a sub-group of the Clinical Resource and Audit Group (CRAG) and a summary report was published in July 2002. A copy of the report can be found on the CRAG website at: <a href="http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/crag/" target="_blank">http://www.show.scot.nhs.uk/crag/</a> .</p>

  <p>This survey demonstrated that the implementation of SIGN guidelines is widespread throughout NHSScotland. Targeted dissemination of guidelines routinely occurs in almost all trusts, and most trusts have an explicit strategy for implementing guidelines following dissemination. As recommended in previous studies on methods of implementing evidence-based medicine, a combination of approaches (appropriate to local circumstances) has been used in the service. However, the survey also demonstrated that the implementation of individual guidelines was highly variable. A number of success factors and barriers to implementation were identified, many of which were applicable to a number of trusts.</p>

  <p>Although the implementation of SIGN guidelines will continue to be the responsibility of trusts, the introduction of unified NHS boards and Board Clinical Governance committees provides an opportunity to facilitate successful implementation, and to overcome barriers.</p>

  <p>In addition, assessment visits carried out by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland monitor compliance with condition-specific and clinical governance (&quot;generic&quot;) standards. These assessments will ensure that procedures are in place to implement SIGN and other relevant evidence-based guidance.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the value of the investment made by private owners in securing the conservation of the built heritage and, through Historic Scotland, works in partnership with both private and other public funding agencies.</p>

  <p>The historic building repair grants scheme, administered by Historic Scotland, provides financial help for the repair and conservation of building of outstanding architectural or historic interest. Resources from the scheme generally work in harness with other sources of funding. In 2001-02, grants amounting to &#163;7.3 million were awarded and were successful in attracting &#163;6.2 million of private investment and &#163;21.7 million from other public funding sources.</p>

  <p>The Yellow Card Scheme underpins drug safety monitoring in the UK. Reports of suspected adverse drug reactions are submitted to the Committee on Safety of Medicines and the Medicines Control Agency (MCA), jointly responsible for running the scheme.</p>

  <p>The MCA advise that although it is possible to calculate the number of reports received for drugs indicated for use in mental health problems, it is not readily possible to derive from this information a meaningful estimate of the percentage of doctors submitting such reports. This is because the level of reporting is variable and health care professionals other than doctors may have submitted a proportion of the reports. The scheme invites reports from all doctors, regardless of speciality, dentists, pharmacists and, in some circumstances, nurses. Information about the Yellow Card Scheme can be found on the MCA&#146;s website at: <a href="www.mca.gov.uk" target="_blank">www.mca.gov.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for distributing proceeds from the National Lottery rests with the Lottery Distributing Bodies, including the New Opportunities Fund.</p>

  <p>The New Opportunities Fund's New Opportunities for PE and Sport (NOPES) Initiative provides funding for the building or modernisation of indoor and outdoor sports and adventure facilities for school and community use, as well as for out of school hours sporting, cultural and outdoor education activities for children and young people, and for projects that use sport to divert children and young people from crime.</p>

  <p>After extensive consultation with key stakeholders, including the Scottish Executive, a provisional sum of funding was allocated to each local authority area and local authorities were asked to work with a wide range of organisations, including national youth organisations, to compile portfolios of suitable projects which reflected local needs and priorities, as well as relevant local strategies and plans (such as School Development Plans, Sports Developments Plans, Health Improvement Plans).</p>

  <p>The NOPES Initiative closed applications on 20 September 2002. One of the criteria that applications will be judged against is the mechanisms that will be put in place to enable partners in projects, including national youth organisations, to participate on an equal basis.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for Scottish Water. The Chief Executive&#146;s response is as follows:</p>

  <p>Scottish Water contracts a wide variety of services from construction to IT support to estate management. It is estimated that in relation to Scottish Water&#146;s capital programmes (a) 50 contractors have been appointed for 91 contracts and 12 partnerships have been awarded 34 packages of work, (b) between five and eight tenders are received each month, (c) 125 contracts have been awarded at a value of &#163;42 million, with an additional &#163;261 million previously committed by the three water authorities and (d) 125 contracts have commenced.</p>

  <p>Recent guidance on sex education, contained in Circular 2/2001, <i>Standards in Scotland's Schools etc. Act: Conduct of Sex Education in Scottish Schools</i> offers a set of principles and aims for sex education which provides a framework within which issues of childhood sexual abuse could be raised. Sex education programmes should provide opportunities for children and young people to develop personal and interpersonal skills that will enable them to make and maintain appropriate relationships within the family, with friends and within the wider community. Programmes should also foster self-awareness and self-esteem and a sense of responsibility and respect for themselves and for others.</p>

  <p>Child Protection Circular 10/95 also provides teachers and staff with guidance. A review of this circular has just commenced and an updated circular is planned by spring 2003.</p>

  <p>A review has been undertaken of the assessment and recording process for pupils with special educational needs and, after consultation, proposals for change were published in <i>Assessing our children&#146;s educational needs: The Way Forward?</i> . Copies are available from the Parliament&#146;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 19469). These proposals are now being developed further, with input from service users and providers and the Executive expects to publish a draft bill early next year. We aim to modernise the framework for supporting pupils with additional needs, strengthen parents&#146; involvement in decisions affecting their child&#146;s education and safeguard the rights of pupils with the most complex needs.</p>

  <p>We plan to replace the Records of Needs with a more flexible co-ordinated support plan for the most vulnerable pupils. The new plan will focus more on support to help the pupil achieve long term learning outcomes rather than the current emphasis in the Record of Needs on assessment and on the failings of the child or young person. It will build on the individual planning mechanisms for pupils, such as the Individualised Educational Programmes, and will improve the co-ordination of the range of services that these pupils with complex needs require. The Co-ordinated Support Plan will have legal status and will be reviewed regularly, whenever required. Parents will be able to appeal its contents, including provision, to a new independent Additional Support Needs Tribunal. Parents will also be able to appeal to the tribunal education authorities&#146; decisions about opening, reviewing and closing Co-ordinated Support Plans.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware of the need for pupils to be able to raise matters of concern. This must be balanced with the need to protect individual teachers against malicious allegations. This balance would not be served if local authorities were inhibited from investigating or acting on allegations due to the fear of being sued for defamation.</p>

  <p>The concept of qualified privilege operates when there is a duty on a person to speak openly. Qualified privilege means that a defamation action can only be successful if a court finds that the allegation was false and was made with malicious intent. We consider that this generally provides sufficient protection for pupils making allegations in good faith.</p>

  <p>Over the past four years, in partnership with the UK government, we have taken action to raise the incomes of families, especially for those on the lowest incomes. We have set the long-term objective of ending child poverty within a generation in partnership with the UK government. Since then, we have made significant progress towards that aim, improving the lives, prospects, and opportunities of children and young people. We are committed to ensuring that all children get the best possible start in life. Early intervention like the Sure Start Scotland programme will enable them to make the most of subsequent opportunities including pre-school education. Under the Spending Review we are providing an extra &#163;31 million for Sure Start Scotland by 2006, bringing the total spend to &#163;50 million that year.</p>

  <p>We are also taking steps to reduce child income poverty by giving parents real opportunities to increase their incomes: by getting more parents into work through support for New Deal programmes, by providing affordable child care for parents, and through supporting education and training programmes. This is underpinned by the work of the UK Government, modernising the tax and benefit system and making work pay.</p>

  <p>Help with child care costs is also available through the Childcare Tax Credit element of Working Families Tax Credit. Take-up in Scotland is currently around &#163;30 million.</p>

  <p>Pre-school education resources amounting to &#163;137 million were re-integrated into the local government settlement from financial year 2002-03. This is to assist local authorities meet their new duties under the Standards in Scotland&#146;s Schools Act (2000), to secure a free part-time pre-school education place for all three- and four-year-olds whose parents wish one.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive's Childcare Strategy aims to provide affordable accessible, quality child care to help parents into work and training. The Executive is providing local authorities with Childcare Strategy funding of &#163;16.75 million this year which will increase by &#163;23.9 million in the period up to 2006.</p>

  <p>Funding amounting to &#163;25.3 million is also available under the New Opportunities Fund Out of School Hours Childcare Initiative 1999-2003, designed to create new out of school care for children aged 3 to 14.</p>

  <p>The NOF Childcare Initiative 2003-2006 amounting to &#163;14.5 million, which was launched on 16 September, will have a particular focus on disadvantaged communities and vulnerable families.</p>

  <p>&#163;25.5 million was allocated to local authorities between 2000 and 2003-04 for community-based programmes to help young people stop offending. On 18 September, I announced that the Executive would continue to invest resources to support the 10-Point Action Plan. &#163;8 million, &#163;24 million and &#163;33 million will be provided over the next three years. An additional EYF allocation of &#163;15 million is also being made available this year.</p>

  <p>Shepherd and Wedderburn has provided and continues to provide legal advice on contractual and other issues in connection with Flour City Architectural Metals (UK) and Flour City International. This includes instructing an agent to make inquiries in the USA. The corporate body is expecting a further report from Shepherd and Wedderburn and the agent, after which I shall write further to the member. No other firm has been providing advice to the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body on this matter.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer what the prospect is of the recovery of losses from Flour City International Inc. and whether any further expenditure on legal expenses to attempt such recovery would be financially worthwhile, detailing the reasons for the position on this matter.</p>

  <p>The legal directorate has instructed Shepherd and Wedderburn to examine the issues and report on the prospects of recovery against Flour City International. A report is expected to be considered by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) within the next two months. The SPCB considers that it has a duty, in the public interest, to examine carefully the prospects of recovery, and to obtain expert opinion, before reaching a final decision on legal action.</p>

  <p>To ask the Presiding Officer whether a performance bond was required for each of the works packages let as part of the Holyrood Project; whether such a bond was provided, and whether any claim under any such bond has been made or is under consideration.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2002-09-26.S1W-29132.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80277" speakername="Sir David Steel" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-02/wa0926.htm#48">

  <p>There are a number of mechanisms adopted within the workings of all trade packages, which ensure that the client&#146;s interests are suitably protected. The purpose of a performance bond is to provide a limited indemnity for the client from a surety in extreme cases of non-performance. Performance bonds provide, in the event of non-performance, for a recovery of 10% of the contract sum in return for a premium of 1%. The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body sought performance bonds for 33 works packages, on the recommendation of the construction manager. Seventeen bonds were obtained, and of the 16 outstanding, at least eight are no longer required since the perceived risk has passed. No claims have yet been made and none are presently under consideration. Performance bonds are not provided readily by contractors and are usually the subject of prolonged negotiation of terms with a third party surety. To delay a contract due to lack of agreement on the wording of a bond could expose the client to a far greater risk in terms of cost and time than the risk that the bond is trying to protect.</p>

  <p>1. From 1 September; records were not kept before that date.</p>

  <p>2. The figures show the number of visitors who accessed the public gallery of the chamber but, because access and egress of visitors is a continuous process, it is not possible to identify total numbers in the gallery at any one time.</p>
