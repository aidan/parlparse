  <p>The management and operation of Dungavel House Immigration Removal Centre is the responsibility of the Home Office. Scottish ministers are responsible for ensuring our actions are compatible with the ECHR and the Human Rights Act 1998 as incorporated into Scots law. Responsibility for the actions of the Home Office (including the ECHR compatibility of those actions) in a reserved area is of course a matter for the Home Office on which it would not be appropriate for us to comment.</p>
