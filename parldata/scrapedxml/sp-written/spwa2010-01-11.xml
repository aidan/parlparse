  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive for what reason patients in the North of Scotland Cancer Network have to wait up to 131 days for an urgent referral for suspected melanoma and up to 147 days for a routine wait.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-01-11.S3W-30039.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80396" speakername="Nicola Sturgeon" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0111.htm#1">

  <p>Patients in the North of Scotland Cancer Network (NOSCAN) do not routinely wait as long as 131 days from urgent referral to first melanoma treatment. The latest published statistics show that for patients diagnosed with melanoma between April and June 2009 in NOSCAN, the median wait was 18 days, showing that half the patients received first treatment in that time. The 90th percentile was 46 days, showing that 90% of patients waited for a maximum of 46 days.</p>

  <p>Full explanations of the specific waits queried cannot be provided as this could lead to the patients being identified. However, some cancer journeys can take longer than the average patient pathway. In some instances, clinical teams may conclude that it is not in the best interests of the patient to be expedited along a pathway solely for the purpose of complying with a target. There is a 5% tolerance applied to the target to accommodate these circumstances.</p>

  <p>Patients with malignant melanomas are not always referred urgently as they can be undistinguishable from other lesions. Routine referrals do not come under any cancer access target, however this is changing as a result of the new access target announced in Better Cancer Care (a target of 31 days from decision to treat to first treatment) to be delivered by December 2011.</p>

  <p>Improvement work is taking place across cancer services to help meet this target.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it has had discussions regarding the introduction of a living wage of &pound;7 per hour for all civil service staff.</p>

  <p>As part of their 2008 pay claim relating to staff below senior civil service level, in the core Directorates and Agencies which make up the Scottish Government main pay bargaining unit, the recognised trade unions sought a common minimum pay rate of &pound;8 per hour. Although the Public and Commercial Services union subsequently withdrew from pay discussions, the other two unions &ndash; Prospect and the FDA &ndash; agreed to a three-year pay award from 1 August 2008 to 31 July 2011. In line with the Scottish Government&rsquo;s public sector pay policy, the pay award took positive steps to deal with low pay and, in particular, to ensure the minimum rate of pay for the lowest paid staff was comfortably above the national minimum wage. The current lowest rate of pay in Scottish Government main is &pound;6.53 per hour (compared to the national minimum wage rate of &pound;5.80) and this will increase to &pound;7.23 per hour on 1 August 2010. We believe that these rates of pay strike a balance between providing value for money for the taxpayer and recruiting, retaining and motivating the lowest paid staff.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has had no such discussions with COSLA. Partnership for Renewables is a commercial venture led by Carbon Trust Enterprises Ltd and as such, any decision to work with them would be a matter for either COSLA or individual local authorities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government works with the Carbon Trust to help Scottish public bodies of all sizes to reduce their energy consumption and cut emissions through the Carbon Management Programme. As of May 2009, 49 organisations had completed the programme, including all local authorities and the Scottish Government itself.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also committed to working closely with COSLA to ensure local authorities play their part in meeting our targets for renewable energy and carbon emissions. For example, COSLA is strongly represented in the Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland (FREDS), a partnership of government, industry and academia which is working to deliver our Renewables Action Plan.</p>

  <p>Two cases of suspected Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) have been reported to the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), following H1N1 vaccination in the UK to date. There is no evidence across Europe of any vaccine-associated GBS. GBS is a naturally occurring condition and it is inevitable that cases will occur not long after vaccination, without the vaccine playing a role. This is particularly so over the winter period when pathogens that may cause GBS are circulating.</p>

  <p>The MHRA does not provide information on the location of these cases, given the very small numbers may mean that individuals could be identified.</p>

  <p>Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) usually develops quickly, over a few days, but can sometimes develop gradually over a period of up to four weeks. Symptoms first appear one to three weeks after a minor infection, such as a cold or sore throat.</p>

  <p>Initial symptoms tend to start in the feet and hands and include tingling, numbness, unsteadiness and progressive muscle weakness. These symptoms soon spread up the limbs, affecting the legs and arms a few days later. Some people only have a mild form of the condition and their symptoms do not get any worse than a general feeling of weakness.</p>

  <p>In some cases, the muscle weakness progresses to temporary paralysis of the legs, arms and face, temporary paralysis of the respiratory muscles that control breathing, difficulty with eye movement and speech, difficulty with chewing or swallowing, difficulty with bladder control or digestion and slow heart rate or low blood pressure.</p>

  <p>The extent of paralysis varies with each case of GBS but the most serious cases can paralyse respiratory muscles and stop the patient from breathing.</p>

  <p>Guillain-Barr&eacute; Syndrome (GBS) affects approximately 1,500 people in the UK every year. The trend in the number of new cases of GBS diagnosed in Scotland does not show a statistically significant increase between 1999 and 2008. Complete data for 2009 is not yet available.</p>

  <p>The Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency (MHRA) monitor all reports of side effects and publish weekly reports outlining these cases. There have been two suspected cases of Guillain-Barr&eacute; syndrome (GBS) reported in the UK to-date following H1N1 vaccination. Further information is awaited in order to fully assess diagnostic certainty. There is no evidence across Europe of any vaccine associated risk of GBS.</p>

  <p>The current condition of the two patients is unknown, however these cases were reported as not fatal. Eight in 10 people with GBS make a full recovery within a few weeks or months. One in 10 people become wheelchair-bound, or have permanent weakness or numbness. There is a 5% mortality rate from GBS.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many council houses occupied by one person have (a) two bedrooms, (b) three bedrooms and (c) four bedrooms, broken down by local authority.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-01-11.S3W-29832.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80370" speakername="Alex Neil" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0111.htm#7">

  <p>The best source of data on household size by number of bedrooms is the Scottish House Condition Survey. Due to the size of sample in this survey, it is necessary to combine data from different years to get reasonable sample sizes for local authority areas.</p>

  <p>The following table shows the number of single-person households in council housing with more than one bedroom, by local authority and based on Scottish House Condition Survey data for 2005-06, 2007 and 2008 combined.</p>

  <p>As these figures come from a survey, the figures are estimates and are also rounded to the nearest thousand. The 95% confidence interval is generally about +/- 1,000 for each local authority figure and about +/- 4,000 for Scotland. The 95% confidence interval is used to determine a range of values within which we believe the true value lies, for example we believe the Scotland total to actually lie somewhere between 81,000 and 89,000 households. The sample size for all of the individual local authority data is very small and therefore these results should be treated with caution.</p>

  <p>As no housing associations have yet drawn down their share of the &pound;70 million allocated to them by The Housing Finance Corporation, it is too soon to know the interest rate obtained by each of them from the European Investment Bank. The timing of any draw down of funds is a matter for individual associations and The Housing Finance Corporation.</p>

  <p>No. NHS Scotland has now received the total supplies required to vaccinate all those in the initial at-risk priority groups. They have also received all of the vaccine supply required to vaccinate children over six months and under five years in the second phase of the programme.</p>

  <p>The H1N1 vaccination programme was launched on 21 October 2009 and has proceeded with a phased roll out initially. The programme is progressing well and health boards have indicated that vaccination has been offered to all those in the initial priority groups and a mop up exercise is taking place to the end of January.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government anticipates that the second phase of the programme will be completed by the end of January with some mop up activity into mid-February.</p>

  <p>At the start of the vaccination programme, patients in the at-risk groups were asked to wait until they were contacted by their GP before making an appointment to have their vaccination. Health boards have indicated that vaccination has been offered to all those in the initial priority groups and a mop up exercise is taking place until the end of January. Anyone who is in the initial priority groups who had not yet has their vaccination is invited to contact their GP practice to arrange an appointment now.</p>

  <p>Phase two of the programme is offering vaccination to all children aged over six months and under five years. Vaccination of these children has commenced and will continue over the coming weeks. Parents of young children will be contacted by their health board or GP practice and invited for vaccination. We are asking parents to wait until they receive an invitation before contacting their GP practice in order to ensure that phone lines are free for emergency calls.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has also set up the Scottish Swine Flu Vaccination Helpline (08000 28 28 16) for patients seeking further information about the H1N1 vaccination. This is in addition to the NHS 24 helpline (08454 24 24 24) for anyone who thinks they may have swine flu. Both helplines are available to provide patients with accurate information whilst relieving the demand on GP practices.</p>

  <p>There are currently no plans to build a tram line from Fife to Edinburgh Airport via South Queensferry.</p>

  <p>However, intervention 25 of the Strategic Transport Projects Review (STPR) has recommended the provision of a light rapid transit system, initially bus-based over the Forth, providing improved connections across the Forth Estuary between the communities of Fife and the business and commercial opportunities in Edinburgh (including outlying areas such as Edinburgh Airport) and West Lothian.</p>

  <p>The detailed design and development of this intervention and its subsequent delivery will be subject to future spending reviews.</p>
