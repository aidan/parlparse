  <p>The Accountant in Bankruptcy does not hold records of sequestrations by age. However, the Accountant in Bankruptcy undertook an exercise to extract what data could be retrieved manually.</p>

  <p>The data available covers the period 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2006. During that period there were 11,354 awards of sequestration on debtor petitions. Of those, 8,965 contained details of the debtor&rsquo;s date of birth (79%). Of those there were 563 cases in which the debtor was aged 16 to 24 at the date of sequestration (6.3% of cases recording a date of birth, 5.0% of all cases). The youngest debtor was 18 years old at the date of sequestration.</p>

  <p>The following table breaks these down by financial year. For reference, it includes published figures on total insolvencies for the financial years 2000-01 to 2004-05. Figures for 2005-06 are included but these have not yet been published by the Accountant, therefore when final published figures are available there may be some small variance.</p>

  <p>Forth Ports plc, as statutory harbour authority under the Forth Ports Authority Order Confirmation Act 1969, is the main organisation carrying out dredging operations in the Firth of Forth. In certain cases, e.g. when dredging within 50 yards of a bridge, pipe, submarine cable etc, Forth Ports is obliged to provide interested organisations with no less than 28 days written notice of its intention to do so. If such operations involve the sea disposal of dredge material then a licence is also required under Part II of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985 (Deposits in the Sea) (FEPA). Fisheries Research Services, Marine Laboratory at Aberdeen (FRS) acts as the FEPA licensing authority on behalf of the Scottish ministers. While there is no requirement for public consultation under FEPA, FRS routinely consults Scottish Natural Heritage, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and local fishermen via the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency about all applications received.</p>

  <p>Information is not held centrally on the full range of dredging operations undertaken. Depending on the nature of the method used, some dredging operations may not fall under FEPA and so will not come to the attention of FRS. Such operations are however likely to be very localised and small in scale.</p>

  <p>Over the past three years there have been 10 routine (maintenance dredging) and two non-routine (capital dredging) licensed operations involving the sea disposal of dredge material within the Firth of Forth. FEPA sea disposal licences are usually issued for a period of one calendar year. Details of dredge material disposal operations within the Firth of Forth that have been licensed over the past three years are given in the following table:</p>

  <p>In addition, following extensive consultation with interested stakeholders, the Crown Estate granted Westminster Gravels Ltd a 10 year Aggregate Production Licence commencing in January 2001 for the extraction of up to 6,000,000 cubic metres of aggregates from within the &quot;Middle Bank&quot; area of the Firth of Forth. The only material extracted under this licence to date was in early November 2005 when 129,387 tonnes was removed in order to supply infill material for the Leith Western Dock Reclamation Project.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether dredging operations in the Firth of Forth are subject to review under regulation 50 of the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp;c.)

  <p>Dredging operations in the Firth of Forth are not subject to review under the Conservation (Natural Habitats &amp;c) Regulations 1994. As a matter of law, only plans or projects covered by regulations 53 &ndash; 85 of the Regulations are subject to the specific obligations at regulation 50. However, regulation 3(4) of those Regulations requires every competent authority, in the exercise of its functions, to have regard to the requirements of the Habitats Directive (92/42/EEC) so far as they may be affected by those functions. Competent authorities are therefore obliged to comply with the procedures and requirements specified in Article 6 of the Directive, whether or not they are also bound by other obligations.</p>

  <p>Accordingly no competent authority may agree to a plan or project unless it has ascertained that (a) the plan or project will have no significant effect on a European site, or that (b) the integrity of the site will not be adversely affected, or that (c) site integrity will be adversely affected but that there is no alternative solution and the plan or project must be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest. This legal obligation, and the associated procedural requirements, apply irrespective of whether the competent authority is operating under Regulation 3(4) or Regulations 53A to 85.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) is not required under legislation to be consulted on routine dredging operations in the Firth of Forth. However, SNH is consulted annually on the routine disposal of dredged material from operations which require a Sea Disposal Licence under Part II of the Food and Environment Protection Act 1985.</p>

  <p>Advice from SNH is that current routine dredging operations are unlikely to be having a significant effect on the Natura sites within the Firth of Forth because when the sites were designated the conservation status of the sites was of a quality to merit designation even though these dredging operations had been taking place routinely for some time before designation and also due to the fact that routine dredging operations take place in a few specific localities.</p>
