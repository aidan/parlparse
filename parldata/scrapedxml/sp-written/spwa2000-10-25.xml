  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises that the continuing growth and development of air freight is vital to the Scottish economy. The enterprise networks are working with Scottish airports, Scottish industry and freight carriers to build on the strong growth seen in air freight traffic over the last 10 years.</p>

  <p>The previous answer related to the Corncrake UK Biodiversity Action Plan. In addition to the costs identified, the Scottish Executive has incurred costs through its agri-environment programme. Payments are made to farmers and crofters through the Argyll Islands and the Machair Environmentally Sensitive Area schemes (ESAs) and elsewhere through the Countryside Premium Scheme (CPS). In each case these are payments for general grassland bird measures and it is not possible to disaggregate the costs of particular species.</p>

  <p>Additionally, total net expenditure by the Scottish Biodiversity Group since 1997 in support of the annual seminars of the steering group of the Corncrake UK Biodiversity Action Plan is &pound;2,102.17.</p>

  <p>Cancer is one of the Scottish Executive health priorities and a specific research priority.</p>

  <p>a) Over the last three financial years, the Scottish Executive has awarded the following funding in cash terms to cancer research:</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1.<strong> </strong>A breakdown of total awards made to cancer research projects in 1997-98, 1998-99 and 1999-2000 by cancer type is provided in the table below. Details on individual projects, which may run for up to three years, are available from the National Research Register (NRR), a copy of which is in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICe).</p>

  <p>2.<strong> </strong>Programmes of research which are supported in the NHS in Scotland can be very broad and encompass a range of subjects. Because of this, we are not able to provide a figure/percentage spend on cancer for 1997-98 and, for 1998-99, we are able to provide only a broad estimate. For 1999-2000, however, we asked NHS providers to specify spend on priority areas, like cancer, separately.<strong> </strong>We are unable to provide a breakdown by cancer type.</p>

  <p>3.<strong> </strong>The Scottish Cancer Therapy Network aims to ensure that optimal treatment is available to all cancer patients in Scotland. Its work includes involvement in trials, developing guidelines about cancer management/treatment and auditing the impact of these guidelines.</p>

  <p>4.<strong> </strong>This one-off initiative funds<strong> </strong>capital equipment items to support general research on cancer.</p>

  <p>In addition to its own research programme, the Scottish Executive Health Department collaborates with other UK Health Departments and the Medical Research Council (MRC) to develop and maintain an effective partnership for the promotion, funding and management of UK medical research. The MRC is the main agency through which the UK Government supports biomedical and clinical research and it is estimated to spend around &pound;28.5 million per year directly on research into cancer. The results of the projects undertaken throughout the UK will inform the future direction of research and treatment of this disease.</p>

  <p>The MRC also funds a large body of basic research including the study of molecules and cells, genetics, and injections and immunity, which will underpin advances in cancer research as well as other diseases.</p>

  <p>b) At present, the Scottish Executive funds research mainly by response-mode and therefore cannot supply an estimate of future funding on cancer. Its current research funding mechanisms are, however, under review and one aim of the review is to ensure that priority areas such as cancer are adequately resourced.</p>

  <p>Scottish Ministers have powers under the Highlands and Islands Shipping Services Act 1960 to maintain and improve sea transport services serving the Highlands and Islands and those powers are used to support lifeline services currently provided by Caledonian MacBrayne and P&amp;O. Under the terms of the Scotland Act 1998, Scottish Ministers do not have powers to award financial assistance to public transport ferry services which start or finish or both outside Scotland. Financial assistance for such services is therefore a matter for the Scotland Office.</p>

  <p>However, given the prospect that re-establishment of the ferry service between Campbeltown and Ballycastle could provide economic benefits to the Campbeltown area, Scottish Ministers support current efforts led by Scotland Office Ministers to re-establish this route; and to seek the European Commission&#8217;s agreement that it should be operated on a public service obligation basis, enabling public subsidy to be made available in compliance with state aid rules.</p>

  <p>Detailed arrangements for the provision of subsidy are dependent on agreement that the service may be operated on a public service obligation basis. The Scotland Office and other interested parties are presently considering an appropriate funding mechanism that would be consistent with state aid rules.</p>

  <p>1999 was an important year for Scottish further education, with the establishment of the Scottish Further Education Funding Council and a major injection of new funding to expand educational opportunities within a new Scotland.</p>

  <p>Our goal of widening access to further education, particularly for those from disadvantaged backgrounds, is being realised. We have set a target of an additional 40,000 college student places by 2002. This is a key part of delivering our social justice agenda and of building a well skilled workforce to underpin Scotland&#8217;s future economic competitiveness and prosperity.</p>

  <p>In addition we recently outlined our new three-year Spending Review that will see annual funding for further education rise over the five years 1999-2004 by over 50%, to &pound;436 million.</p>

  <p>This underlines our vision of Scotland as a learning nation, where lifelong learning opportunities are accessible to everyone. Education improves people&#8217;s prospects of sustainable employment and a better quality of life. The further education colleges are central to delivering this.</p>

  <p>Some health boards have produced helpful material on coronary heart disease, including information on the symptoms of a heart attack and what action to take. As part of the long-running Heart Campaign in Grampian, the health board&#8217;s Health Promotions Organisation gives wide circulation to an information card produced by the Health Education Board for Scotland, which provides basic information about risks and symptoms. Another example of good practice in providing the information mentioned in the question is <i>My Heart Book</i> , issued in May 2000 by Greater Glasgow Health Board. The Scottish Executive commends these approaches.</p>

  <p>The pilot local Managed Clinical Network for cardiac services in Dumfries &amp; Galloway has a public involvement working group, with active participation of members of the public. It is considering the information needed by the public on all aspects of CHD, and how best to make this available. This work will cover the point raised in the question, and the Scottish Executive will then consider how the lessons learned from the pilot can most effectively inform the provision of information on cardiac matters at national level.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Care Information (SCI) Programme will produce computer software products which NHS Trusts can use in conjunction with their own or commercial software to support priority activities, to enable information about a patient to be shared by clinical staff within the Trust or with the patient&#8217;s GP and to serve as the basis for the Electronic Patient Record and Electronic Health Record.</p>

  <p>In conjunction with other related initiatives, SCI will provide healthcare professionals with the right information where it is needed. Faster outpatient booking process is expected and improved exchange of information between primary and secondary care resulting in more appropriate referrals and more effective transfer of information on discharge from secondary care. Patients will benefit from not having to repeatedly give the same information to different parts of the same organisation and will have the reassurance that the clinicians have appropriate access to their clinical history. The benefits to NHS include better value for money for IM&amp;T investment and the provision of IT systems and standards which have a high degree of compatibility.</p>

  <p>There are five pharmaceutical manufacturers supplying the UK market during the coming flu season. The Executive has been in contact with each manufacturer regarding their flu vaccine programme, and we understand that distribution of the vaccines will take place in Scotland between late September and mid-late October. It is difficult to be precise because, as biological products, vaccines have to undergo independent stringent safety tests before they are able to be released onto the market. However, there are currently no grounds for thinking that there will be shortages.</p>

It will be accessible, appropriately and with the patient&#8217;s consent, to a range of healthcare professionals caring for an individual patient. It is expected that such records will, in the first instance, be made available to support out of hours and accident and emergency services.

  <p>On 21 September I announced in-year allocations for 2000-01 and allocations for 2001-02 based on the recently published results of the Arbuthnott Review. For any subsequent allocations, I intend to take into account all of the recommended annual updates as set out in paragraph 7.12 of <i>Fair Shares for All: Final Report,</i> namely:</p>

  <p>changes in health board population shares (based on annually updated mid-year estimates);</p>

  <p>changes in the age and sex structure of the population;</p>

  <p>changes in the indicators of morbidity and life circumstances; and</p>

  <p>changes in the proportion of expenditure on different care programmes.</p>

  <p>Given the proximity of timing, the target shares used in the 2001-02 allocations announced on 21 September 2000 were those recently published in the final report of the Arbuthnott Review. The mid-year estimate used in that work was not updated.</p>

  <p>The population figures used in the Arbuthnott revenue allocation formula for general practitioner prescribing take into account all persons usually resident in an area. As such, they include offshore workers and other workers resident in a health board area at their usual area of residence. For general medical services the allocations take account of the population currently registered with a general practitioner, and so include all persons requiring the care of a GP. In addition both of these formulae reflect the additional requirements placed on general practitioners and prescribing due to temporary residents.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what each health board&#8217;s current allocation of resources for general medical services in 2000-01 is and how each of these allocations will change in (a) the current financial year and (b) future financial years as a result of these resources being allocated on the basis of the community health index.</p>

  <p>The following table shows each health board&#8217;s current allocation for general medical services cash limited and indicative allocations for general medical services non-cash limited. The table also shows those increases in the allocations for general medical services cash limited for 2001-02 which take into account the Arbuthnott target shares. Future decisions on revenue allocations for general medical services have yet to be decided, reflecting the need to progress cautiously in this area.</p>

  <p>The Occupational Health Strategy for NHS in Scotland staff made clear that employers must risk-assess all tasks and activities and develop local policies based on risk, aimed at reducing violent incidents in the workplace. Policies could include measures such as training in the use of techniques designed to diffuse potentially violent situations and crime prevention and safety techniques. As part of the launch of Occupational Health and Safety Strategy, &pound;0.5 million was made available to the NHSiS for the introduction of safety and security measures, such as the provision of access to mobile phones for community nurses, midwives and health visitors.</p>

  <p>The NHS in Scotland Scottish Partnership Forum on which UNISON is represented has recently agreed a guideline and model policy on &quot;Dignity at Work: Eliminating Bullying and Harassment in the Workplace&quot; which is expected to issue this autumn. Work will begin shortly on further guidance covering &quot;Employee Health at Work&quot; which will include personal safety and a model policy for the management of violence and aggression. Occupational health minimum datasets are also in preparation and data on violence against staff will be included.</p>

  <p>To help GPs, Regulations came into force in July which enable health boards and Trusts to take into account which GP may be best placed to deal with a potentially violent patient. The Regulations open the way for boards and Trusts to work with GPs to ensure that treatment is provided at appropriate premises.</p>

  <p>Reducing waiting for patients at all stages in their use of health services is one of the Executive&#8217;s key objectives for the NHS in Scotland. We are currently working with the service on the development of all-Scotland maximum waiting times in the national clinical priorities of cancer, heart disease and mental health.</p>

  <p>Action to reduce hospital waiting lists is primarily for health boards and NHS Trusts. The Executive has put substantial extra investment into the NHS in Scotland, including targeted investment to help reduce waiting. Coupled with new ways of working and delivering services, this will help the service to achieve sustained improvements.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) authorises the disposal of low level radioactive waste to approved landfill sites in Scotland under the Radioactive Substances Act 1993. This type of waste is generated in the main by hospitals and universities and may contain low levels of tritium.</p>

  <p>Earlier this year SEPA commissioned a study to investigate the potential sources of tritium in the leachate collected from landfill sites within Scotland. The study found that the authorised disposal of radioactive waste could not wholly account for the levels of tritium found in leachate samples. Gaseous tritium light devices (GTLDs) have in the past been used in emergency exit signs in buildings such as cinemas. GTLDs within certain activity limits are permitted to be disposed to landfill sites with ordinary refuse. The study suggested that the concentrations of tritium observed may have arisen from such disposals. The findings of the study are contained in a report available on the SEPA website at www.sepa.org.uk.</p>

  <p>The EC Landfill Directive came into force on 16 July 1999 and is due to be transposed into national legislation within two years from that date. The Directive contains several requirements and deadlines for action.</p>

  <p>The <i>National Waste Strategy: Scotland</i> was adopted by the Scottish Executive on the 9 December 1999. It provides a long-term plan for the development of sustainable waste management in Scotland, in line with the Best Practicable Environmental Option principle.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency is currently working with local authorities, local enterprise companies and other interested parties to implement the strategy by developing Area Waste Plans for each of 11 Waste Strategy Areas. These plans will set out the way that waste in each area should be dealt with.</p>

  <p>In answer to question S1W-10051, announcing the outcome of the spending review for the environment, I said that I would soon be proposing arrangements specifically on waste for the distribution of an extra &pound;50 million over the review period. This will help local authorities to take forward implementation of the National Waste Strategy.</p>

  <p>There is no requirement for hazardous waste to be removed from landfill sites before implementation of the Landfill Directive. However, the Directive will mean that co-disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous wastes at landfill sites will no longer be possible. The Directive requires that, from July 2004, hazardous wastes may be disposed of only at sites which are licensed only for these wastes. I plan to issue a consultation paper on these and other technical aspects of the implementation of the Landfill Directive in the near future.</p>

  <p>For years we have disposed of our waste in the cheapest way possible, dumping it in landfills. We must deal with it in a more sustainable way in future.</p>

  <p>Last year I adopted a National Waste Strategy for Scotland. That strategy is now beginning to become a reality. The spending review has provided some of the significant resources which will be required to bring about the long-term change which is necessary if we are to meet our EC obligations for diversion of waste from landfill.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA), local authorities, the waste industry, local enterprise companies, non-governmental organisations and others have begun to work together in 11 Waste Strategy Areas which cover all of Scotland. Each group has investigated the type and quantity of waste produced in their area. Now each area has begun to develop plans identifying the best practicable environmental option for dealing with that waste.</p>

  <p>As foreshadowed in my written answer on 22 September (question S1W-10051), I am making special arrangements for allocating &pound;50.4 million for local authorities to invest in waste to help implement the National Waste Strategy. I intend to establish a specific grant scheme, known as the Strategic Waste Fund, which will be used for allocating these funds. The funds will be spread over the three years of the spending review as follows:</p>

  <p><center> <table border="BORDER" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" width="50%"> <tr> <td width="17%" valign="TOP"> <p align="CENTER">2001-02 </p></td> <td width="28%" valign="TOP"> <p align="CENTER">2002-03 </p></td> <td width="28%" valign="TOP"> <p align="CENTER">2003-04 </p></td> <td width="28%" valign="TOP"> <p align="CENTER">Total </p></td> </tr> <tr> <td width="17%" valign="TOP"> <p align="RIGHT">&pound;4.2 million </p></td> <td width="28%" valign="TOP"> <p align="RIGHT">&pound;16.0 million </p></td> <td width="28%" valign="TOP"> <p align="RIGHT">&pound;30.2 million </p></td> <td width="28%" valign="TOP"> <p align="RIGHT">&pound;50.4 million </p></td> </tr> </table> </center></p>

  <p>The Strategic Waste Fund will be flexible enough to award both current and capital grants as well as provide support for Public/Private Partnership projects where these are shown to be the best method of delivering waste services. The funds will be allocated to local authorities on the basis of readiness for expenditure on activities detailed in Area Waste Plans. In some cases funds may be allocated to groups of authorities working together. These resources will be applied to the implementation of the Area Waste Plans.</p>

  <p>We expect that these resources will contribute significantly to meeting the first targets to reduce the amount of waste landfilled by 2010 under the EC Landfill Directive. My officials hope to work with CoSLA and SEPA to identify funding priorities. The actual facilities and services purchased will depend on the conclusions reached in the Area Waste Plans. Expenditure which may be undertaken includes separate collections, composting machinery, materials reclamation facilities, energy from waste technology and integrated waste management contracts.</p>

  <p>The Strategic Waste Fund will initially cover the three years of the Spending Review. However, I am also making available a further &pound;3 million to start the fund this financial year. This will be distributed to all authorities using a standard population-based local government revenue allocation formula. This means that all authorities will have increased funds available to them this year to invest in composting and recycling. This will help kick-start the changes we need. Authorities will be expected to provide the Executive with details of what they intend to spend the money on and also on progress made in due course. Examples of the types of activities I expect to be funded are the provision of home composting containers or the extension of recycling schemes.</p>

  <p>As I announced on 22 September, part of the Executive&#8217;s overall allocation for local authority expenditure includes nearly &pound;50 million extra for environmental services. This includes an increased element for waste. It is for local authorities to allocate these funds according their own priorities and I hope that they will ensure that an appropriate amount is directed to waste management to sustain and improve this vital service.</p>

  <p>Last year the Executive identified &pound;2.5 million for local authorities to plan and prepare for the implementation of the National Waste Strategy: Scotland. Over the period of the spending review we will continue to provide this funding within the main local government finance settlement.</p>

  <p>A major problem for recycling in Scotland, the UK and around the world, is the lack of markets for recycled materials. The Executive will seek to combat this by becoming a partner in the ground-breaking Waste Resource Action Programme (WRAP) with DETR, DTI and Wales.</p>

  <p>The programme will focus on breaking down institutional barriers to recycling. Many of these barriers have been shown to be at a UK level and only a UK-wide programme such as WRAP can address these properly. For example, work on materials specifications will be addressed by WRAP working with the British Standards Institute.</p>

  <p>WRAP will have a business focus and will concentrate initially on market facilitation, promoting investment in recycling, research and information management and the provision of guidance, advice and technical support.</p>

  <p>Over the three years of the spending review, the Executive will be contributing &pound;2.1 million to the programme which is seeking overall funding of around &pound;25 million per year. This programme will complement the work of ReMaDe Scotland - to which the Executive will continue to contribute. ReMaDe Scotland investigates alternative uses for recyclable materials and brings together waste reprocessors and end users in an effort to stimulate investment in recycling and stabilise markets for recyclable materials.</p>

  <p>Finally, we shall make available a further &pound;400,000 over 2002-03 and 2003-04. This will enable the Executive to offer grants to support innovative waste prevention, re-use, recycling and composting projects. The grants may be paid to voluntary organisations, local authorities or other bodies.</p>

  <p>Before making decisions about the resources needed by local authorities as part of the spending review, the Executive commissioned research from independent consultants, Enviros Aspinwall, to estimate the future needs to meet the Landfill Directive targets. This work showed that expenditure on waste management will probably have to increase at current prices by more than one third of current levels each year by 2010 and double by 2020. I am pleased that CoSLA and SEPA worked closely with the consultants on this work and I have made a copy of the full report available to the Parliament today. The research report showed the size of the task we face by identifying that if the growth in waste production continues we will effectively have to compost or recycle some 12 times more than the current rate by 2010. This will increase to 20 times more by 2016 and 25 times more by 2020.</p>

  <p>It is clear that not all this expenditure can be provided overnight but I am pleased that the Executive has been able to commit considerable resources to allow local authorities to start to bring about real change in the way we deal with our waste, change which the public wants and Scotland needs. <br /></p>
