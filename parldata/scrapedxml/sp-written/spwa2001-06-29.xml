  <p>I made a statement to Parliament on 4 October 2000 setting out the new three-stage appeals procedures for farmers penalised in relation to their European Union subsidy claims and to payments made under certain other schemes.</p>

  <p>Amending legislation extending coverage of the procedures to the main agri-environment and afforestation schemes will take effect from 29 June 2001 and will cover decisions on these schemes from 1 January this year. The first two stages of the appeals procedure will be extended to quota arrangements. The full procedure&#8212;including the Scottish Land Court stage&#8212;will extend to quotas later this year once the underlying quota legislation has been updated.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-15749 by Rhona Brankin on 29 May 2001, how the phrase &quot;while [a] nest is in use or being built&quot; from section 1 (1) (b) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 can be interpreted as applying &quot;outwith the breeding season&quot; as specified in Article 5 (b) of the EU Directive on the Conservation of Wild Birds (79/409).</p>

  <p>I have previously indicated that the Scottish Executive considers that section 1 (1) (b) of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 fully implements the provisions of Article 5 (b) of the Wild Birds Directive as it protects all nests in use. Ultimately, of course, it is for the courts to interpret statute.</p>

  <p>I attended the Fisheries Council in Luxembourg on 18 June as part of the UK delegation.</p>

  <p>The council held a policy debate about the Commission&#8217;s Green Paper on the future of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The UK stated that the primary objective for the CFP was to achieve a policy which is both economically and environmentally sustainable and one which involves the stakeholders more closely in the management decisions affecting them. We stressed the need to build on existing elements of policy such as relative stability, Hague Preference, 6- and 12-mile limits and the Shetland Box. We also advocated the setting up of regional bodies, involving fishermen alongside managers and scientists, to tackle stock conservation issues. These should be aimed at securing a greater sense of ownership by the industry.</p>

  <p>The council discussed the general state of fish stocks and in particular the recovery plans for cod and hake. The commission presented its long-term recovery plans and made reference to ongoing negotiations with Norway. The UK recognised the problems with the stocks but emphasised the importance of securing industry support for the recovery plans through meaningful consultation. I highlighted the need for both measures and the long-term plans to be fully thought through and to recognise the difficulties involved in managing the mixed fisheries in the North Sea.</p>

  <p>The council agreed a set of conclusions about the commission&#8217;s Biodiversity Action Plan for fisheries. It also received an initial presentation from the commission about the extension of the current multi-annual guidance programme (MAGP) and agreed to extend until 31 December the temporary aid scheme for Spanish and Portuguese vessels affected by the failure to secure a new fisheries agreement with Morocco. This is funded from within existing structural funds allocations.</p>

  <p>I have set the following targets for Fisheries Research Services (FRS) for the financial year 2001-02.</p>

  <p><u>Delivery of Service</u></p>

  <p>To achieve 93% of the performance targets set in the Schedules to the Service Level Agreement.</p>

  <p>To achieve 80% of the milestones agreed for Research and Development projects.</p>

  <p>To achieve an output of 0.7 publications per member of staff.</p>

  <p>To produce 16 information packs and eight major articles in the fishing press.</p>

  <p><u>Quality of Service</u></p>

  <p>To submit the scientific work of the Aquatic Environment Programme at the FRS Marine Laboratory to a peer review during 2001-02, and to put in place an agreed Action Plan to implement recommendations by the end of March 2002.</p>

  <p>To achieve accreditation by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service, by March 2002, of the monitoring programmes for three new areas of work.</p>

  <p><u>Efficiency Targets</u></p>

  <p>Full economic costs to be recovered from external customers (other than those agreed to be undertaken at marginal or shared costs).</p>

  <p>To restrict administrative staff costs to a maximum of 17% of the total staff running costs.</p>

  <p>To achieve a research vessel utilisation of 535 days per year, operating at a daily cost of &#163;5,500 (&#163;12,500 full resource costs) for <i>Scotia</i> and &#163;2,200 (&#163;2,500 full resource costs) for <i>Clupea</i>.</p>

  <p>To produce accounts on target, enabling the 2000-01 FRS Report and Accounts to be published in July.</p>

  <p>To achieve cash releasing efficiency gains to the value of 1% of FRS&#8217; budget.</p>

  <p>The chief executive of FRS will be accountable to me for the agency&#8217;s performance against these targets.</p>

  <p>The Boards of Management of FE colleges are each legally responsible for matters relating to the contracts of employment of staff within their college, including pay and conditions. This offers boards the flexibility, as they see fit, to reflect local conditions and circumstances, to secure best value for money and efficiencies and to strengthen their college&#8217;s future.</p>

  <p>I place great emphasis on the potential benefits to colleges from joint ventures and collaboration, including, where boards see this as appropriate, in the area of staff pay and conditions.</p>

  <p>The effect of any major development on traffic volumes on the adjacent local roads is a matter for the City of Edinburgh Council to take into account. The Scottish Executive has, of course, an interest in trunk road impacts and will in due course take part in discussions with the City of Edinburgh Council concerning an assessment of traffic impacts. The Executive&#8217;s Public Transport Fund is available to assist transport authorities towards meeting the capital costs of public transport investments.</p>

  <p>I am publishing today a consultation paper <i> Rivers, Lochs, Coasts: The Future for Scotland&#8217;s Waters</i> . This paper sets out how we propose to secure and promote the environmental health of our rivers, lochs and coastal waters for future generations. It seeks views on the policy proposals that will underpin our planned Water Environment Bill and implement the EC Water Framework Directive.</p>

  <p>Our proposals for a system to manage our water environment in a co-ordinated and comprehensive way will bring significant benefits to Scotland. We aim to ensure the environment is protected and in a way that involves and takes account of all interests. We will need to hear the views of everyone with an interest in the water environment in order to create a successful system. This paper will initiate the debate.</p>

  <p>Records of applications received are not held. Detailed information on licences issued is, however, available for the 10-year period 1990-2000, during which a total of 1,956 individual licences were issued and three general licences were in force.

  <p>The procurement of approximately 50m <sup>3</sup> of Scottish oak timber for the Holyrood Project, from suppliers throughout Scotland, is nearing completion. All of the suppliers concerned are licensed by the Forestry Commission, which ensures that the timber meets the Holyrood project&#8217;s environmental aims and obligations.

  <p>The &quot;analysis of sensitivities&quot; is embedded in the project&#8217;s risk analysis process, which was initiated in 1998, prior to site occupation and trade package contract tender exercises. The process demands a regular and systematic review of all identified risks and sensitivities, together with the specific actions aimed at managing them, as well as an assessment of the probability and level of exposure in respect of each individual risk. The results are set out in a risk register, presented formally to the Holyrood Progress Group, which currently contains 47 separate risks.</p>

  <p>Possession of a management qualification is not currently one of the criteria used in recruitment by the SPCB, although for many posts management experience is required. Where management skills are required for a particular post, this competence is tested in the recruitment process. The information sought is not held comprehensively on a database.
