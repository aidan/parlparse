  <p>The Early Years Framework demonstrates the Scottish Government&rsquo;s commitment to early intervention to ensure that a child receives the support they need, as quickly as possible.</p>

  <p>The programme of routine screening is set out in the Scottish Government guidance <em>Health for all Children</em>. The guidance is firmly rooted in the need for an integrated approach to the delivery of services and support for children and families, co-ordinated in the early years through health but working in partnership with other professionals, in childcare and education, supported by clear routes for liaison, consultation and referral to health professionals when there are clear concerns through the <em>Getting it right for every child</em> methodology.</p>

  <p>Within the context of the concordat and the National Performance Framework, it is for NHS boards and local authorities to design and determine the level of services provided to meet the needs of children and young people with communication difficulties under the age of five, based on local priorities and clinical need.</p>

  <p>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004, which places an important emphasis on multi-agency working, places duties on education authorities to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all children, including those with communication difficulties, for whose education they are responsible. Appropriate agencies, including NHS boards, are required to assist an education authority in the exercise of any of its functions under the act.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has just completed a consultation on <em>Draft guidance on partnership working between allied health professionals (AHPs) and education. </em>The final guidance and resources, which is intended to support school staff and AHPs to work more effectively as partners in supporting children and young people, will be published before June 2010.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to question S3O-8422 on 12 November 2009, which indicates that the maximum reduction in the peak pm traffic occurs in 2030 and would see traffic reduce by 21 cars in an hour.</p>

  <p>We would therefore only expect there to be a negligible impact on our target to reduce carbon emissions as a result of cancelling the GARL project.</p>

  <p>The original cost and timescale of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link (GARL) project are set out in the following table:</p>

  <p>As the Paisley Corridor re-signalling (PCR) project would have led to significant closures of GARL, the decision was taken to merge the projects and align the timescales. Following the combination of the GARL project with the PCR renewal project, (GARL/PCR), the last estimate of the combined project, at the point where the branch line element was cancelled, are set out in the following table:</p>

  <p>Glasgow Airport Rail Link/Paisley Corridor Renewal (GARL/PCR) Cost<strong> </strong>(All Figures in &pound; Million) and Schedule</p>

  <p>March 2006 was the first time that the project cost had been expressed in out turn figures previously having been expressed in Q4/2004 prices (&pound;160 million Q4/2004 equating to &pound;170 million to &pound;210 million Q1/2010 out turn). The out turn cost includes an assessment of the likely impact of cost indexation within the rail / construction industry over the lifecycle of the projects delivery.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Ministers have powers under the Inquiries Act 2005 to establish an inquiry where it appears to them that particular events have caused, or are capable of causing, public concern. The terms of reference and powers of such an inquiry are restricted by section 28 of that act.</p>

  <p>In my statement on 20 August 2009, I acknowledged that there remain concerns to some on the wider issues of the Lockerbie atrocity; that this is a global issue, and international in its nature. I said that the questions to be asked and answered are beyond the jurisdiction of Scots law and the restricted remit of the Scottish Government. If a further inquiry were felt to be appropriate then it should be initiated by those with the required power and authority. The Scottish Government would be happy to fully co-operate in such an inquiry.</p>

  <p>Communication impairment is a widespread characteristic of offenders and arises from a range of causes, most commonly from low educational attainment. Poor ability with verbal expression and reasoning is likely to predispose to more aggressive responses to challenge. The Scottish Government is aware of research in this field focussing on offenders with potential clinical needs relating to speech and language, including that highlighted by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists (RCSLT) to the Parliament&rsquo;s Equal Opportunities Committee.</p>

  <p>The report <em>Offender Learning: Options for Improvement</em> was published on 14 January 2010 and makes recommendations and observations for offender learning in Scotland. It is recognised that offender behaviour patterns may be influenced by a wide range of issues, including social deprivation, negative peer pressure and poor educational attainment. The report identified that learning and skills acquisition, including improved literacy and numeracy, could be a contributing factor to the route out of offending.</p>

  <p>The Waverley Railway (Scotland) Act 2006 received Royal Assent in July 2006. At this stage in the project, the cost was estimated at approximately &pound;130 million at 2002 prices, and a possible completion date in 2011 was proposed. However, there was no commitment at that time to provide sufficient funding, nor to commence construction. Therefore the possible completion date was not deliverable.</p>

  <p>Following a review of the cost and programme estimates this administration has committed to construct the Borders Railway. It is currently anticipated that the Borders Railway will cost between &pound;235 million and &pound;295 million (Q4 2012 prices) to construct, and that the railway will be opened during 2014. These estimates will be validated and refined during the course of the procurement process which has now commenced.</p>

  <p>The Edinburgh Tram (Line One and Line Two) Acts 2006 provide full Parliamentary powers to the City of Edinburgh Council to construct and operate a tram network in the city. Changes to the route of the tram outside the limits of deviation approved by Parliament would require amendment to the relevant Tram Act, or new powers to be secured by the City of Edinburgh Council. On 27 June 2007, Parliament voted to require the Scottish Government to proceed with the Edinburgh Trams project within the budget limit set by the previous administration, noting that it is the responsibility of Transport Initiatives Edinburgh and the City of Edinburgh Council to meet the balance of the funding costs. Changes to the tram project which affected this arrangement would require ministerial approval.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has asked resilience contacts across Scotland to identify lessons which may be learned and applied from the recent period of prolonged winter weather. The Cabinet Sub-Committee on Scottish Government Resilience (CSC SGoR) will meet to consider the findings, including any recommendations for action, once the current Scottish Government Resilience Room lessons learned activity has reported.</p>
