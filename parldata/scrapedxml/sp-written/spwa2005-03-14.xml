  <p>The management of staff fatigue within the Scottish Ambulance Service is an operational matter for that organisation.</p>

  <p>The ambulance service is not aware of any occasions when fatigued staff have felt reluctant to sign off work in case urgent ambulance support is required. The organisation actively encourages staff, through its driver fatigue policy, to call in fatigued whenever they feel it would be clinically unsafe for them to continue with their duties.</p>

  <p>The use of on-call by the Scottish Ambulance Service in the Highlands and elsewhere in Scotland is an operational matter for that organisation. The rates of pay, including the on-call payment, are negotiated and agreed each year under the service&rsquo;s partnership arrangements. The rate applies when staff are providing out-of-hours cover by being available on-call, in most cases at home, to respond to emergency calls. Where they are tasked to respond to a call they receive their full hourly rate of pay for the duration of the incident and for each call-out they receive a minimum of two hours pay. These payments are additional to those made to staff for their contracted in-hours duties.</p>

  <p>I have asked Angiolina Foster, Chief Executive of Communities Scotland, to respond. Her response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The level of grant approved by Communities Scotland for housing association projects is based on a comprehensive and consistent assessment system designed to ensure that the public funding offered is the minimum necessary to enable each project to proceed while maintaining high standards of design, construction and sustainability. Where funding is secured from other partners, the level of housing association grant is therefore reduced and channelled into other projects to produce additional affordable housing units.</p>

  <p>The Executive has not carried out a specific assessment of the number of farmers likely to cease milk production after 31 March 2005 and has no plans to do so. Any change to the number of milk producers will be affected by a range of factors including personal circumstances, milk prices, exchange rates and decoupling. There is a general consensus that the trend towards fewer, larger dairy farms, evident for some years, is likely to continue post 2005.</p>

  <p>The Executive has not carried out an assessment of the long-term sustainability of the dairy sector and has no plans to do so. The future sustainability of dairying will be determined by decisions taken by individual dairy farmers in response to a range of factors, not least market conditions. The Executive is keen to see that the dairy sector responds positively to the challenges of decoupling and to meeting market requirements and wider society objectives. The recently announced measures under the Land Management Contract Menu Scheme should assist dairy &ndash; and other &ndash; producers to respond to the challenges.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. For Dundee the figures combine those for a preliminary Predental Year, and for direct entry to Year</p>

  <p>2. The &quot;Available Places&quot; includes those for overseas students.</p>

  <p>Between 2001 and 2004, the number of applications received and places available for dental training have increased with a healthy ratio of applications to places.</p>

  <p>Insulin pumps cost between &pound;2,350 and &pound;2,562 and can be expected to last four to eight years. The maintenance cost per year following warranty life (usually four years) is approximately &pound;180 per year. The average cost of consumables (i.e. insulin cartridges, infusion sets and batteries) is approximately &pound;950 to &pound;1,200 per year. All people with type 1 diabetes require daily insulin. Reduced insulin use by pump users reduces costs by between &pound;37 and &pound;89 per patient per year. These figures exclude all staff costs associated with training and supporting patients using insulin pumps and any cost savings resulting from improved control.</p>

  <p>Costs are based on figures taken from a report published in October 2004 by the NHS R&amp;D HTA Programme: <em>Clinical and cost-effectiveness of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for diabetes</em> by JL Colquitt, C Green, MK Sidhu, D Hartwell and N Waugh. Health Technology Assessment 2004; Vol. 8: No. 43. Full report available at <a href="http://www.ncchta.org/fullmono/mon843.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.ncchta.org/fullmono/mon843.pdf</a>.</p>

  <p>This information is not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>Emergency cases will be immediately referred to a general ward for care and to await assessment. Urgent referrals and children will be seen by visiting neurologist service from NHS Grampian in four to eight weeks. Non-urgent cases will be seen by visiting neurologist service in approximately 26 weeks.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government and the European Commission on a wide range of issues, including the funding of the European Union from 2007 to 2013 and the impact of future European budget settlements on the level of European structural funding available to Scotland.</p>

  <p>We have outlined various non-legislative proposals to complement the Family Law Bill, including a possible telephone helpline or information service on family relationship issues. Before allocating any funding for a helpline project we will discuss key questions with stakeholders, including the added value of a helpline on family relationships, the links with existing helplines for parents, step-parents and children, and impact on service provision at local level. We will also take account of the current scoping study of telephone helpline services by <em>Parenting across Scotland. </em> We are also currently looking at options for providing web-based information to improve the availability of information about family law and support services in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Figures are given in the Annual Reports published by Family Mediation Scotland (FMS). In general, these relate to the number of people who contact local services for information or advice of any kind, not of the final numbers who proceed to mediation (though the report for 2001 does distinguish these, as noted below). Not all the figures have been collated in the same way since 1999.</p>

  <p>X(1): Figures not provided to FMS.</p>

  <p>X(2): Service not operational.</p>

  <p>X(3): Service not operational until 2002.</p>

  <p>The FMS report for 2004 provides a chart showing the distribution of cases across services but does not give figures of either initial contact or mediation cases.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many police officers from forces outwith Scotland will be deployed during the G8 summit, who will be in overall control of these officers at a local and operational level, whether a Scottish officer will be in command of individual units or be attached to such units for liaison and advisory purposes and what advice or instructions will be given to these officers on the police service and its links with the community it serves.</p>

  <p>It is too early to be precise about the number of officers from forces outwith Scotland who will be deployed in Scotland during the G8 summit. That will depend on operational decisions to be taken in due course by the Scottish Police Service. Those officers, for example, who are deployed in this way around Gleneagles will be directly under the command of the Chief Constable of Tayside Police and will receive, through him, advice and instructions appropriate to the specific circumstances of their deployment.</p>

  <p>The tables show the number of newly diagnosed patients and the overall number of patients seen for obesity.</p>

  <p>These figures considerably underestimate the true number of obese people in Scotland. Many people with obesity do not consult their GP. In addition these figures exclude people with obesity who did not consult their GP during the year of the analysis. Also patients may visit the general practice for a condition related to their obesity without obesity itself being recorded.</p>

  <p>The table gives the percentage of the total prescribing expenditure for drugs used in treatment of obesity (as defined in Section 4.5 of the British National Formulary) and drugs used in diabetes (as defined in Section 6.1 of the British National Formulary) for the financial years 2000-01 to 2003-04, and April to November 2004. The data refer to prescriptions dispensed by community pharmacists and dispensing doctors, but do not take into account medicines dispensed by hospitals or hospital based clinics. The cost of the drugs is before deduction of discount and patient charges and addition of dispensing fees.</p>

  <p>The data reflect the costs of medicines used to treat obesity and diabetes directly and do not include drugs prescribed to treat other conditions associated with these disease states.</p>

  <p>There are a number of different exemptions and reliefs from Stamp Duty and Stamp Duty Land Tax.

  <p>Guidance on the preparation of local housing strategies produced for local authorities states that registered social landlords, as housing developers and providers, should be key partners in the local housing strategy process.</p>

  <p>A local housing strategy should set out a clear investment framework for registered social landlords and for other partners and providers that would allow them to prioritise and target their actions and resources in support of their local housing strategy.</p>

  <p>Where the local authority intends to introduce a Development Plan policy seeking to support the delivery of affordable housing, it should have regard to the local housing strategy and the local authority should work closely with registered social landlords, developers and other providers to ensure there is a common and shared understanding of the policy and its implications.</p>

  <p>1. The figures include public authority dwellings only (Local Authority, New Town Development Corporations and Scottish Homes dwellings).</p>

  <p>2. Due to the nature of the housing association data collection, it is not possible to separate Rent to Mortgage sales from Right to Buy sales for housing associations (and the latter will form the majority of the sales).</p>

  <p>2. Figures from 1990 to 1996 have been transferred from the former local authority areas to the 32 current areas.</p>

  <p>Work Permits UK (WPUK) promoted legal employment routes in Scotland in the last year by inviting Scottish employers and immigration advisors to their annual conference in Islington in November 2004. WPUK met with Scottish Executive staff in September 2004 and they co-ordinated work across Immigration Nationality Directorate (IND) to assist in the production of an Employer&rsquo;s Toolkit (factsheets on all routes to migration including work-related) for use on the Scottish Executive website and at Relocation Advisory Service.</p>

  <p>WPUK also send a copy of the &quot;Scotland &ndash; Fresh Talent&quot; leaflet to all successful applicants to the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme.</p>

  <p>In addition, the publicity information published on the WPUK website is all fully accessible to Scottish employers, as are the printed leaflets.</p>

  <p>WPUK attended a &quot;Fresh Talent&quot; exhibition in 2003 involving an invited audience from CBI. Since then WPUK have also been trying a more targeted approach of meeting with individual employers on request in an effort to promote understanding.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to the second supplementary question to question S2O-5269 by Rhona Brankin on 3 February 2005, what meetings have taken place between the Deputy Minister for Health and the Minister for Justice on the subject of prosecuting shopkeepers who sell tobacco products to minors; what further meetings are scheduled and for which dates, and what the outcome was of those meetings which have already taken place.</p>

  <p>Following evaluation of the &quot;Test Purchasing Pilots&quot; carried out in Scotland, the Lord Advocate announced his decision on 4 March 2005 to revise prosecution policy to allow evidence gained from test purchasing by children of age restricted goods, including tobacco products to be admissible. This will give Trading Standards Officers a useful tool to combat and reduce underage sales. The Scottish Executive will fund training for Trading Standards Officers to ensure that test purchasing is carried out fairly and safely and the protection of children participating will remain paramount.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive is funding Young Scot and the Scottish Retail Consortium to produce information and training packs for retailers on how to avoid sales of age restricted goods to underage children. The continuing roll out of the &quot;PASS&quot; accredited Young Scot Card across Scotland, which includes an accredited proof of age element, will enable retailers to apply &quot;no proof no sale&quot; to all age restricted goods.</p>

  <p>The Health Department will continue to keep closely in touch with the Crown Office and the Justice Department in relation to the roll-out of test purchasing and the other work which the Executive is taking forward on age restricted goods. In view of these developments, I no longer feel a meeting with the Justice Minister to specifically discuss the subject of prosecuting shopkeepers who sell tobacco products to minors is necessary at this time.</p>

  <p>The Data Protection Act 1998 requires that information recorded on computer databases is accurate. The act acknowledges, however, that data subjects must take some responsibility for providing accurate data in the first instance. In police work, people who are apprehended sometimes do not give accurate information. It is the policy of Scottish police forces to use the name given by an individual as the basis for creating a new record on the Scottish Criminal Record Office Criminal History System if a record for the subject does not already exist. The police take steps to verify information and if the name given is found to be false, the subject&rsquo;s real name will be also be retained on the record. The name given in the first instance also stays on the record in case the individual seeks to use the same false details again.</p>

  <p>The police do not rely on name alone for the purposes of identifying a subject as there are numerous people born in the United Kingdom with identical names and dates of birth. As such, emphasis is put on recording identifying information such as fingerprints, DNA, photographs and other descriptive features.</p>

  <p>The Keeper of the Registers of Scotland is responsible for the administration of the two property registers in Scotland. These registers are the General Register of Sasines, a register of deeds, which is gradually being superseded by the Land Register, a register of title. The Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 introduced the system of land registration in Scotland. The act envisaged the progressive introduction of the Land Register over Scotland on an area-by-area basis. This was completed in 2003, and the whole of Scotland is now operational for the purposes of land registration.</p>

  <p>Transactions that induce first registration in the Land Register are set out in the Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979. Generally, only a transfer of property for valuable consideration (i.e. a price) will induce the first registration of a property in the Land Register. Thus any property transfer involving deeds recorded in the General Register of Sasines that does not attract a price will remain on that register.</p>

  <p>There is no set timescale for every property in Scotland to be held on the Land Register. Over time, as more properties held on the Register of Sasines are sold, the stock of properties in Scotland held on the Land Register will increase. The percentage of properties in the Land Register is presently rising by around 3% a year.</p>

  <p>The Land Register is made up of title sheets for each individual property registered and is held electronically.</p>

  <p>Information from the Land Register is already available online. In 2001 Registers of Scotland introduced a service known as Registers Direct. This service provides information from the Land Register, and certain other registers, on the internet.</p>

  <p>Subject to passage of the necessary subordinate legislation, Registers of Scotland plans to begin the roll-out of electronic registration &ndash; known as Automated Registration of Title to Land (ARTL) &ndash; from November 2006. This system will permit straightforward land registration transactions to be undertaken online.</p>

  <p>The fees set in respect of the services provided by Registers of Scotland distinguish between the fees for registration in the registers and the fees for inspecting the information contained in those registers. There is no cross-subsidisation of costs and fees between the registration of property in the property registers and the inspection of information from those registers. The overall costs of registration are met from the overall fee income for registration. Similarly the fees charged for inspection of the registers are intended to meet the overall costs associated with making the registers available for public inspection. The scales upon which fees are calculated for registration of titles and standard securities differ, to reflect generally the different levels of work required. Registers of Scotland is currently undertaking a review of fees relating to the provision of information from the registers, and plans to undertake a review of registration fees in 2006.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers set an annual target for Registers of Scotland in respect of the accuracy of land certificates that are issued when an application for registration is complete.</p>

  <p>The target for the current financial year, 2004-05, requires the Land Register to achieve a registration accuracy rate of at least 98% for land certificates despatched during the previous 12 months. In the 12 months up to 31 December 2004, the Land Register achieved an accuracy rate of <strong>98.60%. 321,918 land certificates were issued from the Land Register during that period, of which 4,503 have required subsequent amendment.</strong></p>

  <p>Though most are minor and readily remedied, the occurrence of inaccuracies in land certificates is a matter that the Keeper of the Registers and his staff treat very seriously. In order to deliver and maintain improvements in accuracy, a number of measures have been put in place, including the creation of a Data and Information Unit and a Quality Steering Group in Registers of Scotland.</p>

  <p>Where a Land Certificate contains an inaccuracy, a party affected may apply to the Keeper to have this rectified in the register. The Land Registration (Scotland) Act 1979 provides for the payment of indemnity to those who have suffered loss as a result of such inaccuracies. Last year, payments were necessary in less than 0.05% of applications.</p>

  <p>The work required by Registers of Scotland in relation to the Land Register derives not only from the abolition of the feudal system of land tenure in Scotland which was abolished by the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000, but also from the related reform of title conditions resulting from the Title Conditions (Scotland) Act 2003.</p>

  <p>The main type of work in the Land Register that arises as a consequence of this legislation is in relation to the Burdens Section of the title sheet. The title sheet is the entry in the Land Register for an individual property. The Burdens Section sets out the various conditions that affect the property. These frequently include conditions arising from the feudal system of land holding. The legislation affects existing conditions and feudal burdens that appear in the title sheets of most of the titles that are currently registered in the Land Register.</p>

  <p>The work required will involve the updating of over a million title sheets that have become inaccurate after 28 November 2004, because the legislation has affected entries in the Burdens Section. Certain categories of title conditions included in registered titles have become extinct.</p>

  <p>All existing registered titles will be examined and those title conditions that have been extinguished by the legislation, removed. The work will be undertaken on a phased and systematic basis. An outline timetable for delivery will be published during 2005-06. The updating work will be completed by 2014, as is anticipated in the legislation.</p>

  <p>The date of registration in respect of a property is the date upon which Registers of Scotland receives the application for registration. The logging of an application on receipt secures the applicant&rsquo;s interest in the property. Once an application has been received, no other party can lodge an application in respect of that property that would take precedence over the original application. This means that if the registration takes longer than usual, for example if the application is particularly complex, there is no legal disadvantage to the security of the applicant's title.</p>

  <p>Scotland has two property registers, the General Register of Sasines, a register of deeds which is being superseded by the Land Register of Scotland, a register of title. There are some 2.6 million properties held between the two registers of which some 1.2 million are registered in, or the subject of applications to, the Land Register as at February 2005. This equates to approximately 46% of all properties that could potentially be registered in the Land Register.</p>

  <p>Registers of Scotland collates information on the average cost of processing each of the different types of application in the Land Register, and an average cost for all deeds that are recorded in the General Register of Sasines. There are three different types of application that may be made to the Land Register. These are:</p>

  <p>First registrations of previously unregistered property;</p>

  <p>Transfers of part of property registered in the Land Register (such as subdivision of that property by a sale), and</p>

  <p>Dealings with Whole, which are transactions affecting the whole of registered property.</p>

  <p>Of the 14,128 applications for registration which are over three years old, some 72% are linked to other applications in that category and can only be taken forward when these preceding applications have been resolved.</p>

  <p>Registers of Scotland are required to meet targets set by ministers as regards the average time taken to process applications for registration in the Land Register. In the past three years, Registers of Scotland has met all such targets.</p>

  <p>In 2004-05 ministers set a target to eliminate stocks of domestic First Registrations over 1 year old during the next three years with a milestone reduction of 25% from the stock position at 31 March 2004 by 31 March 2005. Registers of Scotland expects to meet this target.</p>

  <p>In addition, Registers of Scotland has specifically addressed arrears of older casework and all of the agency&rsquo;s oldest casework is either in the course of being processed or awaiting supplementary information from the submitting agents. Registers of Scotland is on track to process all applications that are pre-year 2000 and not subject to factors outwith the keeper&rsquo;s control, by the end of this financial year.</p>

  <p>The average cost per call will change each month. That is due to fluctuations in running costs, for example, increases/decreases in numbers of staff and their salary costs. It will also change as the volumes of calls grow and with any seasonal effects.</p>

  <p>NHS 24 became available to the whole of Scotland from mid November 2004. The figures for the fourth quarter (ending 31 March 2005) will for the first time show the fully rolled out operating costs for the national service. Financial year 2005-06 will be the first full year that an average cost per call will be available for the all-Scotland service.</p>

  <p>The expected service improvements from the recently announced review of NHS 24 are likely to impact on the average cost per call. I am less concerned about what that impact might be than I am about securing improvements to the operational performance of the organisation - especially to the responsiveness of the service to callers and waiting times for service users.</p>

  <p>There are no current plans to do so. I believe that the current arrangements secure a cost-effective means of purchasing medicines for the NHS and that a combined system would sacrifice the advantages offered by the current separate arrangements.</p>

  <p>In the community, medicines dispensed by community pharmacists against NHS prescriptions are purchased and owned by the pharmacist. Once a medicine is dispensed, the pharmacist is reimbursed the cost of the item less a discount. The financial risk and the administrative costs are borne by the contractors and not the NHS.</p>

  <p>Medicines are purchased in hospitals mainly through National and regional purchasing arrangements to take advantage of the collective purchasing power of NHS boards. The distribution arrangements for medicines used in hospitals are less complex than those for use in the community due to the relatively small number of distribution points.</p>

Milk does have a clear nutritional value on many counts; it is a nutrient rich food, and a rich source of protein, fat, carbohydrates and various micronutrients especially calcium, riboflavin and vitamin A. We consider it should be seen as part of a varied diet.</p>

  <p>The evidence is held in various documents, but can be summarised as follows:</p>

  <p>The amount of calcium required to maintain a healthy skeleton varies with age and gender. There are also differences in the recommendations relating to calcium intakes. The Department of Health's subgroup on Bone Health, the Working Group on the Nutritional Status of the Population of the Committee on Medical Aspects of Food and Nutrition Policy (COMA), recommended that the dietary reference nutrient intake (RNI) of calcium for children aged seven to 10 years is 550 mg per day and for children aged 11 to 18 years, 1,000mg and 800mg respectively for boys and girls (Department of Health. Nutrition and Bone Health: with particular reference to calcium and vitamin D. 1998 and Department of Health. Dietary Reference Values for Food Energy and Nutrients for the United Kingdom. Report on Health and Social Subjects: 41 London: HMSO, 1991).</p>

  <p>However the National Osteoporosis Society (NOS) recommendations are in line with the USA National Institute of Health (NIH) Consensus Panel 4. (National Institute of Health Consensus Development Panel. Optimal Calcium Intake. JAMA 1994;272:1942-1948) and differ from COMA recommendations. NOS/NIH recommend an intake of 800 mg per day for children aged 7 to 12 years and 1,000 for teenagers aged 13 to 19 years. COMA reviewed the evidence presented by the NIH Consensus Panel and could find no scientific justification to adopt its recommendations at this stage.</p>

  <p>Calcium intakes in primary children currently meet recommended levels (using COMA RNIs), however, intake drops off as children, and particularly girls, enter their teenage years. This is related to the increase in their consumption of other drinks at this age. It also relates to changes in their food choices - intake of dairy products of all types falls at this age also. Hungry for Success, (Hungry for Success: A whole school approach to school meals in Scotland) and subsequently the Scottish Nutrient Standards for School Lunches recognise the importance of milk in the diet of children and young people and recommend that plain or flavoured drinking milk should be available as an option every day. Semi-skimmed and skimmed milks have the same amount of calcium as whole milk and should be provided for drinking as well as cooking.</p>

  <p>Fizzy, sugary soft drinks should not be served as part of school lunch in primary schools and should not be encouraged in secondary schools. Carbonated water, plain water, milk and fruit juices are considered appropriate drinks. Milk is a good alternative to sugary, fizzy drinks, and semi-skimmed milk provides less fat than whole milk. The use of semi-skimmed milk is in line with existing recommendations, e.g. the Scottish Diet Action Plan. There is a desirability to gradually wean Scottish children away from a predilection for sweet flavours. Semi-skimmed plain and flavoured milk drinks are to be encouraged as an immediate alternative to fizzy, sugary soft drinks as they can be a valuable source of protein and calcium. Therefore no nutrient specifications for flavoured milk have been set. However, any added sugar should be kept to a minimum in order to assist in meeting the Nutrient Standards for NME sugars (Scottish Executive (2003). Nutrition in Schools: Scottish Nutrient Standards for Manufactured Products. Edinburgh: Scottish Executive).</p>

  <p>In addition, some local authorities are actively working with suppliers to source low fat flavoured milk [personal communication: Direct and Care Services, Glasgow]. In many areas, money received as part of the Hungry for Success initiative is being used to subsidise milk as part of school lunches. Water is recognised as being necessary, particularly in children and young people, for hydration and to facilitate concentration and learning. However, when it is not available children will often meet their hydration needs with fizzy, sugary soft drinks, which will often be more readily available and cheaper than bottled water (Alexander L, Currie C, Todd J and Smith R (2004) HBSC Briefing Paper 7 : How are Scotland's young people doing? A cross-national perspective on physical activity, TV viewing, eating habits, body image and oral hygiene Edinburgh: Child Adolescent Health Research Unit.) However, in recent years significant attempts have been made to improve access to drinking water, and especially tap water, in schools. This is especially important outside of lunchtimes when other sources of hydration are not available.</p>

  <p>Yes.</p>

  <p>The proposed changes stem from the announcement in 2003 by the UK Government that it intended to proceed with its reform of public service pension schemes. This followed the publication in 2002 of the green paper entitled <em>&quot;Simplicity, security and</em> <em>choice: working and saving for retirement&quot;.</em> The case for reform is based on increasing longevity, the rising cost of occupational pensions and the need to ensure the long term sustainability of public service pension schemes in the UK.</p>

  <p>It is proposed to introduce arrangements for public service schemes by 2006 for new staff and by 2013 for existing staff. The necessary legislation will be introduced following appropriate consultation with members and employers.</p>

  <p>The level and mix of services at any new health facility are determined by NHS managers and clinicians before and independent of a decision being taken on whether it should be built using public capital or private finance. The capacity of hospital services is based on a wider assessment of overall service delivery requirements, including treatment in community based settings. In the case of Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, bed numbers have increased whereas in both Wishaw General and Hairmyres Hospitals, the bed numbers have decreased slightly, but have been complimented by more day care and out-patient treatment. Medical and technological advances and changes in the way health care professionals work means that more services are now delivered on a day case and in out-patient and community settings. This is due to normal development of the planning of health services and not as a result of the PFI process.</p>

  <p>The RSA scheme is not evaluated on an annual basis as the nature of the scheme involves support for projects that create or safeguard jobs over a number of years. The employment benefits secured therefore are generated over the full duration of the project and not attributable to any one particular year.</p>

  <p>However, the effectiveness of the scheme is subject to periodic evaluation. Past evaluations have considered the employment impact of RSA over a number of years, allowing the effectiveness and economic benefit of the scheme to be assessed. The last formal UK wide evaluation, covering the period 1991-95, conducted by Arup, was published in September 2000. A full copy of this report can be found at <a href="http://www.dti.gov.uk/regional/evaluationRSA91-95.pdf" target="_blank">www.dti.gov.uk/regional/evaluationRSA91-95.pdf</a>. In addition, the Executive commissioned an external review of the RSA scheme in Scotland, whose report was published in February 2002, to examine the usefulness of the scheme at a Scottish level. A full copy of the report and a ministerial response to the findings is available in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre, (Bib. number 19180).</p>

  <p>Individual RSA projects are monitored against specific employment targets and other outcomes. Grant is released in instalments against the achievement of specific targets over the life of the project and information on jobs created or safeguarded is recorded as grant instalments are claimed.</p>

  <p>Pensions policy is reserved to Westminster and therefore, in line with UK Government policy on public service pensions, the Scottish Teachers' Superannuation Scheme [STSS] is currently under review. The main aims of the review are to ensure that the scheme continues to represent security and value for money for both employees and employers, that it is financially sustainable in the longer term.</p>

  <p>A consultation on options for the STSS ended on 14 January 2005 and comments are currently being analysed. Final decisions on the design of the new scheme will not be made for some months and close liaison will be maintained with schemes elsewhere in the UK to ensure a consistent approach.</p>

  <p>VisitScotland will be present at this event, and view it as an excellent opportunity to forge new contacts, as well as meeting with existing contacts. VisitScotland&rsquo;s branding for the new &quot;Scotland &ndash; Welcome to our life&quot; campaign will be fully evident at the convention. VisitScotland will use this opportunity to highlight all that Scotland has to offer as a great destination to visit.</p>
