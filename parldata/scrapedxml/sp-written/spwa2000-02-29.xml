  <p>Part V of the Police Act 1997 provides for extended access to criminal record checks. New certificates, which will be available next year, will be phased in. <i> </i> Our first priority is to improve child protection and the highest level of check, the Enhanced Criminal Record Certificate (ECRC), will initially be for those regularly caring for, training, supervising or being in sole charge of children. We intend to extend these checks to those caring for vulnerable adults. Applications for ECRCs will have to be countersigned by a registered body, so it will not be possible for an individual to obtain this level of check for care assistants or others. Registration is essential to protect the use of sensitive information. Under Part V, individuals will be able to apply for Criminal Conviction Certificates (CCC) which will contain details of any unspent convictions. Those employing care assistants will be able to ask to see a copy of their CCC although the information will not be as comprehensive as that on the ECRCs.</p>

  <p>In December 1999 the UK-wide Disability Rights Task Force (DRTF) reported on a comprehensive review of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). The Executive is considering the DRTF recommendations although any new legislation would be reserved to the UK Parliament. Meanwhile, the remaining provisions of the DDA on access to goods and services are being implemented between now and 2004. For example, from 1 October 1999 service providers are required to make reasonable adjustments for disabled people, such as providing extra help or making changes to the way they provide services. From 2004 it is intended that service providers will have to make reasonable adjustments to the physical features of their premises to overcome physical barriers to access.</p>

  <p>Reference to numbers of jobs created and safeguarded is most frequently made in relation to projects recorded by Locate in Scotland. In this regard, the methodology used to determine the total number of such jobs is to aggregate the relevant employment forecasts made by the companies planning to undertake these projects. Locate in Scotland defines a &quot;new&quot; or &quot;created&quot; job as one which did not exist prior to the commencement of the planned project. A &quot;safeguarded&quot; or &quot;saved&quot; job is one which, had the planned project not proceeded, would otherwise have been lost.</p>

  <p>Various aspects of the Individual Learning Account (ILA) concept have been tested through development projects running across the UK. One official ILA development project is currently running in the Grampian area, with a second project about to begin in the Lochaber area.</p>

  <p>The Grampian development project has been running for a period of six months. During this period 445 learners have taken up ILAs. Learners contributed at least &pound;25 themselves and by so doing were able to access a public incentive of &pound;150 &#8211; as such, individual contributions of &pound;11,125 were made, with the value of public incentives available totalling &pound;66,750. Employer contributions have varied from &pound;0-&pound;500 per person. In terms of positive outcomes, all but a small number of the 445 learners have completed the learning in question (5% non-completion rate).</p>

  <p>In addition to the official development projects, the ESF Objective 4 programme has approved some Euro ILA programmes throughout Scotland. The best known of these is the Fife programme, set up in response to a number of large scale redundancies in the area. The Fife programme specifically targets small employers in the Fife area. An evaluation of this programme is available from Fife Enterprise Ltd.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is committed to the development of a UK framework for ILAs for the launch of ILAs in autumn 2000.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is currently working with senior management in Trusts forecasting an over-commitment, and their local health boards to ensure that recovery plans are put in place which will continue to provide high quality patient care while achieving financial balance.</p>

  <p>The planned net Scottish per capita spending on health for the current year is &pound;964. The planned per capita expenditure for Scotland is about 18% higher than the UK average. Planned per capita expenditure for 2000-01 and 2001-02 is about 18% and 17% higher respectively. Expenditure plans for 2002-03 and beyond will be considered during the forthcoming spending review. Under the Barnett Formula Scotland will receive the same per capita increase as comparable UK programmes.</p>

  <p>The role of health boards is evolving and developing in line with the wider policy agenda of the Executive. That role will remain a central one in shaping and delivering the strategic agenda for the NHS in Scotland and in securing improvements to the health of the people who live in each health board area. It will, however, be a role increasingly carried out in partnership with NHS Trusts, with local authorities and with others who have an interest in health services &#8211; including the people who use them. The White Paper <i>Designed to Care</i> laid the foundation for dismantling the damaging and divisive internal market and for restructuring the NHS in Scotland on the basis of co-operation and inclusion. Our <i>Programme for Government</i> set out our commitments for modernising the service. Health boards in Scotland will have an important part to play in taking all of this forward.</p>

  <p>The management of tenements is governed by rules and conditions set out as rights and real burdens in the relevant title deeds. The Scottish Law Commission will publish their final Report on Real Burdens and Title Conditions later this year. The resultant modernisation and simplification of the law on real burdens will rationalise the application and enforcement of burdens on all property, including tenements. Reforming the Law of the Tenement after the reform of the law relating to Title Conditions should therefore be a much simpler task.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Law Commission's recommendations on the Law of the Tenement (Scot Law Com. No 162) will therefore be reconsidered in the light of the Commission&#8217;s recommendations on Title Conditions, with legislation depending on how soon consultation can take place and a suitable legislative opportunity be found.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive did not issue any instructions on these matters. Any steps taken by individual Sheriffs Principal were in accordance with their statutory duty to secure the speedy and efficient disposal of business in their Sheriffdoms. I have already acknowledged the professionalism shown by the Judiciary in responding to the extra demands on them arising from the suspension of temporary Sheriffs and temporary Judges.</p>

  <p>It is not appropriate for me to comment on individual cases. Under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, local authorities have a duty to safeguard the welfare of children in need. This is especially the case when children are under the supervision of local authorities. Extensive guidance has already been issued to local authorities to help them discharge their duties under the Act.</p>

  <p>Proposals for legislation to regulate the social services workforce are contained in the consultation paper <i>Regulating Care and the Social Services Workforce</i> which issued in December 1999. The legislation will establish the Scottish Social Services Council which will register key groups of social work staff as a prerequisite before they can be employed or continue in employment. In developing this body, the Scottish Executive is seeking to ensure that users of social services have confidence in those who provide the services.</p>

  <p>There would be financial and economic benefits were the construction of the Glasgow Southern Orbital and the M77 extension to coincide, and consideration is being given to a joint contract to achieve this. It is too early to say whether this will be achieved as there are technical, financial and procedural matters to be considered. These include resolution of objections to the Glasgow Southern Orbital.</p>

  <p>If there is not to be a joint contract, East Renfrewshire Council and South Lanarkshire Council, the promoters of the Glasgow Southern Orbital, would decide on the timing of the construction of that road. It would be for those two councils also to advise you as to the likely effects of that road on employment in Ayrshire.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. The information largely relates to reports, consultations and studies commissioned by the Scottish Executive since 1 July 1999. However, in view of their significance, two exercises initiated by The Scottish Office prior to 1 July 1999, namely <i>Travel Choices for Scotland</i> &#8211; <i>Strategic Roads Review</i> and <i>Borders Rail Feasibility Study</i> have been included. Other routine and ad hoc reports which have been received or published under the terms of contracts placed or work initiated by The Scottish Office prior to 1 July 1999 are not included above.</p>

  <p>2. The cost information relates only to external costs incurred e.g. consultancy fees and printing costs. Information is not held on in-house costs e.g. staff costs arising from the drafting of consultation papers, preparation of research briefs etc. Where external costs have been shared with another body or bodies, the figure relates to the Scottish Office/Scottish Executive&#8217;s contribution.</p>

The scheme currently before Scottish Ministers comprises two Notices of Intention to Develop. In addition, each council has promoted a Compulsory Purchase Order and a Side Roads Order. These Orders, which are deemed necessary by them to facilitate the building of the road, are currently the subject of objections. Negotiations between the Councils and the objectors are ongoing.</p>

  <p>In the event of the objections to the Orders not being withdrawn, the parties have the right to be heard at a Public Local Inquiry (PLI). In such a case, papers would be passed to the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters Unit whereupon relevant notice of the PLI would be issued to each of the organisations and individuals who had made representations concerning the merits of the proposal.</p>

  <p>The sequence of other activities leading to the invitation to tender is a matter for East Renfrewshire and South Lanarkshire Councils, as promoters for the scheme.</p>

  <p>The table below shows the level of funding made available by the Scottish Office to voluntary organisations for 1998-99 by Department. An exercise is due to commence shortly to update this database to show funding from the Scottish Executive. That information will show outturn figures for 1998-99 and 1999-2000 and planned funding for 2000-01.</p>

  <p>It is also planned to collect data relating to the funding of voluntary organisations by executive agencies. At present this information is not readily available. I will arrange for this information to be made available once it has been collected.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body has funded Members on the following foreign trips:</p>

  <p>Mr Michael Russell &#8211; India &#8211; Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference on &quot;Parliament and the Media: Building and Effective Partnerships&quot;</p>

  <p>The costs of these individual trips are not available, as this information is not held in this format.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body has put in place mechanisms to record the costs of committees travelling and for delegations, but not for individual trips. However, the total cost of trips, both national and international, that have been approved by the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body will be available at the financial year-end.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to place copies of the breakdown of trips in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>
