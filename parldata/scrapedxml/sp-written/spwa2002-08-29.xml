  <p>The study on the development of a soil protection strategy for Scotland by Stirling University was finalised in February and future action is now being considered. The recommended review of the available survey data being carried out by the Macaulay Land Use Research Institute has yet to be received but I am led to believe it is now nearing completion. Once it is available we will take forward consideration of the need for a soil protection strategy for Scotland.</p>

  <p>I can announce that a report on the outcomes of the first consultation paper, focussing on the past performance of the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council (SHEFC), is now available. This is being sent to all respondents, is available on the Scottish Executive website (www.scotland.gov.uk/who/elld/hereview.asp) and copies placed in the Parliament's Reference Centre (Bib. number 23187). The written responses received by the Executive are also available on the Scottish Executive website.</p>

  <p>The general outcome of the review is positive with the SHEFC being perceived to have performed well and to have sound internal processes and procedures. The report also highlights where further improvements in the operation of SHEFC can be made.</p>

  <p>This marks the completion of the Quinquennial Review of SHEFC and of stage one of the Higher Education Review process looking at the past performance of SHEFC. We are currently concluding the second stage of consultation based on the document <i>Shaping Our Future</i> which was issued at the end of April 2002.</p>

  <p>The information requested is as follows:</p>

  <p>(a) Steering groups are at different stages in adopting formal constitutions and membership policies. If a constitution and membership policy has been adopted, this should provide a right of appeal for any person excluded. If a constitution and membership policy is not yet in place, any person excluded could appeal to the organisation which established the steering group.</p>

  <p>(b) If a local housing organisation (LHO) is unregistered the same principles will apply to that of a steering group. If an LHO is registered with Communities Scotland the same principles governing a housing association will apply (See paragraph c).</p>

  <p>(c) A person can complain to a housing association using the association&rsquo;s complaints procedure to the point where the complaint is resolved or the procedure is exhausted. If a person is still not satisfied with the outcome they can refer the matter to Communities Scotland.</p>

  <p>(d) If a person is excluded from an Area Housing Partnership they may appeal to the Strategic Housing Partnership &ndash; i.e. a partnership between Glasgow City Council and Communities Scotland.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities to analyse housing needs in their areas and make plans to meet those needs. However, there are a number of national initiatives that can help increase the supply of affordable housing in rural areas.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland&rsquo;s Rural Development Programme has been increased from &#163;36 million in 1998-99 to &#163;48 million in 2002-03. The bulk of this investment is in affordable housing provided by Registered Social Landlords. This programme provided 1,178 new and improved homes across Scotland in 2001-02, and has a target of 1,266 homes for 2002-03. The current New Housing Partnership initiative will also have provided 1,360 new and improved homes in rural areas by the time it comes to an end in 2003.</p>

  <p>Communities Scotland&rsquo;s programme includes means-tested Rural Home Ownership Grants to assist people with a local connection or with local employment to own a home which will be their sole residence. It helps them to build a house or have one built where there is an insufficient supply, or to buy a house that has been on the market for at least six months. Rural Empty Properties Grant is available to private landlords to bring empty property back into good condition for renting, for the benefit of the local community. Both these grant schemes can be a source of accommodation for key workers where the grant criteria are met.</p>

  <p>Through New Housing Partnership funding to Highland Council and subsequent joint funding by Communities Scotland, the Highland Small Communities Housing Trust has been supported to deliver tailored housing solutions in small rural communities. It has assisted the provision of accommodation for workers and a school teacher in Ardnamurchan. Rural Partnership for Change, which was established by the Scottish Executive, is working with the Highland Small Communities Housing Trust and is considering the wider implications of its approach.</p>

  <p>My colleagues and I are absolutely committed to the delivery of a fair, open and transparent public appointments system. Arrangements are kept under continuous review and improvements introduced whenever and wherever appropriate.</p>

  <p>Neither the audit reports received by the Executive nor the Commissioner&rsquo;s Annual Report refer to individuals or specific public bodies. The contents of the reports are a matter for the Commissioner who is generally satisfied that the Executive complies with her Code of Practice. She has also made it clear that no appointment made by Scottish ministers was brought into doubt as a result of the audit and that the concerns expressed in her report related solely to the process adopted. Action taken by the Executive to address these issues is set out in the following table.</p>

If only one candidate meets the criteria for appointment, ministers must be given 
the option of re-opening the competition. Where re-opening the competition is 
unlikely to bring forward new candidates because of the open process that has 
been followed, this should be made clear to ministers. Teams have also been asked 
to ensure that vacancies are made known to as wide a field of candidates as possible. 
As part of the parliamentary notification system introduced in May this year, 
the Executive&rsquo;s Public Appointments Team sends details of all vacancies to 
all ministers, Parliament and a number of outside bodies. The team also maintains

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how much it pays to the London based company reSearchWeb for work in respect of the social work research website www.researchweb.org.uk and why this contract was awarded to a company outwith Scotland, given its position on the importance of the knowledge-based economy in Scotland.</p>

  <p>The contract for reSearchWeb was awarded in 1999 as part of the Scottish Executive's contribution to this UK organisation agreed with other parts of the UK. The National Institute for Social Work (NISW) owns the international research database at the heart of reSearchWeb. The Scottish Executive paid the NISW &#163;50,000 in each of the financial years 1998-99 and 1999-2000. No funding was awarded in the financial year 2001-02.</p>

  <p>The National Institute for Social Work has now been replaced by the Social Care Institute for Excellence (SCIE). The Executive will be reviewing its contract with SCIE later this financial year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-27236 by Iain Gray on 29 July 2002, why all accounts of students that progress from higher education courses at college to higher level courses at university cannot be merged successfully and, in particular, (a) what the difficulties are in matching and merging personal data, (b) for how long this situation has existed and (c) what action it has taken in respect of this matter.</p>

  <p>Difficulties in matching accounts usually occur because of discrepancies in the information provided on the original and the most recent loan application form which would otherwise have enabled the applications to be matched to the same borrower. This can be a difference in the format of a borrower&rsquo;s name or contact details, or the omission of the declaration that a student loan has been taken out before. The automatic system checks which prevent these accounts being merged are in place for the security of applicants to ensure that new loan applications are not attributed to other borrowers&rsquo; accounts.</p>

  <p>This situation has existed since the introduction of the student loans scheme. It is, however, highly unlikely to occur with the current system of income contingent repayment student loans where repayments are collected directly by Inland Revenue.</p>

  <p>The Student Loans Company has a dedicated team which deals with &quot;stand alone&quot; accounts and is working to enhance its computer system to improve automatic matching.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-27236 by Iain Gray on 29 July 2002, whether any former students that incurred default notice debts as a result of the Student Loans Company (SLC) computer system being unable to rationalise, match and merge personal data should be required to pay financial penalties as a result of this situation and what the reasons are for its position on this matter.</p>

  <p>No student should be required to pay a financial penalty as a result of the SLC system failing to match data. Where a default notice has been issued to a borrower who holds an unmatched or &quot;stand alone&quot; account which is up to date with repayments or in deferment, SLC should reverse the default notice and bring the account into line with its partner.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-27236 by Iain Gray on 29 July 2002, whether the acceptance criteria for student loan applications and subsequent validation process should have prevented any students that progressed from a higher education course at college to a higher level course at university in any form of default from being permitted to access further monies.</p>

  <p>If a student loan applicant is recorded on the Student Loans Company system as holding an existing account which is in arrears or default, the system should automatically withhold payment of further support until the existing default debt is settled.</p>

  <p>Former students who incur default notice debts as a result of SLC system failing to match data should not be advised that there is no appeals process in respect of such default. The Student Loans Company has an objective and thorough formal complaints procedure which provides for investigation of situations such as this. Where complainants are not satisfied with the outcome of the investigation they can ask for their complaint to be reviewed by a senior manager, the Chief Executive and, ultimately, an impartial independent assessor.</p>

  <p>Yes. A total of three public local inquiries has been commissioned to address unresolved objections to Stopping Up Orders under the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997. These affected Philipshill Road and Glen Road, East Kilbride (2001); Tryst Road, Cumbernauld (2002), and the footpath between Neidpath Avenue and Beauly Place, Coatbridge (2002).</p>

  <p>In addition, South Lanarkshire Council has commissioned two public hearings in 2002 to address unresolved objections to Local Authority Traffic Orders made under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984. These affected various streets in Cambuslang, and Queen Street and Kirkwood Street in Rutherglen town centre.</p>

  <p>South Lanarkshire Council and East Renfrewshire Council also jointly commissioned a public local inquiry in 2000 under The Compulsory Purchase by Public Authorities (Inquiry Procedure) (Scotland) Rules 1998 into proposals for the construction of the Glasgow Southern Orbital road.</p>

  <p>Under the Road Traffic Regulation Act 1984, local roads authorities have a general duty to secure the expeditious, convenient and safe movement of traffic. This general duty is met by the local authority making traffic regulation orders for reasons which can include the restriction of parking on certain roads.</p>
