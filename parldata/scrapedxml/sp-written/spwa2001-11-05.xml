  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what effect the European Commission&#8217;s recent proposal to make all medicines for livestock and horses available only on prescription will have on agricultural merchant businesses.</p>

  <p>This proposal forms part of a much wider set of proposals to amend and update the procedures for the authorisation and control of both human and veterinary medicines in the EU. In its present form this particular proposal could prevent agricultural merchants supplying medicines intended for administration to food-producing animals. Veterinary medicines legislation is not devolved. But my officials are liasing closely with DEFRA colleagues to try to modify the proposals to allow a more flexible approach to be adopted to product distribution.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive (a) whether it will publish an anonymised account of the full report of its internal investigation into the failure to renew the Erskine Bridge toll order, (b) what the specific reasons are for its position on this matter and (c) how its position reflects its stated aims for open government.</p>

  <p>We undertook during the debate on the Erskine Bridge Tolls Bill to publish the conclusions and recommendations of the investigation. We did so on 15 October. These cover what happened, and the next steps to avoid a recurrence. The publication of this information is in keeping with the <i> Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information</i> . Publication of the full report or an anonymised version would not be in the public interest, as disclosure of this information would prejudice the effective conduct of personnel management in the Scottish Executive (Exemption 7 of Part II of the <i>Code of Practice on Access to Scottish Executive Information</i> ).</p>

  <p>The Registrar General has today published his proposals arising from the consultation <i>Civil Registration in the 21st Century</i> . Copies have been placed in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre. Some proposals can be implemented without legislation. The Registrar General will take these forward as soon as possible. Other proposals will require primary or secondary legislation, which will be announced and brought forward when a suitable opportunity arises.</p>

  <p>The relevant legislation makes the individual applicant or job seeker responsible for the payment of the appropriate fee. Prospective employers may reimburse the applicant but that would be entirely a matter for them to decide.</p>

  <p>We are making available &#163;1 million per annum so that volunteers working with children and vulnerable adults in the voluntary sector may have criminal record checks carried out, without cost to them or to the voluntary organisations concerned. We are presently examining the possibility of extending free checks to such volunteers in the statutory sector.</p>

  <p>An information brochure on the new disclosure system is in the final stages of preparation and should be generally available within the next few weeks. In addition to this, the Scottish Criminal Record Office is setting up a series of seminars at various locations across Scotland for organisations considering becoming registered for the purposes of accessing the new system. The seminars will provide a more detailed insight into the new processes and will give organisations an opportunity to ask questions on particular matters which may concern them. A website will shortly be available to promote the new disclosure system on a wider basis.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise plans to spend up to &#163;9.5 million during 2001-02 in support of recovery programmes designed to combat the impact of foot-and-mouth disease. This represents 2.4% of Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s current grant-in-aid allocation of &#163;395 million.</p>

  <p>As its area of operations was worst affected by the outbreak, Scottish Enterprise Dumfries and Galloway will receive &#163;5.5 million of Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s planned spend on this subject.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the &quot;power of well-being&quot; provisions to be granted to local authorities under its proposed Local Government Bill will create a duty to clear rubbish off the foreshore.</p>

  <p>The power of well-being will not place a specific duty on local authorities in this regard. We envisage the power as a general power to allow local authorities to do anything to promote or improve the well-being of their area, subject to certain safeguards. It will be for local authorities to decide how the power could best be used in responding to the needs and priorities of their area.</p>

  <p>Local authorities are principal litter authorities under section 86 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 and have a duty, as respects their relevant land, to ensure that the land is, so far as is practicable, kept clear of litter and refuse.</p>

  <p>Like all contracts, costs of termination depends on many factors, including the reasons for such a decision and the point of time in the contract. Such costs would require detailed calculation by independent advisers, both financial and legal.</p>

  <p>The marketing of Scotland as a golf tourism destination is, and will continue to be, a high priority. VisitScotland is spending around &#163;1.5 million this year. As a major golfing area, Ayrshire will feature strongly in this effort and, of course, the area is also heavily promoted by Ayrshire and Arran Tourist Board.</p>

  <p>Funds identified during the current year for the Ryder Cup bid have been fully allocated. The approach to future years will be discussed further with the Ryder Cup Committee and other parties in the light of the decision that the event will not come to Scotland until 2014. The marketing of Scotland as a golf destination will remain an important part of the overall tourism strategy throughout this period and will be funded accordingly.</p>
