  <p>The Scottish Executive part funded Children in Scotland&#8217;s &quot;Growing up in Rural Scotland&quot; programme, which, in 2001, included research into the role of local enterprise companies in rural childcare. It explored practical examples such as childcare as a business, sustainability of child care and funding.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has also undertaken a programme of work with voluntary organisations, local enterprise companies (LECs) and childcare partnerships to engage employers in providing for childcare needs.</p>

  <p>The Executive funds a wide range of many and varied projects which promote constructive dialogue between service providers in rural areas and between service providers and their customers, including projects which are funded through the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund and the Modernising Government Fund. We also encourage such dialogue more generally through community planning.</p>

  <p>An example from the Modernising Government Fund is the Dialogue Youth project which was piloted in two rural areas (Argyll and Bute and Angus) and aims to provide young people with a range of information, ideas and incentives to enable them to make informed decisions and choices and turn their own ideas into action. Following the success of the pilots the Scottish Executive provided &#163;5.4 million in funding to roll out Dialogue Youth across all 32 local authority areas by December 2005.</p>

  <p>We also fund the Rural Community Gateway website which is designed to foster dialogue between service providers by providing better access to information for those living and working in rural communities and encouraging the sharing of good practice both locally and across rural Scotland.</p>

  <p>In addition, through the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund, we fund strategic Local Rural Partnerships, usually covering a local authority area, for a maximum of three years to engage local government agencies and the voluntary and private sectors to plan strategically for their rural area.</p>

  <p>We have instigated a range of initiatives to celebrate EU enlargement, in Scotland, in Brussels and in the new member states.</p>

  <p>In Scotland I hosted a business event in Glasgow on 5 May to celebrate enlargement and the success of Scottish business in the new member states. The Deputy Education Minister participated in an enlargement webchat with young people on the Scottish Executive website on 29 April. The Deputy Minister for Finance and Public Services hosted an enlargement/Europe day lecture given in Edinburgh Castle on 10 May by the Estonian Minister for Economic Affairs and Communications, Mr Meelis Atonen.</p>

  <p>The First Minister sent a letter to major newspapers in the new member states, welcoming their citizens to the EU.</p>

  <p>In Brussels, we have organised a season of films from the new member states throughout 2004. This was opened in January by the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport.</p>

  <p>Officials from the Scottish Executive are undertaking a programme of fact-finding visits to the new member states to mark enlargement; three of these visits were timed to coincide with accession day.</p>

  <p>We have also developed an EU enlargement section of our website.</p>

  <p>Additionally, we continue to work closely with external partners, including the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the British Council, the European Commission, Scottish business organisations and the Edinburgh Consortium on a further range of initiatives to celebrate EU Enlargement. This included my opening speech at the outdoor family public event in Princes Street Gardens, organised by the Edinburgh Consortium to mark accession day on 1 May.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-06-04.8.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80115" speakername="Nicol Stephen" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0604.htm#8">

  <p>The proposals for tendering the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services, published for consultation in June 2002, explained that it was the intention to broadly replicate the existing services and timetables. We received a good response to the consultation exercise, including representations for alternative ferry services to South Uist. We are currently in the process of finalising the service specification, reflecting points made through the consultation exercise. There seems little scope to accommodate an alternative route servicing South Uist in the service specification as it would require an additional vessel and crew. We would need to consider the costs of this against other competing pressures on the transport budget.</p>

  <p>However, the service specification will not set in stone the services and timetables for the contract period. There would be opportunities for changes to be approved provided the operator has agreed these with the local communities concerned through the consultative mechanism and the financial consequences are acceptable to the Executive. The Executive also plans to undertake research during the first two years of the tendered contract to develop ideas for service and related vessel developments that might feed into the second contract. This proposal, along with others that have been suggested in relation to the network, will be considered for inclusion in the research.</p>

  <p>In relation to the hardship relief scheme there was no underspend as the &#163;1.8 million figure was an estimation of the maximum amount of relief that could be granted. It was never a commitment to put this amount aside in order to aid the onshore sector as that could be classed as a state aid.</p>

  <p>Food safety is the responsibility of the Food Standards Agency (FSA). Monitoring of the safety and quality of food is carried out routinely by local authorities in their capacities as &quot;Food Authorities&quot; under the Food Safety Act 1990. Local authorities determine local priorities for sampling surveillance but will also contribute to wider national surveys when required.</p>

  <p>The agency also undertakes a programme of UK surveys, however, there are currently none that specifically address the monitoring of listeria, <em>E. coli,</em> pesticides or carcinogens in salads and vegetables offered for sale in modified atmospheric packaging in supermarkets.</p>

  <p>On advice from the Advisory Committee on the Microbiological Safety of Food (ACMSF), the FSA is currently consulting on its "Guidance on the safety and shelf-life of vacuum and modified atmosphere packed chilled foods". The aim of the consultation is to produce guidance for manufacturers, retailers and local authorities (food enforcement) that assists them to be aware of the steps that they need to take to control food poisoning bacteria and avoid some of the confusion that surrounds what is a very technical area.</p>

  <p>Following the positive evaluation of the UK Colorectal Cancer Screening Pilot the Executive has re-affirmed the commitment given in <em>Cancer in Scotland </em> to introduce a national bowel cancer screening programme. The planning process, which will take around five years, has begun and the key components are outlined in the Bowel Cancer Framework for Scotland which was published in April 2004. A copy of the Framework is available in the Parliament&#8217;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 32698). The role of public awareness campaigns, which is primarily for NHS boards, is covered in the Framework.</p>

  <p>Detailed arrangements for the restructuring of the post office network are operational matters for the Royal Mail which is answerable to its regulator, Postcomm and the UK Government on all aspects of these reserved matters. A decision to close a Post Office branch is made only after taking full account of feedback received from customers, MPs, MSPs or assembly members, councillors, local authorities, groups such as Age Concern and Citizen&#8217;s Advice Bureau, and the independent consumer watchdog, Postwatch. To date in Scotland the Royal Mail have proposed for closure only branches where the sub-postmaster has expressed a desire to leave the business and the business is designated as not viable.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has expended a total of &#163;189,000 on dissemination of good practice in the use of rural community buildings in the last two years. This includes the development of the Rural Community Gateway Website, a website devoted to sharing information and advice to rural communities in Scotland.</p>

  <p>We want to ensure that communities across rural Scotland continue to learn from each other. In 2003 we commissioned a project to investigate innovative approaches to service delivery in rural Scotland, which included cases involving village halls and other community facilities. We launched the <em>Innovative Methods of Service Delivery in Rural Scotland: A Good Practice Guide</em> at the Rural Services Conference in September 2003.</p>

  <p>Consideration of the management and use of school buildings is the responsibility of the local authorities.</p>

  <p>Disability discrimination legislation, including the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA), is reserved to the UK Government. The Department of Works and Pensions has conducted an awareness raising campaign to ensure that those with responsibility for public facilities take steps to improve the accessibility of their facilities. This would include rural community buildings where they are managed either by the local authority or by the voluntary sector.</p>

  <p>While there is no Scottish Executive funding available to the voluntary sector specifically for DDA compliance, the Local Capital Grants Scheme, one of the strands of the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund, has provided grants to 22 community groups over the last two years to upgrade their buildings in compliance with the DDA. Local authorities are expected to consider their responsibilities under DDA in identifying capital investment priorities.</p>

  <p>The Executive has worked to facilitate a pilot project aimed at testing the &quot;Community Mall&quot; concept as an innovative approach to providing services in rural areas.</p>

  <p>As a result of this work, Borders Enterprise has recently commissioned phase two of the Walkerburn Community Mall study. Phase two builds on phase one which was an initial exploration of the potential for a community mall in the area. Phase two will include an architectural assessment of sites, an evaluation of outline proposals for the project and an initial exploration of the market potential. Key partners in the project are Scottish Borders Council, Borders Enterprise and the Walkerburn community.</p>

  <p>We will be exploring any potential for roll out from this project to other areas of rural Scotland in due course.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive published research on rural accessibility in 2002 that examined the relationship between travel patterns and access to rural services. Also in 2002, we published Availability of Services In Rural Scotland, which provided maps of access to services using a drive-time measure. The Executive has also co-funded a study on settlements, services and access in partnership with the Treasury, Countryside Agency and the Welsh Assembly.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive published <em>The Review of International Best Practice in Service Delivery to Remote and Rural Areas</em> in 2002. In May we announced funding for the DESERVE project through the Northern Periphery Programme, an EU Interreg IIIb programme, which aims to test different models for rural service delivery and share best practice across Northern Europe. This project is a three-year project beginning in July 2004.</p>

  <p>The Executive is fully aware of the need to take into account the requirements of other funders in relation to the provision of rural community facilities.</p>

  <p>A consultation on the Scottish Rural Partnership Fund (SRPF) came to an end on 28 May. One of the schemes within the SRPF is the Local Capital Grants Scheme which provides funding for new or upgraded community facilities for educational, social and recreational activities. As part of the consultation process, we have discussed with a number of funders, including local authorities, the Community Fund</p>

  <p>and community and voluntary organisations across Scotland, their needs in relation to the funding of community facilities. These discussions will be on-going once changes to the SRPF following the consultation process are clear.</p>

  <p>An external evaluation of the SRPF was carried out in the autumn of 2003 which explored many of these same issues.</p>

  <p>In addition, we work closely on a regular basis with local authorities in relation to the day to day running of the SRPF and with the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations (SCVO) and others regarding the provision of funding for village halls.</p>

  <p>The Highland Wellbeing Alliance/Post Office/Barataria Foundation pilot project was set up to test ways of delivering services through the Post Office network. Post Offices are a matter reserved to the UK Government. The package of support from the DTI to Post Office Ltd includes a Flexible Fund for the development of innovative pilot projects for the delivery of postal services. A significant element of this programme is the development of partnerships with public and voluntary sector organisations. In Scotland, this has included a partnership with Fife Constabulary where four post offices are providing basic policing services across the counter. Post Office Ltd are also investigating whether they can partner Scottish Enterprise Borders in the Walkerburn &quot;community mall&quot; pilot.</p>

  <p><em>A Smart, Successful Scotland</em> (SSS), together with the progress measures in <em>Measuring Progress Towards a Smart Successful Scotland</em> , set the strategic direction for the enterprise networks. SSS requires Scottish Enterprise to take a number of cross-cutting issues, including social justice, into account in pursuing the priorities set out. Relevant progress measures include: the proportion of 16 to 19-year-olds not in education, training or employment and reducing the gap in unemployment rates between the worst areas and the Scottish average.</p>

  <p>As set out in its Operating Plan, Scottish Enterprise contributes to the Executive&#8217;s social justice milestones, including reducing the proportion of unemployed people and increasing the employment rates of groups relatively disadvantaged in the labour market. Details of related activities and targets are set out in Scottish Enterprise&#8217;s Operating Plans.</p>
