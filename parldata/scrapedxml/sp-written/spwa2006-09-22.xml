<p>No. There is a recent report on the English and Welsh energy regulations, carried out by Future Energy Solutions entitled <em>Compliance with Part L1 of the 2002</em> <em>Building Regulations (An investigation into the reasons for poor compliance)</em> which was commissioned by &lsquo;The Energy Efficiency Partnership for Homes&rsquo;.

<p>the Building Warrant Certificate issues prior to building commencement, and<br />
                that all Building Control officers are still attached to the Local Authorities.&quot;</p>

  <p>I have asked Dr. Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>There are no proposals for compulsory testing. The recent Scottish building regulations consultation did not involve a review of procedures, it was solely on the standards and technical guidance. A comprehensive review of procedures was undertaken in 2003. However, the recent public consultation on energy standards in Scottish building regulations proposed guidance on airtightness testing of new buildings. Relatively few respondees objected to these proposals. Decisions still have to be made on whether or not these proposals are taken forward when changes are made to the energy standards in 2007.</p>

  <p>Local authorities will receive &pound;8.8 million this year and over &pound;9 million next year for Cycling, Walking and Safer Streets projects, and &pound;11.3 million and &pound;11.6 million this and next year to implement 20mph schemes around schools making the local environment safer for those choosing to walk or cycle to school. We currently provides funding of &pound;1.24 million for the School Travel Coordinator programme to promote active travel options, including cycling, for school children and to increase the proportion of non-car based travel associated with school run congestion. All local authorities have a least one school travel coordinator working with schools in their areas.</p>

  <p>We also provide core funding of &pound;400,000 to Cycling Scotland to promote the benefits of cycling, not just for leisure purposes but also as a travel option, and to run a training programme for those who deliver cycle training in schools. Cycle training is offered to all P6 and P7 pupils throughout Scotland and is designed to provide pupils with the skills and knowledge needed to cycle safely on the road.</p>

  <p>In June this year, I announced a funding package of &pound;8 million to Sustrans over this and the next financial year to upgrade and expand the National Cycle Network, focussing on building links to schools and increasing connectivity between home and school. I have also identified funding of &pound;10 million for measures to tackle the school run and will be announcing how this will be spent in due course.</p>

  <p>All of the above measures will provide pupils, parents and carers, who would otherwise travel to school by car, with a realistic option for travelling to school by bike.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in light of the proposal to transfer sole responsibility for the compilation of <em>An Inventory of Gardens and Designed Landscapes to Historic Scotland</em> , what measures will be taken to ensure the continued availability of grants for landowners towards the compilation of management plans for historic designed landscapes, which have until now been allocated by Scottish Natural Heritage, and whether specific provision for this will be made within Historic Scotland&rsquo;s budget.</p>

  <p>The detailed arrangements for the transfer of responsibilities in this area from Scottish Natural Heritage to Historic Scotland, including future grants arrangements, are still under consideration. The transfer is not due to take place until 2008-09.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive why it proposes in paragraphs 2.20 and 2.21 of Scottish Historic Environment Policy 3: Gardens and Designed Landscapes to remove the major responsibility for designed landscapes from Scottish Natural Heritage, given that the October 2005 concordat between Historic Scotland and Scottish Natural Heritage acknowledges the need for a more integrated approach to the conservation and management of Scotland&rsquo;s historic environment.</p>

  <p>The proposal comes from a recommendation in a <em>Strategic Review of Scottish Natural Heritage </em> (SNH) published in July 2005. The review commented that there are strong links between natural and cultural heritage but that designed landscapes constitute a relatively specialised area of work relating to historic, man-made and cultivated areas which is not in the main stream of SNH work. Historic Scotland concurs with this view. Indeed the transfer of full responsibility for statutory advice on such sites to Historic Scotland will offer benefits of match with main remit and a simplification of consultation requirements for local authorities.</p>

  <p>Historic Scotland will take an integrated approach to the natural and cultural heritage interests found on these sites and will work closely with SNH where there are natural heritage interests.</p>

Following the introduction of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004, the police have the power to issue &pound;50 fixed penalty fines to those caught fly-tipping.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has not made any specific assessment in relation to this reported contamination since the two maize varieties concerned are not relevant to UK agriculture, however, maize lines Mon810 and Bt11 are already authorised for import and processing as food and feed and therefore there are no safety implications for food supply.</p>

  <p>The Slovenian report names France and Canada as the countries of origin of the affected batches of &quot;PR38F10 and PR37H24&quot; respectively. The tests were qualitative assays and so the level of GM presence was not determined. We have no information on the source of the Bt11 maize contamination.</p>

  <p><em>Delivering for Health</em> set out the Executive&rsquo;s response to the Kerr Report&rsquo;s recommendations on the effective management of long term conditions. This includes the development of the Community Health Partnership Toolkit, a mandatory self-assessment tool which will enable each CHP to determine how responsive services are to the totality of the needs of those with a long term condition, which we would interpret as including chronic pain. The content of the Toolkit is currently out for consultation, and the Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland has been included in order to give generic comments from the perspective of those with long term conditions.</p>

  <p>Self-management is also an essential element of the long term condition management model, and the Executive is providing funding to two organisations who are developing self management strategies for people with chronic pain. Developing self-management initiatives is also an important focus of the work of the Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland.</p>

  <p>This information is not held by the Scottish Executive. The regulation of health and safety at work in Great Britain, including within the construction industry, and the publication of related statistics, is a matter for the Health and Safety Commission and Executive. However, my officials have been able to obtain the following information from the Health and Safety Executive showing accidents recorded in the construction industry in East Lothian since 1999.</p>

  <p>Householders seeking connection to the mains electricity supply may be eligible for a housing improvement and repair grant from their by local authority if their house is deemed below the tolerable standard set out in the Housing (Scotland) Act 1987. The tolerable standard includes a requirement for adequate lighting, heating, cooking facilities and hot water, all of which will require a source of power.</p>

  <p>Grants may be given to improve or replace an inadequate power supply. However, use of a generator may be more appropriate, for example in remote areas. It is unlikely that a grant would be given for connection to the mains when a generator in working order is in place.</p>

  <p>The question asks for details of sums applied for and seized. This terminology does not sit easily with the processes which are available under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. I have therefore given below the value of orders made under the various processes; confiscation order following conviction, forfeiture of cash, and civil recovery.</p>

  <p>An application for a confiscation order can only be made following conviction. In relation to the civil processes, an application for forfeiture of cash or for a recovery order will only be made following an extensive investigation during which Scottish ministers will have satisfied themselves that they can prove that the property is recoverable. Steps can be taken at an early stage under each of these processes to &quot;freeze&quot; assets to make them available to meet a subsequent confiscation, forfeiture, or recovery order.</p>

  <p>(a) The total value of Criminal Confiscation Orders made since the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 came into force is as follows:</p>

  <p>The interplay between European and domestic legislation is complicated as the former deals with penalties to be applied to support scheme payments in the event of non-compliance and the latter was intended to cover the enforcement powers. My officials are seeking further, detailed, legal advice to make clear if the circumstances that led to the convictions being set aside also means that any scheme penalties should also be set aside.</p>

  <p>If that advice, which is awaited, were that there is an undoubted read-across to support scheme payments, my officials would move to reverse any penalties applied to the producer&rsquo;s single farm payment.</p>

  <p>Average waiting times are not regarded as a particularly effective measure of the availability and efficiency of drug services. Rather, the information compiled by Alcohol and Drug Action Teams (ADATs) and submitted to Information Services Division specifies the number of people who wait for less than a week, less than two weeks and so forth, for different types of intervention. Table 1 presents information on the length of time waited, by NHS board area, for (a) clients who have received prescribed drug intervention (which includes methadone maintenance programmes) and (b) clients who are still waiting for prescribed drug intervention for the period January &ndash; March 2006, the most recent period for which comprehensive data is available.</p>

  <p>Alcohol and Drug Action Teams send aggregated data to the Information Services Division (ISD) on a quarterly basis. Reports from this data may be viewed on:</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities to decide how best to allocate their block grant and they may use their existing GAE allocation to adopt unadopted roads if this is considered to be a local priority.

  <p>This information is not held centrally.

  <p>The Highway Code across the UK, sets out the rules for the use of roads. The code states that the speed limit for a road is the absolute maximum, which must not be exceeded. It also makes it clear that exceeding the speed limit is an offence. The code does not indicate any circumstances in which it would be considered acceptable to exceed the speed limit.</p>

  <p>This information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The four year BEd course for initial teacher education contains modules on discrimination and inclusion. The Executive currently allocates &pound;13.5 million per annum to assist local authorities in providing relevant, high quality professional development opportunities for teachers. The subjects covered are for each local authority and school to decide but will take account of school, local and national priorities.</p>

  <p>The Executive has produced teaching resources to deliver anti-racist education and there are plans to produce more.</p>

  <p>UK welfare benefits and services are a reserved matter and their application is standardised across the UK. If there was evidence of differences in the application of benefits and services which disadvantage people in Scotland, there are mechanisms in place to allow appropriate dialogue to take place between the Scottish Executive and Whitehall departments.</p>
