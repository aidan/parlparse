  <p>Farmers and crofters in the Highlands and Islands benefit from the same support arrangements as farmers in all other parts of the country. This includes advice and information from SEERAD and its agencies as well as the main Common Agricultural Policy subsidies which pay some &#163;100 million per annum to farmers and crofters in the Highlands and Islands.</p>

  <p>Highlands and Islands also benefits from measures which are unique to that area including:</p>

  <p>the Agricultural Business Development Scheme which will provide &#163;17 million between 2001 and 2006;</p>

  <p>the Crofting Community Development Scheme worth around &#163;1 million between 2001 and 2006;</p>

  <p>the Crofting Counties Agricultural Grants Scheme which has a budget of &#163;2.7 million for 2001-02, and</p>

  <p>the Crofters&#146; Building Grants and Loan Scheme with a budget of &#163;2.9 million for 2001-02.</p>

  <p>Farmers and crofters in the area also benefit from the Livestock Improvement Scheme and the Highlands and Islands Veterinary Services Scheme.</p>

  <p>The service has been investing in more frontline staff and there are today some 200 more paramedics and technicians on emergency ambulances than there were 10 years ago. We are providing the Scottish Ambulance Service with additional funding which will enable it to further increase the numbers of these key staff.</p>

  <p>Moreover, proposals that are currently being considered by the department provide for the service recruiting and training an extra 100 frontline emergency ambulance staff to support priority based dispatch.</p>

  <p>On 9 January 2002, we announced a &#163;20 million package for local authorities and NHSScotland to make a significant reduction in the number of patients experiencing delayed discharge from hospitals across Scotland. This is over and above the &#163;10 million already provided to local authorities for the purpose through their Grant Aided Expenditure settlements. Additionally, an expert group, led by NHSScotland Chief Executive Trevor Jones, has been looking in detail at delayed discharge and the reasons for it. Next month, I will announce an action plan based on the work of this group, and including the distribution arrangements for the new resources, to help drive down the delayed discharge figures.</p>

  <p>The 11 Area Waste Plans currently being prepared will identify how local authorities and others can improve waste management, including recycling. We have established the Strategic Waste Fund to assist local authorities in implementing the plans. We also intend to set mandatory recycling targets informed by the Area Waste Plans to ensure that the best practicable environmental option for waste management in each area has been taken into account. We will amend existing legislation to enable such targets to be set.</p>

  <p>We have just issued <i>Beyond Trauma: Mental Health Care Needs Of Women Who Survived Childhood Sexual Abuse</i> to the health and social care agencies, asking them to respond positively to its recommendations for service improvements. It is a research report on current service provision for survivors of sexual abuse published by the Edinburgh Association for Mental Health.</p>

  <p>Signalling the importance I attach to this issue, I announced on 19 February a grant of &#163;120,000 over three years to the Moira Anderson Foundation to help raise awareness of the needs of survivors and to expand local self help groups. I also announced &#163;53,000 over two years to the Edinburgh Association for Mental Health to evaluate the operation of a national telephone helpline service for survivors of sexual abuse.</p>

  <p>We have also published guidance on the best organisation of psychological interventions services. This recognises the importance of "talking treatments" for survivors, a need highlighted in the <i>Beyond Trauma</i> research report.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in the process of implementing three waste and recycling directives into national law:</p>

  <p>1. the Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC). We plan to issue a consultation paper with proposed regulations to implement the technical aspects of the directive shortly and for these to be finalised by summer. We plan to consult later in 2002 on the allocation of permits to local authorities in order to limit the landfill of biodegradable municipal waste.</p>

  <p>2. the End-of Life Vehicles Directive (2000/53/EC). A consultation paper was issued last year. We are currently working with DEFRA, DTI and the other devolved administrations to prepare a scheme of producer responsibility for the motor manufacturing industry to be introduced later this year, and</p>

  <p>3. the Waste Incineration Directive (2000/76/EC). We plan to issue a consultation paper on implementation of this directive later this year.</p>

  <p>Legislation to amend the current implementation of the Waste Framework Directive (75/442/EEC) and the Hazardous Waste Directive (91/689/EEC) is due to be put into place this year. Guidance to local authorities on the collection and disposal of equipment containing small amounts of PCBs is currently being finalised to fulfil implementation of the PCB Waste Directive (96/59/EC). We are considering, along with other UK Government departments, further action to implement fully the requirements of the Waste Oils Directive (75/439/EEC).</p>
