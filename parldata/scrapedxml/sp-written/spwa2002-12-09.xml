  <p>The Development Department issued three publications that contain references to the Citizens Advice Bureau service. These were: <i>Mortgage Rights (Scotland) Act 2002</i> ; <i>We Are All Responsible</i> , and the <i>Model Scottish Secure Tenancy Agreement</i> .

  <p>The performance management system operating within the senior civil service, throughout the Home Civil Service, is based on the achievement of agreed objectives for each member of the senior civil service. The process takes account of continuous improvement and delivery of results and is based on relative performance where each individual is compared across their respective pay band.</p>

  <p>The first year of the new senior civil service pay system, introduced on 1 April 2002, allowed for awards of between 0% to 10%. The average increase for the senior civil service in the Scottish Executive for 2002-03 was 6.2%. The average increase for the Scottish Executive Main Bargaining Unit in respect of this same period was 7.3%. Under the previous senior civil service pay system, the average increase for 2001-02 was 4.6%. For Scottish Executive Main Bargaining Unit for the same period the average increase was 5.3%. These average increases do not reflect bonuses as bonuses are not part of salary.</p>

  <p>The pay increases in 2001-02 and 2002-03 for staff in the Scottish Executive Main Bargaining Unit are performance related and were made under an agreed three-year settlement covering the period 1 August 2000 to 31 July 2003. The pay settlement was tied to the introduction of a modern performance management system designed to ensure the delivery of key business objectives. A new performance management system for the senior civil service was also introduced in 2002. For that year, and as with previous years, the increase for the senior civil service was based on the recommendations of the Senior Salaries Review Body. Neither system provides for automatic annual increments.</p>

  <p>Each local authority area has a community safety partnership, therefore there are two partnerships in Renfrewshire, one led by Renfrewshire Council and the other led by East Renfrewshire Council.</p>

  <p>The community safety partnership in East Renfrewshire was established in January 2001. The Renfrewshire community safety partnership was approved by the council and partners in January 2002, although a Community Safety Task Group for the area had been established since October 2001.</p>

  <p>Since 1997, we have contributed to the safety of our communities in Scotland through initiatives such as the funding of CCTV, the formation of Community Safety Partnerships, an increase in police numbers and resources and other locally based community safety projects with the dual purpose of not only reducing actual crime but the fear of crime also.</p>

  <p>Recent survey information suggests that Scotland is a safer place to live compared to the rest of the UK not only for older people but also generally, and that the fear of crime amongst older people is also lower.</p>

  <p>We have set a target to reduce the fear of crime in the Justice section of the recently published <i>Building a Better Scotland - Spending Proposals 2003-06</i>. Whilst no specific target or date has been set for this to be achieved, we aim to reduce the fear of crime for all in our communities by successfully meeting other targets within the spending proposals to reduce specific areas of serious crime. This should have a positive effect on how safe our communities feel. We shall use the Scottish Crime Survey 2004 results to measure progress.</p>

  <p>The level of funding provided to police forces is now at record levels as are police numbers. Targets have also been set for the police to reduce violent crime and to increase drug seizures. CCTV has made an impact and Renfrewshire has benefited from Executive funding from the CCTV Challenge Competition, receiving a total of &#163;180,692 since 1996.</p>

  <p>On 1 April we introduced a new Community Safety Partnership Award Programme to replace challenge funding and Renfrewshire Community Safety Partnership was awarded &#163;147,522 in the current financial year to address local community safety priorities.</p>

  <p>Since 1996, Paisley Partnership has assisted local communities and agencies to develop a number of initiatives aimed at tackling crime in the 11 most disadvantaged areas in Renfrewshire. Many of these initiatives have been led by community groups and tackle the most pressing issues at local level. For example, a new initiative Communities Against Drugs is aimed at reducing the number of drug dealers in the social inclusion partnership areas.</p>

  <p>Renfrewshire Council has also been allocated &#163;4.5 million over three years from the Better Neighbourhood Services Fund for a number of community safety initiatives.</p>

  <p>The most complete information we have about Renfrewshire's allocation from the &#163;128 million (&#163;100 million augmented by a further &#163;28 million over three years from Budget Consequentials) additional funding made available for tackling drug misuse is contained in the answer given to question S1W-31752 today.</p>

  <p>I understand that the reference to CCTV funding relates to the Make our Communities Safer CCTV Challenge Competition for 2000-01, which awarded funding to 34 CCTV schemes. No application was received that year from the Renfrewshire Council area. However, Strathclyde Passenger Transport made a successful bid for CCTV in 16 railway stations, one of which is in the Renfrewshire Council area - Howwood. The Make our Communities Safer CCTV Challenge Competition ran from 1996-97 to 2001-02, awarding &#163;10.3 million to 161 projects. Successful projects within the Renfrewshire council area are detailed in the answer given to question S1W-31385 on 19 November 2002.</p>

  <p>Of the &#163;25.5 million allocated to local authorities over four years from 2000-01 to prevent and reduce youth crime, &#163;961,280 has been allocated to Renfrewshire. Of the &#163;20 million EYF money earmarked for youth crime this year, Renfrewshire has received &#163;128,506. For more information on the use of this money, I refer the member to the answer given to question S1W-31379 on 19 November 2002.

  <p>The Renfrewshire area is benefiting from activities at national level, supported by the Executive&rsquo;s &#163;130 million additional investment over three years from 2001-02 to 2003-04. Drugs education is now provided in 98% of Scottish schools. Our Know the Score Drugs Communications strategy is helping to raise public awareness about the risks from drugs, and to signpost where help and advice can be obtained throughout Scotland.</p>

  <p>Our &#163;13 million additional investment in treatment for drug misusers is helping to expand needle exchange facilities, and methadone programmes, which help to reduce levels of injecting and sharing of potentially contaminated equipment. Figures provided in the answer to written question S1W-31649 today in respect of drug injecting and sharing of equipment in Renfrewshire show an improvement in 2001-02 over the previous year.</p>

  <p>The 2000 national prevalence study estimated that there are 2,441 individuals who are misusing opiates or benzodiazepines within Renfrewshire.

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. All figures in this table exclude penal establishment inmates and information received from needle exchanges.</p>

  <p>2. The database collects anonymous information about new problem drug users presenting at a broad range of drug services across Scotland, including general practice.</p>

  <p>3. It is emphasised that the information held on the Scottish Drug Misuse Database relates to <u>new</u> patients/clients only.</p>

  <p>The definition of "new" is (a) the person is attending the particular service for the first time ever, or (b) the person has attended before but not within the previous six months.</p>

  <p>4. Includes both current and past injectors.</p>

  <p>5. When looking at trends between the years 1996-97 to 2000-01 and 2001-02, it is important to note that in April 2001 the sharing question changed from collecting data on sharing injecting equipment to collecting more detailed information on sharing needles/syringes and sharing spoons/water/filters/solution. A previous ISD study on outcomes suggested that the new information on sharing needles/syringes could be equated to the previous information on sharing injecting equipment. Caution is, however, recommended when comparing 2001-02 data with previous years.</p>

  <p>Argyll and Clyde NHS Board (drug treatment services ) &#163;1,243,484 per annum.</p>

  <p>Renfrewshire local authority (rehabilitation) &#163;235,000 per annum.</p>

  <p>Renfrewshire local authority (Changing Children's Services Fund) &#163;668,000 over three years 2001-02 to 2003-04.</p>

  <p>In addition, the area benefits from a number of other funding initiatives which impact on the drugs problem, including crime prevention and criminal justice initiatives.</p>

  <p>All Drug Action Teams report annually to the Executive on action taken, and action planned, against national targets and standards. Details can be found on the national drugs website at:</p>

  <p>We already have practical examples of managed clinical networks (MCN) at local, regional and national level. There is the cardiac services MCN in Dumfries and Galloway, the diabetes MCN in Tayside, the regional cancer MCNs and national MCNs for cleft lip and palate and home parenteral nutrition. Two demonstration MCNs, one in vascular services and one in neurology with particular reference to stroke, are being evaluated.</p>

  <p>A wide range of MCN development is being taken forward, covering conditions such as multiple sclerosis, epilepsy, asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, hepatitis C and primary immunodeficiency, as well as in areas such as pathology, mental health, learning disabilities and medical receiving in community hospitals.</p>

  <p>The CHD/Stroke Strategy makes clear that each NHS board should have a cardiac services and a stroke MCN in operation by April 2004. The Scottish Diabetes Framework has a milestone that by September 2004 Managed Clinical Networks for Diabetes will be established in each NHS board area.</p>

  <p>Patient groups and the voluntary and independent sectors have a central role to play in the development of managed clinical networks. As our Health Department Letter (HDL(2002)69) indicates, involving patients is one of the core principles of managed clinical network development. The letter also points out that the value of patient representation at all stages of managed clinical network development has been clearly demonstrated.</p>

  <p>I have asked Graeme Munro, Chief Executive of Historic Scotland to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>The conditions that Historic Scotland attaches to the grants it makes on behalf of Scottish ministers are in a standard legal form. A copy has been placed in the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre (Bib. number 25425).</p>

  <p>With regard to adjusting the level of grant, since 1998 recovery of grant has been made in six cases where excess profit was made after a disposal and following a re-appraisal. The sum recovered amounted to &#163;542,985. The financial information provided in such cases is confidential and individual details are not disclosed.</p>

  <p>Significant progress has been made with all 29 recommendations of <i>The same as you?</i> review of services for people with learning disability. Particular milestones include the setting up of Learning Disability Change Funds with effect from April 2001, totalling &#163;36 million in the first three years; establishment of the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability, launched on 5 October 2001, and preparation of Partnership in Practice agreements in every area in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Progress at national level in September and October included the issue of guidance on local area co-ordination to all local authorities and NHS boards, and the commissioning of research into the needs of people with learning disabilities who are in prison or secure accommodation. Working with The same as you? Implementation Group we will continue to work to ensure progress is maintained.</p>

  <p>Matters related to tax credits are reserved. Specific categories of tax credit recipients and their partners are passported to full help with NHS charges and receive a certificate advising them of this fact.</p>

  <p>The Executive has commissioned research into the efficiency and effect of the patient charging system on equity of access to treatment. The Executive has also collaborated with NHSScotland Counter Fraud Services (CFS), formerly known as the Fraud Investigation Unit, on publicity campaigns to inform the public of the categories of patient who are entitled to free NHS prescriptions, NHS optical vouchers, NHS sight tests and full or partial help with NHS dental treatment and to encourage those patients who fall within these categories to take up their entitlements. This collaboration will continue and the CFS has been tasked with taking forward independent initiatives to continue to clarify the position.</p>

  <p>Yes. The Scottish Executive did receive a proposal from West Sound Radio suggesting that it would pay for landscape works on the roundabouts in exchange for signs which, we understand, would carry information about the radio station and also road safety messages.

  <p>A copy of the research was sent to a named official at the Parliament&rsquo;s Reference Centre during the afternoon of 15 November.

An e-mail from the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s Media and Communications Group, timed at 14.49 and dated 15 November confirming that a copy of the research was about to be sent, has since been forwarded to my office. Furthermore, the copy of the research was seen to be placed in the Executive&rsquo;s internal post by a senior official.</p>

  <p>When the Executive was notified on 22 November that a copy of the research had not arrived, a second copy was immediately dispatched to the same address after checking that it was correct.</p>

  <p>The nature of drug-assisted sexual assault makes it difficult to obtain reliable information. Information is collected about the number of people proceeded against and convicted for sexual offences, but drug-related sexual assaults are not separately identifiable.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency's Strategic Assessment includes some estimates, but these cover many cases where the use of drugs in sexual assaults was suspected. As such, we consider that the figures are not sufficiently comprehensive or robust for publication.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many local authorities with coastal boundaries have oil pollution contingency plans and whether these plans specifically address an incident of the scale of the sinking of the Prestige off Spain on 19 November 2002.</p>

  <p>All Scottish coastal local authorities maintain counter pollution contingency plans in line with a general power under the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 with respect to emergencies or disasters. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), as the responsible UK authority, has advised local authorities that they should revise and submit their plans every five years, or earlier if substantial changes are needed.</p>

  <p>While such plans will refer to, and mesh with, the National Contingency Plan for Marine Pollution from Shipping and Offshore Installations (NCP), they will usually only cover minor spills that can be tackled locally. In the event of a major spill in the UK pollution control zone, similar to that involving the <i>Prestige </i>off Spain, the MCA will implement the NCP, calling on participation or assistance from relevant statutory bodies, and deploying the UK&rsquo;s national assets in response.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is well aware of the health risks posed by passive smoking and has consistently pressed for smoke-free facilities in both public places and workplace.</p>

  <p>To drive forward an increase in smoke-free facilities in public places we launched the Scottish Voluntary Charter on Smoking in Public Places in May 2000. The charter was signed by the four main bodies in the licensed, tourism and hospitality industries, the British Hospitality Association, the Scottish Beer and Pub Association, the Scottish Licensed Trade and the Scottish Tourism Forum. We will be reviewing progress against targets for the charter with the signatories early next year. This will allow us to consider what further action is needed to increase non-smoking provision in public places.</p>

  <p>In addition the Scottish Executive is working with the Health Education Board for Scotland on a passive smoking communication strategy to raise public awareness of the risks associated with passive smoking.</p>

  <p>We recognise the workplace is a major opportunity for health improvement. As part of our on-going health improvement drive we will be seeking to accelerate health improvement through workplace-based initiatives. Clearly, robust workplace smoking policies will continue to be central to this programme. Moreover, we will continue to press the UK Government to bring forward an Approved Code of Practice on Smoking in the Workplace which was heralded in the Smoking Kills white paper.</p>

The Exchange is to draw down, in January 2003, the first tranche of this budget for the following expenditure within the UK in this financial year:</p>

  <p>Modest staff support has been provided to the Exchange since its inception but Parliament staff do not generally keep time sheets logging individual work activities. Staff time spent on supporting the Scottish Parliament and Business Exchange cannot therefore accurately be calculated.</p>
