  <p>A review of the low income, low asset (LILA) route into bankruptcy published in October 2008 concluded that the application fee was reasonable and minimised the administration cost to the public purse.

The report also gave a commitment to consider the fee once evidence had been provided by the advice sector.</p>

  <p>The low income, low asset (LILA) route into bankruptcy came into force on 1 April 2008, the same date from which debtor applications for bankruptcy were made directly to the Accountant in Bankruptcy rather than to the courts as previously.</p>

  <p>LILA is an additional route into the bankruptcy process, not a separate scheme in itself, and the Accountant in Bankruptcy does not split the administration costs of the debtor application process.</p>

  <p>The total administrative costs of the team dealing with debtor applications are estimated at &pound;928,700 per annum.</p>

  <p>This figure does not include fees payable to third parties associated with debtor applications which are beyond the Accountant in Bankruptcy&rsquo;s direct control; principally the costs of advertising the award in the Edinburgh Gazette and registering the award with the Registers of Scotland.</p>

  <p>The estimated cost of developing the Debt Arrangement Scheme (DAS) case management system to meet the immediate demands of changes to regulations is &pound;32,000.</p>

  <p>This figure also provides for an assessment on the future suitability of the DAS IT system which, in technology terms, is aging. This work would be required irrespective of any changes to DAS.</p>

  <p>Based on 3,000 DAS applications per annum, the estimated costs to operate the DAS scheme will be around &pound;500,000 per annum. That figure is based on total cost and includes all support costs, a proportion of accommodation, management, governance and control etc.</p>

  <p>Members of the Scottish Advisory Committee on Drug Misuse (SACDM) were advised in spring 2008 of the Government&rsquo;s intention to reconstitute SACDM to give it a key role in overseeing the implementation of our national drugs strategy. On 20 April 2009 I announced that SACDM will be replaced by the Drugs Strategy Delivery Commission, with an independent chair and remit, to look afresh at strategic issues. This group will be augmented by a supporting structure of sub-groups on specific issues, including the National Evidence Group. In developing the detail of the new commission we are drawing on advice from a range of sources.</p>

  <p>The key aim of our national drug strategy is recovery from problem drug use. People achieve recovery in different ways. The strategy makes it clear that there needs to be a range of services in place to make recovery a reality, including harm reduction services such as needle exchanges, as well as community and residential rehabilitation and detoxification programmes.</p>

  <p>Our national drug strategy <em>The Road to Recovery</em> makes it clear that a range of services, including substitute prescribing, needs to be in place to enable people to recover from their drug use. It is, however, for clinicians to decide the most appropriate treatment in consultation with their patient. The <em>Drug Misuse and Dependence: UK Guidelines on Clinical Management</em> provide guidance on the treatment of drug use. The Government strongly supports these guidelines as the basis on which clinicians and other professionals should consider treatment of patients with drug use problems. A copy of the guidelines can be found at:</p>

  <p>In <em>Changing Scotland&rsquo;s Relationship with Alcohol</em>, we set out our commitment to establish a working group to update core services for alcohol treatment and support, revisiting the principles underpinning the Alcohol Treatment Services Framework; identifying and updating effective interventions, and setting out guidance on development of integrated care pathways which take into consideration multiple and complex needs.</p>

  <p>There is a range of assistance available for parents studying in further and higher education:</p>

  <p>Further Education Childcare Support</p>

  <p>Each college has a further education childcare fund which parent students can apply to. This support is additional to bursary funding and applies to registered childcare only. Some colleges, however, may additionally offer different methods of childcare support such as on-site nurseries.</p>

  <p>Higher Education Childcare Support</p>

  <p>In addition to general living cost support (in the forms of grants and student loans):</p>

  <p>Lone parent students can claim an additional &pound;1,270 as lone parent grant from the Students Awards Agency for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Funding of up to &pound;1,185 can also be claimed towards the cost of formal registered childcare as lone parent&rsquo;s childcare grant again for higher education students.</p>

  <p>Each institution is also allocated a childcare fund as part of it&rsquo;s discretionary funds. The higher education childcare fund is open to all eligible parent students and there is no cap on the maximum amount payable. It is for individual institutions to determine the level of awards. If this fund is exhausted, institutions are able to use their general discretionary fund to help with childcare costs.</p>

  <p>Support for parents with the costs of childcare is also provided through UK tax credits and childcare vouchers.</p>

  <p>The current financial climate greatly restricts the opportunities for projects requiring any new funding support. In response to question S3O-7232 I offered to explore how the anti-sectarian resource developed by YouthLink Scotland, and being used successfully in Polmont Young Offenders Institute, could be further developed for wider use with those convicted of sectarian offences. I believe that this is a practical way forward given current financial constraints.</p>

  <p>The Health Boards (Membership and Elections) (Scotland) Act 2009 (Commencement No. 1) Order 2009 was laid before Parliament on Tuesday 16 June 2009. This order names NHS Fife and NHS Dumfries and Galloway as the health boards that will pilot direct elections.</p>

  <p>When selecting these areas the following factors were considered:</p>

  <p>To minimise any disruptive turnover of health board members, areas where appointed member vacancies will occur between now and May 2010 were selected. This means that appointed member vacancies would be filled by elected members after the election.</p>

  <p>In pursuance of our simple administrative approach to pilot elections, pilot board areas that were co-terminus with local authority boundaries were chosen.</p>

  <p>To reflect the diversity of the health boards across Scotland and to ensure the pilots would provide meaningful lessons that would be transferable to other areas, one predominately rural health board and one predominantly urban area were selected.</p>

  <p>I have asked Mike Ewart, Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service (SPS), to respond. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>As recommended by Ofcom, SPS discussed with Siemens the possibility of reducing the rates that they charge prisoners for phone calls between now and the end of their contract but they have responded that for commercial reasons they are not willing to do so without a contribution from SPS. It was not deemed appropriate for SPS to subsidise a reduction in prisoner call charges.</p>

  <p>SPS understands that the reduction agreed by the National Offender Management Service (NOMS) for prisons in England and Wales is 100% funded by the commercial supplier, BT, with no contribution from NOMS and therefore a minimal impact on the taxpayer.</p>

  <p>The gender pay gap is a comparison of the average salary of females with the average salary of males for work of equal value. For equal pay purposes, staff in the same pay range are taken as doing work of equal value.</p>

  <p>Local authorities must determine for themselves how best to incorporate the biodiversity duty in their programmes and actions. There are no formal centralised monitoring arrangements. Although there is no specific obligation for local authorities to include measures relating to the biodiversity duty within their single outcome agreements, some agreements do include reference to relevant actions and targets and I have recently written to all local authorities to encourage them to consider whether this would provide a helpful way of setting out their plans for biodiversity delivery going forward.

  <p>It is not the Scottish Government&rsquo;s role to determine on whether an authority has appropriately complied with its public sector equality duties. However, as the Scottish Government is engaged with community planning partnerships (CPPs) in the development of single outcome agreements (SOAs), it recognises its responsibility to work with partners to ensure that equality is properly considered and reflected.</p>

  <p>To support this, in March 2009 the Scottish Government and COSLA issued advice on <em>Equality and Single Outcome Agreements &ndash; Getting to Best Practice</em>. This advice is intended to help community planning partners to consider how they may move beyond fulfilling their individual equalities obligations and toward jointly incorporating</p>

  <p>Class sizes in Scotland are at a record low. Maintaining teacher numbers in the face of falling school rolls is a mechanism to deliver reduced class sizes. We will work collectively with COSLA, local authorities and others to ensure we achieve even more progress on our class size agenda.</p>

  <p>Based on information returned to Health Protection Scotland by a proportion of GPs, uptake rate in the at-risk groups for the 2008-09 seasonal influenza vaccination programme is estimated at 48.5%. This compares to an estimate of 42.9% for the 2007-08 flu season.</p>

  <p>We provided YouthLink Scotland with &pound;22,000 to develop an anti-sectarian resource for youth workers. Ten inmates from Polmont Young Offenders Institution participated in the pilot which led to the development of the resource which has now been used to tackle the sectarian attitudes of over 50 further inmates since I launched it in December 2008. The resource continues to be used to work with young people who are identified by professionals at the Institution as showing sectarian behaviours.</p>
