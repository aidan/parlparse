  <p>The Scottish Government and COSLA have agreed a package of measures for 2011-12 which they have recommended to local authorities. The package is associated with an overall sum of money for local government. Each local authority is now considering whether to accept that package. The overall package includes implementation of various undertakings, including the delivery of the shared Scottish Government/COSLA commitments on free personal care.</p>

  <p>It is not possible to confirm a net decrease in woodland area in the last two years. Based on felling approvals and the area of replanting and new planting in the same reference period, there was an apparent decrease in woodland area of about 5,000 hectares but this takes no account of the time-lag between felling and replanting nor of any woodland expansion through unrecorded natural regeneration. We anticipate a net increase in woodland area in 2010-11 and succeeding years.</p>

  <p>Guidance through the Fair for All Agenda, to eliminate and promote equality of opportunity for everyone, is available to help NHS staff understand and meet their responsibilities under the Disability Discrimination Act, and to support NHS Scotland in implementing the Gender Equality Scheme Duty, which assesses progress in achieving gender equality outcomes and provides information and good practice examples of LGBT people using NHS services.</p>

  <p>Through this overarching agenda, Fair for All &ndash; LGBT has been mainstreamed within NHS Health Scotland, and is determining the focus to deliver accessible, high quality and sensitive services which fully meet the needs of Scotland&rsquo;s LGBT population.</p>

  <p>From July 2010, the Scottish Government has been funding the LGBT Centre for Health and Wellbeing to run the Demonstration Project, to provide learning and create the foundations for lasting and sustainable cultural change in relation to responding to the needs of LGBT people who experience mental health problems. The project is designed to help us learn how best to support LGBT people across Scotland, it is being guided by a Lothian based advisory group, with a wide ranging membership of stakeholders, such as NHS Lothian, Choose Life and see me, to inform its development and to encourage engagement across health, social care and equality services, communities and organisations. The projects aims to: increase access to health care and support services for LGBT people; tackle the mental health risk factors affecting LGBT people; work to promote resilience and strengthen the capacity of the LGBT community, promote the mental health and wellbeing of individuals, and provide specialist mental health input for LGBT people experiencing mental health problems.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government published <em>Partnership Matters</em> , first issued in 2005, subsequently refreshed in 2007 and again in May 2009. This is a guidance document which describes the roles and responsibilities of local authorities, NHS boards and voluntary organisations to support people with additional support needs who wish to study, or are currently studying at Scotland&rsquo;s colleges or universities. This guidance included developing staff training and guidance; enhancing central support facilities; developing drug and alcohol policies; employing wardens or organising peer support in student residencies, and promoting awareness of stress triggers and periods of increased vulnerability.</p>

  <p>In relation to this, the Scottish Further Education Unit (SFEU) was funded by the Scottish Government to develop a website to provide information and resources for college and university staff related to promoting student mental health improvement.</p>

  <p>Projects currently in partnership with the NHS include: Sharing Practice In Mental Health Improvement between NHS Lothian and the Charlie Waller Memorial Trust, looking at the mental health of students, and the Student Mental Health Group Glasgow, which is a collaborative project between the six universities in Glasgow City and NHS.</p>

  <p>All student mental health improvement initiatives can be found at the SFEU Website, mentioned above, which was launched in 2007:</p>

  <p>A new active schools monitoring system, introduced in 2008-09, which records physical activities and sport within individual primary and secondary school plans.

  <p>The Active Schools Programme was established in 2004. The programme is designed to increase the number of opportunities for children to get engaged in physical activity and sport and develop links with sports clubs and other community organisations to give pupils a &quot;pathway&quot; to continue their participation in sport beyond school. This activity is over and above PE.</p>

  <p>Active schools managers and coordinators are responsible for developing and supporting an infrastructure for active schools within the school and wider community. They do this by recruiting, supporting and sustaining a network of volunteers coaches, leaders and teachers who in turn deliver physical activity and sport before, during and after school and in the wider community.</p>

  <p>sportscotland provided around &pound;13 million to fund this programme in 2009-10 which supports over 450 Active Schools staff overseeing over 2,500 schools in all 32 local authority areas. Last year this delivered just under 5 million sessions (a 5% increase on the previous year) providing opportunities for young people to be physically active beyond PE.</p>

  <p>It is vital that physical activity forms part of all young people&rsquo;s lives and that there are appropriate opportunities to stimulate and develop interest and commitment that will provide a foundation for sustained physical activity throughout their lives. Our investment into sports governing bodies allows them to provide a range of programmes for children to take part in sport. In addition, we have invested into a number of targeted programmes which focus on providing opportunities for children in schools to take part in sport including our clubgolf and top-up swimming investments.</p>

  <p>Local authorities report that 1,167 primary schools throughout Scotland (55%) are delivering at least two hours physical education. This is supported by HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) who found year on year improvement in delivery of two hours physical education in primary schools - 32% of 237 schools inspected in 2007-08, 42% of 231 schools inspected in 2008-09 and 59% of 264 primary schools inspected in 2009-10.</p>

  <p>85 schools throughout Scotland (23%) are delivering at least two hours physical education across S1 to S4. 17 authorities reported that they are either delivering or plan to deliver at least 2x50 or 55 minute periods of core physical education across S1 to S4. This is supported by HMIE who found that 60% of 60 schools inspected in 2009/10 are delivering at least 2x50 or 55 minute periods of physical education across S1 to S4.

  <p>The quality of children and young people&rsquo;s learning in physical education is evaluated and reported on in every school inspection. In every school inspection report HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) makes comment on whether or not the school is providing pupils with two hours physical education in line with national expectations. HMIE gathers evidence about the quality of experiences for learners and other factors such as staffing, resourcing and timetabling. Where it has concerns about the quantity and quality of pupil experiences in PE, it has further discussion with relevant staff about and around the school&rsquo;s proposals to make the necessary adjustments.</p>

  <p>In addition, through ongoing inspection tasks and ongoing work with education authorities, HMIE maintains a clear overview of progress towards the target and will periodically publish on its website a report on this progress for parents, elected members and the public. This ensures that inspection and reporting look not only at the quantitative aspects of PE but also consider the quality of the provision for children and young people.</p>
