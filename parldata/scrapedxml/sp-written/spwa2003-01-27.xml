  <p>We received 7,893 claims under the 2002 Suckler Cow Premium Scheme (SCPS) by the final closing date of 31 December 2002. The numbers of producers (farmers and crofters) who have been issued advance payments are: (a) in November 2002 &#150; 1,157; (b) in December 2002 &#150; 1,386, and (c) in January 2003 (up to and including 20 January) &#150; 3,989.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what the reason was for delays in issuing 2002 Suckler Cow Premium advance payments to crofters and farmers, scheduled to be issued in November 2002 but received by many producers in mid-January 2003, and what action is being taken to avoid similar delays in the future.</p>

  <p>Advance payments under the Suckler Cow Premium Scheme (SCPS) are normally scheduled to <i>begin</i> <strong> </strong> in November but not all payments can be made at that time. Sixty-five per cent of SCPS claimants do not submit their claim form until November or December, 33% do not submit until the final week of the application period. All claims are subject to a rigorous validation process to ensure that subsidy is only paid on animals which have met scheme eligibility requirements. This process now includes the cross checking of claimed animals against the Cattle Tracing System (operated by the British Cattle Movement Service) &#150; this is a legal requirement which we must comply with &#150; and, while these cross checks have added to the complexity of claim processing, advance payments have not been delayed unduly. Over 90% of claimed animals have successfully cleared the validation process and been paid. My department will continue to make every effort to minimise any delay in the issue of payments on eligible animals.</p>

  <p>The Executive has no plans to collate information on the percentage of children in private residential care homes that have been prescribed Ritalin and similar class drugs.</p>

  <p>The decision on whether or not to prescribe a drug for a patient is always a matter for the clinical judgement of the patient&#146;s doctor, informed by advice and guidance about the drug.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care (the Care Commission) in regulating services against the legislative requirements and the relevant national care standards requires providers of care homes for children (independent and local authority), to keep accurate up-to-date records of all medicines for the use of service users. These records are kept on the premises from which the care service is provided.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Education Department commissioned Learning Teaching Scotland to map opportunities for creativity across the curriculum. A guidance document was produced which encouraged a creative approach to learning and teaching through the use of examples of good practice drawn from schools across Scotland. This publication, <i>Creativity in Education</i> , was launched in November 2001 and is further supported by additional case study material through the Learning Teaching Scotland website.</p>

  <p>A Creativity Task Force within the Executive is currently considering appropriate performance measure or quality indicators to allow for the monitoring of the delivery of creativity within education.</p>

  <p>Concurrently, the Executive is funding a joint project by Learning and Teaching Scotland and the IDES Network (International Design Enterprise Series Network) to produce and disseminate robust and practical tools for the promotion and evaluation of creativity in formal education. This work will concentrate on providing exemplification aimed at the classroom; namely teachers, the practice of learning and teaching and assessment.</p>

  <p>Also, this project will aim to point up ways in which evaluation of creativity can assist managers within schools and local authorities across Scotland and identify any implications for the wider educational community, including teacher training, continuing professional development, course guidance and arrangements and assessment procedures.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#146;s National Cultural Strategy landmark Cultural Co-ordinators in Schools programme, (as referred to in the answer given to question S1W-32856 today) is another element helping to maximise the potential of cultural activity and developing creativity in schools.

  <p>1. Trust reported expenditure has been used as a proxy for funding as this more appropriately relates to activity levels within NHS board areas. The funding percentages are based on the published Annual Accounts of individual NHS trusts and Island Health Boards as presented to Parliament.</p>

  <p>2. Activity percentages are based on the Scottish Key Indicators Package for Performance (SKIPPER), produced by the Information Services Division (ISD) of the Common Services Agency (CSA). Total activity = elective in-patients + non-elective in-patients + day cases.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-33257 by Mr Andy Kerr on 17 January 2003, whether HM Prison Kilmarnock is not an asset held by it or any body controlled by it and on whose balance sheet the prison is recorded as an asset.</p>

  <p>The contract to design, construct, manage, and finance a prison at Kilmarnock was awarded by the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) under the Private Finance Initiative. The 25-year contract period commenced in March 1999 and so its accounting treatment was assessed using Technical Note 1 (Revised) <i>How to account for PFI Transactions</i> .</p>

  <p>At the end of the contract period the prison building comes into the ownership of the SPS. In the meantime, the SPS accounts for its commitments under the contract and for its reversionary interest in the property. Since the SPS is an Executive Agency of the Scottish Executive, the same accounting treatment applies in the consolidated accounts of the Scottish Executive (which report the performance, assets and liabilities of all bodies within the Scottish Executive accounting boundary). The external auditor, Audit Scotland, accepts this view.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware that the private sector contractor, supported by their external auditor, has also reached a view that the prison does not constitute a fixed asset in its balance sheet.</p>

  <p>All parties have been applying, in good faith, the relevant guidance.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is aware of the apparent anomaly and has raised the issue with the Financial Reporting Advisory Board, which is now conducting a review.</p>

  <p>In the period until March 2006, Scottish Water will be investing some &#163;1.8 billion towards modernising its infrastructure. About half of this amount will be invested in waste water treatment facilities. Responsibility for ensuring that infrastructure is in place to meet legislative deadlines lies with Scottish Water.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is in regular contact with the UK Government on a wide range of issues, including shipbuilding. However, I understand that the MOD is due to announce its decision on the preferred prime contractor shortly. I understand that, whichever company is successful, a substantial proportion of the work will come to Scotland and to the Clyde in particular.</p>

  <p>The decision on which school a child should attend is a matter for agreement between an education authority and parents. Parents have a right to make a placing request for a school of their choice, and to appeal against the decision should this be refused. The new duty on an education authority to provide education in mainstream schools comes into effect in August 2003. However, children can still be placed in special schools where mainstream education is unable to meet their needs. The Scottish Executive has issued guidance on mainstreaming to education authorities which includes the importance of taking account of parents&#146; views.</p>

  <p>In order to determine the extent of the work required to meet the new standard for lead set in the EC Drinking Water Directive by the target date of December 2003, Scottish Water undertook a survey to determine the extent of the lead problem across Scotland. The results of the lead survey will be used to determine where water treatment measures are required to reduce the tendency for the water to dissolve lead from lead pipes.</p>

  <p>The survey was not designed to ascertain the number of households with lead plumbing but to identify water supply areas within which there was likely to be a significant number of properties with lead plumbing. By December 2003, around 25% of water supplies, covering about 75% of the population, will be treated to minimise the uptake of lead from lead pipes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will be contributing fully to the DEFRA Review of the Control of Trade in Endangered Species (Enforcement) Regulations 1997.
