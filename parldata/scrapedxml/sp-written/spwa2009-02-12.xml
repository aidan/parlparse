  <p>The Scottish Government attaches considerable importance to animal welfare. The passing of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 was a significant step in improving the welfare of animals. The act increased the penalties for animal cruelty, imposed a duty of care on those responsible for animals and allowed animals in danger of suffering to be removed.</p>

  <p>Improving Scotland&rsquo;s health will be the unifying theme of our Games Legacy Plan. We continue to work with a range of key internal and external representatives covering the interests of all sectors &ndash; including health, education and the environment - to ensure we work up a plan that embeds that theme and can deliver a range of benefits. As part of that work we will also make connections with other major events such as the 2011 International Children&rsquo;s Games.</p>

  <p>The Children&rsquo;s Orchard have submitted a proposal for consideration as part of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games legacy programme. This is one of many ideas currently under consideration by the Games Legacy Greener sub-group.</p>

  <p>Health visiting skills, as part of a multi-disciplinary team, are important in the support and care of young children and in achieving the aims of the early years framework. Working with others, NHS Education for Scotland are running a number of education initiatives to ensure that the training and development needs of health visitors and practitioners are met. The recruitment and employment of health visitors is a matter for health boards who will determine their workforce based on the needs and demographics of local populations.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not separately recorded for enhanced disclosures. However, information about the average processing time for a standard or enhanced disclosure issued during each month can be provided. The average turnaround time for standard and enhanced certificates issued in October, November and December 2008 was 14.2 days, 17 days and 18.8 days respectively. Disclosure Scotland has a service level agreement to issue 90% of all applications where no further enquiries are needed within 14 calendar days.</p>

  <p>In October last year, a major IT change to implement a disaster recovery solution was made to the workflow system that supports the work of Disclosure Scotland. The change caused the system performance of the automated work steps to slow down the progress of cases from one step of the process to the next, resulting in bottlenecks and backlogs, and worsening turnaround times.</p>

  <p>We have taken action to address this matter and there has been gradual improvement in turnaround times to the extent that at week ending 8 February 2009 the average turnaround time for standard and enhanced certificates was 18.1 days.</p>

  <p>I was alerted to the emergence of this strain shortly before Health Protection Scotland published their <em>Surveillance of Clostridium difficile Associated Disease in Scotland</em> quarterly report dated 2 July 2008.</p>

  <p>Health Protection Scotland (HPS) are undertaking further studies to better understand the virulence of this strain. Meantime, they have issued revised guidance to laboratories to allow them to build a clearer picture of ribotype distribution and antibiotic resistance in Scotland.</p>

  <p>I have also asked Health Protection Scotland to co-ordinate a study of all Clostridium difficile ribotypes to give us an accurate picture of the epidemiology of Clostridium difficile strains across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Patients in care homes are treated by GPs, just as any other member of the public in the community would be, therefore this information is not held centrally. Given the importance of the care home sector, the HAI Task Force is taking forward a specific action to explore surveillance of healthcare associated infection (HAI) with the Independent Care Home Sector and how it can best be applied. To assist care homes in their understanding of HAI, the Scottish Government&rsquo;s Health Directorates have funded a Nurse Consultant in an HAI post. The post-holder took up post beginning of February.</p>

  <p>Good progress is being made. We offer support to a wide range of organisations, both public and private and at an individual household level to assist with the installation of biomass boilers.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Community and Householder Renewables Initiative has provided 245 grants to householders, totalling over &pound;715,000 and 66 grants to communities, totalling over &pound;2.5 million, to install biomass boilers.</p>

  <p>The &pound;7.5 million Scottish Biomass Support Scheme ran in the financial year 2007-08 and supported 60 projects. Building on that success, the Scottish Government launched the Scottish Biomass Heat Scheme in December 2008. The scheme is Scotland-wide, with funding of &pound;2 million from April 2009 to March 2011.</p>
