  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Electronic Research Pilot database, which works on an individual animal basis, has been built to assess the feasibility and practicality of operating a fully reconciled individual movement database. It is currently operational and open to all sheep and goat keepers in Scotland on a voluntary basis. Further information, including the functionality of this database and government financial assistance for participation can be found at <a href="http://www.scoteid.com" target="_blank">www.scoteid.com</a> . The existing centralised database (SAMU) that is currently in use as required by EU Regulations, operates on a batch basis and has been in place since 2002.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Electronic Research Pilot database is being used by farmers on a voluntary basis. By extending the pilot through 2010-11 with an additional &pound;1 million of Scottish Government funding, this database will be stress tested to identify any issues. Information gathered during the pilot will enable the joint Scottish Government/Industry EID working group to decide whether or not the new database should be rolled out on a compulsory basis or not at a later date.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many of the 1,100 agricultural units in Shetland are eligible for funding of up to &pound;1,000 for purchasing electronic reading equipment for on-farm electronic identification of sheep through the Scotland Rural Development Programme; what information on this scheme has been sent to individual producers, and over what time period the scheme is open.</p>

  <p>Any of these producers may choose to include the purchase of electronic ear tag readers, under the Modernisation through Electronic Data Management for Agriculture option in their Land Managers Options (LMO) application under the Scotland Rural Development Programme. Provided they have land in Scotland and comply with LMO scheme rules they will be eligible for payment of 40% of the actual cost up to a maximum of &pound;1,000, once in any five years.</p>

  <p>Information about LMO and an LMO application form are issued annually with the Single Application Form (SAF), most recently on 15 March 2010, to all SAF applicants. Detailed guidance about LMO is available from the Scottish Government Website at <a href="http://www.scotland.gov.uk/srdp" target="_blank">www.scotland.gov.uk/srdp</a>.</p>

  <p>The LMO scheme opened for applications in 2008 and is due to run until 2013. LMO applications can be made annually in May for the scheme year 15 May to 14 May the following year.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how it encourages local authorities to work together to develop cost-effective waste management facilities.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-03-29.S3W-32605.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80340" speakername="Richard Lochhead" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0329.htm#2">

  <p>It is the responsibility of each local authority to develop and deliver waste management facilities and services that meet local needs and circumstances. If local authorities wish to work in partnership to deliver waste infrastructure or services then the Scottish Government would encourage and support such an approach where this represents best practice and delivers value for money.</p>

  <p>Scottish Futures Trust has identified waste as one of its key priorities and works with local authorities across Scotland to help ensure that best value is achieved. Currently, Scottish Futures Trust is supporting a number of joint authority projects and authorities moving forward on an individual basis.</p>
