This will provide us with a sound basis for developing an action plan of short-, medium- and long-term goals to take forward common interests for adults with a sensory impairment in respect of community care services.

  <p>On the establishment of Careers Scotland, the Executive made available to Scottish Enterprise (SEn) and Highlands and Islands Enterprise funding it had previously directed at a range of conjoining agencies. In the SEn area, this amounted to a total of some &#163;30 million. The proportion of that total devoted to the Renfrewshire Council area and the manner in which it has been deployed are operational matters for Scottish Enterprise. That said, Careers Scotland&#146;s delivery is shaped by the targets the Executive has set. These address our economic development, social inclusion and education priorities and cover:</p>

  <p>increasing the number of disadvantaged young people continuing in post-compulsory education or training;</p>

  <p>increasing the proportion of school-leavers will a positive approach to the world of work;</p>

  <p>increasing the number of disengaged adults actively engaged in learning and training, and</p>

  <p>In July 2001, &#163;24 million additional resources for child care were allocated through the child poverty package over 2001-04. The money was allocated as follows:</p>

  <p>&#163;8.5 million was made available for child care grants for lone parents in full-time higher education to pay for child care. This grant is administered through the Students Awards Agency for Scotland. The Scottish Executive does not hold information on awards made by local area under this grant scheme.</p>

  <p>&#163;7.5 million was made available to further education colleges throughout Scotland to widen child care provision, based on locally identified needs. Responsibility for administering this money lies with the Scottish Further Education Funding Council. Information on awards made by this body is not held centrally by the Executive.</p>

  <p>&#163;8 million was made available to local authorities to help stabilise and sustain out-of-school care projects, especially in disadvantaged areas. The money was allocated over a three-year period as &#163;2 million in 2001-02, &#163;3 million in 2002-03 and &#163;3 million in 2003-04. Of this, Renfrewshire Council was allocated &#163;48,600 in 2001-2 and &#163;72,800 in 2002-03 and 2003-04. Allocation of this money within the Renfrewshire Council area is a matter for Renfrewshire Council as they have responsibility for the allocation of funds at a local level. The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>Individual children&#146;s hearings can review social work recommendations as part of their decision-making process. Once the children&#146;s hearing determines the child&#146;s needs and makes a decision, it is the duty of the local authorities to give effect to the decision.

  <p>It is not possible to provide meaningful figures for all sheriff court districts. Figures throughout the year will vary according to the volume of business and the complexity of cases. The availability of part-time sheriffs is also a factor in securing writing days for permanent sheriffs to complete written judgements. Sheriffs Principal monitor avizandum lists and they take such action as they can to secure completion of written work within reasonable time.</p>

  <p>The Executive supports the continuation of milk quotas which is the main element of the EU support regime providing market stability. We will continue to fight for the interests of Scottish dairy producers in the current discussions under the Mid-Term Review of the Common Agricultural Policy, which is considering alternative future arrangements for quotas and dairy policy more generally.</p>

  <p>The Executive has funded, at a cost of &#163;50,000, a strategy document titled <i>Pooling Resources &#150; A Strategy for the Scottish Dairy Industry (2001-2006)</i>, and will shortly be discussing its implementation with the Scottish Milk Forum. Research results due out early next year will also highlight the reasons why milk prices in the UK, including in Scotland, are consistently lower than the EU average.</p>

  <p>The most recent scientific advice given to the UK Health Departments by the Committee of Toxicity of Chemicals in Foods, Consumer Products and the Environment, is that use of dental amalgam fillings is free from risk of systemic toxicity and that only a few cases of hypersensitivity have occurred. While there is no scientific evidence that the use of dental amalgam is related to adverse effects on pre- and post-natal health or fertility, the Executive recommends that amalgam should not be used in the dental treatment of pregnant women.</p>

  <p>The most effective reduction in the use of dental amalgam fillings would be through a reduction in the current levels of dental decay experienced by the Scottish population. The Executive is currently seeking views on preventative measures aimed at reducing the high incidence of oral disease amongst Scotland's children, through its consultation document, <i>Towards Better Oral Health in Children</i>.</p>

  <p>Employment policy is reserved to the UK Government which takes the lead on funding and delivery of the New Deal. In Scotland it does this in partnership with the Scottish Executive and contributing Scottish organisations.</p>

  <p>The whole range of New Deal programmes are available to all unemployed working age people in the Renfrewshire Council area who meet the qualification criteria.

  <p>The following table compares Average Residence Based Claimant Count Unemployment Rates for Scotland and the worst 10% of wards in Renfrewshire (detailed above). It can be seen that overall the percentage point gap between the annual average residence-based claimant count rates for Scotland and the worst 10% of wards in Renfrewshire has been reduced from 10.7 in 1996 to 6.5 in 2001.</p>

  <p>Quotas are allocated to UK Fish Producer Organisations and uptake of these quotas by these organisations is monitored centrally. It is the responsibility of the Producer Organisations to allocate quota to individual vessels within their membership. Consequently, fisheries departments do not hold records of the quota allocated to individual vessels.</p>

  <p>There are seven Fish Producer Organisations that are administered in Scotland. For the calendar year 2001 their share of the EC White Fish quota by species was as follows:</p>

  <p>No. The farm-scale evaluations offer an opportunity to collect valuable ecological information that will better inform future decision taking. The expert advice is clear that these evaluations can be conducted without threatening human health or the environment. As such, the Executive's support for the evaluation programme is seen as a sensible and precautionary approach to this issue.</p>

  <p>The precautionary principle is applied where a scientific assessment has identified the possibility of harmful effects from a particular action or where there is ambiguity.</p>

  <p>The GM crops that have been released in field trials in Scotland have been subjected to a thorough scientific risk assessment prior to their release. There is no ambiguity in the scientific advice to ministers that these crops do not pose a threat to either human health or the environment. If any such evidence was to emerge, we would have no hesitation in withdrawing consent for the release and halting the field trials.</p>

  <p>There are no scientific grounds to suggest that the GM crops grown in farm trials in Scotland pose a different health risk to local populations than that posed by conventional crops. However, we maintain a watching brief in this area and, should emerging scientific evidence support a change in this position, we will reconsider the need to implement an appropriate, effective and evidence-based health surveillance programme.</p>

  <p>In recognition of the importance of community participation in the Clyde Waterfront regeneration proposals, the Clyde Waterfront Working Group has established a Community Regeneration Sub-Group. This sub-group will look specifically at the impact of on-going regeneration activity on the Clyde Waterfront communities (covering housing, labour access, skills development and community engagement), and collate information on good practice in linking developments to job opportunities.</p>

  <p>Through Glasgow City Council, the Glasgow Harbour development has applied for over &#163;10 million in European Regional Development Funding. An offer of grant, if made, is likely to contain a condition that a local labour market plan is developed. The council is working towards a strategic approach to maximising the training and job opportunities for local residents of social inclusion partnership areas.</p>

  <p>One of the key themes of Clydebank Re-Built Ltd (the company formed from the Clydebank Taskforce to transform Clydebank) is an Inclusive Clydebank to improve the experience of the people who live, work, learn and invest in Clydebank. Clydebank Re-Built Ltd will use the Place Check Approach to ensure appropriate community participation and have applied for Urban II funding to cover the costs. Urban II is a European programme directed at areas of particular disadvantage specifically targeting social inclusion and ensuring community participation in local projects.</p>

  <p>There has been a wide range of measures introduced by the Executive since 1997 to increase the proportion of students in higher education (HE) from under-represented, disadvantaged groups and areas. These include:</p>

  <p>Funding an additional 2,800 full-time equivalent places in higher education institutions</p>

  <p>Waiving fees for all eligible full-time Scottish students at Scottish institutions</p>

  <p>Providing bursaries of up to &#163;2,000 p.a. for young full-time students from low income families</p>

  <p>A Wider Access Bursary Fund for mature full-time students</p>

  <p>Fee waiver for unemployed or low income student on part-time courses</p>

  <p>Access to loans for part-time students</p>

  <p>Child care support</p>

  <p>Piloting of Education Maintenance Allowances designed to encourage more young people from low income households to remain in full-time education which are now being rolled out across Scotland</p>

  <p>Introduction of a widening access premium for institutions to help support students from non-traditional backgrounds</p>

  <p>Introduction of a disability premium for institutions to help support students with disabilities</p>

  <p>Introduction of New Access Partnerships to encourage institutions to develop innovative partnerships with the private sector to widen participation</p>

  <p>Support for developments to provide higher education in rural communities such as the designation of UHI Millennium Institute and the collaboration at Crichton Campus.</p>

  <p>In addition to these measures, young people in the Renfrewshire Council area, along with other schools in the West of Scotland, also benefit from the Greater Opportunities of Access and Learning with Schools (GOALS)<strong> </strong>project which provides a spectrum of opportunity for school pupils, aged 10 to 18, to learn about and become familiar with higher education. Targeted at schools with low rates of progression to HE and involving all the higher education institutions in the West of Scotland, the project aims to stimulate pupils towards achievement at school and ultimately, to progress to higher education and a rewarding career.</p>

  <p>As my statement to Parliament on 7 November made clear, the final definition of the standard and the setting of a target date for meeting it will require full and careful consultation with local authorities, Registered Social Landlords and others. That process will begin shortly.</p>

  <p>The Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill currently progressing through the Parliament provides for the establishment of a new public body, the Risk Management Authority (RMA). The authority will be a centre of expertise in the fields of risk assessment and risk minimisation. One of the RMA&#146;s key functions will be to provide the framework for the multi-agency assessment and management of the risk posed to the public by sexual and violent offenders.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive on what assumptions and calculations the estimate of an extra &#163;200 million investment for council housing was based, as referred to in the ministerial statement on housing by the Minister for Social Justice on 7 November 2002, including (a) the extra investment that will be raised for each year from 2004 to 2006 and (b) the local authorities assumed to be eligible for the prudential borrowing regime.</p>

  <p>The figure of &#163;200 million is our broad estimate of the additional borrowing that the Prudential Regime might permit in Scotland as whole. It is based on the assumption that 20-25% of the rental income currently used for capital investment purposes could instead be used to support additional borrowing. However, as I made clear in my statement it is up to individual local authorities to decide for themselves what, if any, additional borrowing the Prudential Regime might allow. For that reason, I am unable to answer parts (a) or (b).</p>

  <p>The third party development arrangement is considered to be neither a private finance initiative nor a public private partnership. It is an additional reimbursement route available to General Practitioners (GPs) which was introduced to encourage private developers to build health care premises in areas that traditionally have not been attractive to such developers. Premises developed in such areas are then leased to GPs at or below a prescribed rent based on the approved development cost.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>However, 19 projects providing modern, fit-for-purpose accommodation for GP practices are understood to have been completed under the third-party development arrangement. Detailed information can be obtained from individual trusts on those health premises funded using the third-party development arrangement and the capital and revenue consequences.</p>

  <p>Increasingly GPs are located in property from which other health care or social care is being provided. Dependent on local circumstances a head lease can be taken by any of the occupants although Primary Care Trusts are not encouraged by the department to assume the role of head lessee.</p>

  <p>People of working age in Renfrewshire Council area will continue to benefit from recent changes in tax and benefits. The UK Government is helping to make work pay through tax credits and the National Minimum Wage.</p>

  <p>Working in partnership, the UK Government and the Scottish Executive offer a range of welfare to work initiatives to help people of working age. Across Scotland, the New Deals are helping more unemployed people on benefits to find work. As set out in <i>Smart, Successful, Scotland </i>the Scottish Executive&#146;s enterprise strategy places an emphasis on improving learning and skills which will help improve the earning potential of working age people on low income. Local projects such as the community-based partnership Buddies for Learning Project, which provides literacy and numeracy support to adults in the social inclusion partnership areas in Renfrewshire, are helping local people to remove the barriers to employment.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Budget for 2003-06 as announced by the Executive will further help working people on low incomes through funding increases in areas such as skills and learning and entrepreneurship.</p>

  <p>Not only will this new funding assist councils in meeting their obligations but it will also contribute to a higher quality of life for local communities by reducing the potential for discarded fridges to be abandoned illegally.</p>

  <p>The specific grant resources this year will be distributed using the existing GAE distribution formula for waste disposal. From next year, support for local authority expenditure on the disposal of fridges will be included within the general local government settlement, using the same distribution formula.</p>
