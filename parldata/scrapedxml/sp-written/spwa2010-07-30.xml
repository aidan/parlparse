  <p>Applications were approved on a first come, first served basis until the initial allocation of vouchers was equal to the budget allocated. The system did not record unsuccessful applications. A total of 4,602 vouchers were allocated during the initial allocation. Following subsequent appeals by individuals and the clarification of these and existing cases the number of current applications is 4,645, 20 of these are duplicates.</p>

  <p>The reason for refusal of applications, broken down by postcode, is tabled below.</p>

  <p>There are a very wide range of actions being undertaken by the Scottish Government and partners to reduce child poverty. Our broad approach is set out in the three inter-linked policy frameworks <em>Achieving Our Potential</em> , <em>Early Years Framework</em> , and <em>Equally Well</em> . These link with other relevant policy frameworks, such as the national approach to supporting and working with children and young people, to ensure all receive the help they need, when they need it. They also link to policies promoting the employability, education and life chances of both adults and young people (such as Workforce Plus, More Choices More Chances, and Curriculum for Excellence). We are working across Government and with partners in CPPs, third sector and wider society, to implement these frameworks in a cohesive way.</p>

  <p>Scottish Government has also ensured that Scotland is covered by the Child Poverty Act, and is developing a Child Poverty Strategy in line with this. The strategy will set out the measures that we propose to take to contribute to the UK-wide target to eradicate child poverty by 2020, and to ensure as far as possible that children in Scotland do not experience socio-economic disadvantage. This strategy will be published in spring 2011.</p>

  <p>Please refer to the information note on implementation of the Early Years Framework, which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 51402).</p>

  <p>Our social marketing campaign which supports parenting skills was launched in September 2009. The PlayTalkRead campaign aims to support, empower and enable parents to improve life chances for their children. Evaluation has shown 90% awareness of the campaign but a continuing need to promote the importance of positive interaction between parents and their children aged 0 to three, whilst focusing our efforts on targeting parents in the most deprived areas across Scotland. We are considering the next phase of the campaign in the light of the evaluation.</p>

  <p>Please refer to the information note on implementation of the Early Years Framework, which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 51402)</p>

  <p>Effective local implementation of the Early Years Framework is the key to achieving the changes we want to see. Single Outcome Agreements are the mechanism in the relationship between national and local partners through which shared priorities are progressed. Each Community Planning Partnership (CPP) is expected to reflect high level, strategic progress on the Early Years Framework within their SOA.</p>

  <p>Most local areas have developed formal parenting strategies, which will have been informed by the Early Years Framework. These include the use of evidence based parenting programmes and approaches to ensure they have a competent and capable workforce to identify and address need as early as possible.</p>

  <p>It is for local partners in CPPs to develop models tailored to meet local needs and the Scottish Government is not enforcing local action. We are however providing support to the national third sector parenting organisations and others to develop parenting capacity through well trained, multi-disciplinary/multi-agency staff in quality, evidence based parenting programmes/approaches.</p>

  <p>We are also supporting specific initiatives including the Family Nurse Partnership and the Barnardo&rsquo;s You First programme.</p>

  <p>Please refer to the information note on implementation of the Early Years Framework, which has been placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (Bib. number 51402)</p>

  <p>The focus of the Early Years Framework is supported by the joint COSLA and Scottish Government Statement on Community Learning and Development (CLD) which highlights the need to build the capacity of individuals, families and communities to secure the best outcomes for themselves. The Scottish Government, working with key partners such as Learning and Teaching Scotland supports the leading role of local authorities in facilitating partnership and in developing programmes which cover the three national priorities for CLD of: achievement through learning for adults, achievement through learning for young people and achievement through building community capacity.</p>

  <p>In addition, information on the importance of family and community learning in improving outcomes for children has been disseminated through a range of seminars and conferences which have been held by Scottish Government, HMIE and Learning Teaching Scotland with ministerial input and key note speakers from high level roles in the field.</p>

  <p><em>Curriculum for excellence through outdoor learning</em> provides guidance to schools and centres on progressive outdoor learning experiences from ages three to 18. The guidance emphasises that all staff at every level of involvement with the education of children and young people have a responsibility to make the most of the outdoor environment to support the delivery of the experiences and outcomes within Curriculum for Excellence. The new guidance is supported by a Learning and Teaching Scotland online resource which is designed to support schools in making learning in the outdoor environment a reality for all children and young people.</p>

  <p>We are in the process of establishing an implementation group to provide strategic direction on the delivery of <em>curriculum for excellence through outdoor learning. </em>This group will lead and direct the formation of a national network for outdoor learning which will help to build capacity in schools and local authorities.</p>

HMIE are committed to evaluating the learning experiences of children and young people across a broad curriculum in line with the curriculum design principles of Curriculum for Excellence. Part of this is an expectation that schools should take advantage of the opportunities for outdoor learning that exist within and across the curriculum, and which are reflected in some of the experiences and outcomes of Curriculum for Excellence. In addition, HMIE will continue to identify and share good practice in outdoor learning through its reports, Journey to Excellence and other activities.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government fully recognises local authorities&rsquo; role in local economic development and is committed to ensuring they have the opportunity to contribute to growing local business success. It supports local authorities in this work through a range of measures. For example, local delivery of the Business Gateway was transferred, along with funding, to local authorities as part of the reform of the Enterprise Networks. This helped to ensure better integration of these services with other local authority services.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government continues to work closely with COSLA and the Scottish Local Authorities Economic Development Group (SLAED). For example, it has recently agreed a framework to offer local authorities clear guidance on business support activities that are likely to be supported through the European Regional Development Fund. This will ensure local authorities can develop suitable and consistent proposals to address the needs of small and medium-sized enterprises across Lowland and Upland Scotland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also supporting local authorities through various business rate relief schemes. These schemes will reduce taxation for Scottish businesses by an estimated &pound;2.4 billion over the next five years. Money which would otherwise be paid as tax, can now be reinvested in those businesses. Measures also include proposals for a business rates incentivisation scheme to encourage authorities to grow their tax base.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also recently signed a funding agreement with the European Investment Bank (EIB) to establish a &pound;50 million JESSICA Holding Fund in Scotland &ndash; a new, flexible source of investment capital for revenue generating regeneration projects. The Holding Fund, which has been jointly financed by the Scottish Government and European Commission, will invest in Urban Development Funds, who will provide loans and other forms of repayable investment to projects. Schemes in 13 local authority areas will be eligible for investment.</p>

  <p>Scottish Enterprise and HighIands and Islands Enterprise continue to work collaboratively with local authorities and Community Planning Partnerships providing expertise, advice and mentoring to support economic development at a local level.</p>

  <p>Article 13 of Council Regulation (EU) No 1342/2008 (the Cod Recovery Plan) provides for allocation of additional fishing effort for cod avoidance measures. The Scottish Government has implemented Article 13 through the conservation credits scheme (CCS), which allows for real-time closures (RTCs) to buy back additional fishing effort for Scotland&rsquo;s fishing fleet.</p>

  <p>Marine Scotland Science submitted an analysis of these measures for consideration by the Commission&rsquo;s Scientific Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) at its plenary meeting in mid-July. The recently published STECF assessment of that analysis acknowledged the progress made by Scotland in improving the situation for North Sea cod through the CCS.</p>

  <p>STECF also noted that the most recent stock assessment results indicated that the 25% reduction in North Sea cod mortality in 2009, required by all member states under the Cod Recovery Plan, had not been realized. STECF suggested that measures under Article 13 of the Cod Recovery Plan should be expanded to include increasing the size of RTCs and increasing the uptake of cod-selective gears that reduce the level of discards. The Scottish Government had already taken action on both fronts in early July, both by extending the scope of RTCs and by making available buy-backs for the use of further selective fishing gears in the CCS.</p>

  <p>Training for new entrants into commercial fishing is delivered through a network of industry-led group training associations (GTAs) covering the whole of mainland Scotland and the Highlands and Islands. The GTAs are registered with the Sea Fish Industry Authority (Seafish) as their approved training providers for the statutory safety training courses undertaken by all fishermen going to sea.</p>

  <p>The GTA network provision is supplemented by a number of colleges of further education specialising in training for fishing industry, i.e. Banff and Buchan College, North Atlantic Fisheries College, Orkney College and Lews Castle College. These colleges deliver SVQs and certificates of competency for deck and engineer officers. There are currently four learning providers supported by Skills Development Scotland for delivery of the Fishing Deckhand SVQ Level 2 through the Skillseekers national training programme.</p>

  <p>Grant aid for capital investment in the fisheries sector is available under the European Fisheries Fund (EFF) programme for 2007-13. EFF provides for capital grants to assist across a range of measures including assistance to young fishers (up to 40 years of age) to purchase their first full, or part, ownership of an active fishing vessel (subject to eligibility criteria).</p>

  <p>Under the 2001 decommissioning scheme, the fixed quota allocation (FQA) units associated with the licences of decommissioned vessels could be transferred to other over 10 metre licences, licence entitlements or to fish producer organisation &quot;dummy&quot; licences. The deadline for such transfers was 31 December 2004.</p>

  <p>By far the majority transferred FQA units to fish producer organisation (PO) &quot;dummy&quot; licences. The conditions under which such transfers took place were commercial matters solely between the vessel owner and PO.</p>

  <p>More than five years have passed since the above deadline. It is not possible, therefore, to say now how many vessel owners still enjoy quota allocations deriving from the licences of their decommissioned vessels.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will consider helping any local authority wishing to establish town and city-wide wi-fi networks by facilitating discussions with relevant organisations and the telecoms industry. At a community level, as announced by the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment on 1 July 2010, rural communities are now able to bid for a share of a &euro;1 million fund to bring enhanced broadband to their areas. The new investment is being delivered by the LEADER scheme which supports small-scale, community driven projects in rural areas and is aimed at improving coverage and bringing faster broadband rural communities. These projects could include the establishment of small wi-fi networks.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive how many train drivers have been breathalysed and, of those, how many were found to be over the legal drink-drive limit in each year since 1997, also expressed as a proportion of total tests undertaken.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-07-30.S3W-35203.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0730.htm#9">

  <p>Data on the number of train drivers who have been breathalysed, and the number of those who were found to be over the legal drink-drive limit is not available centrally.</p>

  <p>The information provided by the police refers to the number of cases recorded where an individual endangers rail passengers. This offence includes, but is not restricted to, driving a train while unfit through drink or drugs. Because there are several different preliminary tests (preliminary breath test, preliminary impairment test, and preliminary drug test), and the police officer involved may administer any one or more of these, the number of such incidents does not relate directly to the number of times that a breathalyser test has been carried out. Furthermore, the data is collected at an aggregate level, so details of individual crimes, such as the occupation of the individual, are not available.</p>

  <p>Section 27 of the Transport and Works Act 1992 makes it an offence to drive (or guard or signal) a train, tram or other guided vehicle either when unfit through drink or drugs or when the quantity of drink or drugs exceeds the prescribed limit. Section 38 sets out the prescribed limit which is the same as the one for road vehicle drivers.</p>

  <p>The tables below show the number of offences of endangering rail passengers recorded by the police by local authority since 1997-98.</p>

  <p>Community Benefit clauses are one of a range of social clauses that can be included in contracts. In February 2008 the Scottish Government published a detailed report on Community Benefit clauses with practical information on how and when to use the clauses and since then we have been involved in encouraging their use across the wider public sector. They should be considered on a contract by contract basis.</p>

  <p>Use of Community Benefit clauses has been considered for a number of Scottish Government contracts and the clauses have been included in contracts for the Scottish Government Energy Assistance Programme and in contracts relating to the Scottish Crime Campus.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government Ready for Business Programme and the Scottish Sustainable Procurement Action and Delivery Plans will continue to promote Community Benefit and other social clauses within the core Scottish Government and across the wider public sector.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what it anticipates the total cost of the Borders railway project will be and how much it plans to contribute to the scheme in each year between now and the estimated date of completion</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2010-07-30.S3W-34984.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80393" speakername="Stewart Stevenson" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-10/wa0730.htm#12">

  <p>As I stated to the Parliament on 5 March 2008, the Borders Railway is expected to cost between &pound;235 million and &pound;295 million (at 2012 prices).</p>

  <p>The Borders Railway will be designed, built, financed and maintained by a newly created, Transport Scotland-backed single purpose vehicle (SPV), using a design, build, finance and maintenance contract. The SPV will enter into a contract with Transport Scotland for the delivery and maintenance of the Borders Railway over a 30 year period. Repayments will be made throughout the 30 year duration by the Scottish Government via a not for profit distributing procurement model via an annual unitary charge.</p>

  <p>Transport Scotland provides the initial capital required to purchase the land and undertake required early activities. The Transport Scotland budget for these activities, broken down on a year by year basis up to the date of construction completion in 2014, is shown in the table below:</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has held no such discussions regarding wind farm applications under Section 36 of the Electricity Act (1989). However, where applications are to be determined by Scottish ministers there are robust and transparent planning procedures in place to ensure that all landscape, environment and visual impact issues relating to any development are taken fully into account.</p>

  <p>In addition, Scottish Planning Policy (SPP), which sets out the Scottish Government&rsquo;s planning policies on the siting of wind farms, indicates that planning authorities should consider the likely impacts of wind farm developments on tourism and recreation interests.</p>

  <p>Responsibility for the development and reinforcement of grid infrastructure to accommodate new generating capacity is a matter for the relevant electricity Distribution Network Operator (DNO); in this case Scottish Power Networks. It is for individual developers to engage with the DNO on grid connections and any necessary associated infrastructure development. The Scottish Government encourages individual developers and DNOs to engage proactively on grid connection and to deliver electricity transmission network enhancements and improvements that meet Scotland&rsquo;s existing energy needs and help deliver our considerable energy potential.</p>
