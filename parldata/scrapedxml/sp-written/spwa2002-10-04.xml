  <p>Priorities identified included improvements in diagnosis, joint working, training and research. Many of these priorities are for health and social work service providers to deliver at local level.

  <p>We have today published the Executive&#146;s 3rd <i>Electronic Service Delivery Progress Report</i> . Over all 69% of services provided by the Executive, its agencies and non-departmental public bodies are now available online to some degree.

  <p>No representative of the Scottish Executive is expected to attend the eSkills Summit. The summit is primarily intended to address issues about the development of high-level, technical Information and Communication Technology skills within Europe. There are no specific Scottish characteristics to these skills. Scottish interests in developing these skills are being addressed through eskills UK, the aspirant Sector Skills Council. There are good links between the Scottish Executive and eskills UK. UK involvement in the preparatory work for the summit, led by officials in the DTI, has sought to ensure that the work of eskills UK is given due weight in the summit.</p>

  <p>I attended the first of the newly merged Agriculture and Fisheries Councils with Margaret Becket, Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and Elliot Morley, Parliamentary Under-Secretary of the same department on behalf of the UK in Brussels on 23 to 24 September 2002. The following matters were discussed:</p>

  <p><strong>Agriculture</strong></p>

  <p>Transport of Live Animals</p>

  <p>The council held a public debate on the transport of live animals with the UK recommending better monitoring of animal welfare in transit and supporting the case for reducing maximum journey times to eight hours. The UK noted, however, the need for practical rules which provided, for example, for limited derogations to deal with the difficulties of transport within the remoter regions of member states and mentioned in particular the Highlands and Islands of Scotland. These matters will be further considered as negotiations proceed.</p>

  <p>Review of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)</p>

  <p>The council also began its detailed consideration of the mid-term review of the CAP published in July with a discussion of the proposals for the arable sector. This was a preliminary discussion in which the UK stressed the importance of securing further reform of the CAP and recalled the importance that developing countries attached to improved trading conditions for agriculture as they had emphasised at the recent World Summit on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.</p>

  <p>BSE and Scrapie</p>

  <p>The Commission reported the latest information on BSE and scrapie in the EU, noting that there had been no significant development since its last report to the council.</p>

  <p>Genetically modified food</p>

  <p>The Presidency reported the state of progress on the proposal for rules governing genetically modified food and feed and signalled its intention to seek political agreement on a compromise at the October Council. It also reported progress in the drawing up of an action plan for organic food and farming.</p>

  <p><strong>Fisheries</strong></p>

  <p>Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy</p>

  <p>This was the first Council debate on the reform of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). The discussion took the form of a low-key table round based upon a questionnaire produced by the Presidency and focussed around three key areas: conservation and sustainability of fish stocks; fleet policy, and control and enforcement. The Commission advocated the introduction of multi-annual management plans for fish stocks, associated effort controls, a continuing ceiling on the capacity of member states&#146; fleets, additional incentives for voluntary decommissioning schemes, and an end to grant-aid for fleet modernisation and vessel construction. It confirmed that there were no plans to end aid for safety improvements, but that there would be no increase in the Community contribution for aid for decommissioning. On enforcement the Commission advocated better co-operation among member states and between the Commission and member states. The UK supported multi-annual management involving clear biological targets for all stocks and a range of management measures capable of being applied flexibly to individual stocks according to their circumstances. The UK also stressed that inaction was not an option and indicated willingness to explore all available options whether these involved capacity or effort reduction or both. It emphasised that construction and modernisation grants should cease, and indicated support for better enforcement provided that enhanced arrangements at Community level could be made compatible with the Treaty and national competence for criminal law and procedure.</p>

  <p>The Presidency indicated that it aims to conclude the reform package in November and that a further debate on CFP reform will take place at the October Council.</p>

  <p>Strategy for Sustainable Aquaculture</p>

  <p>The Commission presented its strategy for sustainable aquaculture, which will now be examined by a Council Working Group with a view to discussion at a future Council.</p>

  <p>Deep Water Species</p>

  <p>Deep-water species was not on the agenda for this Council.</p>

  <p>The Executive is committed to improving the access to, and quality of, health information for patients and is investing &#163;3 million over the next three years to deliver this as part of the <i>Patient Focus and Public Involvement</i> programme of work. A number of initiatives are in place to support this commitment; NHS 24 and a comprehensive patient information package to replace the Patient&#146;s Charter will be central to this.</p>

  <p>In addition, a &quot;Patient Information Initiative&quot; will be developed which will:</p>

  <p>assure the quality of patient information, based on a range of evidence;</p>

  <p>involve and engage with other sources of expertise such as expert patients;</p>

  <p>make information accessible and available in a variety of formats, and</p>

  <p>link to future developments (e.g. NHS 24 online).</p>

  <p>Citizens Advice Scotland has already established a number of local advice centres in primary health care settings in Scotland. Following a meeting with their Chief Executive in May, Citizens Advice Scotland have been invited to submit a proposal to the Scottish Executive Health Department for developing an initiative along the lines of &quot;Good Advice: Good Health&quot;.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Crime reduced from murder to culpable homicide or a re-trial was authorised.</p>

  <p>2. Effective start date or punishment part.</p>

  <p>There have been no sentences imposed in the High Court that have been reduced as a result of the provisions contained in the Convention Rights (Compliance) (Scotland) Act 2001 under which the High Court is required to specify the punishment part of a life sentence. The punishment part is such part of a life sentence as the court considers appropriate to satisfy the requirements of retribution and deterrence (ignoring the period, if any, which may be necessary for the protection of the public). The sentence of life imprisonment is unaffected by the fixing of the punishment part. It is only once the punishment part has expired that the prisoner has the right to require the Scottish ministers to refer his or her case to the Parole Board for the board to decide whether the prisoner requires to continue to be confined for the protection of the public.</p>

  <p>Under the transitional provisions contained in the Schedule to the 2001 act, the Scottish ministers are under a duty, subject to certain exceptions detailed in the Schedule, to refer to the High Court the cases of life prisoners who were sentenced prior to 8 October 2001, the date on which the relevant provisions came into force, for a punishment part to be fixed. As regards those prisoners who were the subject of minimum recommendations made by the sentencing court under the former statutory provisions, as the Appeal Court noted in its opinion in the case of <i>William Stewart </i>v<i> Her Majesty&#146;s Advocate,</i> issued on 6 September 2002 (Appeal No. C228/02): &quot;it does not follow that periods which have been recommended in the past provide a general yardstick by reference to which the length of a punishment part should be determined.&quot; The full Opinion is available on the Scottish Court Service website (www.scotcourts.gov.uk).</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-28834 by Mrs Elish Angiolini on 13 September 2002, whether prosecuting authorities have attended bail hearings for people (a) charged with and (b) convicted of (i) serious assault, (ii) rape, (iii) culpable homicide and (iv) murder, and what percentage of the total number in each category they have attended in each of the last three years; if these figures are not available, what its best estimate is of the percentage of attendance by prosecutors at bail hearings for people after conviction (1) for murder and rape or (2) in the most serious High Court cases, including murder and rape, in each of the last three years.</p>

  <p>Prosecutors are present in court at all applications for bail that follow immediately upon conviction. Prosecutors are also present in court in relation to all bail applications heard in the High Court, because these applications are dealt with each day in the Bail Court and other cases in that court require prosecutorial input. Prosecutors will not necessarily be present in the sheriff court when sheriffs are considering applications for interim liberation. Prosecutors are therefore present at all post conviction bail hearings of murder, rape and culpable homicide.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989 requires amendment and what interim measures it is taking following the earlier suspension of the powers to impose additional days added or loss of remission, in the light of the judgement of the European Court of Human Rights on 15 July 2002 in the case of Okechukwiw Ezeh.</p>

  <p>On 11 June 2001, Scottish ministers decided to suspend the use of additional days and loss of remission in Scottish prisons. The European Court held on 15 July 2002 in the case of <i>Ezeh &amp; Connors</i> v <i>United Kingdom</i> that there were Article 6 difficulties with the procedure for awarding Additional Days Added (ADAs).</p>

  <p>The decision to suspend the use of ADAs on 11 June 2001 didn&#146;t lead to disciplinary problems. It was therefore decided that the time was right to complete the abolition of ADAs. On 16 August 2002, ministers remitted all ADAs which prisoners in Scotland were serving or were still liable to serve, provided these days had been awarded to a person sentenced by a Scottish court.</p>

  <p>No decision has yet been taken as to whether the Prisons (Scotland) Act 1989 and other legislation will be amended to remove references to additional days. The Ezeh &amp; Connors judgement does not require the legislation to be amended.</p>

  <p>Only the courts and the Lord Advocate have the direct power to reduce the number of accused held on remand, by means of the grant of bail to individual accused.</p>

  <p>The Executive has, however, provided funding and guidance to all local authorities to allow bail information and supervision schemes to be provided to courts within their areas.</p>

  <p>Bail information schemes are intended to assist procurators fiscal and courts through verification of information in respect of cases where bail might otherwise have been opposed or refused. Bail supervision is intended to increase the confidence of courts of successful completion of bail periods through the availability of supervised bail with the intention of reducing the number of accused remanded to custody.</p>

  <p>Partnerships UK have been working on the Argyll and Bute Project for over a year. This role is entirely consistent with its constitution and remit. Partnerships UK (PUK) is a research and developer, not an operator or a major funding body. It works with the Scottish Executive in the development of Public Private Partnership (PPP) policy and it has a specific remit to develop new models and applications for PPP's. Its financial targets are set to fulfil its public sector mission while permitting a fair return on capital. All directors are required to declare any interests in any matter coming before the board. In addition PUK operates an internal code of conduct which deals with a number of issues including conflict of interest. That code states that it will publish the other interests of its Directors and that, in the event that PUK is supporting the public sector on a project and is aware that one of its shareholders is involved in any part of the bidding process, it will formally notify relevant public sector clients as soon as it becomes aware of the involvement and agree a procedure with them for dealing with any potential or perceived conflicts.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1O-5476 by Mr Andy Kerr on 5 September 2002, whether it will allow all local authorities to establish not-for-profit trusts once the variant model developed by Argyll and Bute Council and Partnerships UK has been approved.</p>

  <p>The Non Profit Distributing Organisation model currently being developed with Argyll and Bute Council&#146;s schools public private partnership project will take over a year to reach the stage where we can properly assess whether this variant model has been successful as a new delivery vehicle. That timing will not be suitable for most local authorities that were awarded funding in the 25 June 2002 announcement. However, dependant on the progress and outcome of the NPDO model, local authorities in the second tranche of Outline Business Cases may be able to be considered.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will inquire into the appointment by the Scottish Arts Council of John McTernan as a consultant; whether a public tendering process was used for this post and, if so, what process was involved and, if not, what the reasons are for its position on this matter.</p>

  <p>This is a matter for the Scottish Arts Council. Recruitment practice is a matter for public bodies themselves although they are required to comply with employment legislation and the framework of guidance that is made available to them.</p>

  <p>In this case, Mr McTernan has been appointed in line with Scottish Arts Council&#146;s established practice for appointing on a temporary basis to fill short-term skills gaps. Scottish Arts Council policy is that posts for periods of six months or less are not tendered for or advertised because it could be several months before anyone was available to take up the post.</p>

  <p>None.</p>

  <p>In my reply dated 27 June to your letter of 4 June specifically about the Seafield Waste Water Treatment Plant, I explained that the monitoring of aqueous effluent from waste water treatment plants is the responsibility of the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. That letter also explained that the local authority concerned has legal powers relating to monitoring.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water arrange regular community liaison meetings during periods when its operations may impact on the community or when particular communities experience an on-going inconvenience or disruption as a result of the activities of Scottish Water or their contractors. An example is the Seafield Waste Water Treatment Works (WWTW) Community Liaison Group that meets bi-monthly to address local concerns regarding odour.</p>

  <p>Community Liaison groups have also been established for Shieldhall, Daldowie and Dalmuir WWTW (Glasgow) and another is about to be set up for Ardoch WWTW (Dumbarton). Liaison groups include local community councillors, politicians, business representatives and affected residents.</p>

  <p>Scottish Water is also invited to attend regular public meetings organised by the Water Industry Commissioner for Scotland. These meetings address both water and waste water issues.</p>

  <p>The Drinking Water Quality Regulator monitors compliance with the drinking water quality standards set out in The Water Supply (Water Quality) (Scotland) Regulations 1990. The regulator has considerable enforcement powers and if appropriate will require Scottish Water to carry out any remedial measures necessary to protect public health. Scottish Water has also given Scottish ministers undertakings to upgrade water treatment facilities across Scotland to specified timescales.</p>

  <p>The Executive will carefully consider the forthcoming reports into issues arising from the recent water supply incidents in Glasgow and Edinburgh. If any legislative response is required, we will act accordingly.</p>
