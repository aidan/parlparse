  <p>Research into waste recycling is one of a number of topics funded by the Scottish Executive&#8217;s environment research programme. This programme has an annual budget of some &pound;400,000 and is used to inform and develop policy on environmental issues. Recycling and waste research projects which have been supported in recent years include the composting of green waste; waste reduction, re-use and recycling in the Scottish Islands; and an assessment of priority materials to be addressed in the recycled market development programme (REMADE). The Scottish Executive will also contribute &pound;50,000 each year for three years beginning in 1999-2000 to the REMADE project to develop potential markets for recycled materials. Future research will support the development and implementation of Scotland&#8217;s National Waste Strategy. Information on the general public&#8217;s use of recycling facilities is also being collected by the Scottish Household Survey, a major new continuous survey, commissioned by the Scottish Executive to provide information on a range of policy topics.</p>

  <p>Several other sources of funds are also available for waste recycling research. These include the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, Scotland and Northern Ireland Forum for Environmental Research and the landfill tax credit scheme.</p>

  <p>Yes. Scottish Healthcare Supplies, the Division of the Common Services Agency responsible for arranging central contracts for the NHS in Scotland, closely monitors developments in this rapidly advancing area. This ensures that the range of hearing aids available is comparable in both quality and modernity to those supplied by the private sector. Decisions on which hearing aid best meets the clinical needs of a patient is however a matter for the clinician in charge of their care.</p>

  <p>This is an operational matter for Virgin Trains and Railtrack. I understand that Virgin Trains, however, has made a formal request to Railtrack to accommodate a service from Lockerbie that would arrive in Edinburgh before 09:30.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body operates under the statutory authority of the Scotland Act 1998. Under section 21 of the Act it provides the Parliament, or ensures that the Parliament is provided, with the property, staff and services required for the Parliament&#8217;s purposes. It is in reliance on that statutory authority that the SPCB has agreed to meet an MSP&#8217;s legal expenses in connection with a court case brought against that Member but which raises important issues of principle concerning the Parliament&#8217;s main purposes, and the powers of the courts to intervene in them. The judgement itself addressed these wider issues. <br /></p>
