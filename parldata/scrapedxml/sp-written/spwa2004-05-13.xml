  <p>Implementation of the Data Protection Act 1998 is the responsibility of each individual NHSScotland organisation. All staff, students, volunteers, and contractors must endeavour to meet the standards outlined in the <em>NHSScotland Code of Practice on Protecting Patient Confidentiality</em> , which can be found at www.show.scot.nhs.uk/confidentiality, as well as their terms of employment or other engagement agreements.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive seeks to help NHSScotland bodies discharge their responsibilities under the act in a consistent manner through the Code of Practice and by supporting the work of the Data Protection and Caldicott Guardian Forums.</p>

  <p>Where volunteers have access to patient identifiable information to perform agreed activities, a written agreement should be put in place between the hospital and the voluntary body and volunteers should be asked to sign an appropriate "confidentiality statement".</p>

  <p>Visits by lay members of a church to patients in hospital should require no special arrangements if the patient is known to them and is willing to receive the visit. If the visit by a lay member is as part of the hospital&#8217;s spiritual care services then any information provided to lay members about the patient should be provided in accordance with the code of practice on protecting patient confidentiality, and with the patient&#8217;s informed consent.</p>

  <p>All publicly-funded secondary schools in Scotland are approved by the Scottish Qualifications Authority to offer national qualifications courses in modern studies. However, some schools can decide not to offer the subject at any or all of the available levels. There is no school statutory national curriculum in Scotland. It is therefore a matter for local authorities and schools themselves to decide upon the course options they provide.</p>

  <p>The enforcement of gas safety regulations is a matter for the Health and Safety Executive. Its guidance on the relevant regulations explains that landlords have a duty to make sure that gas appliances, fittings and flues used by tenants are safe, and to ensure that an annual safety check is carried, out normally by a CORGI-registered installer. There are penalties for non-compliance.</p>

  <p>The Department for Work and Pensions, which is the department with responsibility for housing benefit, advise that eligibility for housing benefit is based on a tenant&#8217;s liability for rent and their means and not adherence to gas regulations, and that there are no plans to change this position.</p>

  <p>The table presents estimates of the numbers of a) men and b) women with gross income falling in the various income bands, for each of the years 1996-97 to 2001-02. The estimates are derived from the Family Resources Survey&#8217;s (FRS) Individual Incomes Analysis. Due to the small sample size of the FRS in Scotland, the higher income bands have been grouped together; the sample sizes are too small to give reliable estimates for the separate groups (vii) and (viii) for men and (vi)-(ix) for women.</p>

  <p>The income is gross income and includes all elements of income that are accrued to the individual in their own right. This includes income from earnings, self-employment, occupational pensions, investments, social security benefits, and, in 2001-02, tax credits. Elements of income that are generally accrued by a household rather than an individual are excluded, e.g. housing benefit and council tax benefit, and income from letting/sub-letting.</p>

  <p>For the purposes of the table, individuals&#8217; incomes in each year have not been up-rated for inflation, but represent their actual incomes during the year of the survey.</p>

  <p>Specific grants ensure that local authorities spend a set amount of their total funding on essential functions, such as civil protection. A percentage of certain GAEs (Grant Aided Expenditure) are ring-fenced and make up part of the total specific grants. In consultation with COSLA, additional funds have been made available for the Gaelic and National Priorities Action Fund GAEs, along with an increase in police GAE, which has had a knock-on effect on the total of specific grants.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive welcomes the Sustainable Development Commission's report as a contribution to the debate on sustainable development. The report looks mainly at the activity of the UK Government and at progress against its indicators, but includes brief mention of the devolved administrations.</p>

  <p>In particular we welcome the commission's recognition of the "serious attempts" by the Executive to put sustainable development at the centre of policy making; of the Executive's commitment to sustainable development and environmental justice and of the mechanisms we have put in place to deliver on these. That commitment is evident in the Partnership Agreement.</p>

  <p>We recognise that more needs to be done, by the Executive and others. That is why over the coming year we will be working with the UK Government and the other devolved administrations to develop a new UK Sustainable Development Strategy. We will be working together to determine how we can best achieve our common sustainable development objectives. We shall work closely with stakeholders in Scotland to develop the best approach - developing a UK-wide approach where appropriate but retaining a distinctive Scottish approach where it is beneficial to do so. Our consultation, <em>Taking it On: developing UK sustainable development strategy together</em> was launched on 21 April. The Sustainable Development Commission&#8217;s report was prepared as a contribution to the strategy review process, and the most appropriate response to it is the development of the new strategy itself.</p>

  <p>The new Strategy will include sustainable development indicators. Again, we will look to achieve common UK-wide indicators where sensible but supplement them with Scottish indicators where they are a better measure of our intentions.</p>

  <p>This will build the comprehensive sustainable development strategy for Scotland that the Commission seeks, and we look for their involvement and support in doing so.</p>
