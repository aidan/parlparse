  <p>Since 2007, the Scottish Government has been working on a number of ways to tackle poor oral health in children. We have launched a number of successful government funded projects across Scotland. One such project is the Childsmile Schools Programme, a school based dental preventative service. This Childsmile programme provides a twice-yearly fluoride varnish application as a preventive treatment for children in P1 and P2. 20% of schools in an NHS board area are included in the programme. Schools are ranked by the proportions of children in P1 and P2 in each school residing in the most deprived local SIMD (Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation) quintile.</p>

  <p>In the period from 31 March 2007 to 31 March 2010 the number of dentists working in NHS general dental services has increased from 2,474 to 2,847.</p>

  <p>Access to NHS general dental services in Scotland has increased, and 85% of general dental practices are regarded as &quot;NHS committed&quot;.</p>

  <p>The substantial increase in the number of dentists working in NHS general dental services in Scotland has been achieved by the significant steps taken by the Scottish Government to address dental service recruitment and retention problems since 2007.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has:</p>

  <p>Invested &pound;368.2 million in 2009-10 in NHS general dental services in Scotland;</p>

  <p>Provided funding of &pound;82 million, over two years, for the Primary and Community Care Premises Modernisation programme. The top priority for this funding is the development of new dental centres for general dental practitioners working in the NHS;</p>

  <p>Delivered on a manifesto commitment to re-introduce the school based dental service, through the &quot;Childsmile&quot; programme currently being rolled out across Scotland; and</p>

  <p>Delivered on a commitment to establish a third dental school in Scotland when the Aberdeen Dental School opened in October 2008.</p>

  <p>The dental bursary (introduced in 2006) continues to be available to students studying in the three dental schools in Scotland. Students can apply for a bursary of &pound;4,000 per year on condition that they undertake to work in NHS dentistry in Scotland for up to five years following qualification. Approximately 580 students are currently in receipt of the bursary.</p>

  <p>Financial assistance is also available through the revised Scottish Dental Access Initiative (SDAI) scheme to help dentists to establish or expand practices.</p>

  <p>Significant financial incentives aimed at encouraging dentists to join NHS boards&rsquo; dental lists continue to be available. These include:</p>

  <p>Remote Areas Allowance;</p>

  <p>Vocational trainees payments;</p>

  <p>Payments to dentists joining NHS board dental lists;</p>

  <p>Commitment payments;</p>

  <p>Grants to establish new or improve existing vocational training practices;</p>

  <p>Reimbursement of either full or partial practice rental costs; and</p>

  <p>Deprived areas enhancements.</p>

  <p>2009-10 is the first year in which data has been submitted based on the date the incident was recorded. Prior to this, data was returned based on the number of incidents which occurred during that time period. Historical data was revised during publication of 2009-10 data to ensure reporting on a consistent basis.

  <p>All NHS boards in Scotland provide a child health programme. The universal programme for child health screening and surveillance is set out in <em>Health for all Children 4: Guidance on Implementation in Scotland</em> . This details the health checks that should be undertaken on entry to primary school, in Primary 7 and in secondary school. Children and young people with identified health needs will have a series of reviews throughout school.</p>

  <p>Guidance on the Administration of Medicines in Schools was published in 2001 and states that an individual health care plan should be drawn up for every child or young person with health care needs to identify the level and type of support that will be needed at school, including information about response to emergency situations.</p>

  <p>The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 (as amended) places duties on education authorities to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs and duties on appropriate agencies, including NHS boards, to help an education authority in the exercise of its functions under it.</p>

  <p>Education authorities, NHS boards and other appropriate agencies should work together to ensure the effective co-ordination and implementation of support to address a child&rsquo;s or young person&rsquo;s needs. In line with <em>Getting it right for every child</em>, where more than one agency or service is involved, the child or young person should have one integrated plan in place, which may be made up of different elements, such as the educational or health plans required by the individual.</p>

  <p>We do not collate information centrally on how many pupils receive individual health plans.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage&rsquo;s (SNH) procedure for &quot;taking account of the wider public interest&quot; (TAWPI) is an integral part of the consideration for all planning cases where SNH is considering an objection, including wind farm proposals. TAWPI applies to all cases where the consideration of &quot;national interest&quot; indicates that SNH should object, including those cases affecting National Scenic Areas (NSAs) and Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). The only exceptions are where a proposal would have a significant effect on the integrity of a Natura site or a proposal could have an effect on the favourable conservation status of a European Protected Species. The TAWPI process does not inform the advice SNH offers, only whether SNH decides to object.</p>

  <p>Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) is not required to consult with other parties when conducting a &quot;taking into account wider public interests&quot; (TAWPI) assessment. However, the organisation may do so if there is a need to clarify information. The assessment is an internal process which allows SNH to check that any natural heritage impacts are not outweighed by any social, economic or wider environmental benefits of a development proposal. As such, it is for SNH to decide whether engagement with an applicant and other relevant interests would be necessary to help in undertaking an assessment.</p>

  <p>None of the &quot;taking into account wider public interests&quot; (TAWPI) assessments undertaken to date by Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) has led the organisation to remove an objection. The TAWPI assessment does not alter SNH&rsquo;s advice; it determines whether or not SNH should object to a development proposal. SNH&rsquo;s advice on the natural heritage impacts, such as the detailed landscape and visual impacts of a proposal will not be affected by the TAWPI assessment.</p>

  <p>Despite huge cuts being inflicted on Scotland by the Westminster government, the Scottish Government has decided to retain the funding level for equality projects at &pound;20.3 million for 2011-12. This demonstrates the continuing commitment of the Scottish Government to the promotion of equality and to tackling issues of discrimination. All organisations currently funded through Race, Religion and Refugee Integration funding, including those delivering work to tackle sectarianism, were issued with funding application packs on 25 January 2011 for the 2011-12 financial year. We are committed to working constructively with organisations to tackle the scourge of sectarianism.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it has taken since 2007 to support (a) measures to improve access to independent sexual health information and advice services in rural and urban areas and (b) the role of secondary school nurses in delivering a sexual health strategy and what the outcomes have been.</p>

  <p>In line with our manifesto commitment, the Scottish Government has increased access to sexual health information and advice services across Scotland. Additional funding of &pound;1 million over the years 2008-09 to 2009-10 was provided to help achieve this. As agreed with stakeholders, half of the additional funding for 2008-09 was allocated to NHS boards to assist them to increase access to accurate sexual health information, particularly in rural areas. This funding has been used to create or update local websites and service information, improve public access to sexual health websites and support the provision of information by voluntary organisations.</p>

  <p>In 2009 the Scottish Government launched the Sexual Health Scotland website, which provides information, help and advice. This can be accessed at:</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.sexualhealthscotland.co.uk" target="_blank">http://www.sexualhealthscotland.co.uk</a>.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also provides funding to a number of voluntary organisations throughout Scotland which provide independent sexual health and advice services.</p>

  <p>In addition, the availability of local drop-in services for young people, offering general health advice, chlamydia testing, pregnancy testing and condoms has increased in line with our National Outcomes 2008-11. The majority of areas are working towards an integrated approach to providing accessible sexual health services for young people, either within school by the school nursing staff, or outwith school, with an emphasis on targeting vulnerable groups of young people. Most nurses working in schools deliver health education programmes on puberty followed by age appropriate information on positive sexual health, including contraception and STIs within secondary schools. Where chlamydia testing or pregnancy testing is included within the health service, the process of setting up clinics has been done in full consultation with teachers, parents, young people and the local authority.</p>

  <p>With regard to improved health outcomes, it is too early to measure. However, research suggests that young people require access to information and advice in order for them to take responsible decisions on sexual health and relationships.</p>

  <p>In the three years from 2008-09, Scottish Rugby was awarded &pound;1.415 million direct from the Scottish Government to deliver a wide range of rugby opportunities as part of the government&rsquo;s Cashback for Communities programme.</p>

  <p>Scottish Rugby has received significant funding from sportscotland in each of the last ten years to support the implementation of the sport&rsquo;s development plan. The level of investment is an operational matter and I have asked the Chief Executive of sportscotland, Stewart Harris, to provide the detailed information requested.</p>

  <p>I refer the member to the answer to questions S3W-14128 and S3W-14129 on 23 June 2008. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at:</p>

  <p><a href="../../../Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/Apps2/Business/PQA/Default.aspx</a>.</p>

  <p>The information regarding how much each authority spent in each year is not held centrally. Under the single outcome agreement it is a matter for each local authority to decide spend on the basis of local circumstances and local need, within the context of the wide range of local authority services each provide.</p>
