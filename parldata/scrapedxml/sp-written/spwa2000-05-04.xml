  <p>No. Section 68 of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 1976 makes it an offence to sell alcoholic liquor to persons under the age of 18 years. Any public order implications can also be handled under existing Scots law. The Scottish Advisory Committee on Alcohol Misuse (SACAM) is already developing a national strategy to address all aspects of alcohol misuse in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Cancer services are one of the three top clinical priorities for the NHS in Scotland. The Scottish Executive is committed to reducing the incidence of all forms of cancer, including breast cancer, and we have set a challenging target of reducing the incidence of cancer by 20% over the next 10 years.</p>

  <p>In order to meet those targets we have in place a number of different policies aimed at improvements in the treatment and care of people with cancer. These include:</p>

  <p>supporting the breast cancer screening programme with funds of over &pound;5 million per year;</p>

  <p>establishing one stop clinics for investigation and diagnosis of breast lumps, to reduce the anxiety of waiting for results;</p>

  <p>setting a national maximum waiting time for cancer treatment, to be delivered by March 2001;</p>

  <p>encouraging the use of the Scottish Intercollegiate Guideline Network (SIGN) guidelines on Breast Cancer in Women which was published in 1998;</p>

  <p>renewing and updating the guidelines on the Referral of Women with Breast Problems and issuing them to all GPs in Scotland, including new evidence and guidance on determining the urgency of individual cases;</p>

  <p>setting up three multi-disciplinary managed clinical networks on breast cancer across Scotland, allowing for the sharing and dissemination of good practice;</p>

  <p>encouraging referral of patients to specialist breast surgeons;</p>

  <p>undertaking prospective audits of breast cancer, among others, nationwide using the relevant SIGN guidelines;</p>

  <p>having the Scottish Cancer Group work with the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland on ways of improving quality of cancer care generally and on developing standards for assessment and accreditation of cancer services;</p>

  <p>supporting six research projects on or related to breast cancer through funding of &pound;754,000;</p>

  <p>funding the Cancer Therapy Network to encourage the entry of as many patients as possible to clinical trials at a cost of &pound;1 million.</p>

  <p>As cancer is an overall clinical priority for the NHS in Scotland and is tackled through many different routes, we do not require health boards and NHS Trusts to identify separately how much of their expenditure they devote to providing cancer services, but we expect them to give the treatment and care of all forms of cancer due priority in allocating their resources.</p>

  <p>Disposal of clinical waste generated by the NHS in Scotland is the responsibility of NHS Trusts and island health boards.</p>

  <p>The majority of Trusts in Scotland, along with the island health boards, have clinical waste disposal contracts in place with private sector companies. Two companies are involved, namely Eurocare Ltd and Dundee Energy Recycling Ltd. These companies were awarded their contracts following national tendering exercises. Exceptions are Borders&#8217; Trusts and Orkney Health Board who have their own incinerator for clinical waste.</p>

  <p>The treatment processes involved are disinfection, using a hot oil auger system, and incineration. All processes are regulated by SEPA.</p>

  <p>Guidance on clinical waste management was issued by the NHS in Scotland Property and Environment Forum in Scottish Health Technical Memorandum No.3 <i>Management and Disposal of Clinical Waste</i> (April 1998).</p>

  <p>Current guidance on the disposal of clinical waste from patients with suspected or actual variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease (vCJD) is detailed in the 1998 report from the Advisory Committee on Dangerous Pathogens and the Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (ACDP/SEAC), <i>Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents: Safe Working and the Prevention of Infection. </i> The report was circulated to health boards and NHS Trusts in Scotland. This guidance is reiterated in a Scottish Executive Health Department Management Executive Letter (1999)65: <i>Variant Creutzfeldt Jakob Disease (vCJD): Minimising the Risk of Transmission</i> which was issued on 31 August 1999.</p>

  <p>All agents of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are categorised under the EC Classification of Biological Agents as belonging to Hazard Group 3. This means that they are considered to present significant risk to human health because of their severity of infection.</p>

  <p>Because of this all clinical waste from patients diagnosed, or suspected of, having vCJD or other TSEs should be disposed of by incineration at an authorised incineration site. For the safe handling of clinical waste, secure leak-proof containers are used which, where appropriate, should be double-bagged. External contamination of the container should be avoided.</p>

  <p>The directly attributable expenditure by the Scottish Executive on tackling drug misuse in 1999-2000 is estimated at &pound;58.1 million, and generic spend at &pound;85.4 million, resulting in a total of &pound;143.5 million. The breakdown is estimated as 46% enforcement, 39% on treatment and rehabilitation and 15% on prevention/education.</p>

  <p>The findings of the current review of expenditure on drug misuse across the Executive will be published in due course. This is likely to identify further significant spend more widely attributable to action on combating drug misuse.</p>

  <p>A very precise definition of a computer would quickly be overtaken by developments in technology, and would risk limiting the flexibility of schools to select the devices most appropriate for particular purposes within the school. A more general definition would serve no useful purpose.</p>

  <p>It is for local authorities to determine the most effective way of providing technical support for ICT in their schools. This is being done in a variety of ways, not all of which will involve the permanent presence of technical staff in any individual school.</p>

  <p>In order to minimise the burden of data collection on schools and local authorities, the Scottish Executive tracks the progress of the National Grid for Learning by collecting information about a small number of key indicators, closely related to published targets, through the School Census and the Annual Survey of ICT.</p>

  <p>The important work of measuring the effectiveness of the National Grid for Learning is carried on through a range of research projects and HMI tasks. A baseline report on teachers ICT skills and knowledge needs was published in 1998, and one on pupils is in preparation. It is planned that both pieces of research will be repeated towards the end of the current programme. Other research under way includes an investigation of the different models of ICT support emerging across Scotland.</p>

  <p>Strategic environmental assessment will be a valuable tool in the delivery of our Programme for Government commitment to delivery of sustainable development. The Ministerial Group on Sustainable Scotland has already taken significant steps to ensure that sustainable development is embedded in Government and these will take effect over coming months. The EC Directive is now expected to be adopted by the end of the year. The clarity and uniformity which the EC Directive offers will be of considerable assistance in enabling organisations to make decisions about programmes for themselves. We believe it important to implement the Directive as it finally emerges rather than to act prematurely on an interim text.</p>

  <p>The rise in Scottish manufacturing exports clearly demonstrates the ability and commitment of companies in Scotland to perform successfully in the world marketplace. In particular the 6.6% growth in real terms last year was achieved during particularly difficult global trading conditions. This increase was primarily driven by continued growth in the electronics industry, which is Scotland&#8217;s largest export sector, and the chemicals sector. Exporters have also benefited from the Export Development Strategy for Scotland which provides a focused framework for the support provided by Scottish Trade International and the network of Local Export Partnerships.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive recognises the concerns about the misuse of fireworks. However, the UK Government undertook a comprehensive review of the controls on fireworks in 1996 which led to the Fireworks (Safety) Regulations 1997, introducing controls on the supply of certain fireworks and raising the age at which persons can be sold fireworks from 16 to 18 years of age. These controls, together with targeted safety campaigns, played a significant part in reducing firework injuries and incidents of misuse during the 1997 and 1998 firework seasons.</p>

  <p>GPs do not receive item of service payments to provide the main target group with diphtheria, polio and tetanus vaccine. They receive target payments if they immunise at least 70% of children aged five and under on their medical list, and a higher target payment if they achieve 90%. An item of service fee is paid for vaccinations outwith the target group. Target payments are paid to encourage GPs to immunise in order to achieve herd immunity.</p>

  <p>The provision of influenza vaccination has been regarded as a matter of good clinical practice in the management of patients who may be at risk of developing complications from influenza. GPs have available advice from the Chief Medical Officer and the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation on &quot;at risk&quot; groups.</p>

  <p>No. The Scottish Executive&#8217;s main priority has always been to ensure the protection of the environment and human health. The farm scale trials are the latest in a comprehensive series of rigorous tests designed to ensure that the crops concerned are safe to human and animal health, and to the environment. There are currently no provisions in Scots or UK law covering liability for damage caused specifically by genetically modified organisms. However, under the terms of the Environmental Protection Act 1990, there are powers to prosecute where conditions attached to a deliberate release consent are breached.</p>

  <p>The wider issue of environmental liability is being considered at present by the European Commission, which has prepared a White Paper for consultation. Her Majesty&#8217;s Government will represent the UK in all international and European Union negotiations. The lead UK Department on international environmental matters is the Department of the Environment Transport and the Regions (DETR). In line with normal practice, the Scottish Executive will be consulted on the development of a UK negotiating position.</p>

  <p>I have been advised by Ayrshire and Arran Health Board that Seafield Hospital, Ayr, ceased to be operational as a hospital in 1991 but was used as the Health Board Headquarters until December 1996. An offer of purchase was approved by the health board in September 1998. Missives are expected to be completed in the current financial year, once planning permission has been given and a surface drainage problem has been resolved. It will be up to the purchaser to decide how the site will be developed. Property expenses, including security costs, between December 1996 and 31 March 2000 have totalled &pound;346,000.</p>

  <p>The land reform policy development process has been highly consultative, and our proposals have benefited as a result.</p>

  <p>The Partnership Government embraced recommendations by the Land Reform Policy Group. These were informed by very extensive consultation. The Executive&#8217;s Land Reform White Paper of last July was distributed widely: 14,800 copies were issued, including copies to those who had commented previously, and 13 local seminars were held. Meetings with relevant representative bodies and individuals have also helped to inform our proposals. In early summer we plan to consult on our draft Land Reform Bill.</p>

  <p>The timetable for concluding modernisation of the NHS pay system has yet to be agreed and will form part of planned discussions between the Scottish Executive, NHS in Scotland management and representatives of healthcare trades unions and professional bodies.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive and the Scottish Council for Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education recently carried out an annual review of the Specialist Registrar (SpR) establishment. The review determines the numbers of higher specialist training numbers available for each specialty, which in turn determines the number of doctors who will be qualified to fill consultant vacancies in the future.</p>

  <p>It has been agreed that the number of SpRs in both medical and clinical oncology will be increased. Medical oncology will benefit from an increase of five posts from 12 to 17 and clinical oncology will rise by an additional seven posts, from 16 to 23.</p>

  <p>Work is being undertaken, commissioned by the Scottish Cancer Group and funded by the Health Department&#8217;s Clinical Resource and Audit Group, to model future trends in cancer incidence taking into account available evidence relating to new developments/interventions and emerging technological advances in managing cancer. The results of this work &#8211; which is expected later this year &#8211; will be valuable in informing future services and workforce planning for the various clinical specialties involved in the treatment and care of people with cancer.</p>

  <p>Eating a healthy and balanced diet is an important factor in the prevention of malnutrition.

  <p>The Scottish Ministers will be able to issue directions and guidance to the Strategic Rail Authority for the franchise providing passenger rail services which begin and end in Scotland. They will reflect strategic priorities for the provision of passenger rail services throughout Scotland and build upon the good working relations that already exist between the Strategic Rail Authority, Train Operating Companies and Railtrack. It would then be for the Train Operating Company, in conjunction with Railtrack, to ensure the availability of the necessary infrastructure and rolling stock to meet the terms of the franchise.</p>

  <p>The Larkhall to Milngavie rail route project is the responsibility of the Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority as the public passenger transport body for the area. Scottish Executive officials have met SPTE officials on a number of occasions, most recently in March to discuss the authority&#8217;s reappraisal of the investment case for the project and related issues. Before a decision can be taken about the eligibility of the project for level playing field support under the PPP arrangements, the Executive needs to receive the Full Business Case from the authority.

  <p>It is important that the NHS provides an appropriate response to those presenting as victims of abuse, including rape. Sympathetic, non-judgmental clinical investigation and treatment is essential. The NHS in Scotland has, in recent years, put in place processes to improve its response to victims of rape and other types of abuse. Recent developments in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Lanarkshire, for example, indicate the emphasis which the Scottish Executive expects to be put on aspects such as appropriate training of staff, close co-operation with voluntary organisations involved with victims of abuse, developing appropriate protocols in Accident and Emergency settings, and having proper frameworks for monitoring and evaluating the services provided to rape and other victims of abuse.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive will continue to promote this kind of approach throughout the NHS in Scotland.</p>

  <p>Statistics relating to mobile phone related road accidents are not available.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive review of research about the safety of hands-free and hand-held mobile phones was carried out by the Transport Research Laboratory and the results published in 1997. The review found that there was no unequivocal evidence of a causal link between mobile phones and accidents, but that the various studies highlighted a distraction to varying degrees by both hand-held and hands-free mobile phones, which in the more complex cases might carry safety risks. For this reason the Highway Code recommends that drivers should never use a telephone whilst driving and the UK Government will continue to promote this message through publicity campaigns.</p>

  <p>In its initial search for a location for the Scottish University for Industry, the Scottish Executive&#8217;s Land and Property Division undertook a trawl of public sector space available right across Scotland. Initial consideration was also given to a number of other locations suggested by various organisations and individuals. Further consideration was then given to what location would best meet the business and operational needs of the Scottish UfI. Both the Scottish UfI Advisory Group and the Scottish UfI Ltd felt that a central Glasgow location would best meet these needs. A short list of seven sites within Glasgow was produced.</p>

  <p>On the basis of business criteria set out by the company and endorsed by the Scottish UfI Advisory Group, the Europa Building, Argyle Street, Glasgow, emerged as the most favourable site.</p>

  <p>The Partnership Agreement, <i>Partnership for Scotland</i> , is a policy agreement between the Executive parties. The <i>Programme for Government</i> , published last September, turned that policy agreement into a programme of work for the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The Executive is working to implement all of the commitments listed in <i>Programme for</i> <i>Government</i> are implemented. As we approach the first anniversary of the Partnership Agreement, I am pleased to say that 34 of the 37 commitments due to be in place by May 2000 have been delivered in full, with a further two delivered in part.</p>

  <p>We are abolishing feudal tenure. We have reformed the laws on the welfare and finances of adults with incapacity, Tuition fees for higher education have gone, and our schools and hospitals have record investment.</p>

  <p>We have much progress to celebrate one year on.</p>

  <p>The task of implementing an electronic records management system for the Holyrood building is the final stage of a records management project which addresses systems for the Mound and Holyrood.</p>

  <p>The aim is to install an electronic records management system, not simply to minimise storage space in the new Parliament building, but also to ensure that the Parliament is in the forefront of best practice for electronic records management. As part of its research on best practice, the project team has already visited a number of public sector sites, and consulted with the National Archives of Scotland and the Public Record Office.</p>

  <p>Only one logo design has been commissioned for the Scottish Parliament. Redpath were commissioned to propose design ideas to accompany their existing text-based corporate identity, one of which was based upon the winning entry in the students competition held last year. One of the designs proposed by Redpath was developed for full design and production as the logo. The design costs are commercial-in-confidence, but the overall project costs, which cover several aspects including copyright, design, and trademark application, are around &pound;20,000. <br /></p>
