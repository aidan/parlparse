  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what representations it has made to either Her Majesty's Government or directly to the European Parliament regarding the consultation on the proposal contained within European Parliament Document No. 10317/99 <i>Initiative of the Republic of Austria</i> with a view to adopting a Council Directive to combat child pornography on the Internet and any implications this proposal may have for the Scottish legal and criminal justice system.</p>

  <p>Relations with the European Union and control of the Internet are reserved matters. The Scottish Executive made no specific representations on this initiative but welcomes it. Scots law already addresses child pornography, whether or not on the Internet, and I am not aware of any immediate implications for the Scottish legal and criminal justice system. We will continue to do whatever is necessary to combat child pornography, including national and international co-operation.</p>

  <p>I would hope that local authorities would show the same commitment to tourism as has the Scottish Executive. However, funding decisions are for authorities themselves.

  <p>I do not propose to publish either the cleaning specification, toilet cleaning schedules nor monitoring reports for PHQ as this information is readily available within the Facilities Management Office, Room 1.20, PHQ. Anyone wishing to peruse the information should contact the Helpdesk (Ext. 85100) and suitable arrangements will be put in place. <br /></p>
