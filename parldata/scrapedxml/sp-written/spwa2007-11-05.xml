  <p>The Scottish Primary Care Research Network (SPCRN) encourages GPs to be involved in cancer prevention and research. This is funded by the Chief Scientist Office (at a cost of &pound;207,122 in 2007-08) and centrally managed by the Scottish School of Primary Care (SSPC). The SSPC is funded by the Scottish Government Health Directorates (at a cost of &pound;275,000 in 2007-08). It is currently appointing senior academics to run programmes of research which include a collaborative programme of primary care cancer research for Scotland, one element of which will be prevention and screening.</p>

  <p>The SPCRN has links with other primary care research networks in the UK and other countries. It builds on previous work of the local research networks and the Scottish Practices and Professionals Interested in Research (SPPIRe) based at the Scottish School of Primary Care. SPPIRe database has been well used in the past by researchers all over the UK and beyond.</p>

  <p>The SPCRN works with disease specific networks, including cancer, and is open to all researchers and primary care professionals, assisting in research studies that are relevant to primary care. Members contact details are held in a data base of research interested professionals who are invited to participate in research studies in the future, if appropriate. SPCRN offers practical support by carrying out activities such as suitable patient identification, mailing of invitations to patients, etc, thus minimising the use of practice staff time and disruption to the practice.</p>

  <p>There has been a significant programme of investment in cancer care in Scotland. The Scottish Cancer Strategy, <em>Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change, </em> which is currently being updated, is a wide ranging plan to help control the burden of cancer in Scotland. It has delivered more than 300 additional doctors, nurses and other health professionals and significant improvements in radiotherapy and other equipment and related services across all NHS boards.</p>

  <p>There is also an encouraging decline in mortality rates in the under 75s and we are on target to reduce death rates from cancer in this age group by 20% by 2010. Latest figures show an 18.1% reduction since 1995.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government also invests in many research trials that will ultimately improve care and outcomes for cancer patients. The Chief Scientist Office is currently funding one research project on lung cancer at a cost of &pound;203,495 and one project on pancreatic cancer at a cost of &pound;156,241.</p>

  <p>A national managed clinical network (MCN) for pancreatic and hepatobiliary cancer was established in 2005 to address a lack of uniformity in outcomes of surgery and subsequent clinical management of these cancers. The aim of the network is to optimise care and outcomes through the standard setting and audit processes that are core functions of MCNs. Optimising care will have a limited benefit in terms of life expectancy but should have a material benefit on the quality of life and death of most diagnosed patients. Substantial progress has already been made on the establishment of an appropriate set of standards. A similar MCN is in place for lung cancer.</p>

  <p>Equity of access to and funding of services for individuals with cancer is primarily the responsibility of NHS boards to plan, in the light of the needs of their resident population, from the unified budgets which are made available to them from the Scottish Executive.</p>

  <p>The remit of the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) is to provide advice to NHS boards and their area drug and therapeutics committees (ADTCs) across Scotland about the status of all newly licensed medicines, all new formulations of existing medicines and any major new indications for established products (licensed from January 2002). The SMC process seeks to secure the availability of drugs and treatments in the NHS on an equitable basis through rigorous, scientific consideration of the evidence presented.</p>

This section provides for a defence in certain circumstances to a charge of assault in cases involving the physical punishment of children.

  <p>Section 51 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2003 sets the limits on physical punishment clearly and for the benefit of children. It is illegal to punish children by:</p>

  <p><blockquote>

<p>Giving blows to the head</p>
<p>Using implements, such as canes or belts.</p>
</blockquote></p>

  <p>In addition, if a court were looking into whether the physical punishment which a child had received constituted a justifiable assault, it would consider:</p>

  <p><blockquote>
<p>The child&rsquo;s age</p>
<p>What was done to the child, for what reason and what the circumstances were</p>
<p>The duration of the punishment and the frequency</p>

  <p>The most recent evidence, from the 2003 Scottish Health Survey, indicates that amongst adult males (aged 16+ years) the relationship between obesity and deprivation is not clear. Results indicate that a higher proportion of males living in the most deprived fifth of areas are obese compared to those living in the least deprived areas: 25.6% compared to 20.4%. However, there is not a clear linear relationship between obesity and deprivation across the intermediate deprivation groups.</p>

  <p>Amongst adult females (aged 16+ years) there is a clear linear pattern of increasing obesity with increasing deprivation, ranging from 20.7% obese in the least deprived fifth of areas to 31.8% obese in the most deprived areas.</p>

  <p>The evidence available suggests that there is no simple relationship between childhood obesity and deprivation.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government funds specific elements of the costs involved with local government elections (such as the national publicity campaign and in 2007 the additional costs associated with e-counting).

  <p>I have asked Dr. Paul Stollard, Chief Executive of the Scottish Building Standards Agency (SBSA), to answer. His response is as follows:</p>

  <p>No. The panel was appointed by Scottish ministers to produce an independent report on a Low Carbon Buildings Standards Strategy for Scotland. The panel met in September 2007. The report is likely to set out a number of workstreams on a wide range of energy efficiency and performance measures specific to buildings, including the use of low carbon equipment.

  <p>It is not known what percentage of total firearms offences are committed with legally or illegally held firearms. This is because, although the firearm certificate status of the accused is collected as part of the statistical return, in a large proportion of cases the perpetrator or weapons alleged to have been used in the commission of a crime are not identified by the police. In a number of cases the firearm itself is not actually seen but identified based on the type of damage caused. Furthermore, it should be noted that a large proportion of offences are committed using air weapons, which can be legally held without a licence.</p>

  <p>The firearm certificate status of the accused in firearms offences are shown in the following table:</p>

  <p>The five wheelchair centres in Scotland have a responsibility to assess service users&rsquo; eligibility for a powered wheelchair, on an individual basis. This is based on clinical assessment and national eligibility criteria and takes into account the type and extent of the patient&rsquo;s disability, whether the patient can operate a powered chair independently and safety issues.</p>

  <p>Following the independent review of NHS wheelchair and seating services in Scotland, I have established a project board and have appointed a project manager to carry out an in-depth analysis of the 40 recommendations flowing from the review, including those recommendations that relate to national eligibility criteria.</p>

  <p>By December 2008, the project team will produce a costed action plan on the delivery of the recommendations identified, including evidence-based outcomes and timescales, for my approval. They will then implement those needs-based recommendations that are achievable, measurable and deliver the greatest benefits for the majority of service users.</p>

  <p>Participation in public local inquiries by interested bodies or groups is encouraged by Scottish ministers and there is no obligation for parties to be represented professionally. Where the inquiry concerns an appeal the community generally appears in support of a refusal of planning permission by the planning authority and can reasonably look to them to take the lead in assessing relevant planning considerations. Reporters from the Directorate for Planning and Environmental Appeals (DPEA) will take into consideration the level of experience of parties and will ensure that they understand the proceedings, together with their rights and the obligations that come with those rights. Their overall objective will be to ensure fairness, whilst also ensuring that evidence led is relevant and not subject to repetition. It is the experience of reporters from the DPEA and Scottish ministers that community groups are capable of presenting their evidence to inquiries on an equal basis to private companies.</p>

  <p>We have no plans at present to reconstitute the Expert Group on Prostitution.

  <p>The procedures currently used in the public local inquiry system are set out in the Town and Country (Inquiry Procedure) Rules 1997, amended 1998. It is vitally important that Reporters from the Directorate for Planning and Environmental Appeals obtain the material necessary to make an informed and reasoned recommendation or decision on a development proposal. In doing so, they must always act in accordance with the principles of fairness, openness and impartiality established by the Franks Committee in its 1957 Report (Administrative Tribunals and Inquiries). Scottish ministers are satisfied with the procedures used in these cases and are of the view that they are sufficiently robust to allow this.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has worked in partnership with the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland (RHASS), Scottish Enterprise Edinburgh and Lothian and the City of Edinburgh Council to conduct a site search exercise followed by a feasibility study into the preferred site. These studies have identified a suitable site south of the A8, roughly opposite the existing site. The site has been identified in the consultation draft of the West Edinburgh Planning Framework (WEPF) as suitable for the use. Any revision to the local plan or decision regarding a planning application for the site should have regard to the content of the WEPF.</p>

  <p>The RHASS is negotiating with BAA regarding relocation and in due course will submit a planning application for the site to City of Edinburgh Council.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that there are many potential factors which may prompt an authority to consider a school&rsquo;s future. We entirely endorse the views of the Accounts Commission and Audit Scotland that occupancy levels alone should not determine what councils do and that an occupancy level of below 60% should not automatically trigger consideration of a school&rsquo;s closure.</p>

  <p>Those views were set out in a letter of 24 January 2007 from the Accounts Commission to the Convener of the Parliament&rsquo;s former Education Committee, which can be found on the Scottish Parliament website at:</p>

  <p>The seasonal flu campaign is supported every year by a significant marketing and communications exercise designed to increase uptake amongst those individuals most at risk.</p>

  <p>This year a range of approaches have been taken to promote the message to the at risk groups under 65 years old. This includes a strong marketing message highlighting the risks of flu for those suffering from long-term conditions that will be delivered in and around pharmacies. As well as posters, leaflets and pharmacy bags, the marketing campaign this year will make use of posters on bus shelters in the direct vicinity of pharmacies. Interactive media such as text messaging and interactive posters on bus shelters will also be used.</p>

  <p>We have provided all general practitioners with resource packs to make it easier for them to write to at risk groups to encourage them to attend for their vaccination. We have also worked with voluntary organisations for people who are at risk to promote the need for the flu vaccine, and undertaken media briefings with journalists to ensure the key messages are communicated through the press and other media.</p>

  <p>I am considering whether ministers&rsquo; powers to fund or employ solicitors through the Scottish Legal Aid Board to provide legal advice and representation could be utilised to further help victims. The legal aid system can already assist victims claim compensation through the civil courts provided their case meets the three statutory tests for civil legal aid: financial eligibility, probable cause and reasonableness.</p>

  <p>Victims of violent crime can apply to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s contribution to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme and its administration is expected to be &pound;28 million in 2007-08.</p>

  <p>I want to ensure that victims of crime receive the information they need about legal proceedings that affect them. Significant numbers of victims, particularly victims of serious crime, already receive information from the Victim Information and Advice service, an integral part of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS), and through the operation of the Victim Notification Scheme (VNS). COPFS will respond to requests for information from any other victim within 20 working days. The Scottish Children&rsquo;s Reporters Administration provides information to victims of youth crime through its Victim Information Service (VIS), which is currently available in a number of areas across Scotland. Rolling out the service will be given full consideration once an evaluation of the current VIS, and other alternative options, has been carried out.</p>

  <p>Provision of information to victims through all these means is kept under review and any opportunity to improve or extend provision will be given serious consideration. For example, following a recent evaluation of the VNS I indicated a willingness to extend the terms of the scheme to include more victims. A final decision on the extension will depend upon the availability of resources and is therefore subject to the outcome of the Spending Review.</p>

  <p>I committed to ensuring that victims of crime receive the support they need when they need it and I see this as integral to making Scotland a safer and stronger country. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s provision of around &pound;41.5 million in 2007-08 to address issues affecting victims of crime underlines this commitment. This includes a contribution of &pound;28 million to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Scheme and to its administration. The remainder includes grants to Victim Support Scotland, Rape Crisis Scotland, Scottish Women&rsquo;s Aid and to a number of initiatives such as the Violence Against Women Fund, the Scottish Domestic Abuse Helpline, additional support for victims during the Domestic Abuse Court pilot and the Sexual Assault Referral Centre pilot in Glasgow. In addition, the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service has estimated the cost of the Victim Information and Advice service in 2007-08 to be around &pound;1.7 million. Decisions on future initiatives for victims will depend upon the outcome of the Spending Review.</p>

  <p>In answering this question, I take it that the reference to &quot;affected by&quot; domestic violence means subjected to domestic violence. Where an employee of the SPCB reported this, either to line management or a representative of the Personnel Office, the SPCB would offer support in the work place. The way that the SPCB would do this would be dependent on the needs of the employee at that time, for example:</p>

  <p>The employee would be able to access, on a completely confidential basis, our Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) provider which is available 24 hours a day. The range of services available include telephone or face to face access to a fully qualified counsellor and access to information specialists;</p>

  <p>To assist line management in such cases, access is also provided to the EAP. This allows management to discuss how they should respond appropriately to the situation, and</p>

  <p>In addition, the SPCB has the option of supporting the employee through referral to our occupational health service. This would apply especially where the employee was returning to work after a long term absence and would allow the SPCB to ensure that relevant support measures were in place at work.</p>

  <p>If the employee needed to make alternative domestic arrangements or require time away from work, the SPCB offers a range of flexible working options.</p>

  <p>In cases where the domestic situation of an employee was manifesting itself in the work-place, again there are a range of measures we can take:</p>

  <p>the on-site Police presence can be alerted. The Police can help with practical advice as well as responding to any formal complaint;</p>

  <p>we can screen calls for the individual, and</p>

  <p>we can agree to alter the individual&rsquo;s work pattern, approve a career break and consider options for working off-site if necessary.</p>

  <p>If financial advice is needed, this can be provided via the EAP.</p>

  <p>In the case of need for direct financial assistance the employee would be assisted in making an application to the Benevolent Fund of which the SPCB holds corporate membership.</p>

  <p>It is the aim of the SPCB to support sensitively and with professional help any employee who finds him or herself in this regrettable situation.</p>

  <p>If an employee tells his/her line manager in confidence that he/she has been subjected to domestic violence, the SPCB has measures in place to provide effective support to the employee concerned and the line manger. Such measures include:</p>

  <p>Support from the Personnel Office to enable the manager and any colleagues of the employee concerned to deal sensitively with the situation;</p>

  <p>24 hour access for the manager to the Employee Assistance Programme (EAP) provider. This can include coaching in dealing with sensitive situations such as this.</p>

  <p>Support from the Personnel Office in assisting the manager to put in place flexible working options and or other adjustments to the work or working environment, should these be required by the employee, and</p>

  <p>If the employee is returning from prolonged sick leave, a referral to our Occupational Health Service will be made and recommendations received as to how best support the employee at work. The manager and Personnel Office would work together in implementing the recommendations from the Occupational Health Service, ensuring that the employee&rsquo;s confidentiality was maintained at all times.</p>
