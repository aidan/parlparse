  <p>Subject to final EU Commission approval we propose to begin making sheep agrimoney payments in early April and beef agrimoney payments in mid to late April.</p>

  <p>Of the &#163;156 million optional agrimoney package announced by the Government on 27 February 2001 all but &#163;30 million is subject to match funding. In other words the EU will be funding &#163;93 million and the UK Exchequer &#163;63 million. However, because of the operation of the Fontainebleau agreement the UK taxpayer will end up paying &#163;129 million or some 83% of the total.</p>

  <p>We estimate that Scotland&#8217;s share of the UK package will be around &#163;24.5 million, of which &#163;15.5 million will be EU funded and &#163;9 million UK funded.</p>

  <p>Under the provisions of the Scotland Act 1998, matters concerning the regulation of aviation and air transport are reserved to the UK Government. The Scottish Executive is, however, in regular contact with the UK Government about a wide range of matters and, through its contacts with airlines operating in the Highlands and Islands, has discussed the improvement of fare structures to encourage more discounted fares as a means of promoting greater use of air services.</p>

  <p>The research found that whilst there was scope for some minor improvements in the courts, the greatest scope for improvement lay with the landlords and related agencies. <strong> </strong> I understand, however, that the Sheriff Court Rules Council is considering, as part of its current review of procedure, how cases dealt with under summary cause procedure, including eviction cases, can be dealt with more expeditiously.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. Originally listed as adequate, further investigation resulted in this bridge being regraded as sub-standard.</p>

  <p>Not included in this list are three bridges which are to be bypassed by proposed trunk road schemes. These structures have been strengthened by propping as an interim measure pending their replacement.</p>

  <p>Sub-standard bridges will be strengthened or replaced on a prioritised basis as part of the annual trunk road bridge maintenance programme. It is expected this work will take five years to complete but the actual timescale will depend on competing priorities and the availability of funding.</p>

  <p>Not included in this programme are four sub-standard bridges that will be replaced as part of other proposed schemes involving the improvement or realignment of the existing trunk road. These structures have been strengthened by propping as an interim measure pending their replacement.</p>

  <p>Between 1 April and 31 December last year a total of 1,231 calls were received by the NHS Helpline on carer-related issues. Information is one of the main needs of carers. Our decision to extend the NHS Helpline to contain social care information, and particularly information for carers, is potentially helping over 100 carers a month. Carers can now obtain advice and support through a single and easily accessible gateway, one that was previously unavailable to them, and that is to be welcomed.</p>

Of the latter, three cases have been dealt with by the court and one of these orders has been revoked. The remaining orders continue in force. An evaluation study of the Glasgow pilot and a second pilot established in Fife last July is currently under way and it is intended that the findings of this study will be published towards the end of the year. A commitment to a third site covering Aberdeen/Aberdeenshire was announced last November. Decisions on further extension will await the outcome of the evaluation.</p>

  <p>Latest data show that quarterly growth in Scotland is broadly in line with the UK, although year-on-year growth is slower. Independent forecasters (BSL and Cambridge Econometrics) suggest that growth in Scotland will be slightly below the UK this year.</p>

  <p>Short-term fluctuations aside, the central issue for policy is how Scotland&#8217;s trend rate of growth can be increased. The critical element in stimulating sustainable economic growth is the enhancement of productivity throughout all Scottish enterprises. This is achieved through increasing both the quality and quantity of output per worker and through reducing costs. Improved productivity is the key source of international competitive advantage.</p>

  <p>This is recognised in the Executive&#8217;s recent <i>Framework for Economic Development in Scotland </i>and the<i> Enterprise Strategy &#8211; a Smart, Successful Scotland &#8211; </i>which sets out the new international conditions for economic success <i>&#8211;</i> growing business, ensuring Scotland is globally connected, lifelong learning and skills development.</p>

  <p>The latest information from the 1999 school census shows that the average class size in publicly funded primary schools was 24.6. This figure covers both single stage and composite classes. A composite class includes children from more than one stage &#8211; for example P1 and P2.</p>

  <p>Most secondary school pupils are members of different class groupings for different subjects. Information about average class size is therefore generally regarded as less helpful than information about the average pupil:teacher ratio (PTR).</p>

  <p>Collection of information about average class sizes in secondary schools is time consuming for schools and was discontinued in 1997. Information about secondary PTRs is provided in the answer to question S1W-13585.</p>

  <p>The discharge of any poisonous, noxious or polluting matter, or any solid waste matter, to the River Clyde is in most circumstances an offence under section 30F of the Control of Pollution Act 1974. The most important exception is where a consent for a discharge, such as from a sewage treatment works, is granted by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency. The agency is statutorily obliged, when granting such consents, to give consideration to the protection of the environment, and attaches conditions to consents to prevent unacceptable impacts. Littering is also an offence under the Environmental Protection Act 1990.</p>

  <p>Decisions on whether to prosecute under the 1974 and 1990 Acts are a matter for the Procurator Fiscal, though under the 1990 Act the local authority may appoint Litter Wardens with powers to serve a &#163;25 fixed penalty notice on litter offenders, as an alternative to referring the offence to the Fiscal.</p>

The discharge of sewage without a consent from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency into the Clyde or any other Scottish river is an offence under the Control of Pollution Act 1974. On summary conviction, the maximum penalties are imprisonment for up to three months, or a fine of up to &#163;20,000, or both. On conviction on indictment, the penalties are imprisonment for up to two years, or an unlimited fine, or both. Decisions on prosecution are a matter for the Procurator Fiscal, and sentencing (within the parameters of the Acts) is a matter for the courts.</p>

  <p>Where the Scottish Environment Protection Agency grants a consent for the discharge of sewage, it is bound by the terms of the Environment Act 1995 to do so in such a way as to protect the environment, for example by the application of appropriate conditions to the consent.</p>

  <p>The Executive is determined that vacant and derelict sites in Scotland should be brought back into use. Planning policy encourages the re-use of previously developed sites. We have not set a national target.</p>

  <p>We monitor and report annually on the extent of such land. The <i>Scottish Vacant and Derelict Land Survey 2000</i> was published on 27 March 2001. It shows that the level of derelict and vacant land in Scotland fell in 2000 to an all-time low of 11,683 hectares.</p>

  <p>3. Figures given include honorary consultants.</p>

  <p>4. Health board areas that did not have consultants working solely in the specialty of renal medicine in any of the years 1997, 1998 or 1999 are not shown.</p>

  <p>5. It should be noted that, in addition to those consultants in the table above, there are also a large number of general physicians with a subspecialty interest in renal medicine working in all areas of Scotland. Subspecialty statistics are not collected centrally, so it is not possible to give an exact figure for these.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S1W-11275 by Mr Jim Wallace on 11 January 2001, why the number of excess winter deaths has increased from 2,610 in 1997-98 to 5,190 in 1999-2000.</p>

  <p>Year to year fluctuations in the numbers of &quot;excess winter deaths&quot;, however defined, show a close relationship with the occurrence of major influenza outbreaks. Whilst the numbers of deaths where the underlying cause is recorded as being influenza is normally relatively low, even during a relatively severe outbreak, there is invariably a sizeable increase in the numbers of deaths from related causes, notably pneumonia and other respiratory conditions. This was the case during the winter of 1999-2000, and also to a slightly lesser extent during that of 1998-99. Though complete data for the winter of 2000-01 is not yet available, provisional figures suggest that the number of &quot;excess winter deaths&quot; will be in line with that normally observed during a winter when influenza activity is limited, such as 1997-98.</p>

  <p>The information requested is not held centrally. While some authorities are using the Model Secure Tenancy Agreement (MoSTA), it has not yet been widely adopted as MoSTA did not become available until after the secure tenancy had been introduced.

  <p>Employment Policy is reserved to the UK Government which takes the lead in funding and delivery of the New Deal. In Scotland it does this in partnership with the Scottish Executive and contributing Scottish organisations.</p>

  <p>By responding to individual needs, New Deal seeks to improve participants&#8217; prospects of finding and retaining employment. Where appropriate this will include help with motivation, soft and jobsearch skills.</p>

  <p>In our <i>Social Justice Strategy</i> , we have set long-term targets of ensuring older people are financially secure and that increased numbers enjoy independent and healthy lives.</p>

  <p>The first <i>Social Justice Annual Report</i>, which was published on 13 November 2000, sets out what is being done to support our social justice targets and milestones for older people. This includes a community care package of &#163;300 million over three years, the installation of central heating for 70,000 pensioners and free off-peak bus travel.</p>

  <p>In addition, we are working closely with the UK Government which is working through the tax and benefits system to improve the incomes of poorer pensioners.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether the findings of Power Frequency Electromagnetic Fields and the Risk of Cancer by the National Radiological Protection Board give rise to any concerns about the health implications of electro-magnetic radiation from telecommunications masts located in residential areas.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2001-04-05.S1W-14435.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80140" speakername="Malcolm Chisholm" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-01/wa0405.htm#31">

  <p>This review was carried out by the Advisory Group on Non-ionising Radiation (AGNIR) on behalf of the NRPB Board to assess the potential risks of cancer from electromagnetic fields and to recommend any further steps that should be taken to protect the health of the public. The AGNIR report deals specifically with the low frequency electric and magnetic fields arising from the electricity supply system. It does not cover exposure to the much higher frequencies used by mobile phone technology, and therefore does not give rise to any concerns about mobile phone base stations.</p>

  <p>The Independent Expert Group on Mobile Phones (IEGMP) was set up to assess the current state of knowledge on the possible health effects from mobile phone technology. Their report, which was published in May 2000, concluded that the balance of evidence does not suggest that mobile phone technologies are a risk to health.</p>

  <p>During 1999 and 2000, officials within the Scottish Executive Road Network Management and Maintenance Division gave advice to Scottish planning authorities on 1,250 planning applications, some of which would have included requests for new accesses onto trunk roads. The determination of these planning applications then rests with the relevant local planning authority.</p>

  <p>Generally, proposals for new accesses to trunk roads are assessed by the Executive and relevant local planning authority, on a case by case basis. The benefits and costs of trunk road access are carefully assessed, (with particular regard to the likely impact on accidents and traffic flows), alongside those of the alternative options available to meet the developers&#8217; needs.</p>

  <p>In Scotland, the Scottish Education Unit of the Construction Industry Training Board (CITB), the National Training Organisation for the construction sector, is in the lead on promoting this study and career option. The unit provides a single approach to promoting careers in the construction industry among school pupils in Scotland, with the emphasis on the 14-18 age group. The unit undertakes two key strands of activity to promote civil engineering. It provides a range of activities, such as work shadowing and building competitions, to promote professional and management careers in the sector and, through the CITB Curriculum Centres Initiative, organises school-based projects, with links to FE colleges.</p>

  <p>At UK level, the Hawley Group Report, has recommended that the Engineering Council evolves into the Engineering and Technology Board, to meet the needs and aspirations of an increasingly diverse engineering community. Ownership of the process remains with the engineering community itself and the shape and remit of the new board will be for them to decide.</p>

  <p>No specific guidance has been issued on provision for children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. General guidance on Special Educational Needs (SEN) is contained in the <i>Scottish Executive Manual of Good Practice</i> for all staff and professionals involved with children and young people with special educational needs. Further advice on good practice can be found in the Scottish Executive publications, <i>Taking a Closer Look at</i> <i>Promoting Social Competence</i> , <i>Sharing Good Practice</i> and <i>Circular 4/96: Children and Young</i> <i>People with Special Educational Needs-Assessment and Recording</i> .</p>

  <p>Circular 4/96 provides advice to education authorities on the assessment and recording arrangements in Scotland for children and young people with learning needs across the full range of special educational needs. The National SEN Advisory Forum is conducting a review of these statutory arrangements and Circular 4/96 will be updated in light of any proposed changes.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) is currently developing a clinical guideline on Attention Deficit and Hyperkinetic Disorders in Children and Young People, which is due to be published later this year. The guideline will be disseminated to a range of interests including NHS Trusts and health boards.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether <strong></strong> sportscotland received a proposal from the Camanachd Association to set up a working party to discuss an increase in its core funding; whether this proposal has been rejected and what the reasons were for any such decision; whether sportscotland has requested that an independent review of shinty be conducted; what the reasons are for any such request and what such a review will cost, and whether it will consider redirecting the cost of any such review towards increasing the core grant of the Camanachd Association.</p>

  <p>As explained in my response to question S1W-12677 on 14 February, <strong></strong> sportscotland has offered to fund an independent review of the Camanachd Association. The association&#8217;s response was to reject the offer and instead propose that an independently chaired working party be set up to look at the differences between it and <strong></strong> sportscotland. <strong></strong> sportscotland rejected this approach because of concerns that a working party would focus on the issue of the Camanachd Association&#8217;s core funding, an issue on which a decision has already been taken.</p>

  <p>An independent review of the Camanachd Association would be wide ranging and its aim would be to ensure the long-term success of shinty and the viability of the association. The cost of a review would be approximately &#163;10,000. <strong></strong>sportscotland would not consider redirecting the one off costs of a review to the Camanachd Association&#8217;s core grant as there is presently no basis on which to increase the Camanachd Association&#8217;s core funding.</p>

  <p><strong></strong>sportscotland&#8217;s offer of an independent review remains on the table. The way forward for the Camanachd Association and the sport of shinty is to accept the offer.</p>
