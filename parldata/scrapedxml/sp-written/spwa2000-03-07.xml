  <p>The first plant, Dundas Brothers Ltd at Kintore by Inverurie, treat their waste on site using their dissolved air floatation and biological treatment plants. This produces a &quot;float&quot; (or &quot;sludge&quot;) which is tankered by Dundas Brothers to Burnhaven, Peterhead where it is disposed of, under licence, to the sea via a six-inch bar screened outfall facility. This process is overseen by North of Scotland Water. Liquid waste is disposed of by Dundas Brothers into the River Don.</p>

  <p>The second plant, William Forest and Son (Paisley) Ltd, treat their waste at Daldowie treatment works, where it is subject to full tertiary treatment, including nitrification. The treated liquid effluent is discharged into the public sewer under consent issued by North Lanarkshire Council. Discharge is controlled by SEPA under a waste management licence. A contractor, Cunningham, removes the sewage sludge from the treatment works to the Mount Vernon landfill site.</p>

  <p>The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee (SEAC) have considered the practice of spreading rendering condensate on land and have concluded that as a precautionary measure it should be discontinued on land where cattle may graze.</p>

  <p>The Environmental Agency published a report on the options for the disposal of treated effluent from a particular rendering plant in June 1997 which showed that all the disposal methods - including the historical method of disposal onto the land surface - present extremely low risks of exposure to BSE infectivity, negligible compared to other risks in daily life. An assessment of the risk using a set of pessimistic assumptions showed that the likelihood of the most exposed individual ingesting sufficient material in one year to cause infection was around one in 1,000 million.</p>

  <p>The Spongiform Encephalopathy Advisory Committee have noted the methodology used in this report and is content with its conclusions.</p>

  <p>Neither of the two plants in question, Dundas Brothers at Kintore by Inverurie, or William Forrest and Sons (Paisley) Ltd at Newarthill, Motherwell, dispose of waste by spreading on land.

  <p>The Newarthill site does remove sewage sludge to the Mount Vernon landfill site for burial. There is also provision given under their Waste Management Licence for up to 600 tonnes of permissible effluent per day to be discharged to a mine shaft on site in an emergency situation.</p>

  <p>A consultation paper will be released today on regulatory powers for SEPA to prevent and control agricultural water pollution. The new regulations would extend SEPA&#8217;s powers to allow it to serve notices in relation to silos, slurry stores and agricultural fuel storage tanks requiring farmers to address problems causing pollution or which may cause pollution. The new powers will also allow SEPA to require the preparation and implementation of a Farm Waste Management Plan. The regulations would also simplify controls to encourage repairs to agricultural storage facilities and prevent water pollution, and remove controls where there is no evidence of a significant pollution risk, such as a 30-day notification period for making bulk-bagged silage.</p>

  <p>SEPA forecast that, on present trends, diffuse agricultural pollution will, by 2010, be the most important cause of downgrading in river quality. It is also a significant threat to the quality of bathing waters, and I announced on 18 February that the Scottish Executive has commissioned research to examine the effects of farm practices in that area.</p>

  <p>The cost of flu vaccine is met by health boards from the overall resources made available to them to meet their responsibilities. The question of which groups should be immunised is addressed each year by the Chief Medical Officer. He identifies the groups at risk and recommends that they should be immunised.</p>

  <p>Currently, immunisation is recommended for the following groups:</p>

  <p>those of any age with a chronic heart or chest complaint including asthma, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, lowered immunity due to disease or treatment such as steroid medication or cancer treatment, or any other serious medical condition;</p>

  <p>all aged over 75;</p>

  <p>people living in places where there is a high risk of influenza spreading quickly, such as long stay residential accommodation.</p>

Income is from all sources including employment, Social Security Benefits and investments. Evidence suggests that some items of income may be under-reported in the survey, particularly for self-employment and investment income.

  <p>The Executive has given a commitment to review how the justice system in Scotland deals with stalking and harassment. We intend to issue a consultation paper in March seeking views on how we can offer greater protection from stalkers. We will consult widely and will consider any suggestions, including the need for a register of convicted stalkers. To date we have not received any representations about such a register.</p>
