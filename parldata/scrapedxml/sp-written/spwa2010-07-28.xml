  <p>Scotland&rsquo;s zero waste plan, launched in June 2010, sets the strategic direction for waste policy for Scotland. Zero Waste Scotland is the Scottish Government&rsquo;s delivery programme for zero waste. It provides a range of support, campaigns and other interventions to help people and organisations on the journey to zero waste.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government provides funding to the zero waste Scotland litter and flytipping programme which supports local authorities and other stake holders in their role tackling litter in public places.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is keen to see the number of recycling on the go facilities in public places increase substantially across Scotland. Zero Waste Scotland has been commissioned to produce guidance on recycling on the go, which can turn the problem of litter into a resource for Scotland.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers have already allowed a derogation for the burial of fallen stock in a designated remote area. However, burial should not be regarded as the first option on remote areas, rather it should be the very last option considered for disposal purposes. In Scotland, the designated remote areas cover the majority of the Highlands and Islands and Argyllshire.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government will soon be consulting on consolidation the Animal by-Products (Scotland) Regulations 2003 and will be seeking views on a number of derogations including one that would allow burial/burning of fallen stock where access is impractical or there is health and safety risks of collection.</p>

  <p>The requirements for correct disposal of fallen stock exist to protect human and animal health and to protect the environment.</p>

  <p>Scientific evidence shows that the degradation process essential to ensure reduction of BSE/TSE infectivity cannot be guaranteed by burial. Even after burial scrapie infected material can persist in the soil for years and present a source of infection. Therefore it is essential that fallen stock is disposed in the correct way.</p>

  <p>Marine Scotland is currently developing statutory guidance for Scottish inshore waters, in line with Scottish regulations. Marine Scotland will consult key marine stakeholders on this guidance and publish it in autumn 2010.</p>

  <p>The Joint Nature Conservation Committee, Natural England and the Countryside Council for Wales have produced statutory guidance on the disturbance of marine European protected species for UK offshore areas, including offshore waters adjacent to Scotland.</p>

  <p>A cross-sector working group, including supplier representation from the construction sector, has been established to review existing approaches to supplier pre-qualification and to develop a standard pre-qualification questionnaire (SPQQ) for use by the public sector in Scotland in all types of procurement (goods, works and services). A competition has also been launched to identify potential providers of the data base and associated services.</p>

  <p>The development of the database, and its launch, will be accompanied by a significant series of communications and training events designed to encourage its use within both the buyer and supplier communities.</p>

  <p>A key aim of the SPQQ database project is to encourage the public sector buyer community in Scotland to use a common system and standardised questions when contracting for goods, services and works (including construction projects), and offer suppliers the ability to store their answers to the standard questions online, reducing the current requirement to repeatedly submit their prequalification details.</p>

  <p>We expect the database to be launched by the end of 2010.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government does not currently hold any contracts awarded following the use of Article 19 of the EU Procurement Directives. The Scottish Government is actively exploring how Article 19 may be used at the fit-out stage in the construction of the Scottish Crime Campus.</p>

  <p>The Public Contracts Scotland contract advertising portal is being developed to send issue alerts to purchasers when they select a category of goods or services that could be supplied by a support business. A brochure will also be issued to public authorities, which profiles all supported businesses in Scotland and highlights the range of goods and services available.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is also working at a number of levels to increase access to public contracts for supported business, such as by providing access to guidance, training and skills through the <em>Enterprising Third Sector Action Plan</em>.</p>

  <p>Smaller tree planting is already supported through the small scale woodland creation measure available under the Land Managers Options and also the native woodland and mixed conifer/broadleaf woodland models under the Rural Priorities mechanism of the Scotland Rural Development Programme.</p>

  <p>Using the land managers options, landowners can plant new woods with native species from 0.1 - 1.0 hectare in size and using the Rural Priorities, landowners can create new native woodlands or mixed conifer/broadleaf woodland of 0.25 hectares or greater.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government commissioned an independent review of the Scottish Monitor Farm programme in 2008. ADAS, who carried out the review, reported that, overall, the programme was effective in bringing about physical and financial improvements on the farms involved and on farms not actively engaged in the programme. They concluded that, at a conservative estimate, for every &pound;1 of public funding invested in the programme, the farming economy benefited by &pound;6.50. The full report, &quot;An Investigation into the Role and Effectiveness of Scottish Monitor Farms&quot;, can be found on the Scottish Government website at:</p>
