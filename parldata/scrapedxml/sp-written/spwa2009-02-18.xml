  <p>Ministers have agreed to undertake the following overseas visits:</p>

  <p>North America &ndash; The First Minister will travel to Washington DC this month in support of the Scottish Government&rsquo;s promotion of the year of Homecoming. He will take part in a major symposium on the life and works of Robert Burns, featuring leading Scottish and American academics and scholars.</p>

  <p>China &ndash; The First Minister will visit China in April and a comprehensive programme of events will be announced in due course. He will be accompanied by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning.</p>

  <p>Ministerial diaries are subject to parliamentary and other pressures and therefore often subject to change. Further details of each visit will be announced in due course.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what its assessment is of Operation Cougar in tackling gang culture in Manchester, as reported by the Home Office on 29 January 2009.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-02-18.S3W-20367.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80341" speakername="Kenny MacAskill" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0218.htm#3">

  <p>The Scottish Government welcomes the efforts taken by others to tackle gang violence and is interested in any initiative that has a positive impact. We are therefore looking carefully at Operation Cougar and will consider what action, if any, could be replicated in Scotland. In the meantime, we are continuing to take direct and innovative action to tackle this problem. The next phase of the Violence Reduction Unit&rsquo;s anti-violence campaign in March will see the police across Scotland delivering intelligence-led co-ordinated action on gangs, and the groundbreaking Community Initiative to Reduce Violence (CIRV) project currently being delivered in Glasgow, for which we are providing &pound;1.6 million funding, is providing coordinated and intensive services to over 700 gang members to encourage and support them change their lives.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will develop a national mental health service for deaf people and, if so, what the timescale will be for achieving a service agreement to that effect.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2009-02-18.S3W-20543.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80379" speakername="Shona Robison" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-09/wa0218.htm#4">

  <p>Mental health services for those with sensory loss continue to develop and improve. For example, a new dedicated community service and a deaf counselling service are now operational and have been well received by service users in Lothian. National access to specialist in-patient services when needed is long established through referrals to the John Denmark Unit in Manchester with attention to transitions a feature of the care pathway.</p>

  <p>We are examining with partners the merits of a Scotland-based in-patient facility and how to further improve regional specialist community services.</p>
