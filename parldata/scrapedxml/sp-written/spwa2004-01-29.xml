  <p>The Scottish Executive is today publishing estimated Scottish farm income figures and I welcome the forecast rises in income that these show. These estimates show that Total Income From Farming (TIFF) rose by 29% in 2003 to &#163;471 million. The forecast rise in the Scottish figure reflects the increase in cereals in particular the good yields and prices for barley. Finished cattle and sheep markets also continue to improve, as shown by the 3% and 10% increase in cattle and sheep respectively.</p>

  <p>Average net farm income (NFI) for all farm types is forecast to have risen by 134% between 2002-03 and 2003-04, from &#163;7,000 to &#163;17,000. This figure relates to farms not directly affected by foot-and-mouth disease culling. There is forecast to have been a considerable rise for all farm types, with cereal and general cropping farms showing significant increases. However, income for other farm types has also benefited from better cereal prices. Detailed estimates of the outputs, inputs and income for 2003-04 at both the aggregate level and by farm type will be published this morning and will be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.</p>

  <p>Yes. My ministerial colleagues and I spent considerable time over the summer of 2003 consulting with communities across Scotland about antisocial behaviour. Problems with groups of people causing alarm and distress were raised many times and we found widespread support for our proposals to strengthen the powers of the police to deal with such groups. That dialogue with the people affected by antisocial behaviour has continued and will continue throughout the progress of the bill and beyond.</p>

  <p>Local authorities and managers of services have responsibilities to monitor and improve their performance. Overall, the Scottish Executive undertakes monitoring through the social work services inspectorate annual report and periodic thematic and specific reports by the Inspectorate. The Children and Young People Delivery Group is taking forward work to strengthen local quality assurance systems and external inspection of children&#8217;s services. Revised guidance for local authorities on planning co-ordinated children&#8217;s services will issue later this year. The Scottish Executive has collated and published performance by local authorities and other service providers under the Time Intervals Monitoring Group. Audit Scotland reports to the Scottish Parliament provide independent assessment of performance.</p>

  <p>At individual case level, children&#8217;s hearings will monitor progress at review hearings. The Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Bill proposes a new power for reporters and hearings to refer local authorities to the courts if there are concerns that statutory obligations are not being met. The review of the hearings system which is due to be launched in a few weeks time will need to consider how the system as a whole ensures effective outcomes for children.</p>

  <p>Maritime safety is a reserved matter and responsibility in this areas lies with the Maritime and Coastguard Agency.</p>

  <p>However, following the recent tragedy in the Forth Estuary when two men went missing on a fishing trip, Central Scotland Police are carrying out an investigation into the circumstances and when their report is completed it will be considered by the Procurator Fiscal. It would be inappropriate to offer further comment at this stage. However, I can assure Parliament that any lessons learned from this tragic incident will be carefully considered by all the parties involved.</p>

  <p>A range of policies and initiatives are being progressed at local and national level aimed at improving care, services and support for older people with mental health problems. These include implementing the joint future agenda for single shared assessments and our work with the agencies to reduce delayed discharges from hospital. We are also working with Alzheimer Scotland-Action on dementia on guidance to help remove any blockages to joined up care that may occur in the organisation of dementia services.</p>

  <p>The median waiting times for a first outpatient appointment with a consultant in the specialty of dermatology, following referral by a general medical practitioner, by NHS board of residence, in each of the last 10 years are given in the table.</p>

  <p>Information on waiting times for diagnostic tests, such as biopsies, is not collected centrally.</p>

  <p>The Centre for Change and Innovation will be launching a national redesign of dermatology services in February 2004 as part of our commitment to reducing outpatient waiting times and ensuring that no patient waits more than 26 weeks for a first outpatient appointment, following GP referral, by 31 December 2005. The twin aims of the redesign will be to reduce outpatient waiting times and to improve the quality of services for patients.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-4782 by Euan Robson on 13 January 2004, whether the income threshold for qualification for free school meals of &#163;13,230 is a combined parental income threshold and therefore a household income limit.</p>

  <p>My answer to question S2W-4782 details the income threshold of &#163;13,230 as representing the current income threshold for child tax credit (CTC), as prescribed by the Tax Credits Act 2002. This threshold relates to income assessed for the purpose of awarding tax credits. This is family income - so for two parent families the income threshold is a combined parental income threshold and therefore a household income limit.</p>

  <p>National objectives and standards for social work services in the criminal justice system, which cover the supervision aspects of probation orders, were established in 1991. The national standards set out detailed guidance on management and practice and seek to provide courts with the assurance that high quality services will be provided and standards rigorously applied and effectively administered by suitably qualified staff.</p>

  <p>The Accounts Commission has a statutory responsibility to specify information local authorities must publish about their performance, in the form of statutory performance indicators. Criminal justice social work services, which are responsible for the supervision of probation orders, are one of the areas on which the Commission report annually. In addition the social work services Inspectorate commenced in 2003 a programme of inspection of the work of criminal justice social work services and have identified probation as one of the key areas for inspection.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what steps it has taken to promote genealogy as a reason for visiting Scotland.</p>

  <p>Research shows that many visitors to Scotland give &quot;family roots and ancestry&quot; as the main influence on their decision to holiday in Scotland. Scotland is fortunate in having some of the best genealogical resources in the world. In particular, the development of the &#163;1.6 million Scottish Family History Centre announced by the Scottish Executive in December 2002 provides a valuable opportunity to attract more visitors and maximise use of this tremendous resource.</p>

  <p>The new Centre will link the adjacent General Register House and New Register House at the East end of Edinburgh&#8217;s Princes Street to create a fully-integrated Register House campus. It will be fully operational in 2006 and will create a one stop-shop for genealogy research, bringing together services provided separately by the General Register Office for Scotland, National Archives of Scotland and Court of the Lord Lyon.</p>

  <p>In addition, in response to growing demand for genealogy tourism to Scotland VisitScotland launched the AncestralScotland website in 2002. The primary aim behind the project is to use people&#8217;s interest in their ancestral roots as a hook to encourage tourism. AncestralScotland offers the user information on how to research ancestry and provides a database of names (based on the 1881 census) for users to search through. The genealogical information is linked directly to tourism information on the relevant regional tourist board site, thereby encouraging users not simply to research their ancestors but to travel to their homeland.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive covers the cost of standard and enhanced police checks for voluntary sector volunteers working with children, young people and vulnerable adults. We also core fund the Central Registered Body in Scotland to process applications for free checks for the voluntary sector and to forward them to Disclosure Scotland which issues the disclosure certificates. Furthermore we have authorised the recruitment of additional staff at Disclosure Scotland to reduce the turnaround times for applications and the position is improving.</p>
