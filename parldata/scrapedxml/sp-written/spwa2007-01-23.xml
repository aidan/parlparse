  <p>Responsibility for the distribution of compensation to farmers impacted by the sea eagle reintroduction programme on Mull lies with SNH rather than Scottish ministers. As indicated in the following table, such compensation payments by SNH were discontinued after 2003, in favour of a positive incentive scheme for the management of sea eagles and golden eagles in Mull.</p>

  <p>Under the Standards in Scotland&rsquo;s Schools Act 2000 every child, including asylum seeking and refugee children, has a right to school education provided by an education authority. The Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 requires education authorities to identify, meet and keep under review the additional support needs of all pupils who require support to access and benefit from education. To help ensure that all asylum seeker and refugee children get the education to which they are entitled, the Executive has produced an education guide which provides new arrivals with information on how the Scottish education system works and relevant contact details.</p>

  <p>The Executive collects data on the number of asylum seekers and refugees in Scottish schools and on their educational attainment. We have also commissioned research to assess the experiences of the children of asylum seekers in our schools, and the policies employed by local authorities to support their learning, and we expect the findings to be published shortly.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 places duties on local authorities relative to the provision of services to safeguard and promote the welfare for children in their area who are in need. The fieldwork for the first joint inspection of children&rsquo;s services for asylum seekers in Glasgow took place in the autumn. The inspection will assess the quality of all such services, including education provision. We expect to receive the formal report of the inspection shortly and will inform Parliament of its findings.</p>

  <p>All asylum seeker children have the same right to help and support as other children &ndash; to get access to health, education and other services from local service providers.</p>

  <p>We continue to implement the provisions of the March 2006 Agreement with the Home Office, which focuses mainly on the removal of failed asylum seekers and their children. The package agreed will mean that the rights, needs and interests of children in asylum seeker families are given earlier and on-going consideration.</p>

  <p>In January 2006, the latest date for which figures are available, it is estimated that 96% of eligible three-year-olds and 99% of four-year-olds were registered for pre-school education. As children are counted at each centre where they are registered, children who attend more than one centre will be counted more than once.</p>

  <p>There were 51,610 registrations for three-year-olds and 55,690 registrations for four year olds at a pre-school education or day care centre in January 2006, with a further 3,050 registrations of three-year-olds and 2,840 registrations of four-year-olds attending a childminder. As children are counted once for each centre or childminder that they attend, these figures include double counting. It is not possible to disaggregate the figures further to produce figures for the number of children taking up child care and pre-school education as the figures are based on the settings children attend rather than the services each child receives.</p>

  <p>The figures are published in the <em>Pre-School and Childcare Statistics 2006 </em>(Bib. number 40411).</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive issued the <em>Guidance on Commissioning Pre-School Education Partners </em> in July 2003, which advises that authorities should provide clear guidance on the conditions that will be applied in selecting partner providers.</p>

  <p>The <em>Guidance on Pre-School Education</em>, issued in 2002, also includes some general advice on commissioning pre-school places from other providers.</p>

  <p>Both documents are available on the Scottish Executive website:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what consideration it has given to any possibility that the public information campaign for the new local government electoral system will lead to confusion in respect of the constituency section of the ballot for the Scottish parliamentary elections, given that this will now be the only election involving marking a single &quot;x&quot;, and what representations have been made to the (a) Scotland Office and (b) Electoral Commission to ensure that the public remains well-informed for participation in all levels of democracy.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is working closely with the independent Electoral Commission to deliver a joint information campaign for the 2007 elections. We consider that because the local government and Scottish parliamentary elections are combined, a joint public information campaign is likely to be more effective. The Electoral Commission has statutory responsibility for the promotion of the Scottish parliamentary elections.</p>

  <p>The primary aim of the campaign is to spread awareness of and information about the forthcoming elections to ensure that people who want to vote are able to do so in May. A vital element of this will be explaining the two different voting systems being used on 3 May. The campaign plan and content are based on research into current knowledge of the voting systems and are designed to minimise any confusion on how to vote. The effectiveness of the campaign will be monitored throughout.</p>

  <p>The Scotland Office has no official role in the public information campaign, however, they are kept aware of the development of the campaign through their participation in the 2007 Elections Steering Group.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive when it will make its formal response to the Commission on Boundary Differences and Voting Systems (Arbuthnott Commission) Report, Putting Citizens First: Boundaries, Voting and Representation in Scotland, published on 19 January 2006.</p>

</ques>


<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-01-23.11.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80078" speakername="Mr Jack McConnell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0123.htm#5">

  <p>The Executive has separate responses to four recommendations of the Arbuthnott Report, which are set out as follows:</p>

  <p>The majority of the other recommendations of the Arbuthnott Report relate to reserved matters, and the Scotland Office is today responding to these separately on behalf of the UK Government. Other recommendations in the report fall to be considered by the Electoral Commission and the Scottish Parliament.</p>

  <p>Recommendation 2. The boundaries for Scottish Parliamentary constituencies should be within and respect local authority areas rather than Westminster constituencies.</p>

  <p>Recommendation 4. The functions of the Boundary Commission for Scotland and the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland should be combined to enable the constituencies and regions for the Scottish Parliament and local authorities to be reviewed together. Consideration should also be given to integrating the review of Westminster constituencies in Scotland into this process.</p>

  <p>The approach advocated in the report is consistent with the aims of the Scottish Executive&rsquo;s public service reform agenda and there could be benefits from aligning boundaries as proposed. The Scottish Executive is currently looking at the long-term options for reform across a range of public bodies in Scotland, including local authorities. Any action which might need to be taken by the UK Government, including consideration of possible new structures for the regions for Scottish Parliament elections or any future review of constituency boundaries, would only be after the question of any need for changes had been considered by the new Scottish administration.</p>

  <p>Recommendation 12. The Scottish Parliament and local government elections should not be held on the same day.</p>

  <p>The Executive has noted the Arbuthnott Commission&rsquo;s conclusion and recommendation, but remains of the view that it is in the best interests of the voters and turnout that these elections should continue to be combined.</p>

  <p>Recommendation 21. No pupil should leave school without having had an introduction to the voting systems and the work of the parliaments, in the context of Education for Citizenship.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive has endorsed the recommendation that young people leaving school should have a good understanding of voting and parliamentary democracy. The current review of the curriculum in Scotland, <em>A Curriculum for Excellence</em>, aims to prioritise and simplify existing curricular guidance.</p>

  <p>The aspiration is that all young people should be given the opportunity to develop as responsible citizens with a capacity to participate fully in political, economic, social and cultural life. It is envisaged that there will be a range of areas through which an understanding of voting and parliamentary democracy could be developed.</p>

  <p>NHS patients in Scotland may receive treatment outside their NHS board of residence for a range of reasons, including accessing services at the Golden Jubilee National Hospital and highly specialised (tertiary) services at the major teaching centres. Many thousands of patients receive treatment outwith their board of residence each year.</p>

  <p>NHS Quality Improvement Scotland works with NHS boards to improve the quality of health care by reducing variation in practice and outcome, through developing and disseminating national clinical guidelines containing recommendations for effective practice based on current evidence. This covers guidance on referrals, including referrals to services in other board areas.</p>

  <p>The NHS in Scotland is increasingly using information technology to support effective practice by enabling electronic transmission of referrals from any GP practice to any hospital in Scotland using standard forms. The intention is to provide the same facility for referrals between consultants, including referrals to services in different board areas.</p>

  <p>Health Protection Scotland published the latest figures on MRSA bacteraemia (blood infection) rates on 16 January 2007. A copy of this report is available from:</p>

  <p>The numbers of reported MRSA bacteraemias for NHS Grampian since 2004 are laid out in the following table. Hospital specific information is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>MRSA bacteraemia rates have remained stable in Scotland as a whole and in Grampian since national mandatory reporting began in 2003.</p>

  <p>As part of our drive to improve surveillance, compulsory reporting of all Staphylococcus aureus infection in addition to MRSA was introduced in July 2006. This has increased detection rates and will enable more effective targeting of measures to reduce these infections.</p>

  <p>Wide-ranging measures to address healthcare associated infection (HAI), set in place by the HAI Task Force, include a media campaign to raise awareness amongst NHS staff, patients, visitors and the public of the benefits of improved hand hygiene to public health. Local health board co-ordinators are being appointed to help implement and monitor compliance. Additional training courses for NHS staff, and robust monitoring of the standards of cleaning in Scotland&rsquo;s hospitals are also part of the task force&rsquo;s delivery plan.</p>

  <p>There are no plans to redirect 999 emergency ambulance calls to NHS 24 &ndash; calls will continue to be answered by the Scottish Ambulance Service&rsquo;s emergency medical dispatch centres. Scottish Ambulance Service call handlers will continue to use the clinical algorithms that support decisions about the priority of the call and the nature of the response that is required.</p>

  <p>The vast majority of emergency ambulance calls require an ambulance to be sent, but there are a number that do not. At present, a caller who does not require an ambulance may be asked to hang up and contact their own GP or NHS 24. In future, it will be possible for the call details to be passed electronically to NHS 24, to enable an appropriate advisor to call the patient back without the patient having to repeat the information that he or she has already provided.</p>

  <p>A scoping exercise of current community nursing services.</p>

  <p>A literature review.</p>

  <p>Workshops in health boards areas for all community nurses and managers.</p>

  <p>Examination of different models of nursing in the community.</p>

  <p>Development of a new model.</p>

  <p>On-going consultation with services users and professional groups.</p>

  <p>Develop conclusions and recommendations.</p>

  <p>Publish a report.</p>

  <p>The recommendations from the review will be piloted in four development sites over the next two years which will address the implications of the proposed model and highlight any further work to be done. Any further implementation will take several years.</p>

  <p>Project officers began liaising with individual NHS boards in late 2005. From the start of 2006 two reference groups &ndash; practitioners and patients/carers &ndash; and a steering group examined the best way forward for the future of nursing in the community. The work of these groups was complemented and informed by a wide range of workshops which took place across the country in the first half of 2006. Furthermore, two conferences were held allowing a wide range of practitioners the opportunity to inform the draft model. The draft report of the review was circulated for comment from 6 June with responses invited by 23 June 2006. All responses which missed this deadline were nonetheless considered.</p>

  <p>A consideration of the policy drivers of care provision was undertaken by the review team as well as an examination of international models of nursing in the community. A literature review was also conducted by Napier University.</p>

  <p>We are not removing the services district nurses and health visitors provide. We are changing how they are organised and educated to help them to provide high quality services to meet the health needs of Scotland in the 21st Century. To mark this change, the new nurses will be called community health nurses (CHN), which we feel reflects their role more accurately. The CHN will absorb the current district nursing, public health (health visiting and school nursing) and family health nursing disciplines and will sit in a wider multi-disciplinary, multi-agency context. The model is based on a team approach which should not be made up exclusively of nursing staff. For example, the team may include social work skills and independent sector colleagues as appropriate. The skill mix of each CHN team will vary according to the needs of the local area in which it is based. CHN will refer to specialist services (including community learning disability nurses, community mental health nurses, community children&rsquo;s nurses, occupational health nurses and many others) where appropriate. The development sites will help to identify the interface between the services provided by the model and those provided by others.</p>

  <p>General practice nurses are not covered by the model, but will be important partners of those working within the new service model.</p>

  <p>A patient and carers reference group met several times during the review process. A patients&rsquo; representative was also invited onto the review steering group. Members of the public were also given the opportunity to comment on earlier drafts of the review report and revisions were made in light of their comments. Two conferences were held which allowed practitioners and invited members of the public to inform the draft model. A section of the Scottish Executive website outlining the review also gave people the chance to submit comments electronically.</p>

  <p>There is a statutory disregard of the first &pound;10 of a war pension in the assessment, by local authorities, of eligibility for access to some local services. These include the charging for residential accommodation and the assessment of eligibility for housing and council tax benefits.</p>

  <p>There is also provision, under the housing and council tax benefits regulations, for local authorities to allow a further discretionary disregard at their own expense. This discretionary disregard is a matter for each individual local authority.</p>

  <p>There are no current plans to change the rules relating to the disregard of war pensions. Any plans to change the regulations relating to housing and council tax benefits would be a matter for the Department of Work and Pensions (DWP) as such benefits are reserved to the UK Government.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2007-01-23.46.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80077" speakername="Mr Tom McCabe" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-07/wa0123.htm#17">

  <p>For (a) and (d) I refer the member to the Scottish Executive Financial Partnerships Unit&rsquo;s website where the information can be found at <a href="http//: www.scotland.gov.uk/ppp" target="_blank">http//: www.scotland.gov.uk/ppp</a> . The initial cost of a PPP project has been interpreted as the capital value which is defined as &quot;the public sector procuring body&rsquo;s estimate of the capital value of the property the private sector purchases or creates for delivering services under a PFI contract.&quot;</p>

  <p>For (b) and (c) I refer the member to the following table A for the information requested from 1999-2000 to 2005-06. I refer the member to the answer to question S2W-28685, on 18 October 2006, for the information requested from 2006-07 to 2030-31, and the answer to question S2W-30414 on 19 December 2006, for the information requested from 2031-32 to 2040-41. All answers to written parliamentary questions are available on the Parliament&rsquo;s website, the search facility for which can be found at <a href="../../../webapp/wa.search">http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/webapp/wa.search</a>. I also refer the member to the following table B for the information requested as two further projects have just recently reached financial close.</p>

  <p>The unitary charge is the amount paid by the public sector procuring body to the private sector consortium for the services it provides over the length of the contract. The services include capital construction, lifecycle maintenance and facilities management, and not just the upfront construction cost of the asset.</p>

  <p>For (e), the assets that are improved or created in a PFI/PPP contract are returned to the public sector at the end of the contract period which is typically up to 30 years. PFI/PPP contracts put the onus on the contractor during the term of the contract to maintain the asset properly so that when the asset does revert to the public sector there is no significant maintenance required for up to five years thereafter.</p>

  <p>For (f), there are three PFI/PPP contracts that the Executive has entered into and which are operational, these are the M6 DBFO, the M77/GSO and HMP Kilmarnock. For HMP Kilmarnock, no additional charges have been made. For the M6 DBFO, the additional charges made after the Agreement was signed were &pound;1,833,797 for new works and &pound;29,872 for operations and maintenance. For the M77/GSO an additional one-off charge of &pound;395,000 was made to the Concessionaire and is a reconciliation of both Company changes, East Renfrewshire Council (Employer) changes and the sharing of Value for Money initiatives permitted under the agreement during the New Works phase of the agreement.</p>

  <p>There are provisions within the contract for changes to be made in accordance with prescribed change procedures. Information on any additional charges made by other PFI/PPP contracts is not collected by the Executive as it is the responsibility of the relevant public sector procuring body.</p>

  <p>This information is not routinely collected. Local authorities, as public sector procuring bodies, are required to demonstrate that the PPP projects they are undertaking represent value for money as compared to a conventional procurement approach. They are also bound by the duty of Best Value as stated in the Local Government in Scotland Act (2003). Section 74 of the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1973 allows for disposal of land at less than market value but only in specific circumstances.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what efficiency savings Scottish Water made in (a) 2004-05 and (b) 2005-06 and what these savings were used to fund, broken down into (a) Scottish Water-related projects, (b) other Executive projects and (c) projects undertaken by other Executive agencies.</p>

  <p>The responsibility for assessing the efficiencies delivered by Scottish Water lies with the Water Industry Commission. In its <em>Cost and Performance Report 2003-06</em> , it calculated that for the last four-year regulatory period 2002-06, Scottish Water delivered nearly &pound;1 billion of efficiency savings. This is a record for the UK water industry.</p>

  <p>These savings have been passed through to customers in the form of lower charges. Over the four years, average household bills were in total &pound;211 lower than they would otherwise have been. Looking to the future, these efficiency gains mean that customers will pay the lowest overall reasonable cost for the services they receive.</p>

  <p>Further details of the efficiency savings can be sought from the Water Industry Commission and its <em>Cost and performance report 2003-06</em> at:</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, under the proposed UK Statistics and Registration Services Bill, what the position of the Chief Statistician for Scotland will be in relation to (a) Scottish ministers, (b) the National Statistician and (c) the proposed statistics board and to which organisation or individual the Chief Statistician for Scotland will be responsible.</p>

  <p>Subject to the passage of the necessary legislative consent motion (LCM), the Statistics and Registration Service Bill will give the Statistics Board a role in setting and monitoring the standards of Scottish statistics.</p>

  <p>If the LCM is passed, the chief statistician in the Scottish Executive will be accountable to Scottish ministers as he is now.</p>

  <p>In accordance with the current National Statistics Framework, the chief statistician is professionally accountable to the national statistician.</p>

  <p>The bill does not set out the position of the national statistician or the board in relation to chief statisticians of the devolved administrations or the head of professions of UK government departments. The framework, which currently outlines roles and responsibilities, will be reviewed.</p>
