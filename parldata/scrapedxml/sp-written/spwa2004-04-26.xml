  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive which ports operating ferry services have adequate disabled access; whether there are any plans to address any lack of adequate disabled access to ports and, if so, when these will be implemented; who will meet the cost of any upgrade or enlargements, and what information it has on what action will be taken against any service not offering adequate facilities.</p>

  <p>Passenger terminals and public buildings at ferry ports are covered by Part III of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA). The DDA is a reserved matter. Part III of the act deals with access to goods, facilities and services and imposes specific duties on service providers. These duties have been introduced incrementally since 1996, with the remainder to come into force by October 2004. Transport infrastructure, including ports, is already covered by these provisions.</p>

  <p>As the duty will be placed on the harbour authority to comply with the law, any costs incurred in so doing should be met by the harbour authority. Any claim of discrimination under part III of the DDA would ultimately be a matter for the courts.</p>

  <p>Drugs education, in line with national guidelines, is already available in 94% of Scottish schools.

  <p>We published on 5 April our consultation <em>Family Matters: Improving Family Law in Scotland</em>.

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-7013 by Mr Jim Wallace on 29 March 2004, what additional support and funding has been awarded to further and higher education institutions that offer support and training for students with mental health conditions.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2004-04-26.S2W-7343.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80123" speakername="Mr Jim Wallace" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-04/wa0426.htm#5">

  <p>The information is not held centrally in the form requested.</p>

  <p>The measure of student activity used to inform the core funding provided to colleges by the Scottish Further Education Funding Council is weighted to take account of students with special educational needs. This can either be in the case of programmes specifically designed for such students or students on &quot;mainstream&quot; courses who require additional support to access the course. These weightings can be applied to students experiencing difficulties in learning associated with mental health problems.</p>

  <p>Colleges can also offer additional support towards study and travel-related expenses to a disabled student who, by virtue of their disability, is obliged to incur additional expenditure arising from their attendance at college. This additional support can be offered to students with mental health difficulties.</p>

  <p>Through Beattie funding we support a programme of staff training activities, provided through the Scottish Further Education Unit, for the further education sector to raise awareness and understanding of student mental health issues. So far, two days of training have been assigned within the full programme to explore these issues.</p>

  <p>In higher education institutions, the Disabled Students&#8217; Premium is allocated on the basis of the number of students in the institution receiving the Disabled Students Allowance. The Disabled Students&#8217; Premium was introduced to assist institutions with the additional costs incurred in providing additional materials and services for disabled students.</p>

  <p>Notes:</p>

  <p>1. This information was extracted from the SMR01 linked data set maintained by ISD Scotland. SMR01 records (Scottish Morbidity Records) record all in-patient and day case discharges from non-obstetric and non-psychiatric specialties in NHS Hospitals in Scotland. Probability matching methods have been used to link together individual hospital records for each patient, thereby creating &quot;linked&quot; patient histories.</p>

  <p>2. An FCE is defined as a period of patient care under one consultant in one health care provider. The figures do not represent the number of patients, as one person may have several episodes within the year.</p>

  <p>3. FCEs have been estimated from the SMR01 linked data. Where two or more SMR01 episodes that follow directly from each other without a break are coded with the same consultant, they are counted as one FCE. This may not exactly match the English definition if there is a transfer to another hospital under the same consultant as it will be counted as one FCE.</p>

  <p>4. In this particular analysis, the specialties of orthodontics and paediatric dentistry, oral surgery and oral medicine, restorative dentistry, convalescence, spinal paralysis, surgical paediatrics, medical paediatrics, special care baby unit, geriatric assessment, geriatric long-stay and young chronic sick have been excluded in order to show figures that are most easily compared with English FCE figures.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive Health Department does not maintain a central record of all health care pilot schemes. The following table sets out a list of pilot schemes which the department is aware of and which it has initiated since 1999.

  <p>I issued revised guidance to the NHS on hospital car park charging on 1 April 2004.</p>

  <p>The guidance states that car park charging should not be introduced as a means of generating income but charging may be justified if it is to cover any significant costs in providing or improving parking facilities such as maintenance, administration and security costs. Charging might also be justified if it is used to better manage car parking facilities by discouraging unauthorised users (e.g. fly-parkers) although in so doing, measures taken to discourage unauthorised users must not be detrimental to the car parking arrangements for staff, patients and visitors. Widespread charging of excessive rates to staff, patients or visitors cannot be justified.</p>

  <p>The guidance covers all hospitals in Scotland, although legal restraints covering the NHS mean that it cannot be applied to existing contracts, such as that at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh (RIE) between Lothian NHS Board and Consort Healthcare Ltd. It will, however, cover all such contracts when they are revised or renewed.</p>

  <p>Brian Cavanagh, Chairman of Lothian NHS Board has indicated that he has already raised the issue of car parking charges at RIE with Consort Healthcare as he recognises its importance for staff, patients and their families. Mr Cavanagh wishes to ensure that it is an issue NHS Lothian can positively address as part of the refinancing discussions with Consort Healthcare due to take place later this year on the funding arrangements at RIE.</p>

  <p>Lothian NHS Board has negotiated concessionary rates at the hospital for members of staff, visitors who have to remain on site for considerable lengths of time and for patients who have to make numerous, repeat visits.</p>

  <p>Emissions savings from wind power will vary depending upon the fuel that is displaced - displacement of coal will result in higher emission savings than displacement of gas. The most recently published data shows that wind generation in Scotland in 2002 accounted for 450 GigaWatt hours (GWh). This level of output could reduce carbon emissions by between 45,000 and 90,000 tonnes.</p>

  <p><em>Reduce, Rehabilitate, Reform</em> , the Scottish Executive&#8217;s consultation on reducing reoffending, is inviting views on how we can improve the management of all categories of offenders &#8211; including sex offenders &#8211; in order to reduce their reoffending.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive is fully committed to reducing reoffending by sex offenders and is currently taking forward a number of initiatives:</p>

  <p>Delivery of sex offender treatment programmes in prison.</p>

  <p>Implementation of the 73 wide-ranging recommendations contained in the Report by the Expert Panel on Sex Offending, chaired by Lady Cosgrove.</p>

  <p>Strengthening of the throughcare service available to prisoners on release from prison back into the community. Throughcare provision for high risk and sex offenders will be considered as a priority.</p>

  <p>Improvements to the sex offenders register made by the Sexual Offences Act 2003, which comes into force on 1 May 2004.</p>

  <p>Any proposals in relation to sex offenders submitted in response to the reducing reoffending consultation will therefore be considered in the context of these on-going initiatives.</p>

  <p>Choose Life has commissioned research into suicide prevention and intervention from leading researchers throughout the world. Responses to date have come from 14 countries. We are also exchanging good practice and information with colleagues in Ireland, Slovenia, New Zealand and Finland. This will add to our knowledge and future strategic planning on suicide prevention in Scotland.</p>

  <p>ASIST (Applied Suicide Intervention Skills Training) will shortly be delivered in Scotland by experts form Canada and Australia. The Scottish trainees on the course will be joined by Norwegian colleagues. In addition, the visitors from Canada, who are internationally recognised World Health Organization experts on suicide prevention, will help review the Scottish approach to community development and training in the field of suicide prevention.</p>

  <p>Tartan Day offered Scottish ministers and members of the Parliamentary delegation an excellent opportunity to promote Scotland as a good place to visit, study in, live and do business with.</p>

  <p>The programme, co-ordinated and supported by the Scottish Executive, around Tartan Day 2004 was the most extensive yet with a range of events promoting both contemporary and traditional Scotland. These events included an Executive sponsored Scotland Run and Pavilion in Central Park which brought together 20 organisations showcasing some of the best of Scottish tourism, business, education and creative industries. Organisations involved included the Executive and the Scottish Parliament, VisitScotland, Scottish Development International, Universities, Glasgow and Edinburgh City Councils and Scottish Screen. In addition the Executive and Scottish Parliament co-hosted a reception for over 300 guests representing academic, political and business leaders from the New York area. The First Minister and I represented the Scottish Executive at these and other Tartan Day events including "Dressed to Kilt", promoting contemporary Scottish design, a reception at the British Embassy in Washington DC and the Icons of Scotland Awards dinner, co-sponsored by VisitScotland and Scotland magazine.</p>

  <p>Alongside these promotional events, key policy areas were successfully pursued. The First Minister gave a keynote address on "The New Scotland; Attracting Fresh Talent" at Columbia University as well as hosting a joint SDI/Forbes Magazine seminar promoting the excellence of Scotland's Financial Services. The First Minister visited Baltimore and met with Mayor O'Malley to discuss how that city has met the challenges that also face Scotland in attracting fresh talent to address population decline and increase economic regeneration. I spoke at a VisitScotland lunch for over 40 key media contacts to promote Scotland's growing global importance as a destination for business tourism as well as undertaking visits to learn more of the urban regeneration work being carried out in both New York and Washington as part of their business improvement districts. I also met with a number of US businesses already investing in Scotland and considering further expansion here.</p>

  <p>Good coverage of these events were secured in both the US print and broadcast media with the focus being on our Fresh Talent initiative. The programme of events undertaken this year and the very positive reaction from US businesses offer us an excellent platform to build on for 2005.</p>
