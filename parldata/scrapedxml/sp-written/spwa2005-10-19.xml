  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will report on the outcome of the Agriculture and Fisheries Council held in Brussels on 19 to 20 September 2005.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2005-10-19.2.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80032" speakername="Ross Finnie" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-05/wa1019.htm#1">

  <p>I attended the Agriculture and Fisheries Council in Brussels on 19 and 20 September 2005, together with Margaret Beckett, Ben Bradshaw and Jim Knight.</p>

  <p>Two Environment Council matters were included on the agenda in the absence of a meeting of Environment Ministers within the relevant deadlines. These were taken as &quot;B&quot; points at the request of Denmark. On the first, the Council was unable to act on the Commission&rsquo;s proposal on a GM maize authorisation due to the absence of a qualified majority in favour or against. On the second, however, the Council did adopt a Decision amending Annex II of Directive 2000/53/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on end-of-life vehicles.</p>

  <p>On Agriculture, Poland requested the Commission remove surplus cereal production from the Countries of Central Europe through the use of free market tenders rather than intervention storage. Austria suggested that the intervention criteria for grains be adjusted to respond to difficulties caused by bad weather this year. The Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary supported both requests. The Commission were aware of the serious situation and said they had made every effort within the rules to ease it.</p>

  <p>Italy, supported by France, Greece, Spain, Poland, Hungary, Cyprus and Portugal, drew the Commission&rsquo;s attention to the crises in its wine and fruit and vegetables markets, caused by drops in price. They asked for a further increase in the quantity of crisis distillation and called for the Commission to present its proposals on crisis management as soon as possible. The Agriculture Commissioner explained that they were considering options. They were planning a reform of the fresh and processed fruit and vegetables sectors for the second half of 2006.</p>

  <p>On wine, the Commissioner explained that the Management committee of 6 September had given a favourable opinion on the opening of crisis distillation for table wine in Italy. A reform of the wine CMO would be launched in 2006.</p>

  <p>The Czech Republic, supported by Poland, Lithuania, Latvia, Cyprus and Slovakia, requested a derogation from the CAP reform regulation which would allow them to make payments under the single area payment scheme (SAPS) earlier than 1 December. The Commission explained that there was no legal basis for an earlier payment date this year, unless in the case of an emergency.</p>

  <p>The Commissioner for Health and Consumer Protection gave an update on the situation on Avian Influenza in south East Asia and Russia and on the actions taken and planned.</p>

  <p>The Agriculture Commissioner provided the Council with an update on the state of play of the World Trade Organization Negotiations.</p>

  <p>On Fisheries, in a frontloading exercise ahead of December Council, ministers held an exchange of views on the Presidency discussion paper concerning the options and principles for enhancing stock recovery measures. Most member states stressed that decisions should only be taken on the basis of sound and updated science. However, there was a general opinion that closed areas would not be effective in helping cod recovery and that current management arrangements should be given the chance to work.</p>

  <p>Under any other business, the Commission gave a short presentation on methods being considered to help the industry with high fuel prices. The Commission was against subsidising vessels running costs, but did remind member states that money from the Financial Instrument for Fisheries Guidance could be used to give vessels tie up aid or subsidise the purchase of more fuel efficient gear. In the long-term many member states supported the use of more fuel efficient engines and renewable energy. Member states noted the presentation.</p>

  <p>Although the staff of the Crofters Commission are based mainly in Inverness, there are several staff based in outlying areas of the Crofting Counties. Many of the day-to-day functions of the Crofters Commission are carried out on behalf of the commission by the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department (SEERAD) staff in the area and sub&ndash;area offices throughout the Highlands and Islands. There are currently no plans to change these arrangements.</p>

  <p>It is expected that the management of the SEERAD unit based in Tiree (nine posts) will transfer to the Crofters Commission by the end of this year.</p>

  <p>Area Assessors act as a valuable resource of information to both the Crofters Commission and their local communities. Assessors are appointed to provide advice to the commission on policy development, local issues, assisting in the assessment of demand for crofts and monitoring levels of absenteeism. The role of the assessor is changing as the commission moves towards full non-departmental public body status.</p>

  <p>The intention is that the bill will empower the Crofters Commission to develop, in conjunction with crofting communities in different areas, policies to suit local circumstances in these areas and also empower it to apply these policies when making regulatory decisions in relation to these areas. Currently, the commission has a range of policies which inform its regulatory decisions for example in relation to absentee action, apportionments, decrofting of house sites and subletting but these are and must be applied consistently across the crofting counties and do not therefore always have regard to local needs and expectations.</p>

  <p>There is scope for developing area based policies in all parts of the crofting counties. It is intended that area based policies should be developed for discrete and identifiable geographic areas. The size of the area within which a particular set of area policies should apply ought to be determined by the crofting communities involved. A township is the smallest identifiable unit into which crofts are aggregated and is therefore the smallest possible unit for which it seems appropriate to devise specific policies. However, in practice, I would expect area policies to be devised and applied to much larger communities than single townships.</p>

  <p>Since the creation of the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman in September 2002, five cases handled by the Crofters Commission have been submitted for consideration by the Ombudsman. Three of these cases were closed by the Ombudsman after preliminary investigation. Two cases remain open and under investigation. As from 2004 these figures have been published in the Crofters Commission Annual Report.</p>
