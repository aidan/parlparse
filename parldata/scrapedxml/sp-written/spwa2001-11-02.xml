  <p>Earlier this year, the Scottish Executive commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers, and a firm of quantity surveyors, to undertake a national survey of physical standards in existing residential and nursing homes in Scotland. We also consulted on proposed draft physical standards.</p>

  <p>As a result of this work, the period within which existing providers should offer single rooms to those people who want them was extended from 2003 to 2007. We also made the installation of en-suite facilities in existing homes optional. These changes should enable existing providers to meet the new physical standards at minimal cost.</p>

  <p>the level of recorded landings of white fish (cod, haddock, whiting and hake), nephrops and scallops by the vessel concerned during 1999 and 2000;</p>

  <p>Employment policy is reserved to the UK Government which takes the lead on funding and delivery of the New Deal. In Scotland it does this in partnership with the Scottish Executive and contributing organisations.</p>

  <p>Rural Stewardship Scheme payments for the 2001-02 and 2002-03 financial years will be funded from modulation of Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) payments in respect of 2001 and 2002 respectively. Since it is too early to know the total CAP payments for these years, the funding available for RSS cannot be established yet.</p>
