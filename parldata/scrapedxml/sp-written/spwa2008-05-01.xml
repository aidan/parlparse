  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to halting the loss of Scotland&rsquo;s biodiversity by 2010. It will continue to work in partnership with Scottish Natural Heritage, Forestry Commission Scotland and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and with non-government organisations to achieve this. In the case of the public agencies, this will be funded through existing programmes and resources as determined by the Spending Review. Although there are pressures for funding under the Scotland Rural Development Programme 2007-13 we are confident that biodiversity objectives will be met within the overall budget of some &pound;1.6 billion.</p>

  <p>The additional power arising from the proposed delegation of listed building consent will allow local authorities to issue such consents without formally notifying Historic Scotland.</p>

  <p>Currently local authorities must notify Historic Scotland on behalf of ministers where they are minded to grant listed building consent. This can cause delays in the issuing of such consents as notification occurs only when the local authority have reached a view. This requirement arises from the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) (Scotland) Act 1997.Under the proposed agreements, local authorities would not have to undertake formal notification for certain works to category B listed buildings, but would instead be able to issue a consent immediately upon reaching a view. This change has been made possible by section 55(2) of the Planning etc (Scotland) Act 2006.The scope of the scheme of delegation will be subject to agreement with each local authority and may vary dependent upon the resources and expertise available locally.</p>

  <p>All 32 local authorities in Scotland have submitted draft single outcome agreements (SOAs) that set out how they will contribute to the agreed national outcomes in relation to education provision. Those drafts are currently the subject of discussion. We aim to complete the process of finalising all the agreements for 2008-09 by 30 June. Subject to agreement with the authorities, all the finalised SOAs will be made publicly available shortly thereafter.</p>

  <p>Through our historic concordat with COSLA we have moved to an outcomes-focussed approach which empowers local authorities and provides consolidated block grants rather than ring-fenced funding. This will give councils flexibility to allocate resources to meet need and the agreed national outcomes in the concordat underpinned by the agreed national indicators. Outdoor education and learning is relevant to many of the national outcomes and indicators, including our aspiration for all our young people to be successful learners, confident individuals, effective contributors and responsible citizens.</p>

  <p>Local authorities have also committed to developing and delivering Curriculum for Excellence as part of the concordat. This will require schools to explore creative use of both indoor and outdoor learning environments to ensure exciting, engaging and relevant teaching and this will be reflected in the new framework for Learning and Teaching &ndash; Building the Curriculum 3 that the Scottish Government will publish in early June.</p>

  <p>No target has been set to increase the proportion of wealth earned by the six lowest income deciles. The Government Economic Strategy does however contain the Solidarity Target, which is to increase overall income, and the proportion of income earned by the three lowest income deciles as a group by 2017. It is important to note that this includes all those experiencing relative poverty in Scotland. The Scottish Government&rsquo;s Anti-Poverty Framework will set out later this year how we intend to deliver the Solidarity Target.</p>

  <p>This is the first government to set a stretching national target to reduce income inequality in Scotland while at the same time making us wealthier per person. The Government Economic Strategy provides the strategic framework to achieve this target.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government has not set a timescale for the provision of two hours good quality PE for each child every week. As part of Curriculum for Excellence, we expect schools to continue to work towards the provision of two hours good quality PE for each child every week. This commitment will be reflected in <em>Health and Wellbeing: planning for the experiences and outcomes</em> and <em>Building the Curriculum 3: A framework for learning and teaching</em> .</p>

  <p>The concordat with local government means that local authorities and schools will decide the best way of achieving the experiences and outcomes in a way that meets local needs and circumstances.</p>

  <p>The intention of the new relationship with local government is to move away from ring fenced funding. The settlement for each local authority is intended as a single budget which provides authorities with the flexibility to reach decisions on where money should be spent to achieve agreed outcomes.</p>

  <p>Since local authorities have committed to developing and delivering curriculum for excellence we expect schools to continue to regard working towards the provision of two hours PE as a priority.</p>

  <p>The experience of the last franchise re-letting process is that a four-year lead time is required to allow for effective consultation and for any significant changes in the basis of the franchise contract.</p>

  <p>Activating the extension clause in the current franchise agreement has therefore given this administration the scope to consider and consult upon what changes it might wish to make to the structure of future rail franchising arrangements, whilst guaranteeing continuity of train service planning and delivery during the introduction of the existing programme of rail enhancements and for the Commonwealth Games in 2014.</p>

  <p>Through the franchise extension we have created a cap on the operator&rsquo;s profits: where the profit of the franchise reaches more than &pound;30 million per annum in 2007-08 prices, 50% of the marginal profit is returned to government for investment in services.</p>

  <p>The total number of passenger miles travelled by train each year since 1945 is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>However, table 1 shows the number of passenger miles travelled on First ScotRail services since 1996 onwards, which accounts for 96 per cent of the Scottish rail network. Table 2 shows the total number of passenger journeys originating in Scotland from 1960 onwards.</p>

  <p>It is not the Scottish Government&rsquo;s policy to set targets for capacity from individual renewable energy technologies. However, a resource study in 2001 found that there is enough potential capacity from wave and tidal energy around Scotland&rsquo;s coastline to meet our demand for electricity several times over. This suggests that marine energy can make a significant contribution towards achieving our renewables targets and we are working to help the sector maximise that contribution in as short a time frame as possible.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government aims to maximise the contribution of marine energy firstly through long-term market support, such as via the Renewables Obligation (Scotland).</p>

  <p>Our &pound;13 million Wave and Tidal Energy Support Scheme will help the development of a number of wave and tidal projects, and we will continue to support the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney.</p>

  <p>We will work to address major strategic issues, such as the provision, availability and affordability of grid capacity and subsea links both within and beyond the UK.</p>

  <p>We have set out plans to establish a Marine Energy Policy Group, which will lead on actions relating to further environmental research, monitoring and the production of locational guidance for the marine renewables sector.</p>

  <p>We will also continue our close dialogue with marine energy developers and key stakeholders to ensure that relevant issues are addressed as they arise and that our goals are being pursued in a sensible, joined-up manner.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is encouraging the development of expertise in the marine energy sector in a number of ways.</p>

  <p>We continue to support activities at and improvements to the European Marine Energy Centre in Orkney, including work to develop internationally recognised standards and certification for marine devices.</p>

  <p>In addition to the Scottish Government&rsquo;s &pound;13 million Wave and Tidal Energy Support Scheme, Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s Proof of Concept programme supports development activities at Scotland&rsquo;s universities and research institutes. This includes recent support for a pioneering tidal turbine technology being developed at the University of Strathclyde. Support for marine developers is also available through Scottish Enterprise&rsquo;s Marine Collaboration Fund, which aims to reduce development costs and improve device performance by accessing advice from other relevant sectors.</p>

  <p>Through Scottish Enterprise we are undertaking mapping and analysis of the marine energy sector, including databases for research and development activity and manufacturing, and supply chain mapping to highlight the current strengths and weaknesses in the supply chain.</p>

  <p>The Marine Energy Policy Group will lead on producing strategic locational guidance to identify the most appropriate areas for early developments.</p>

  <p>The development of individual marine energy projects will enable the involvement of and input from local communities via the relevant consents process. We believe that communities should be able to invest in and benefit meaningfully from renewables projects in their areas. This is an issue for renewables more generally, and one which the Scottish Government is exploring closely, including the preparation of guidance which will help communities to gain maximum benefit from renewables projects.</p>

However, the recently published report from Scottish Natural Heritage <em>The distribution of Mountain Hare (Lepus Timidus) in Scotland (2006-2007)</em> estimated that 5,078 mountain hares were killed by snaring between January 2006 and February 2007. Scottish ministers take the view that the snaring of mountain hares is an offence unless it is done under the terms of a licence. This view has not however been tested in the courts.</p>

  <p>The recently published document by Scottish Natural Heritage called <em>The distribution of Mountain Hare (Lepus Timidus) in Scotland (2006-2007)</em> considered, amongst other issues, the implications of large scale culling of mountain hares. The Scottish Government also seeks advice from Scottish Natural Heritage on a case by case basis when a licence is sought to take mountain hares.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government recognises that it is highly unlikely that louping ill can be completely eradicated. However, a ministerial working group with representation from a wide range of key stakeholder interests, has been set up to look at ways of controlling ticks and the problems which they can create which include the spread of louping ill. The group will assess the scale of the problem and consider possible solutions.</p>

  <p>Good field craft should minimise the risk of any accidental capture of Scottish wildcats. Should any Scottish wildcat be accidentally caught in a legally compliant snare operated in accordance with industry best practice guidelines, the land manager should be able to release the captured animal unharmed.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, in view of the policy that a landowner or manager convicted of a wildlife crime may be subject to a reduction in agricultural subsidy grant, whether the illegal snaring of protected species such as otter or mountain hare would attract that penalty.</p>

  <p>Under the Cross Compliance regime, land managers must not deliberately or recklessly capture, injure or kill any European Protected Species as provided for by Regulation 39 of the (Natural Habitats, &amp; c.) Regulations 1994, as amended by the Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp; c.) Amendment (Scotland) Regulations 2007. Schedule 2 of the same legislation provides a list the European Protected Species, including the common otter. In addition, a land manager must not use any methods listed in Regulation 41, paragraphs (3) to (5) of the same legislation, for the purpose of taking or killing any species listed in Schedule 3, including the mountain hare. Scottish ministers take the view that the use of snares would fall within one of the methods specifically prohibited and that a licence under the 1994 Regulations would be required. However, this view has not been tested in the courts.</p>

  <p>Cross Compliance dependant support scheme payments could be reduced if it is established that a land manager is responsible for a negligent or intentional act or omission leading to the deliberate or reckless capture injure or kill any European Protected Species (including the common otter) or the use of a prohibited method to take or killing any species listed in Schedule 3 (including the mountain hare) without a licence.</p>
