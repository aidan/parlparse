  <p>It is not possible to give an absolute time period because each case depends on its own facts and circumstances.</p>

  <p>If large numbers of anthrax spores or bacilli are present then a sample might be reported provisionally as being positive within a few hours, with confirmation in around one day. Samples not assessed provisionally as being positive need to be cultured for a period of around one week to allow any bacilli present to reach a detectable level.</p>

  <p>Prevention of infection in care homes is a result of good management, provision of up-to-date infection control policies and procedures which are readily available to all staff, education of new staff at induction and on-going education to existing staff, and monitoring and audit, with actions taken to remedy any deficiencies.</p>

  <p>The Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001, its associated regulations and the National Care Standards against which the Care Commission regulates care homes, require providers to have appropriate procedures in place for the control of infection and management of clinical waste. Staff working in care homes are required to be appropriately trained and qualified for the jobs they do. The hygiene and infection control triggers used by the Care Commission Officers when inspecting adult care homes cover a range of areas, including evidence of staff training and knowledge of hygiene, infection control and waste disposal issues.</p>

  <p>The commission inspects care homes at least twice a year. Where there are concerns, the Care Commission has the power to put recommendations and/or requirements on a care service to ensure any issues are addressed.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission employs a Professional Adviser on hygiene and infection control who provides information and education to Care Commission Officers to assist them in their regulatory role of registration, inspection, complaint investigation and enforcement. Officers are then able to update service providers as necessary during inspections.</p>

  <p>Based on the findings in its <em>Review of Cleanliness, Hygiene and Infection Control in Care Homes for Older People,</em> published in 2005, the Care Commission has collaborated with NHS Education Scotland in an infection control study day to assist service providers in their efforts to improve infection control within their services. This was complemented by infection control workshops at the Royal College of Nursing study day for care homes in May 2006. Further workshops have been planned for a future study day at Heriot Watt University.</p>

  <p>The Healthcare Associated Infection Task Force, set up by ministers in 2003, was influential in opening up the &quot;Cleanliness Champions&quot; training, initially developed for the NHS, to the independent sector, including care homes. This education programme developed by NHS Education Scotland is available to the independent and voluntary sector at Scott College in Dumbarton.</p>

  <p>In 2005, the Scottish Executive published infection control best practice standards for adult care homes. These standards underpin the regulatory requirement for care services to have appropriate procedures in place for infection control.</p>

  <p>Good nutritional practices in care homes are a result of good management, up-to-date policies and procedures which are readily available to all staff, education of new staff at induction and on-going education to existing staff, and monitoring and audit, with actions taken to remedy any deficiencies.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission, as the national regulator of care services in Scotland, is required to take account of the National Care Standards (NCS), published by Scottish ministers in carrying out its regulatory functions. The NCS for Care Homes for Older People cover a range of important issues including nutrition and monitoring the liquid intake of residents. Care home staff are expected to monitor residents&rsquo; food and drink intake and, where there are concerns, take advice from appropriate professionals, such as a dietician or GP. The commission inspects care homes at least twice a year and has the power to put recommendations and/or requirements on a care service to ensure that any issues of concern are addressed.</p>

  <p>Improving nutrition in care homes for older people is one of the commission&rsquo;s inspection themes for 2006-07. The findings will be reported nationally. The triggers used by Care Commission Officers for nutrition when inspecting care homes cover a range of areas including evidence of a food and nutrition policy; evidence of residents&rsquo; meal preferences being met; evidence that fluid needs are being met, and evidence of staff training and knowledge of nutritional issues.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission employs a Professional Adviser on nutrition who provides information and education to Care Commission Officers to assist them in their regulatory role of registration, inspection, complaint investigation and enforcement. Officers are then able to update service providers as necessary during inspections.</p>

  <p>In addition, the Scottish Executive provided funding to support the recent appointment by the Care Commission of a Nurse Consultant for Care Homes. Part of her role will be to create a learning network for staff in care homes. one project will focus on nutrition, and the commission&rsquo;s nutrition adviser and its dieticians network for care homes will work together on this initiative.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it considers that treating liability insurance as remuneration in kind in respect of charity trustees will encourage or discourage individuals to take up such positions and whether it will consider introducing amending legislation to remove the interpretation of liability insurance as a benefit in kind to charity trustees.</p>

  <p>As I explained in my answer to question on 28 August 2006, the Scottish Executive is aware of the concerns of the voluntary sector that the restrictions on the provision of trustee indemnity insurance from charity funds (by treating it as remuneration in kind) under the Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Act 2005 may deter potential trustees from taking up such position with Scottish charities.</p>

  <p>Through our reform of charity law we are committed to establishing a properly regulated and supported charity sector. In doing this we will take measures, legislative or otherwise, to address any constraints on the sector which may hamper the achievement of this commitment. We recognise that the current treatment of trustee indemnity insurance is proving problematic and we have therefore been actively working through the options available for addressing the issue. I am hopeful of being able to confirm how we will be taking this matter forward very shortly, at which point I will ensure Mr Martin is provided with the relevant details.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what information it has on whether the implementation of the recommendations of Sir David Henshaw&rsquo;s report, <em>Recovering child support: routes to responsibility</em> , will require separate Scottish legislation and, if so, whether this will be addressed through an act of the Scottish Parliament or by means of a legislative consent memorandum.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2006-09-19.9.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80046" speakername="Hugh Henry" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-06/wa0919.htm#4">

  <p>Sir David Henshaw&rsquo;s report was published in July 2006 together with the UK Government&rsquo;s response, <em>A fresh start: child support redesign-the Government&rsquo;s response to Sir David Henshaw</em> . The response takes the form of a consultation document, seeking views on the wide range of issues raised. It acknowledges that any proposed legislative changes within devolved competence would be for the Scottish Parliament. A white paper will be published in the autumn.</p>

  <p>Scottish ministers welcome the focus in the consultation paper on child welfare and on reducing child poverty. Executive officials are discussing with the Department for Work and Pensions the possible implications of the redesign of the child support agency for devolved responsibilities, in areas such as child poverty, birth registration policy, the role of the courts, and provision of family support services.</p>

  <p>The core local government finance settlement includes provision for the salaries and wages paid by local authorities. The settlement is largely unhypothecated and it is for councils themselves to determine how they spend this in line with local needs and priorities. The pay and conditions of local government staff are matters for local authorities who have an obligation, like other employers, to ensure that they comply with all employment legislation.</p>

  <p>By the end of the current spending review period the core local government finance settlement will have increased by over &pound;3 billion compared with 1999-2000, an increase of 55%. While the Executive&rsquo;s overall spending plans in the period up to 2007-08 have been announced, we have said that within the overall total we remain prepared to look again at the funding for local government for 2007-08, and that remains the position.</p>

The Commission published Decision 2006/578 on 24 August which allows for the placing on the market of long grain rice products from the US only when an analytical report, from an accredited laboratory, accompanying the consignment demonstrates that the product does not contain LL RICE 601. In the absence of such an analytical report, the importer shall have the products tested to demonstrate they do not contain LL RICE 601. These measures have been put in place throughout the UK and all other member states. Member states will take appropriate measures, including random sampling and analysis, to verify the absence of LL RICE 601 in products referred to in Article 1 of the Decision which are already on the market.</p>

  <p>Information on the actual numbers not connected to mains electricity is not held centrally.</p>

  <p>The Scottish House Condition Survey, which measures house condition for a sample of occupied dwellings, identifies occupied dwellings in the sample not connected to electric mains. Of the sample of 15,000 occupied dwellings surveyed in 2002, three dwellings did not have a connection to the mains electricity supply. This number is too small to provide a reliable estimate of the total number of dwellings in Scotland or in each local authority area without a mains electricity supply.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive, further to the answer to question S2W-26055 by Cathy Jamieson on 1 June 2006, whether the rate of conviction for rape for cases proceeding to court in 2002-03 was 63.8%, as identified in the answer, or 26%, as identified in Review of the Investigation and Prosecution of Sexual Offences in Scotland, published by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service (COPFS) in June 2006.</p>

  <p>The two figures referred to are not directly comparable as they are based on different analyses of two different sets of information.</p>

  <p>The conviction rate of 26% published in the <em>Review of the Investigation and Prosecution of Sexual Offences in Scotland</em> report derives from an analysis of prosecution case papers carried out by COPFS as part of its review of the way in which serious sexual offences are investigated and prosecuted. The conviction rate of 26% is a percentage of all cases indicted with a charge of rape in the financial year 2002-03 which resulted in a conviction. This figure is confined to cases where the victim was an adult, in which there is the additional challenge of proving that the victim did not consent to sexual intercourse.</p>

  <p>The conviction rate of 63.8% derived from figures given in reply to S2W-26055 is based on data extracted from the Scottish Executive Justice Department court proceedings database. It expresses, as a percentage of the total number of proceedings concluded in financial year 2002-03 with rape as the final main offence recorded, those where the charge was proved. Cases initially prosecuted on a charge of rape but which result in a conviction for some alternative charge are not included. Unlike the figures produced as part of the <em>Review of the Investigation and Prosecution of Sexual Offences in Scotland</em>, the total number of cases used in calculating this percentage does not include cases where it was ruled there was no case to answer or where the prosecutor withdrew the charges. The court proceedings statistics for a particular year will exclude the outcome of proceedings which had not been recorded on the Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) criminal history system at the point at which the analysis file for that year was created. Recording delays at SCRO in previous years can mean that some disposals, particularly in relation to acquittals in the High Court, are missing from the court proceedings database.</p>

  <p>Note: <strong>*</strong>Spend from financial year 2000-01 is given on an accruals basis</p>

  <p>RSA is paid in instalments, sometimes over several years and only as specific job and capital expenditure targets are met. Not all projects will proceed, and nor do all accepted offers result in full payment of RSA grant, as projects are sometimes scaled down or abandoned before payments are made. The amount of RSA paid, shown above, will therefore include payments in relation to offers that were accepted in previous financial years. Grant recoveries are, for the most part, in relation to amounts paid out in earlier years.</p>

  <p>We do not hold specific records of companies that have gone into administration, ceased trading or relocated outside Scotland after receiving RSA. However, grant recoveries and write-offs result from non compliance with the conditions in the RSA grant agreement. Some of the reasons for this will be because businesses have gone into administration or ceased operations.</p>

  <p>Ministers have specified the objectives Scottish Water must deliver in the Directions issued on 28 September 2005. In January 2006, Scottish Water accepted the Water Industry Commission for Scotland determination of resources as sufficient to deliver these requirements. Should the sewage sludge strategy give rise to a requirement for additional resources, this would, in the first instance, be a matter for Scottish Water to discuss with its economic regulator, the Water Industry Commission for Scotland, through the agreed procedures detailed in the final determination.</p>

  <p>The timetable for implementing Scottish Water&rsquo;s sewage sludge strategy is an operational matter for Scottish Water. I understand that Scottish Water is reviewing the comments received following the Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA) consultative exercise which was carried out in support of its Sludge Strategy, and is considering amendments to the strategy and the SEA in the light of those comments. I will ask the Chief Executive to respond directly to you.</p>
