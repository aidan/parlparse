  <p>16 of the 23 Red Tape Review recommendations have now been implemented in full. These are recommendations 1-3, 6-12, and 15-21, and they include the establishment of an independent appeals mechanism, improvements in inspections and important developments on communication with producers.</p>

  <p>The remaining seven are all in progress, and require longer-term action. The roll-out of Electronic Service Delivery (recommendation 2) for submission of scheme applications is now well underway, with a forward timetable publicised along with the External Communications Strategy. Recommendation 13 has been raised at EU level. It is mostly concerned with the simplification of the CAP, and is being discussed in the relevant EC working groups. Some of the elements of Recommendation 14, which deal mainly with specific Scheme operational or policy rules, have been implemented and others are under active consideration. The remaining four (namely 4, 5, 22 and 23) are also being actively progressed with further progress expected this autumn. These recommendations concern moving to a map based Field Data Sheet, integrating IACS further with the agricultural census, and producing guidance notes on specific situations.</p>

  <p>The recent independent review of the Business Birth Rate Strategy (BBRS) by the Fraser of Allander Institute indicates that the BBRS has had a positive effect, if not as much as was originally hoped. The report recognises that there have been improvements in many areas consistent with a positive contribution from the BBRS including, inter alia, raising interest and acceptance of entrepreneurship, access to finance and improved business support. We are of course reviewing the Strategy and will look to make such improvements as are considered necessary for the future.</p>

  <p>At my request, Scottish Homes has again increased provisions in rural areas, from &#163;45.1 million last year to &#163;49.5 million in 2001-02. These resources, which are spread across Scottish Homes&#8217; regions, are being made available for the provision of affordable rented housing by social landlords. We are not convinced that the resources available would be better targeted through private landlords. However, if it appears appropriate in the local circumstances, Scottish Homes can consider and make recommendations to ministers to support such projects. In addition, when development funding passes to local authorities, they will also be open to consider and suggest such alternative approaches.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive maintains a website www.scotland.gov.uk/transport/stgpf on the matter of the Scottish Transport Group Pensions scheme and will update the information contained on its website when there are any substantial developments to report. In addition, when the Scottish Parliament has agreed proposals for the making of ex-gratia payments to members of the Scottish Transport Group Pension Schemes details will be published in national newspapers.</p>

  <p>Ash from incinerators is defined as controlled waste and therefore subject to Part II of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. As a result, the storage, treatment, disposal and transportation of both bottom ash and fly ash are strictly controlled to ensure that they do not cause a risk to the environment or human health. In addition, fly ash is classified as special waste under the Special Waste Regulations 1996. The disposal of special waste is carried out under strict conditions under the waste management regime which requires the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to be notified using consignment notes prior to all movements of the waste.</p>
