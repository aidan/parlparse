  <p>The key aim of Curriculum for Excellence is to help prepare all young people in Scotland to take their place in a modern society and economy by delivering opportunities to develop skills for life and skills for work. This includes options for young people to explore a range of issues and to participate in practical activities relating to particular sectors, including food and health.</p>

  <p>As part of this investment in vocational learning opportunities, Skills for Work qualifications have been developed to encourage young people to develop knowledge and skills which will be important for employment and for life in general, and to provide a variety of practical experiences linked to particular careers. Hospitality Intermediate Levels 1 and 2 are two examples which offer specific vocational skills and experience of the food and drink sector. Such learning is often delivered in partnership with other providers, including colleges.</p>

  <p>There is on-going engagement between Improve, the Sector Skills Council for the Food and Drink Industry, the careers arm of Skills Development Scotland and the Determined to Succeed teams to increase awareness of the food and drink sector and the career opportunities available within it.</p>

  <p>At present, local authorities can extend fostering placements to age 18 and beyond if it is in the best interests of the young person in foster care and with the agreement of the foster carer.</p>

  <p>We will support local authorities to do this through issuing guidance along with forthcoming revised Looked After Children (Scotland) regulations.</p>

  <p>We continue to support the payment of allowances based on The Fostering Network&rsquo;s recommended rate of allowance. It is however up to individual local authorities to decide on an appropriate rate of allowance based on their local need and priorities.</p>

  <p>One of the commitments within our historic concordat with COSLA is to pay approved kinship carers of looked after children a weekly allowance, at the same rate as the local authority&rsquo;s foster carers. Progress against each of the commitments in the concordat will be reported annually by COSLA at the end of each financial year.</p>

  <p>Where a &quot;looked after&quot; child is already living with a kinship carer and the local authority is satisfied that its approval process and the current arrangements for the child are satisfactory, the authority may already be in a position to pay allowances equivalent to those to paid foster carers. This is a decision for each local authority.</p>

  <p>The Getting it Right for Every Child in Kinship and Foster Care reference group will be producing guidance on the assessment and approval process for kinship carers of &quot;looked after&quot; children in the late summer.</p>

  <p>As stated in <em>Getting it Right for Every Child in Kinship and Foster Care</em> , the appropriate placement limit depends on the circumstances of the individual carer. The Looked After Children (Scotland) regulations will require a fostering panel to approve the maximum number of children that a foster carer may have in their care at any one time.</p>

  <p>We will issue guidance to support the updated Looked After Children (Scotland) regulations, which will be brought before Parliament later this year.</p>

  <p>The Care Commission regulates all children's social care services, including fostering and adoption services. The Care Commission will inspect local authority fostering services and monitor compliance with the regulations.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what information it has on average household expenditure on (a) gas and (b) electricity bills in each year since 1960.</p>

  <p>The Scottish House Condition Survey (SCHS) provides survey estimates of household gas and electricity expenditure for the years 1996, 2002, 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06.</p>

  <p>The Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) provides data for Scotland going back to 1990 for gas and electricity expenditure but only broken down by payment method &ndash; with no total. <a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/energy/statistics/publications/prices/tables/page18125.html" target="_blank">http://www.berr.gov.uk/energy/statistics/publications/prices/tables/page18125.html</a></p>

  <p>The same departmental site also provides UK expenditure on domestic electricity and gas going back to 1974 (table 2.6.2 Average Expenditure Each Week on Fuel per Consuming Household). A comparison of levels of expenditure in Scotland and the UK can be made where statistics exist from both data sources for a particular year.</p>

  <p>The Office for National Statistics Family and Expenditure Survey, &quot;Family Spending&quot;, also provides average weekly household expenditure on gas and electricity for Scotland back to 1999.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=361" target="_blank">http://www.statistics.gov.uk/StatBase/Product.asp?vlnk=361</a></p>

  <p>From the average ratio of these comparisons, the average annual domestic expenditure on (a) gas and (b) electricity can be constructed for Scotland back to 1974.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive what information it has on average household expenditure on (a) gas and (b) electricity bills in each year since 1960 as a proportion of average household incomes.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-07-28.S3W-14907.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80349" speakername="Stewart Maxwell" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0728.htm#4">

  <p>The Scottish House Condition Survey provides survey estimates of household gas and electricity expenditure for the years 1996, 2002, 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06.</p>

  <p>The Department for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform provides data for Scotland going back to 1990 for gas and electricity expenditure but only broken down by payment method &ndash; with no total.</p>

  <p><a href="http://www.berr.gov.uk/energy/statistics/publications/prices/tables/page18125.html" target="_blank">http://www.berr.gov.uk/energy/statistics/publications/prices/tables/page18125.html</a></p>

  <p>The same Departmental site also provides UK expenditure on domestic electricity and gas going back to 1974 (Table 2.6.2 Average Expenditure Each Week on Fuel per Consuming Household). A comparison of levels of expenditure in Scotland and the UK can be made where statistics exist from both data sources for a particular year.</p>

  <p>From the average ratio of these comparisons, the average annual domestic expenditure on (a) gas and (b) electricity can be constructed for Scotland back to 1974.</p>

  <p>&quot;Average&quot; household income figures are very skewed by high income earners. Their incomes distort the average household income figure. Therefore the &quot;Median&quot; household income is the preferred central measure. It is available for Scotland from the Department of Work and Pensions Households Below Average Income data series for the period 1994-95 to 2006-07.</p>

  <p>Therefore, on a consistent basis, using median household disposable income, the proportion of household income spent on (a) gas and (b) electricity is available for the period 1994-95 to 2006-07. The figures for these measures are shown in the following table.</p>

  <p>Average Household Expenditure on (a) Gas (b) Electricity, Median Household Income and Gas and Electricity Costs as a Proportion of Household Income: Scotland 1994-95 to 2006-07</p>

  <p>I have been advised that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde followed the guidance set out in Annex 4 of the document <em>Managing Incidents Presenting Actual or Potential Risks to the Public Health: Guidance on the Roles and Responsibilities of Incident Control Teams</em> and that Health Protection Scotland were notified of the outbreak in accordance with the terms of the Watt Matrix adopted across NHS Scotland.</p>

  <p>Health Protection Scotland provided the infection control team with expert advice and support throughout this outbreak and I was kept informed by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde on a daily basis of the condition and progress of the babies colonised with MRSA. None of the babies were a cause of concern and I am advised that standard infection control procedures were followed by staff at the hospital.</p>

  <p>All incidents and outbreaks of infection are regrettable but I am satisfied that all appropriate precautions were taken by the hospital to deal with these MRSA cases and no action is therefore planned.</p>

  <p>Yes. Use of official cars on 11 June 2008 was fully in line with guidelines on use of Government cars. The First Minister met with the Secretary of State for Business Enterprise and Regulatory Reform on 11 June 2008 at Victoria Street in London to discuss the recent tanker drivers dispute.</p>

  <p>Local regeneration, including that of town centres, is primarily a matter for local authorities and their partners. However, the Scottish Government has developed a range of national policies that support the regeneration and growth of town, city and village centres across Scotland.</p>

  <p>These include the Small Business Bonus Scheme, introduced on 1 April 2008, our ongoing support for Business Improvement Districts, and planning guidance.</p>

  <p>To advance a shared understanding of the issues facing town centres, the Scottish Government has recently invited a wide range of stakeholders to contribute to a series of facilitated discussions which are intended to identify practical actions which can be taken by local stakeholders and local or central government to sustain and, where necessary, regenerate Scotland&rsquo;s high streets.</p>
