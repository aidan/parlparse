  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will consider removing listed building status from the Royal Commonwealth Pool on the grounds that it is no longer fit for purpose as a venue for international swimming competitions, nor is it possible for it to be upgraded to be fit for that purpose.</p>

<reply id="uk.org.publicwhip/spwa/2008-03-20.S3W-10865.r0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/member/80307" speakername="Linda Fabiani" url="http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/business/pqa/wa-08/wa0320.htm#1">

  <p>Listing is intended to identify a building&rsquo;s special interest to inform the management of future change such as this. A listing is only removed from a building when it fails to meet the criteria as a building of special architectural or historic interest. The Royal Commonwealth Pool is a streamlined modernist design of international renown, winner of three awards, designed by RMJM, and erected 1967-70. Its innovative planning greatly reduced the normal problems of heat-loss, noise, condensation and glare. It was carefully designed and landscaped for its park-side location. In Historic Scotland&rsquo;s opinion the building meets the criteria for listing.</p>

  <p>The necessary planning and listed building consents for a fully workable scheme that complies with national swimming regulations are in place for the Royal Commonwealth Pool, passed by the council and Historic Scotland last year. There was no mention in the course of this of any problems in upgrading the facilities. The major works will allow for swimming, water-polo, synchronised swimming up to national standard and diving to international standard.</p>

  <p>I am aware of the Changing Culture &ndash; the impact of alcohol in Renfrewshire conference and welcome the joint approach to developing local policy and strategy. It is through such partnership working, at a local level, that we will tackle alcohol misuse and alcohol-related harm.</p>

  <p>I have announced today that NHS specific funding for tackling alcohol misuse, is increasing from &pound;10 million in 2007-08 to almost &pound;25 million in 2008-09. This funding will be used to ensure access to early intervention, and downstream treatment services for those people for whom alcohol related harm is already a reality. The distribution formula for this funding is weighted for deprivation and other factors.</p>

  <p>To increase dental access NHS Western Isles are currently undertaking a property review of all board accommodation to link with the clinical strategy which is also under development. This will produce a vision for services for the population of Western Isles in the short-term. In the meantime, to increase dental access the board are looking urgently at the setting up of a number of temporary surgeries in Stornoway.</p>

  <p>In addition, a number of financial measures are in place to recruit and retain dentists in the NHS, including a remote areas allowance.</p>

  <p>The road equivalent tariff (RET) fares recommended by the RET study consultants on the pilot routes are set out below. The two tables are based on comparisons with the single equivalent for passengers and cars of a 2008 summer five day open return ticket and secondly a 2007-08 winter multi-journey ticket. The current commercial vehicle fares are based on CalMac&rsquo;s published rates. Work is still underway to finalise the RET fares for the pilot routes.</p>

  <p>Alcohol licensing in Scotland is presently undergoing a transition to the system introduced by the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005. This will be completed on 1 September 2009, when the new licences under the 2005 act come into effect. Local licensing forums have already been established, and have a function to keep under review the operation of the legislation in their area. A number of national fora already exist at which licensing matters are discussed, including the Scottish Ministerial Advisory Committee on Alcohol Problems and the Alcohol Industry Partnership. We are not persuaded that there is a need for another forum at this stage.</p>

  <p>All heath boards have received a standard increase of 3.15% in 2008-09. In addition, the Scottish Government has provided additional resources to those boards who are below both their current formula and NHSScotland Resource Allocation Committee (NRAC) target allocations in 2008-09 in advance of NRAC&rsquo;s implementation in 2009-10. These boards are NHS Lothian, NHS Fife, NHS Forth Valley, NHS Grampian, NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Orkney. The average increase is 3.3%.</p>

  <p>For future years the exact amounts received by each health board will depend on the overall funding available and their changing relative position when the formula is calculated. Uplift levels, including parity uplifts, will be considered and announced each financial year in line with the parliamentary process and taking into account funding earmarked for Scottish health priorities within the overall Scottish Government financial settlement. This reflects the practice established under the previous SHARE and Arbuthnott formulae. It means that each health board will receive a standard uplift each year to meet inflationary pressures whilst those boards whose actual funding remains below their target level, as indicated by the NRAC formula, would receive an additional parity uplift from within the remaining resources available.</p>

  <p>Many male patients awaiting circumcision previously experienced lengthy waits because their treatment was considered to be of low clinical priority and they were therefore excluded from waiting time targets. These hidden waiting lists were abolished on 1 January 2008. From that date any patient placed on a waiting list is treated within the national maximum waiting time, after subtracting any periods of unavailability. There is no category of low clinical priority.</p>

  <p>Consequently, no patient awaiting a circumcision procedure should wait longer than 18 weeks to be seen at out-patients, or a further 18 weeks for their operation. I have already announced that as a milestone towards delivery of our ambitious 18 weeks whole journey waiting time target, these maximum waiting times will both reduce to 15 weeks by the end of March 2009.</p>

  <p>The NHS treats the confidentiality of patient records very seriously.</p>

  <p>A comprehensive set of policies and guidance for NHS boards on IT security was issued in 2006. This includes risks relating to patient&rsquo;s health records. Progress on this was recently reviewed following the loss of child benefit data by HM Revenue and Customs across the NHS in Scotland. One of the key findings of this review was the importance of staff training and awareness. NHS Education for Scotland and NHS National Services Scotland recently consulted on a staff training and educational framework to support NHS staff in this important area, and it will be launched later this year.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Government is committed to introducing an alternative funding mechanism to the traditional costly &quot;standard form&quot; of PFI, in the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT). The SFT is still under development &ndash; the consultation period has just ended and account will need to be taken of the responses received to help inform the next stage of development. The final form that SFT will take will be set out in due course but we have made clear that it will follow the same &quot;non-profit distributing&quot; (NPD) approach which has been introduced for projects which would have followed the &quot;standard PFI&quot; approach in the past. An announcement on further SFT developments will be made when we are ready to inform the Parliament, as will further details of how the NPD approach will apply in the Waverley rail project.</p>
