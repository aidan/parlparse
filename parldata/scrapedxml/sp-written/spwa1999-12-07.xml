  <p>The Executive&#8217;s aim is to help create a strong and sustainable agriculture industry which will prove attractive to potential new entrants.</p>

  <p>The concept of financial incentives to encourage new entrants into farming received little support during a public consultation exercise earlier this year when it formed part of a package of possible measures under the Agenda 2000 CAP reform agreement. Although we have no plans to introduce such a measure, the land reform proposal to create new limited duration tenancies should have the effect of increasing the availability of farms to let, thus opening up additional opportunities for new entrants to get into farming.</p>

  <p>I met with the Technical Manager of Marks and Spencer on 7 August. I had also planned to meet the Chief Executive of Asda, but this meeting was postponed at the company&#8217;s request following their take-over by Walmart.</p>

  <p>On 10 November, the First Minister attended an event to discuss UK supply chain issues and met the Chief Executives of Sainsbury&#8217;s, Asda and Somerfield, and the Trading Director of Tesco.</p>

  <p>The issue of supermarket profit margins and their impact on Scottish agricultural produce was not discussed at these meetings. Competition policy is a reserved matter and it would be inappropriate for the Scottish Executive to discuss such matters when the Competition Commission are actively looking at the supermarkets&#8217; competitive position.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will list the forms, record sheets and any other paperwork, by agricultural sector, issued by its Rural Affairs Department and its predecessor departments which farmers are required to complete in order to comply with legislation or in order to apply for subsidies and grants.</p>

  <p>Documentation which the Rural Affairs Department requires farmers to complete in order to comply with legislation relates to statistical surveys. The main survey is the agricultural and horticultural census carried out annually in June. Several other sample surveys are carried out for specific sectoral interests.</p>

  <p>There are a number of schemes under which the farmer can apply to the Rural Affairs Department for grants and subsidy. Each scheme usually has its own explanatory booklet and forms. An overview of the schemes and material is given in the <i>Scottish Agriculture &#8211; A guide to Grants and Services</i> booklet.</p>

  <p>The Department aims to minimise the bureaucratic burden on Scotland&#8217;s producers. As part of this process, an external review panel of farmers and crofters has recently been examining the form-filling burden on the industry. This panel is due to produce a report on their findings soon.</p>

  <p>The Executive&#8217;s policy on the location and relocation of public service jobs was set out in my reply of 15 September to Question S1W-1558 from Mr Duncan McNeil. My reply made clear that where new units or agencies are set up there will be a presumption against an Edinburgh location. Other relocation options outwith Edinburgh will be considered when appropriate opportunities arise. Costs in all cases will be taken into account in deciding on location, along with operational effectiveness and impact on the staff concerned.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it was consulted over the amendments to The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) Regulations 1997 which have been prepared by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for the whole of Great Britain.</p>

  <p>Those Regulations govern the packaging recovery scheme, by which means the UK discharges compliance with the recycling and recovery provisions of Directive 94/62/EC on Packaging and Packaging Waste. They came into effect on 6 March 1997 and have since been reviewed twice, in July 1998 and August 1999. The reviews have given rise to two amending Regulations. The first of these came into effect on 4 June 1999. The other, The Producer Responsibility Obligations (Packaging Waste) (Amendment) (No.2) Regulations 1999, have yet to be made. These amending Regulations, which extend to Great Britain, have been laid at Westminster by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions. They are subject to affirmative resolution and, subject to the outcome of the debate on them, will come into effect on 1 January 2000.</p>

  <p>Although the implementation of the Directive in Scotland is a devolved matter the packaging recovery scheme was designed to operate in a seamless way across Great Britain. The United Kingdom was served with a Reasoned Opinion by the European Commission in June 1998 about the non-implementation of certain aspects of the Packaging Directive. The UK accepted that it was in default and the consequent need to demonstrate full compliance as early as possible, together with an overriding operational need to meet the 1 January deadline, made it appropriate for the amending Regulations to be made, exceptionally, by the Secretary of State for the Environment, Transport and the Regions for the whole of Great Britain.</p>

  <p>The Scottish Executive considers that matters affecting Scotland should be legislated for by the Scottish Parliament unless there are very clear overriding reasons for not doing so. My Department is currently conducting a review of the way in which the Packaging Regulations operate in Scotland with a view to improving demonstrable compliance for the future.</p>

  <p>To ask the Scottish Executive whether it will list the forms, record sheets and any other paperwork, by fisheries sector, issued by its Rural Affairs Department and its predecessor departments which owners of fishing vessels are required to complete in order to comply with legislation and what plans it has to review any &quot;red tape&quot; in the fisheries industry.</p>

  <p>Documentation which the Rural Affairs Department may require fishing vessel owners to complete relates primarily to the licensing of fishing vessels, control and quota management. Most require to be completed only in specified circumstances. Owners are routinely required to complete an application for a fishing vessel licence (form AFL2), annually in the case of vessels over 10 metres in length and biennially in the case of vessels of 10 metres or under.</p>

  <p>We will continue to try to ensure a balance between the aim of minimising the bureaucratic burdens on the industry whilst securing an appropriate level of regulation in the interests of sustainable fisheries.</p>

  <p>A list of extant European legislation, including that relating to fisheries, can be found in the <i>Directory of Community Legislation in Force</i> , published by the Office for Official Publications of the European Communities. There is also a Commission database of Regulations (EUR-Lex) available on the internet.</p>

  <p>A list of the main domestic fisheries acts and orders is set out in the annual report and accounts of the Scottish Fisheries Protection Agency. The most recent version was published and laid before the Scottish Parliament, and copies were sent to Members of the Scottish Parliament, in July this year. Various aspects of fisheries are also subject to administrative rules and arrangements.</p>

  <p>Regulations are proposed to give effect in Scotland to obligations arising out of recent Community legislation on fisheries control arrangements, satellite monitoring and technical conservation measures; and for fish conservation and quota management purposes. These will be subject to appropriate parliamentary procedure.</p>

  <p>I fully appreciate concerns about the effect the withdrawal of paediatric cardiac surgery might have on the Paediatric Intensive Care Unit at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh. Work is underway to ensure the Unit&#8217;s continuing viability. As a first step, at my request the Chief Medical Officer is undertaking a detailed discussion with key staff at Lothian University Hospitals NHS Trust about the Unit&#8217;s position.</p>

  <p>The Unit&#8217;s viability must be a key factor in all future decisions about the location of tertiary paediatric services in Scotland. The framework for those decisions was set out in the report of the Acute Services Review, which advocates a coherent distribution of services amongst the existing tertiary paediatric centres in Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow.</p>

  <p>We believe that an emphasis on prevention, using the additional funding from the NOF initiative to complement our health promotion and prevention drive to stop people getting cancer in the first place, would provide the greatest benefit for Scotland&#8217;s health.

  <p>The Scottish Executive is very much in favour of people with asthma being fully informed about their treatment and as far as possible taking an active role in the management of their condition. The National Asthma Campaign (Scotland) is very keen to promote the extended use of self-treatment plans, and I will be meeting them to discuss this and other asthma issues in the near future.</p>

  <p>It must be borne in mind, however, that the treatment of people with asthma is not identical in every case, and must ultimately be a matter for individual clinical judgement after discussion with the patient and, in the case of young children, the family.</p>

  <p>The Land Reform Bill will not exempt voluntary groups, community groups and charities from paying fees for accessing information on land ownership from the Register of Sasines or the Land Register of Scotland, nor will it affect the legislative basis for charging those fees. The Registers of Scotland Executive Agency, which maintains and compiles these registers, incurred operating expenses of nearly &pound;34 million in 1998-1999. If this cost was not covered by fees paid by those making use of the Agency&#8217;s services then this would fall to be a burden on taxpayers, including those who never have any call to access the registers.</p>

  <p>Ministers are still considering whether the creation of a new database of land ownership in rural areas would represent good value for money. If such a database is established, decisions will have to be taken as to its funding and also of course in relation to charging for its use.</p>

  <p>The estimated average cost of answering Scottish Parliamentary Questions which was provided in previous answers was calculated by asking Departments of the Scottish Executive to take a sample of such questions and to make an assessment of the time spent at each grade on preparing an answer. The standard costs for each grade were then applied, giving an average figure of &pound;100 per question in the sample. Not surprisingly, and for a range of reasons, there were significant variations in the cost per individual question. As has been explained in my responses to previous questions on this issue, this was a preliminary exercise, based upon a relatively small sample and was intended specifically to provide a broad indication of costs quickly to members who had asked for that information.

  <p>We consult as widely as possible when planning new administrative and legislative measures and make every reasonable effort to ensure that those likely to be directly affected by a proposal, in this case tenant farmers, have an opportunity to give their views. We handle each consultation in a way that best suits its circumstances.</p>

  <p>It is for Scottish Executive Ministers to approve such proposals and I did so on 7 July after a wide-ranging consultation exercise involving around 120 organisations and individuals. Following consideration of 63 written submissions, including those from Scottish Natural Heritage, Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, Highland and Islands Enterprise, Historic Scotland, Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors, Scottish Environment Protection Agency, River Authorities, Deer Commission, Crofters Commission, Forestry Commission, National Trust, Rural Forum, Scottish Consumers Council, National Farmers Union of Scotland, Scottish Landowners Federation, Scottish Crofters Union, Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, Scottish Environmental Link, Scottish Wildlife Trust, World Wide Fund for Nature, Organic Sector bodies, Scottish Agricultural College, and Farming and Wildlife Advisory Group, a series of bilateral meetings was held with key players to discuss the scope and structure of the scheme. The process was rounded off with a seminar attended by key environmental, farming and land-owning interests to discuss the detail of the proposed management prescriptions.</p>

  <p>I am confident that the proposals will command a broad measure of support.</p>

  <p>The Executive have submitted scheme proposals to the European Commission for technical scrutiny. These will need to be adapted to take account of the EC Rural Development Regulation prior to formal submission as part of the Rural Development Plans required by the Regulation. I will be happy to make details available at this stage. A copy of the formal proposals will be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre (SPICE) and will be sent to all who were involved in the consultation process, as well as to any person or organisation who wishes a copy.</p>
