	<p pid="a.406.6/1">My Lords, a couple of weeks ago I announced the recess dates as far as I was able for the next Session. I am now able to announce provisional dates until next October. The dates will be in the Printed Paper Office, along with the dates for Friday sittings.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.6/2">The Easter Recess starts when we rise on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-29">Thursday 29 March</phrase> and goes on until <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-16">Monday 16 April</phrase>, when we return. For Whitsun, we have from <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">Thursday 24 May</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-04">Monday 4 June</phrase>. For the Summer Recess, we rise on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-26">Thursday 26 July</phrase> and return on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-08">Monday 8 October</phrase>. As the discerning listener will have noticed, there is no September sitting. The Commons decided yesterday not to have September sittings; I think that that was a splendid decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.406.6/3">I know it is helpful to the House to give the dates of Friday sittings throughout the year, as far as we are able, but I cannot claim credit for coming up with the idea. I shall not read them out now because there are a lot of them, but it helps people to plan. The credit should go to the legendary former Liberal Democrat Chief Whip, the noble Lord, Lord Roper, who suggested that it was helpful to everyone to know in advance as far as possible, especially for those noble Lords who are introducing or hoping to introduce Private Members' Bills and things of that sort, because they can then have some idea of how they might progress through the year.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-02a.428.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100293" speakername="Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts" colon=":" colnum="428"  time="012:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61102-0005.htm#06110288000218">
	<p pid="a.428.2/1">My Lords, when we first met in Grand Committee on this Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>, after Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-11">11 January</phrase>, it was the first of 13 Grand Committee sittings during which we discussed no fewer than 1,926 amendments, made a short 700 changes to the Bill and, along the way, caused the collapse of the traditional methodology used by the Public Bill Office for numbering amendments&mdash;another first for this Bill. I had no foreknowledge of the prescience of the remark that I made in that first Committee meeting. I said:</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/2" class="indent">&quot;A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single amendment&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 30/1/06; col. GC 1.]</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/3">If that was the right quotation for then, the appropriate one for today must be:</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/4" class="indent">&quot;Once more unto the breach, dear friends&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/5">And what a breach it is: we have a Bill now with three volumes instead of two and 1,264 clauses instead of 885, and it still requires us to consider 1,029 amendments in a single sitting.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/6">I readily accept that in part the increase, and some 600 of the amendments, are as a result of the Government taking on board our advice on consolidation when the Bill first passed through this House. I thank the Minister for that and for his helpful letter of <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-30">30 October</phrase> explaining the background. I also thank the Bill team for making that final push to transfer so many more clauses from previous Companies Acts into this one. The huge number of amendments with which we now have to deal as a result of this consolidation may be making these later stages of the Bill rather more unwieldy than is usual. The name change may have confused some people; nevertheless, history will show that the effort was worthwhile.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/7">As a final piece in the jigsaw, for which I am sure that this House will be grateful, perhaps the Minister could explain what will be left behind in the 1985, 1989 and 2004 Acts. What is planned to happen to those areas? When does he hope that we will finally complete the repeal of those three Acts?</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/8">So much for what the Bill consists of: the next question worrying industry, commerce and practitioners is when it will all happen. The Minister's colleague in the other place, Margaret Hodge, sent us all a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-16">16 August</phrase>. She wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/9" class="indent">&quot;In both Houses, Committee members examining the Company Law Reform Bill ... asked a number of questions about how the Bill will apply to existing companies. I intend to publish the enclosed paper this week, which sets out both our general approach to transitional issues and a possible timetable for commencement of the bill's provisions ... We have sought views on these issues by mid-September so that we are able to inform Parliament in October of the outcome at Report stage in the Commons.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/10" class="indent">I should emphasise that this will be the first opportunity for interested parties to comment on transitional issues. We shall consult further formally on the full range of transitional arrangements after Royal Assent. We shall do this well before commencement of the bill's provisions. We hope it will be possible to commence the majority of the Bill's provisions on<phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2007</phrase>&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/11">At some time today, it would be helpful to the House and the country if the noble Lord could update us on progress on that proposal. To be specific: first, what has been the general reaction to consultation? Secondly, since inevitably much of this is an enabling Bill, when does he expect to publish draft regulations? Thirdly, and most importantly, are the Government still sticking to their implementation target of<phrase class="date" code="">1 October 2007</phrase>?</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/12">Finally, and unfortunately, much as I would like to stand here and make a wholly positive speech, I regret that I have to say that despite the enormous number of constructive and very welcome amendments that we are considering today, there are some which quite frankly should not be there. After such a long consultation period with so many days in Committee both in this House and in another place, it is extraordinary that the Government have attempted at a very late stage to bounce through an amendment without proper scrutiny or debate. This would be regrettable but perhaps not serious if it was an issue on which there was a large measure of consensus, but that is not the case. The matter of reporting on the supply chain in the business review is a controversial issue that has sparked huge controversy and debate in the media over the past couple of weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/13">At the opening meeting of the Grand Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>, the Minister opened with some fairly disobliging remarks about my party and myself. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/14" class="indent">&quot;Before I turn to the first amendment, I had hoped that we could debate this Bill on a relatively non-partisan basis. We all share a common objective of updating and modernising company law, and wherever possible deregulating. This Bill has been drafted on the basis of a great deal of expert advice and the widest possible consultation. Large sections of the Bill are highly technical. I had the hope that we could all work together to produce a Bill that provides the best possible conditions for the success of British industry ... I do not believe in politics-free politics, but I do believe that politicians should keep their attention firmly fixed on what is best for the economy and for the country&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 30/1/06; cols. GC 1-2.]</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/15">I hope he will forgive me if I say that the way he and his colleagues have dealt with the supply chain matter runs counter to everything he said then.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/16">My honourable friends in the other place have had it far worse than we have. We at least have had two and a half weeks in which to consult interested parties before tabling amendments; our colleagues did not even have two and a half days. This Government have become renowned for their dismissive attitude towards Parliament and the principles of well considered and well written legislation. For this to be so clearly illustrated in such a flagrant way is extraordinary.</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/17">It is hard to accept that having to consider 1,029 amendments in a single day will lead to a Bill which, in the Minister's words, will,</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/18" class="indent">&quot;provide the best possible conditions for the success of British industry&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 23/5/06; col. 794.]</p>
	<p pid="a.428.2/19">This helter-skelter finish to our proceedings will, I fear, inevitably lead to unforeseen problems. The issues identified in the report from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee are probably only the beginning. The Government will have much to answer for. We on this side approach this final stage of the Bill as we have approached all the stages. We ask of each amendment: is it deregulatory, is it comprehensible, does it think small first, and does it provide the right balance between risk and reward to encourage men and women of the highest quality to work in British industry and commerce? We look forward to seeing how this latest set of amendments measures up to these yardsticks.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-02a.444.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100293" speakername="Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts" colon=":" colnum="444"  time="013:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61102-0007.htm#06110288000325">
	<p pid="a.444.0/1">My Lords, I am extremely grateful to the Minister for his reassurance on the status of the new clauses that the Government are introducing. The fact that no new legal developments are intended, except in so far as he explained, is a critical reassurance to practitioners and to the country at large. I am also grateful for the Minister's remarks on a private company purchasing its own shares and on the fact that the abolition of the &quot;whitewash&quot; procedure will not resurrect the common law prohibitions, which has been a cause of much concern externally.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/2">Generally, we share the Minister's view&mdash;indeed, we argued it in Grand Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-15">15 March</phrase>&mdash;that there is a strong argument for consolidation. On that date we discussed pre-emption and allotment&mdash;a part of company law frequently considered by practitioners. We argued that to have it straddling two or three Acts was not helpful. However, the Government have sought to address a wider range of topics with these amendments, as the Minister explained. As the Minister pointed out, if this consolidation were to take place, account would have to be taken of the fact that commercial practice develops rather faster than the measured pace of primary statute law.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/3">At an earlier stage the Minister listed three areas where it was believed that some mechanism for updating through secondary legislation would be needed, of which, as he said, capital maintenance was one. We accept the force of these arguments. Therefore, in these areas, which are covered by Amendments Nos. 432 and 512, we are prepared to accept the introduction of an affirmative procedure statutory-instrument-based system for interim reform. We do so, despite the misgivings expressed in the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee's report because of the relatively technical, fast changing nature of this section of company law.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/4">However, we share the view that the committee has a strong point with respect to the reform power in Amendment No. 671. That covers another area of the law&mdash;distributions&mdash;the implications of which, and the future policy principles for, have been much less discussed. Therefore, we are grateful to hear that the Government will not move Amendment No. 671.</p>

	<p pid="a.452.2/1">My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 228 to 244. I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 247, 251 to 254, 258, 259, 261, 264, 266 to 272, 274 to 282, 285, 289 to 291, 293 to 295, 302 to 308, and 310 to 314. The 61 amendments in this group are mainly minor and technical improvements to the accounts and audit provisions of the Bill. I shall mention two of the more substantive changes that they make. If any noble Lord would like an explanation of the other amendments, I shall happily do my best to provide it.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/2">The most substantive change made by this group is to the accounts and audit requirements for certain small financial service companies. Twenty-three of these amendments achieve this change: the two key ones are Amendment No. 231, which amends Clause 366, and Amendment No. 289, which amends Clause 462. These amendments are deregulatory in that they will allow more small financial companies not to have their accounts audited, and to take advantage of less onerous accounting and reporting requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/3">The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, proposed an amendment in this area when we debated the Bill in Grand Committee. The Financial Services Authority has carried out a consultation and found strong support for deregulation. The Government are pleased to be making these amendments to reduce the reporting burden on small companies. Some 4,690 small companies&mdash;all those where the requirement to have an audit is not based on a European Union requirement&mdash;will be able to benefit, saving them some &pound;15 million a year in total. In order to enable companies to benefit from these relaxations in accounting and auditing requirements as soon as possible, we have made regulations to make parallel amendments to the Companies Act 1985. These will allow companies to benefit from the exemptions for financial years ending on or after <phrase class="date" code="">31 December 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/4">I want to focus particularly on preliminary statements. Five of these amendments&mdash;Amendments Nos. 251 to 254 and 277&mdash;remove what would have been a new requirement for quoted companies to disclose on a website the preliminary statements that they are required to produce. Those amendments were prompted by a recent consultation by the Financial Services Authority on whether to change the regime for preliminary statements of annual results from a mandatory to a permissive one. We have concluded that the requirements on publication of preliminary statements are more properly a matter for securities law&mdash;just as what those statements must contain is&mdash;and those requirements should not be unnecessarily duplicated in company law.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/5">FSA disclosure rules require an issuer to keep for one year on its websites all price-sensitive information published through a regulated information provider. In the FSA's experience, it would be unusual for a company to come to the conclusion that there was no price-sensitive information contained in any future preliminary statements that it produced. Consequently, the FSA expects that companies will put their preliminary statements on their websites anyway.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/6">As I have said, the remaining 33 amendments are more minor and technical, though I shall be happy to seek to explain them if that would be helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.452.2/7">Moved, That the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 228 to 244.&mdash;(<I>Lord McKenzie of Luton</I>.)</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-02a.460.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100489" speakername="Lord Patten" colon=":" colnum="460"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61102-0009.htm#06110288000438">
	<p pid="a.460.2/1">My Lords, I believe that the noble Lord's colleague in the House of Commons was very firmly bounced by NGOs and others into making these provisions. It was not something that the Government had toyed with bringing forward until the lobbying gained apace at a later stage. My point about legislative fatigue is the way in which the Government rolled over to the lobbying and that is why I think the DTI has shown a certain amount of mettle fatigue as well. That is doubtless why the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, in his appearance in another place before the Select Committee on Trade and Industry on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-24">24 October</phrase>, stalwartly refused to give any undertaking at all that he thought that the department had a long-term life in front of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.2/2">My second point is in strong support of what my noble friend said about the effect of these provisions on smaller companies with just one, two or three suppliers. I believe that this will be a very onerous burden. She has set the point out very clearly and I shall not attempt to be a little Lord Echo to what she has said so forcefully.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.2/3">Thirdly, I believe that we should all be aware of legislative creep, of regulatory creep and of compliance creep in this legislation. My noble friend on the Front Bench said that big companies can handle the extra regulatory box-ticking through which they will have to go, but, I predict that a whole new industry will emerge and companies will have to be very stalwart in resisting it in order to give gainful employment to professional services, firms and others, coming forward with seminars, breakfast meetings and new undertakings that they feel companies should fulfil. I think that some companies, innocent though they may sometimes be, will fall for this. We will see a great deal more regulation, self-imposed by companies, thanks to compliance creep urged forward by professional services firms.</p>
	<p pid="a.460.2/4">I do not believe that the purposes of industry, business and commerce have been particularly well served in respect of these provisions by the CBI and, in particular, by the Institute of Directors. The words of Mr Templeman, the director-general of the Institute of Directors, which have already been quoted in your Lordships' House, will come back to haunt him in future years after having had a cup of tea with Mrs Hodge, who told him that everything was going to be all right. She does not have that effect on me, my Lords.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-02a.495.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="495"  time="016:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61102-0013.htm#06110288000682">
	<p pid="a.495.5/1">My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment Nos. 959 to 968.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.5/2">These amendments fall into two broad categories. Amendments Nos. 959 to 968, 970 to 979 and 1,023 to 1,025 seek to ensure that the transparency directive is implemented effectively and on time. The transparency directive will help to improve access to capital markets across the EU and ensure that investors have access to better information when they make investment decisions. Amendments Nos. 959 to 968, 971 to 979 and 1,023 to 1,025 amend the Financial Services and Markets Act to give the FSA the power to implement fully the transparency directive by making transparency rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.5/3">While there is a general rule-making power, some of the particular provisions referred only to &quot;voting&quot; shares and not to obligations applying to other classes of issuers of traded securities required by the transparency directive. It was identified that this use of particular provisions for one class of security could lead to confusion as to how the clauses operate. To avoid any such confusion, these new amendments clarify the relationship between the general and particular provisions and make it clear that the particular provisions apply, as appropriate, to all the classes of issuer required by the directive. There are also some other minor adjustments to ensure that the wording of the clauses reflects clearly other particular provisions from the directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.5/4">Amendment No. 970 deals with transitional arrangements and ensures that the Financial Services Authority consultation on transparency rules meets the requirements for consultations on proposed rules set out in Section 155 of the Financial Services and Markets Act. This is necessary to enable the Financial Services Authority to make transparency rulesthat come into force from the day on which the directive must be implemented into national law&mdash;<phrase class="date" code="">20 January 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.5/5">I now turn to Amendments Nos. 980 to 987 and 1,026, which deal with liability for false or misleading statements in reports and statements publishedin response to a provision implementing the transparency directive, or otherwise. The background to these amendments is the Government's decision during the passage of this Bill, strongly supported by a wide range of stakeholder opinion, to introduce a statutory liability regime to cover disclosures required by the transparency directive and narrative reporting by UK companies. This was necessary to remove uncertainty about the liability regime, which risked constraining important disclosures by companies&mdash;for instance, in the narrative reports to be included in annual reports&mdash;thus reducing both their effectiveness and the accountability of directors. Accordingly, following discussion with stakeholders, liability provisions were introduced at the Report stage in this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.5/6">Amendment No. 984 ensures that it is clear what liability regime would apply to potential as well as actual investors with regard to losses arising from reliance on periodic financial information disclosed under the transparency directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.5/7">Amendments Nos. 980 to 983, 985 to 987 and Amendment No. 1026 address issues that were raised with the Government by consultation. It was suggested in another place that the liability regime should be clarified across a wider scope. The Government consulted on this over the summer and specifically asked whether liability should be clarified in respect of disclosures made under the FSA's disclosure rules, preliminary announcements of results, disclosures made by companies with securities quoted on the alternative investment market, and transparency disclosures by companies admitted to trading on an EEA-regulated market in situations where UK law is applicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.5/8">When considering the issue of extending the liability regime to disclosures made under the FSA disclosure rules, the emerging consensus from consultation was that issuer liability is an extremely complex area in which it is vital that the Government get their policy right. Most responses said that an extension of the statutory regime was, in principle, desirable. However, there was no consensus on what the right policy would look like. Importantly, the consultation raised the point that, while the existing provisions in the Bill are there largely to produce certainty as to issuer liability for documents published in accordance with the transparency directive, these provisions, along with other provisions in the directive requiring disclosure of relevant information in all EEA-regulated markets and other developments in securities law, combined to make the existing common law position on issuer liability for other published financial documents increasingly uncertain.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.5/9">The effect would be to restrict severely the content of issuers' annual reports and other regular publications to the market. Such a development would not be in the interests of a well functioning market. It is also necessary to consider the possible effects for the UK as a whole of any developments in common law that would increase the liability of issuers for any financial publications that they may make. It is necessary that very careful consideration be given to the consequences. This is a very complex area of law and public policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.5/10">Amendments Nos. 987 and 1026 therefore give the Government the power to make further provision about liability for published information. This will enable us to make appropriate provision once further consideration has been given to the shape that such a liability regime should take. We recognise that this is a wide power, but stakeholders consider that it is important that provision should be made, and, subject only to what I am about to say about the review, the Government have already announced that we agree.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.5/11">This power has also been subject to scrutiny by the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, whose consideration is that the subject matter of the power is sufficiently circumscribed to make the power acceptable in the light of the affirmative procedure provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.5/12">The Government have announced that Professor Paul Davies QC, the Cassel Professor of Commercial Law at the London School of Economics, is to conduct a formal review of the liability of issuers in respect of damage or loss suffered as a consequence of inaccurate, false or misleading information disclosed by issuers or their managements to financial markets, including to their own shareholders or bondholders, or of failure to disclose relevant information. This will take into account both existing regulatory obligations and penalties, including criminal penalties, and the potential for liability in damages under existing common law jurisprudence. The review will also need to look at the position in other EU member states and more widely in the jurisdictions of other substantial financial services markets.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.5/13">If Professor Davies' review recommends that the Government either implement a statutory liability regime for financial disclosures or make changes to the regime that we are putting in place to deal with financial publications required by the transparency directive, the Government will hold a full consultation on the Government's response to the review's proposals, with a full regulatory impact assessment of these proposals, and legislate for the new regime using the powers proposed.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.5/14">Of course, it is possible that the review could recommend that no changes at all are required. Most responses to the Government's consultation also supported an extension of the liability regime to cover a preliminary announcement of results. It was argued that in practice these contain the same information as in annual and other reports required to be published by the transparency directive, and therefore captured by the statutory liability regime.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.5/15">It was also argued that excluding the preliminary announcement of results from the scope of the liability regime would cause issuers to cease publishing them. Investors pointed out that they regard preliminary announcement as highly useful. Amendments Nos. 980 and 981 extend the liability regime to preliminary announcement of results. Nevertheless, in the light of the obvious existence of uncertainties surrounding an extension of the liability regime to disclosures made under the FSA disclosure rules, Amendments Nos. 980 and 981 ensure that any extension of the liability regime to preliminary announcements does not extend to all information contained within a document entitled &quot;preliminary announcement&quot;, and is instead restricted to that information in the annual report, which the preliminary announcement properly presages. I should add that the extension is not set in stone. The power I have just discussed will enable the extension of the liability regime to preliminary announcements to be adjusted in the light of the outcome of Professor Davies's review.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.5/16">Stakeholders also pointed to some confusion over how the liability regime as currently expressed in the Bill would apply to certain situations where either the issuer or the investor was situated in the EEA but outside the UK. In order to clarify that, Amendments Nos. 982, 983 and 986 change the territorial coverage of the statutory liability regime to ensure that the regime covers securities of all issuers for which the UK is the home member state, as well as to cover those issuers whose securities are traded on a regulated market situated in the UK and for whom the UK is the host member state. UK holders of security of other issuers&mdash;that is, those for whom the UK is neither a host nor a home state&mdash;will not be able to rely on the rights of action set out.</p>
	<p pid="a.495.5/17">One further issue that was raised in response to the Government's consultation was that the wording of the Bill as it stands makes senior officials, not just directors, responsible for issuers' financial publications. Government policy is for only directors of companies and senior officials of issuers that are not companies to bear liability. Amendment No. 985 clarifies the wording of the Bill in that area.</p>

	<p pid="a.498.0/1">My Lords, within this group I have two amendments, Amendments Nos. 984A and 984B, to disagree with Amendment No. 984 and insert different wording. Amendment No. 984B is not quite as draconian as it appears, because the latter half of the amendment is the same. It just has these words at the beginning,</p>
	<p pid="a.498.0/2" class="indent">&quot;and provided that this subsection shall be without prejudice to the rights of any person which have accrued prior to this section being brought into force&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.0/3">As I understand it, the Government's intention in subsection (2) is to confer the benefit of the new statutory compensation regime only on persons who, first, have acquired securities and, secondly, who have suffered loss as a result of relying on a publication containing an untrue or misleading statement or omission made knowingly or recklessly.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.0/4">Subsection (5) eliminates whatever common law other rights shareholders or any other persons may have, save as provided in subsection (7). As a result, subsection (5) will eliminate the rights of a much wider category of persons than will be protected by the new compensation regime in subsection (2). While that may be acceptable looking forward from the date the regime takes effect, it would not be appropriate for it to operate retrospectively so as to eliminate accrued rights of shareholders and other persons. The effect of the amendment is to preserve those accrued rights, including those of existing shareholders whose rights will be eliminated by the new regime. Although it is a principle of statutory construction that a statute should be presumed not to apply retrospectively unless the contrary intention appears, it is preferable to make the position clear in the statute in order to avoid any uncertainty.</p>
	<p pid="a.498.0/5">The new liability clauses were originally in symmetry, but following an amendment introduced by Margaret Hodge in Committee in the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-06">6 July</phrase>, that symmetry was lost. The upshot of this appears to be to confer compensation rights on non-shareholders who acquire shares on the basis of untrue and misleading transparency disclosures and at the same time take away whatever rights existing shareholders may have in respect of such untrue misleading statements. We argue that this is surely a counter-intuitive outcome. In any case, the Government should ensure that the common law rights of existing shareholders, which will be eliminated by the new regime, should be within the remit of the forthcoming review of the liability compensation regime by Professor Paul Davies to which the Minister referred.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-02a.502.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100293" speakername="Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts" colon=":" colnum="502"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61102-0014.htm#06110288000728">
	<p pid="a.502.0/1">My Lords, I beg to move, as an amendment to the Motion that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 988, leave out &quot;agree&quot; and insert &quot;disagree&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/2">I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 989A to 991A. We return to familiar ground and the case has been summarised by the Government that a reserve power is needed to compel financial institutions to disclose to the world at large, not their clients, how they have voted their shares. On these Benches, we argue that not only is this power unnecessary, it is undesirable on technical, practical and philosophical grounds, especially when it comes from a Government who keep stating and showing their deregulatory colours.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/3">We debated this issue at some length in Grand Committee and it came to a head on Third Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-23">23 May</phrase>, when the House decided to strike out this provision from Clause 865. The provision has now been reinstated with four clauses, rather than one. To be fair to the Government, Amendments Nos. 989, 990 and 991 attempt to provide clarity on some of the technical aspects of the proposal. We are grateful for that.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/4">We note that financial institutions can now have the necessary information disclosed on their behalf by their agents and that disclosure can now be of voting intentions given. Finally, under Amendment No. 991 at subsection (5)(b), an institution will have to disclose only an aggregate of all its voting in respect of an individual company. But that destroys the value of the whole exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/5">Consider the position of a major fund manager who manages a series of unit trusts, investment trusts and pension funds for some of which he has responsibility in deciding how to vote and for others where the client has retained that right but has delegated the disclosure to the manager. We could then have a ludicrous situation where, for a major company, say, Marks and Spencer, a fund manager would have to report that in respect of a particular resolution at an AGM it voted, say, W shares in favour, X shares against, abstained on Y shares, while Z shares were not voted on at all. The fund manager would not even have taken the decision in respect of some of those shares.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/6">In practice, this remains a valueless exercise but is also likely to give rise to our old friend the law of unintended consequences as outsiders and third parties seek to draw unwarranted conclusions from the figures disclosed. The House should be aware that there is already a trend towards greater public disclosure. The Investment Management Association, whose 35 members look after 62 per cent of all UK equities, reports a steady increase in the number of their members reporting publicly&mdash;three years ago it was seven, last year it was 10 and now it is 12. Hermes, which manages the huge British Telecom and Post Office pension funds is about to join, making 13 in all.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/7">If the Government proceed with this clause, that momentum may well be stalled. Why spend money and resources on developing disclosure procedures that may well not fit with the regulations that are produced? It may be better to sit on one's hands and see what will be required by statute.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/8">Disclosures, as, I think, the Minister accepts, are complex and do not fit with a one-size-fits-all requirement. The IMA's 2005 annual survey of fund managers' engagement analysed voting details that had been published on websites. The 12 managers that currently disclose publicly used a wide variety of ways of disclosing.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/9">Some give narrative reasons as to how they voted in a contentious situation; some give narrative reasons for voting against, or consciously withholding their vote; some give no explanation at all. This wide variation in the matters reported indicates the complexity of the area and the difficulty of introducing a one-size-fits-all legislative requirement, which would only serve to undermine the progress made to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/10">Furthermore, those that analyse the issues give narrative reasons to do so, in order to provide a clear picture to users. By contrast, legislative requirements would be likely to result in mechanistic, meaningless reporting. If regulations are made to require voting disclosure, there is a risk that managers could be discouraged from voting. Far from engaging with shareholders, as the Minister thought, the reverse could happen. That could in turn lead to some managers choosing to get round the disclosure requirement by not voting, which cannot be what the Government seek to achieve.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/11">The killer blow to these amendments comes not from the City or, indeed, from the Opposition Benches. It comes from the Minister's colleague, the Chancellor of the Exchequer. He wrote in the <I>FT</I> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October</phrase> that his aim is to reduce the regulatory burdens by 25 per cent; he has subsequently met a group of leading City figures to discuss that objective. The Economic Secretary to the Treasury, Ed Balls MP, in a speech to the City of London on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-25">25 October</phrase> said:</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/12" class="indent">&quot;And it is this commitment to openness and internationalism, our light-touch and risk-based regulatory approach&mdash;combined with the great pool of talent gathered from across the planet&mdash;that underpins London's success as a modern international financial centre&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/13">Clearly, the left hand of the Treasury has no idea what the right hand of the DTI is doing. We on the Opposition Benches are happy both to be the messenger between the two departments and&mdash;on this occasion, at least&mdash;to help the Chancellor of the Exchequer achieve his objective. I beg to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.0/14">Moved, as an amendment to the Motion that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 988, leave out &quot;agree&quot; and insert &quot;disagree&quot;.&mdash;(<I>Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts.)</I></p>
