<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-10-31a.165.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100016" speakername="Baroness Anelay of St Johns" colon=":" colnum="165"  time="015:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61031-0002.htm#06103159000108">
	<p pid="a.165.4/1">My Lords, bearing in mind the recent question asked by my noble friend Lady O'Cathain of the Chairman of Committees, the House might perhaps just need a slight flavour of the matter that we are debating. When I pressed this to a Division on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-17">17 May</phrase>, I was concerned about the process that the Government have adopted to designate a locality as an alcohol disorder zone. Amendment No. 27 would have ensured that a local authority could not act in a pre-emptive way when it wished to go through all the bureaucratic hoops that could lead almost inexorably to the imposition of an alcohol disorder zone on an area where licensees trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.4/2">Since the House decided in favour of my amendment way back in May, we have had further opportunities to debate the designation process on Report. In addition, the Minister has made it possible for the Wine and Spirit Trade Association and the British Retail Consortium to meet those involved in preparing the regulations that will deliver so much of this part of the Bill. I should like to put on record my gratitude to the Minister for all that he has done to facilitate that. This part of the Bill would have had a much rockier passage had it not been for his activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.4/3">I am also grateful to the Wine and Spirit Trade Association and the BRC for keeping me informed of progress at all stages. They and their vast membership understand that while an alcohol licence brings opportunities, it also carries significant responsibilities. They have made it clear to me that ensuring that these responsibilities are met is a clear priority for members of both organisations and that, through the trade associations and through their own individual company policies, they seek to demonstrate their responsible retailing approach. They have made it clear that tackling under-age sales in particular, which was of concern to noble Lords, is top of their agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.4/4">In November 2005, they set up the Retail of Alcohol Standards Group to provide the industry with a forum to share best practice and develop new ideas in the fight to reduce under-age sales. It has been recognised that this group has made excellent progress including, first, retraining on how to sell alcohol legally and appropriately; and, secondly, commissioning research to help members to understand why, despite training and significant resources devoted to stopping under-age sales, such sales continue to happen on occasions. This research has been shared with the Home Office and other stakeholders&mdash;a favourite government word&mdash;and they are taking positive steps to implement the recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.165.4/5">It is vital that the licensing trade and the Government work closely and constructively on the regulations as they are promulgated and on the guidance that will be brought into effect as a result of this Bill. I was therefore grateful to receive last week fromMr McNulty&mdash;the Minister in another place&mdash;a letter setting out his policy position that the Government are sympathetic to the intention behind my amendment and that they wish to do all that they can to avoid designations being necessary. It is important that ADZs are treated as the very last resort and that they donot treat responsible and irresponsible licensees alike. Mr McNulty maintained in his letter that the intention behind my amendment could be covered by guidance. He sent to me the extract from guidance that the Government have developed with the WSTA. It was in the light of that, plus the Government's further assurances that followed that they would continue to work with the retail trade on the regulations and guidance, that I indicated to the Government that I would not seek to oppose their Motion today, and I do not.</p>

	<p pid="a.188.0/1">My Lords, as I have already said, in Clause 8 we have sought to modernise and limit the offence of desertion. One of the changes that we are making is to remove the maximum penalty of life imprisonment for all cases of desertion. This maximum was only applied to all desertion cases by the Armed Forces Act 1971. We recognise that in some cases it is not appropriate for an offence of desertion to carry the maximum penalty of life imprisonment. However, we are not persuaded that in the most serious cases&mdash;that is, when a serviceman is on relevant service&mdash;he should not face the possibility of life imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/2">&quot;Relevant service&quot; is the kind of service in which all involved need to be able to rely completely on everyone else involved&mdash;a reliance and trust that are undermined where a member of the service leaves his colleagues without permission. It is also the kind of service in which the success of an operation can depend on every member of the force involved. As I said on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-24">24 July</phrase>, leaving your mates in the lurch at the time they need you most by deserting in the face of dangerous operations is viewed in the Armed Forces as just about the worst thing you can do.</p>
	<p pid="a.188.0/3">I have listened carefully to the arguments that have been made both today and in Committee on this matter, but I do not think that the case has been made for the reduction in the maximum sentence envisaged in the amendment. In such circumstances, a maximum sentence of life imprisonment may be appropriate in an extreme case and should be available as a maximum for a court martial. I trust that the noble Lord will see the requirement for retaining the sentence of life imprisonment in the limited circumstances in which it will continue to be available and understand why I cannot support the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.190.2/1">My Lords, the Minister wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-24">24 October</phrase> in the light of our discussion in Committee about unfitness or misconduct through the use of drugs. I raised two separate issues in Committee: first, the question of advice from a senior officer or senior member being the reality rather than an order; and, secondly, performance-enhancing drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/2">My Amendments Nos. 21 and 22 deal with advice. The Minister in his letter told me that there is really not a problem. He says:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/3" class="indent">&quot;This is something we believe should be controlled by clear instructions to service personnel not to advise others to take drugs without having medical advice to that effect. We do not believe therefore that this is a problem in practice&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/4">I hope the Minister will tell us how often, and in what form, these instructions are issued. In my 32 years of military service I cannot recollect having received any instruction of that kind.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/5">The letter goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/6" class="indent">&quot;That said, each serviceman is expected to exercise some personal responsibility for his own intake of drugs. In considering whether to take disciplinary action, the respective rank of the individual who took the drug and the person giving the advice would be taken into account&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/7">Perhaps the Minister will explain what he meant by that. If a junior soldier is advised by a sergeant and accepts the advice, is he charged? If the advice comes from a warrant officer, is he not charged? That seems a curious practice. We are putting an unfair burden on our troops if we are asking them to make that sort of informed decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/8">The letter says that performance-enhancement drugs are,</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/9" class="indent">&quot;a developing area of research, and at present we do not sanction their use by service personnel&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/10">although I note from col. 269 of <I>Hansard</I> of<phrase class="date" code="2006-10-11">11 October</phrase> that the noble Viscount, Lord Slim, said in Committee that he has on operations carried a pill in his pocket in times of dire trouble.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/11">We have a problem with the definition of performance-enhancing drugs, and I do not believe the Minister has provided the necessary assurances for a Bill that is about how we will deal with them. He says that such drugs are not sanctioned &quot;at present&quot;, which presumably means he is keeping his options open. His letter goes on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/12" class="indent">&quot;In our view it would be improper to give any such order in respect of any performance enhancing drug which carried any risks whatsoever&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/13">Again, I am not sure that that fills me with confidence. The question is: to whom would the risks apply? Presumably, the purpose of taking a performance-enhancing drug is to increase the risks to the enemy. It may have minimal risks to the person who takes it, but what about the risks to the person's colleagues and allies? In Committee I referred to the effect of performance-enhancing drugs on air crew members involved in friendly fire incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.2/14">Even following the Minister's helpful and full explanatory letter, I remain concerned that we do not seem to have made much progress on how we address the issue of performance-enhancing drugs. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.1/1">My Lords, We, too, welcome the amendment. The Minister wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-23">23 October</phrase> to explain how he had taken on board my concerns expressed in Committee about the narrowness of the inaccurate certification clause. I am pleased that he has brought forward these amendments, which will allow the regime of certification to meet future challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/2">However, the annexe to the Minister's letter stated, however, that the situation remained that testing and checking of all land equipment did not involve a formal certification procedure and that such a procedure would not be practical or useful. I understand that the Minister believes that he needs to look at the issue on a case-by-case basis, and that is important, but the letter gave the impression of there being closed minds within the land systems staff. As the services work more closely together, they need to pick up best practice from each other. Lives depend as much on proper servicing and checking of audit systems on land as on the sea and in the air, where the services have been more practised in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.1/3">I welcome these amendments, but perhaps the Minister might wish to keep an eye on this matter, outside the confines of the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.195.4/1">My Lords, although the amendment is grouped with Amendments Nos. 31 and 35, they relate to three separate and important issues. If noble Lords, in particular the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, will forgive me, given that things have moved on since Committee, I think that it is necessary to spend some time considering these amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/2">Amendment No. 30 simply repeats the provision in the Army Act 1955 that:</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/3" class="indent">&quot;A person shall not be charged with an offence under this section,&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/4">which relates to the military charge for committing a civil offence,</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/5" class="indent">&quot;committed in the United Kingdom if the corresponding offence under the law of England and Wales is treason, murder, manslaughter or rape&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/6">Noble Lords who were here when we debated this matter in Committee may recall my comment in withdrawing the amendment that I had not heard any reason from the Government as to why a change as dramatic as this was being made in the existing provisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/7">I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, and to the Bill team, who, no doubt, assisted him, for writing to me extensively on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-25">25 October</phrase>. In particular, the justification put forward in the letter was that the present exclusions for &quot;treason, murder, manslaughter or rape&quot; committed in the United Kingdom were, he stated, &quot;an historical anomaly&quot;. He went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/8" class="indent">&quot;By this I mean that it is anomalous that the Service system can deal with very serious sexual offences committed in the UK but not rape; that they can deal with grievous bodily harm or official secrets cases in the UK but not manslaughter. And they can deal with very serious cases (carrying up to life imprisonment) for a number of offences committed within the UK (as well of course abroad). The list of exclusions is arbitrary&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/9">Having had that letter from the Minister, I realise that it is an arbitrary list of exclusions. However, the answer is not to remove those exclusions but to extend the offences which, if committed in the United Kingdom, should not be subject to court martial. Thus, not only should a soldier or a civilian subject to service law not be charged with offences of treason, murder, manslaughter or rape committed in the United Kingdom, as at present, but, following the Minister's analysis, he should not be charged with any offence carrying a sentence of life imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/10">Perhaps I may explain to your Lordships that if a person is sentenced by court martial to more than two years' imprisonment, he is immediately thrown out of the services and will serve his sentence not in a military prison but in an ordinary prison as a civilian. If the sentence is life imprisonment, he then becomes subject to the regime for lifers within the prison and he will be subject to all the usual routines of parole and so on until his sentence is exhausted. So, if a soldier or civilian subject to service law is to be convicted of serious offences such as that and immediately lose his status, it seems right that he should have the opportunity of being tried in the Crown Court and not by court martial. Therefore, I propose to withdraw Amendment No. 30 and redraft it for the purposes of Third Reading to extend the list of offences that would be subject to ordinary trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/11">The Minister also says&mdash;this is really at the crux of the matter so far as we are concerned&mdash;in his letter:</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/12" class="indent">&quot;I do not accept that a military system which is the equivalent of the civilian system must be the same as that civilian system in every respect. Our aim is to create a service system which is as good as the civilian system and which is appropriate for the services. It must be capable of operating in a service context and have due regard to that context&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/13">I am sure that it is the Government's aim to try to bring the court martial system up to the standards of the civil system, as exemplified by trial by jury in the Crown Court. It seems to me that, if the Government were to accept some of the amendments that we have tabled, they would be some way along the line to improving the system. It has improved over the years but not as a result of the desire of any Government, whether this or any predecessor Governments; it has improved because of decisions of the European Court of Human Rights, which has pointed out in judgment after judgment that a fair trial by court martial has not been possible in important cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/14">That brings me to Amendment No. 31. Although, as with all Bills, this Bill was certified by the Minister as complying with the European convention at the beginning of its passage, a decision of the European Court on Wednesday last week was fundamental. I pray it in aid in support of Amendment No. 31.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/15">Your Lordships may recall that in Committee we discussed the case of Martin, in which I was involved. It went to the House of Lords and subsequently, in 1997, to the European Court. The judgment was delivered last Wednesday, just in time for this debate. That gives your Lordships some idea of the importance of the Human Rights Act&mdash;it was not available for the House of Lords' decision in 1997&mdash;in bringing the European Convention into British law.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/16">This was the trial of a 17 year-old civilian, the son of a serving soldier, for murder. The trial took place by court martial in Germany because at the time of committing the offence his father was in the Army, stationed in Germany. By the time the trial took place, 12 months later, his father had left the forces and the young lad was taken back to Germany, having been on remand in this country, and he was tried there. First, the matter went to the courts martial appeal court in which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, who was then Lord Chief Justice, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/17" class="indent">&quot;We have some considerable sympathy with the appellant's complaint&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/18">that is, of an abuse of process&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/19" class="indent">&quot;With the benefit of hindsight, it seems plain that the trial could have been conducted in England without undue difficulty. It would in our view have been preferable if this young appellant, whose subjection to military law was purely vicarious and involuntary, had been tried here with all the procedural safeguards which procedure in the ordinary criminal courts affords. We cannot, however, stigmatise these proceedings as abusive. They were strictly in accordance with a procedure prescribed by Parliament to apply in such cases&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/20">As I said to your Lordships, the Human Rights Act had not been thought of when that case was heard in 1996.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/21">When the matter went to the House of Lords, the noble and learned Lords, Lord Slynn of Hadley and Lord Hope of Craighead, expressed the view that the decision to prosecute the applicant, a civilian aged only 17 at the time of the murder, by court martial had been inappropriate. Again, the decision was that the proceedings were conducted within the rules laid down by Parliament and could not, therefore, be abusive.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/22">It is very interesting to see what the European Court of Human Rights has made of this in its judgment which was published last Wednesday. An important judge in that court is Sir Nicolas Bratza, a very distinguished English lawyer who, when practising in this country, used to appear mainly on behalf of the Government. He has an impeccable background. The European Court went beyond children under the age of 18 to all civilians and decided:</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/23" class="indent">&quot;It is, however, a different matter where the national legislation empowers a military court to try civilians on criminal charges ... While it cannot be contended that the Convention absolutely excludes the jurisdiction of military courts to try cases in which civilians are implicated, the existence of such jurisdiction should be subjected to particularly careful scrutiny, since only in very exceptional circumstances could the determination of criminal charges against civilians in such courts be held to be compatible with Article 6&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/24">that is, the article which requires a trial to be fair&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/25" class="indent">&quot;The power of military criminal justice should not extend to civilians unless there are compelling reasons justifying such a situation, and if so only on a clear and foreseeable legal basis&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/26">It concluded that the complaint of young Martin was fully justified and upheld his appeal and awarded costs. There was a violation of the requirements of a fair trial. In the past few days, the European Court has decided that that which is proposed in the Bill denies to a defendant a fair trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/27">Bearing in mind the Martin case, my amendment is limited to a civilian under the age of 18 who is subject to service discipline. It suggests that no civilian of that age may be prosecuted before the court martial for an offence under this clause. The service civilian court should set up a proper system of juvenile courts, or something akin to them, which could deal with the under-18s. No more should youngsters who have not joined the Army, Navy or Air Force be hauled in front of a court martial, with all that that implies, but without, as the then Lord Chief Justice, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, said, the procedural safeguards that the Crown Court affords.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/28">I say it loud and clear: we have moved a long way on courts martial. However, they are not the equivalent of a Crown Court jury trial with the procedural safeguards we have in this country. Still the Government drag their feet with this Bill in front of them. I do not suppose we will look at the issue again for 10, 15 or 20 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/29">I hope that the Government can respond. They must respond to the European court's judgment. In his letter, the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, says that:</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/30" class="indent">&quot;Given the ruling of the European Court in <I>Martin</I> which we have received today I am sure you will understand if I confine my comments for now to these issues in relation to service personnel&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/31">As your Lordships would expect, the Government were not able to respond so quickly, in relation to civilians, to a judgment delivered only last Wednesday. Again, that is why I will not be pressing Amendment No. 31 tonight, but I shall table it again at Third Reading. That will at least give the Government a little time to consider whether this Bill is not the ideal opportunity to respond to the concerns of the European Court of Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/32">I told your Lordships that these were three disparate issues. Amendment No. 35 is on a different, although not unrelated, issue. In 1861, 150 years ago, it was decided that the courts of the United Kingdom could try any British citizen charged with murder, even though that murder did not take place in the United Kingdom. Any British citizen may be tried for an offence committed abroad. All that Amendment No. 35 provides for is that, where the courts of the United Kingdom have such extra-territorial jurisdiction to try a service offence committed abroad, the defendant may elect to be tried in the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.195.4/33">All the opposition to our amendments has been along the lines that we must maintain disciplined services. I entirely agree with that aim. We should stop from time to time, however, and look at it from the defendant's point of view. That is what is missing. We have looked at the criminal court system in this country with the aim of ensuring a fair trial and doing what is right for the individual, and have tried to prevent the innocent from being convicted. Notwithstanding some of the recent measures by the Government that have weakened the position of the defendant in the British courts, we still look at it from the defendant's point of view. We should do that when considering a military system of justice, instead of always concentrating on the needs of discipline, morale and so on. We should look at whether a person charged with an offence before a court martial will get a fair trial. The European court has said,for civilians, &quot;No!&quot;&mdash;except in the most unusual circumstances. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.199.0/1">My Lords, this is an important matter, so I will speak to it in some detail. Amendment No. 31 seeks to prevent civilians who are under 18 being tried before a court martial. As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said, on<phrase class="date" code="2006-10-24">24 October</phrase> the European Court of Human Rights gave its judgment in the case of Martin. We need to be clear what it decided.</p>
	<p pid="a.199.0/2">As we have heard, the case was about the son of a serviceman who was tried by court martial in 1995 for the murder of a civilian in Germany. The court martial was subject to the same objections as were found to exist in the Findlay case in 1996, and which were remedied by the Armed Forces Act 1996. So it is no surprise that the European court also decided in Martin that the court martial was not compliant. The court did not decide that courts martial should not try civilians or that they should not try civilian juveniles, but it stated the important principle that a military jurisdiction should only be exercised over civilians if there are &quot;compelling reasons&quot; to do so. In Martin, there was the possibility of civilian trial in the UK, because the charge was murder. The European court did not decide whether there had been compelling reasons for a court-martial trial. It did not need to, because, as I have said, it decided the case on the basis that the court martial was not compliant. It did not go into what it thought would be compelling reasons. In the Martin case, the reasons for court-martial trial were mainly to do with the availability of witnesses, most of whom were German. But there were other factors.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-10-31a.202.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100102" speakername="Lord Campbell of Alloway" colon=":" colnum="202"  time="017:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61031-0002.htm#06103163000080">
	<p pid="a.202.1/1">My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 32, which is supported by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, in its retabled form, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 in the group, which are not consistent with the intent of Amendment No. 32 and would inhibit the vital exercise of discretion of commanders in the field, and are not acceptable as conferring statutory force on rules of engagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/2">To save time the argument that I deploy will be found in the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, in Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-11">11 October</phrase> at cols. 296-97 and I have tried to cut my speech down. The intendment of Amendment No. 32 is to provide a defence under a new service law, as spoken to by the noble and gallant Lords at Second Reading, for the armed serviceman on active service who complies or intends to comply with his orders and rules of engagement. This amendment achieves that by a rebuttal of presumption in favour of the serviceman, which assuredly is no absolute defence, as was the proposal in old Amendment No. 61.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/3">The rules of engagement as such do not have statutory force. The defence applies to trials for homicide or breach of international convention, either under the civil jurisdiction in exceptional circumstances or by courts martial.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/4">This is a probing amendment for your Lordships' consideration, as spoken to by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, on Second Reading. This defence is but part of a fair and just regime which recognises the realities of armed combat and peacekeeping and can be trusted by the servicemen. The amendment acknowledges that rules of engagement, if written, are but a framework within which verbal orders and rules of engagement, which often form an amalgam, are given in context with a specific operation, whether on combat or peacekeeping, as spoken to by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, on Second Reading, and assented to by my noble and learned friend Lord Mayhew of Twysden, who is in his place. The noble and gallant Lord said:</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/5" class="indent">&quot;Justice cannot be dispensed in a vacuum; it must depend on the circumstances prevailing at the time at the scene of operations and rules of engagement, if established&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/6/06; col. 242.]</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/6">The introduction of a new services law was heralded in the evidence of the Judge Advocate General, Judge Blackett, and was assented to by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce. It was the evidence given to a Select Committee of another place. It was referred to in the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, on Second Reading at col. 252. It was also assented to by the noble and gallant Lords, Lord Guthrie of Craigiebank and Lord Vincent of Coleshill. I shall cite a small but crucial passage. The amendment is dependent only on the acceptance of a new service law&mdash;a military law. In another context, I think that the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, was speaking about that some moments ago. The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, cited Judge Blackett, saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/7" class="indent">&quot;There are cogent reasons for maintaining a unique system of military justice, separate and distinct from the civilian system. These are to . . . support operational effectiveness and morale . . . maintain discipline which is an essential element of command . . . reflect the special and unique nature of the Armed Forces, in which sailors, soldiers and airmen are required to use lethal force to support Government policy, to risk their personal safety, and to be prepared to lay down their lives for their country, and . . . extend the law of England and Wales to personnel serving overseas and outside the jurisdiction of the civilian courts&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/6/06; col. 252.]</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/8">That is the basis on which this House is, so to speak, built.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/9">I shall cite two short passages from the speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, which support the principle of the amendment&mdash;there being as yet no provision in the Bill that gives effect to such appraisal. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/10" class="indent">&quot;In response to one of the important points made by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell, about the situation where a soldier makes a mistake, it is important for me to reassure the Committee that if a soldier acts in combat on his view of the situation, even if it is wrong, he will not be guilty of a crime. That is a fundamental principle, which we need to keep clearly in focus as we consider this matter&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/11">In the other passage, he stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/12" class="indent">&quot;The noble Lord, Lord Campbell, raises an important point when describing the similarity between orders and the detailed nature of rules of engagement. He has also emphasised the point to which I alluded at the beginning of my response, which is the importance of the intent to do wrong. The noble Lord is right. We have heard on the Floor of this House as we have debated this issue in the past how in combat this may be a split-second decision made in very difficult circumstances. I remember vividly the description that the noble Viscount made&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 11/10/06; col. 295-96.]</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/13">Unfortunately, the noble Viscount is not in his place.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/14">Those are the sort of twin pillars. It now comes to give but one example where, had the amendment been in force and this defence available, it would have saved a conviction for murder. I shall take it shortly because it was dealt with at some length in Committee. If this defence had been available to the Scots Guardsmen, Fisher and Wright, they would not have been convicted of murder, as their evidence on oath that they intended to comply with the orders, rules of engagement and training&mdash;they were both pretty young, so training was relevant&mdash;was wholly accepted by the Army board. It is quite obvious that if they had had that defence open to them, it would have been very unlikely that they would have been disbelieved on their oath.</p>
	<p pid="a.202.1/15">However, their only defence was self-defence&mdash;as to fear their murder by coffee jar bomb attack. That was rejected by the trial judge. There was no other defence. As it was a finding of fact, it foreclosed on any appeal to the Court of Appeal or application to the Appellate Committee of this House or to the CCRC to refer the case for reconsideration tothe Court of Appeal. A civil system of law had hit the buffers of its own making. The stain of a conviction for murder is indelible, unless there is fresh evidence. There was none. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.209.1/1">My Lords, it would be difficult for me to overstate the importance of this subject, which is why we have had a number of briefings on rules of engagement during the debates on this Bill. I am very grateful to noble Lords who have attended those briefings and discussions that we have had in this House and at the Ministry of Defence. So I will speak at some length on this matter. As we have debated the Bill, there have been clear differences of opinion on a number of issues, but on the matter of rules of engagement there has been a higher level of misunderstanding across the House than on any other issue, which is why we in the Ministry of Defence has taken so much trouble to try to explain to noble Lords the practical purpose of rules of engagement. Perhaps I may expand on that a little.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/2">Rules of engagement are key documents vital to the success of every operation. They are always classified to ensure that information about the way our forces will operate during a mission does not get into the public domain or into the hands of the enemy. Despite that, at a briefing held on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-23">23 October</phrase> for noble Lords, we took the unusual step of showing copies of actual rules of engagement for an operation. The reason we did that was to give noble Lords an opportunity to understand the way in which they are written, their complexity and their purpose. I think that those noble Lords who were able to attend the briefing found them illuminating and perhaps even surprising.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/3">Rules of engagement give our commanders the political and military framework to achieve their mission, including limits on the use of force. They must be consistent with the law, of course, but their purpose and even their language is operational. Rules of engagement are and must be flexible. They must not and do not tie commanders' hands unnecessarily. They leave important decisions to commanders on the ground and those commanders need and value this responsibility. Rules of engagement are more often than not specific to individual missions. No two profiles are the same. Crucially, they can be modified quickly to meet the needs of a changing threat or a changing mission. Rules of engagement must retain these key characteristics. If they do not, it would damage our operational effectiveness. To give rules of engagement statutory force in the way suggested here would be prejudicial to those characteristics on operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/4">Servicemen know that the rules of engagement will help them to conduct operations in a way consistent with the law, but each serviceman still has a responsibility to carry out his role lawfully. To that end, personnel rely on a combination of their training and detailed guidance. I shall address the points made just a moment ago by the noble Lady, Lady Saltoun, because she is absolutely right: it is vital for the individual soldier to have confidence in the basis on which he can operate so that, under pressure, he is able to make clear, split-second decisions with a level of confidence and clarity. But giving statutory force to the rules of engagement is not the way to achieve it.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/5">I recognise that Amendment No. 32 in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, seeks to safeguard the position of soldiers in combat. It would mean that a serviceman who opens fire during armed combat or peacekeeping is not guilty of unlawful killing unless he intended not to comply with an order or rule of engagement. This defence is to apply where the serviceman has acted mistakenly, but in good faith. I understand the intention, but orders and rules of engagement simply do not cover every situation in which a serviceman might open fire. I have tried to explain why rules of engagement should not be drafted to tell each soldier exactly what the law requires of him in every possible situation. To take a simple example, rules of engagement do not say, &quot;Do kill a prisoner&quot;; that is a matter for training. So I return to the principle: do noble Lords want rules of engagement to be legal documents or operational documents? They cannot be both.</p>
	<p pid="a.209.1/6">I turn to Amendment No. 33. This would give all rules of engagement the force of law. It is a pity that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, was not able to attend the briefing on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-23">23 October</phrase> because we went into some detail on this point. As we looked at the detail of rules of engagement, it was clear how it would be inappropriate to try to give them statutory force. As I have said, they have an operational purpose and they vary between operations. The amendment would mean that the law would change both between and during operations; that is, changing as swiftly as the operational situation changes. It would create a position of legal encirclement of our Armed Forces in a way which I am sure the noble Lord does not intend.</p>

	<p pid="a.231.3/1">My Lords, I gave notice to the Minister that I would wish to return to the detail of the Service Complaints Commissioner once we had had time to absorb the amendments, which came very late in Committee. We tabled amendments at that stage but we are now in a complex mix of the Government's proposals and the question of how we fill out some of the detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/2">I am most grateful for the Minister's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-24">24 October</phrase>, which gave some further information. But, as he said in that letter:</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/3" class="indent">&quot;This is very much work in progress and will continue to be developed in consultation with the single Services and others over the coming months&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/4">Time, of course, is very short as regards getting this provision into the Bill in a satisfactory structure. It would be helpful if the Minister could tell us who are the others to be consulted, as mentioned in his letter, apart from the Children's Commissioner. A question arises over whether the roles of the Children's Commissioner and the Service Complaints Commissioner are exactly parallel. However, I am aware that the Ministry of Defence has a history of thinking of members of the Armed Forces as children needing appropriate discipline and needing to be kept in order.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/5">The Minister's letter outlines a timescale for implementation&mdash;which, again, is helpful&mdash;with selection beginning next year for appointment by the end of 2007. It would be useful to have in the Bill a schedule of what is required for a person to be a service complaints commissioner. That is what my amendment attempts to do. As I said, it has been tabled in some haste because the Government's amendment came late and we had little time in which to respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/6">It is important that this new post should be defined in the right direction. Specifically, can the Minister tell us whether it will meet all the requirements of the Blake report, which considered the need for such a commissioner? For example, paragraph 12.101(iii) of the report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/7" class="indent">&quot;In an important case, the Commissioner should be able to institute legal proceedings to set aside legally flawed decisions not to prosecute&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.231.3/8">Is that the sort of commissioner that the Minister is proposing? I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-10-31a.232.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="232"  time="019:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61031-0002.htm#06103174000024">
	<p pid="a.232.1/1">My Lords, we now return to what I previously called a key part of the Bill, on which I have written to noble Lords. In speaking to Amendment No. 66, I shall also cover Amendments Nos. 67 and 72.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/2">I remain absolutely convinced that the appointment of a Service Complaints Commissioner under the Government's amendments moved in Committee is right for the way that the Armed Forces operate. It meets the overall objectives underpinning Mr Blake's recommendation in the Deepcut review, which sought to promote the effective operation of existing military proceedings, rather than to replace them and to provide independent assurance that the procedures are working as effectively as they can. It will provide the best solution for service personnel. They need to have confidence in a fair and efficient system. I believe that this is best achieved by the changes we are making in the Bill. They streamline the existing system and introduce independence where that is necessary. But they also retain a connection between redress and the services. I think it essential to retain the important role of the services in looking after the welfare and discipline of those under command.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/3">I would like to reiterate some of the main points of our proposed system. First, the Service Complaints Commissioner will have an important role in relation to allegations of bullying, harassment, and other forms of misconduct. The commissioner will be able to refer such complaints to the chain of command, which will then have to check with the alleged victim whether he or she wants to make a complaint. These allegations can be sent to the commissioner by the alleged victim or any other member of the public.So the Bill will provide an alternative to going straight to the chain of command. We will lay down in subordinate legislation, which will be subject to affirmative resolution, how the commissioner is to be kept informed about cases he has referred to the chain of command. This will also ensure that whoever contacted the commissioner about the case can also be kept informed of progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/4">There will be independent oversight by the commissioner of the performance of the system as a whole, with direct reports to Parliament and direct access to Ministers. Further, the independent element in the consideration of complaints related to bullying, harassment and other forms of misconduct will be provided by the presence of an independent member on service complaint panels. We have already talked about complaint panels and I now want to concentrate on the commissioner.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/5">As I have said previously, and I again stress here, although some of the proposals in AmendmentsNos. 66 and 72coincide with those of the Government, Amendment No. 72 goes beyond what is proposed by the Government. The noble Lord's amendments would involve the creation of a parallel system of complaint, controlled and directed by a commissioner. The relationship between its decisions and those of the internal redress system is not specified, but I suspect that having two systems would inevitably be complicated. The amendment leaves it to the Secretary of State to work out the details of this parallel or alternative system.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/6">However, these amendments would undermine the responsibility of the services for dealing with complaints and the parallel system they require would mean that some complaints would be dealt with under the internal system and some under the commissioner's. This could result, for example, in a lack of consistency in dealing with complaints; in the application of time limits; and ultimately, a significant and worrying decline in the ability of the services effectively to look after their own people.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/7">However, I share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Garden, expressed in the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-12">12 October</phrase>, that it will be crucial to ensure that the post of Service Complaints Commissioner is filled by an appropriate person. As such, we intend that this individual will be someone of the stature and experience appropriate to a post of this importance, as the noble Lord has said. We will consult the Children's Commissioner in line with the recommendation of the House of Commons Defence Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/8">We envisage that appointment will take place through public advertisement and a fair and open competition, and that the normal principles of the public appointments process will apply. We will consult further with any other persons whom we think can usefully contribute. We intend that the selection panel will include an external, independent element, and we are exploring the possibilities, including the opportunity for the selection panel to be chaired by a senior Civil Service commissioner. I remain convinced that the appointment should be made by the Secretary of State, as is the norm in comparable cases, and we see no reason to be different with this appointment.</p>
	<p pid="a.232.1/9">I also agree that the commissioner should be adequately resourced in order to give effect to the role. This will need to be kept under review in relation to the commissioner's workload as the role develops. As an individual officeholder, the commissioner will have the legal powers necessary to appoint staff. The commissioner's annual report will provide the commissioner with the opportunity to raise any concerns about resources and the ability adequately and effectively to carry out the role on that basis. I most firmly believe that the existing system will work fairly and efficiently, and that it will maintain the balance between the service role and the appropriate degree of independence in responding to complaints. I therefore ask the noble Lord to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.235.8/1">My Lords, AmendmentNo. 69 covers another important issue, so I would like to take a little time to speak to it. As your Lordships will recall, it is a variation on the issue of the responsibilities of the commanding officer as regards worrying about suspicious movements through his airfield. Your Lordships will have seen that the vice-president of the United States last week appeared to endorse the practice of interrogation using water-boarding as a &quot;no-brainer&quot;, to quote him. The evidence since we last discussed extraordinary rendition has been growing constantly. The new book by Stephen Grey, <I>Ghost Plane</I>, was featured in the <I>Guardian</I> of <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-26">26 October</phrase>. We have tried to get the Government to respond to these concerns in different ways, with amendments to the Civil Aviation Bill and the Police and Justice Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.8/2">I now have a much more limited aim: to ensure that military personnel are not implicated in this nightmare activity of extraordinary rendition. The debate we had in Committee was extraordinarily useful. The Government took their usual position that there is no problem because it is all covered by international treaties already. The Minister gave us reassurances that the military are not really at risk because all these flights are covered by diplomatic clearances; the commanding officer is thus absolved of responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.235.8/3">I was, however, less comforted once I re-read the views of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&mdash;I am pleased to see him in his place&mdash;whose knowledge of the law much exceeds mine:</p>
	<p pid="a.235.8/4" class="indent">&quot;I am in no doubt that if the commanding officer of any aerodrome in the United Kingdom had reason to believe that an in-transit aircraft was engaged in an act of external rendition, or there was a real risk that it was so engaged, he would be under a personal legally binding duty to investigate the matter, irrespective of any superior orders he had had to the contrary. Not to act, in those circumstances, would render him liableto prosecution for complicity in torture&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/10/06; cols. 439-440.]</p>
	<p pid="a.235.8/5">My amendment is a very mild one in some ways, to ensure that we do not end up in that situation. In Committee, the Minister was obviously less certain about the commanding officers' situation, as, one must assume, the commanding officers will be. The amendment permits the Defence Council to help commanding officers by issuing appropriate regulations, and reminds them of their legal responsibility. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.237.0/1">My Lords, the amendment once again raises issues such as extraordinary rendition, as well as international obligations. In the context of the Bill and the debate in Committee, however, the concern relates particularly to the responsibilities of commanding officers.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/2">I do not intend to add to what my noble friend Lord Triesman said on extraordinary rendition in general in the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-18">18 July</phrase>. Nor do I wish to add to what was said more recently, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October</phrase>, by my noble friend Lady Scotland. She made it clear, in the context of the Police and Criminal Justice Bill, that the Government are more than satisfied that the police already have sufficient legal powers. They are able to react to any intelligence suggesting that any offence under either UK domestic law or our international obligations is being committed when foreign aircraft transit through our jurisdiction, including our military airfields.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/3">I am afraid that Amendment No. 69 does not add anything to the law as it stands. As I have said, there are already sufficient legal powers to react to any intelligence that an offence is being committed. Any regulations that might be made under the proposed clause would not add to those powers. Propose subsection (2) of the amendment, again, adds nothing. Of course commanding officers, like anyone else, must not become parties to crime. We do not consider that there are any other international obligations which this clause could be referring to.</p>
	<p pid="a.237.0/4">I hope that what I have said adds to the debate and reassures noble Lords that this amendment is neither necessary nor desirable. There is already sufficient provision in domestic law to cover their concerns. I hope that, having raised the matter once more, the noble Lord feels able to withdraw the amendment.</p>
