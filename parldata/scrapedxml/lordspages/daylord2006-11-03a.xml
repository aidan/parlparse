<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-03a.511.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100699" speakername="Lord Woolmer of Leeds" colon=":" colnum="511"  time="011:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61103-0001.htm#06110350000009">
	<p pid="a.511.2/1">My Lords, first, I express the thanks of the sub-committee to our then Clerk, Anna Murphy, and our then committee specialist, Oriel Petry, for the excellent assistance that they both gave us in conducting the short inquiry that formedthe basis of our report. I also express my warm appreciation to all the members of Sub-Committee B for their diligent work on this inquiry and in producing the report.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/2">Our inquiry into the Seventh Framework Programme for Research was short, because of the pressure of other internal market issues before us at the time. We concentrated therefore on a small number of matters but recognise that there are many other important facets of research, development and innovation in Europe that we were unable to address. Today's debate may provide an opportunity for your Lordships to touch on some of these wider matters. I look forward in particular to the contributions of the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp of Guildford, and the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, who both bring enormous experience to debate on research issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/3">Member states of the European Union agree that strengthening the research base and increasing research and development as a proportion of gross domestic product is an important part of the Lisbon agenda aimed at ensuring that Europe can take on the challenges of an increasingly competitive global economy. The European Council and Commission aspire to increasing research and development in Europe from 1.9 per cent to 3 per cent of GDP by 2010, but in oral evidence, the Minister told us that the Commission has now lowered its expectations to an increase of just 2.6 per cent. In the United Kingdom, our figure is around the European average at 1.9 per cent, and two-thirds of that is done by companies. Research in universities and our research institutes makes a further valuable contribution, supported by public funding programmes and by the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/4">The latest research and development scoreboard published by the DTI recently analysed the top 1,250 global companies by research and development spend and the top 800 UK companies. Eighty-two per cent of global research and development is in companies based in just five countries&mdash;the USA, Japan, Germany, France and the United Kingdom&mdash;with Taiwan and South Korea growing significantly and China beginning to grow quickly from a verylow base. Sixty-one per cent of all that globalresearch and development is undertaken by the top 100 companies; and 70 per cent of all research and development is just in five sectors&mdash;technology hardware, pharmaceuticals, automotive, electronics and software&mdash;while aerospace and defence companies are growing research and development fastest. In this country, we are particularly strong in pharmaceuticals and aerospace with research and development in software and financial services companies growing in importance. Remarkably, of the top 800 research and development spending companies in this country, 119 are software businesses. Private sector investment is of course influenced by the general business and taxation environment&mdash;including taxation incentives&mdash;but also by the research and skills base of a country. It is important that the research skills base is maintained and grown. Our universities have an important part to play in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/5">At the European level, the main programmes to support research have been what are called the framework programmes. It has been said to me already today that that is not the most meaningful phrase to use to communicate with the general population, but that is the name given to the programmes. The sixth programme, covering five years, ends on <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase>. The seventh programme, which will cover seven years, comes into full operation on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January</phrase> next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/6">The budget for the seventh programme over seven years is some &euro;54 billion&mdash;about &euro;7.7 billion per annum. That compares with around &euro;5 billion a year in the sixth programme, a significant increase reflecting the importance attached to it by the Council of Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/7">Chapter 1 of our report summarises the research and development programmes. There are four broad objectives. The first is to support co-operation between industry, universities, research centres and public bodies to gain leadership in key scientific and technological areas. This is allocated 60 to 65 per cent of the budget. The second is to promote and fund basic frontier research. This will be the responsibility of a new European Research Council, which I shall say more about later. This will take 15 to 20 per cent of the budget. The third is to train and to provide mobility and careers development for researchers through a range of schemes, known generally as the Marie Curie schemes, and will take 10 per cent of the budget. The fourth is to strengthen research and innovation capacity throughout Europe. This will take the final 10 per cent of the budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/8">Funding is expected to support nine priority themes, which are set out in paragraph 12 on page 8 of our report. In addition, the seventh framework programme covers the Euratom research framework programme, although the committee did not consider that in its inquiry. We invited and received written evidence from the CBI and Research Councils UK and took oral evidence from the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, the Minister responsible for this policy area. In our discussion with the Minister, we covered seven issues, set out in paragraph 18 of our report. Your Lordships will be aware that we took his oral evidence in February this year. That is a long time ago now, and things will have moved on in several areas. No doubt the Minister today will bring us up to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/9">On the overall budget, we sought to clarify the likely outcome of the then gap between the Commission's initial budget proposal for some&euro;76 billion and the likelihood that this would be reduced significantly. The final outcome, as we now know, is a budget of some &euro;54 billion over seven years. This is still a significant increase, which we welcome. In its written evidence to us, the CBI told us that there was little evidence that the research framework programmes have given Europe a widespread economic advantage, and still less evidence of directly attributable competitive gains for UK businesses. In his oral evidence to us, the Minister took a more positive view of the impact and importance of these research programmes, but acknowledged that, although industry still participated in the European programme, he was concerned that participation by industry in the UK and across the EU had reduced in the last five-year programme. Will the Minister reassure the CBI today by giving practical examples of where past research programmes have borne practical results in innovation and products in the market place? It is always dangerous to expect results too quickly, but we are now on the seventh programme and we should be able to convince industry that this really does pay off.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/10">The Minister agreed with the CBI that the largest part of the new programme should concentrate on research aimed at more direct applications andshould be industry-driven. He told us that these objectives would be met by placing industry at the heart of European technology platforms chargedwith identifying large-scale industrial research and development challenges and with developing a strategy&mdash;the so-called strategic research agendas&mdash;to deal with them. Crucially, the Minister strongly supported the proposal that the most important of those strategic agendas should be taken forward by joint technology initiatives&mdash;long-term private-public partnerships. We discuss these very important matters on page 12 of our report.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/11">The joint technology initiatives are a major change in the identification and delivery of improved research that is of more immediate value to industry. We welcome this new approach. It will be criticalto improving the participation of industry in a European research agenda, and to the success or failure of the seventh framework programme, so far as industry is concerned. Difficult though it is, more effort should be made to set clearer target outcomes and timelines on investments through the joint technology initiatives. When we met the Minister, he was unsure what monitoring and reporting systems would be in place for the initiatives. Will he tell your Lordships today whether there has been any progress in this area? He also conceded that businesses believe that the framework programmes are too complex and bureaucratic and that changes must be made. The Government's response to our report gives more detail on how, in their view, the Commission is seeking to tackle this problem. Is he optimistic that good words will turn into good deeds?</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/12">The second broad objective of the framework programme is to promote and fund basic frontier research. To this end, the European Research Council has been established and a scientific council appointed as an academic body to determine the council's strategic strategy and to ensure that it operates on the basis of scientific excellence. As many of your Lordships will be aware, the scientific council will be chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Patten of Barnes, and two of the 22 members of the council&mdash;the noble Lord, Lord May of Oxford, and Professor Wendy Hall of Southampton University&mdash;are from the UK. We welcome the establishment of the European Research Council, and the strength of its scientific council is greatly encouraging. It can make a real difference to developing a coherent and productive programme of European frontier research. It is vital that its independence is strongly upheld in the years ahead, and that its decisions will always be based on excellence and merit.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/13">My committee was less persuaded by the Commission's proposal for the establishment of a European institute of technology. When the proposal was initially floated, it appeared to be modelled on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. There had been considerable doubts about the idea of creating a top-down academic institution. In his oral evidence, at question 68 on page 11 of the minutes of oral evidence, the Minister told us:</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/14" class="indent">&quot;I think the idea of a European Institute of Technology is quite unhelpful, frankly. We remain very sceptical about it&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/15">Many commentators emphasised the need to strengthen existing universities and research institutes across Europe in order to ensure that more of them are world class and to strengthen further those that are already world class.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/16">Since we reported, the European Council invited the Commission to bring forward a formal proposal, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October</phrase>. It aims to have a European institute of technology in place by 2009. In October, the president of the vice-chancellor's organisation of Universities UK commented that although the proposal is now better defined, they still have some serious reservations. First, will funding of the European institute of technology impact onthe European Research Council's budget and its priorities? Secondly, what problems will there be if the institute of technology seeks to award its own degrees? Thirdly, will it really add value or will it threaten some of the many collaborations which already exist between universities and industry? What is the present view of the Government on the proposal and what answers would the Minister give Universities UK on its continuing concerns?</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/17">The third objective of the framework is to strengthen training, mobility and careers development for researchers within the context of promoting excellence in European research. This will continue to be delivered through Marie Curie schemes in order to develop research skills and training capacity, which we warmly welcome. The UK research councils told us that these programmes have been strongly beneficial to the United Kingdom and have added value at the European level. They had some concerns about the topping up of national programmes and how that is affected by the European scheme. What progress has been made in meeting the concerns of the UK research councils?</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/18">The final area of interest to our committee was the relationship between the EU competitiveness and innovation programme, EU industrial policies, structural funds and these research programmes. Each of these is of great importance, but they offer the potential for overlap, confusion, and complexity. The Minister told us that the Government shared our concern. In September, the Commission publisheda European Union innovation strategy&mdash;<I>Putting knowledge into practice: A broad-based innovation strategy for the EU</I>. My committee awaits legislative proposals in this area and will look carefully at these matters as well as at the positive benefits that a vigorous and well constructed innovation strategycan bring.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/19">Research and development lie at the heart of competitiveness, improving standards of living and the quality of lives. The framework programmes are just part of responding to the challenges and just part of the solution, but they are an important initiative at the European level and demonstrate the value of strengthening our diverse but large internal market in ideas and research communities. I look forward enormously to the debate. I beg to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.511.2/20">Moved, That this House takes note of the report of the European Union Committee on the <I>Seventh Framework Programme for Research</I> (33rd Report, HL Paper 182).&mdash;(<I>Lord Woolmer of Leeds</I>.)</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-03a.530.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100836" speakername="Lord De Mauley" colon=":" colnum="530"  time="012:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61103-0003.htm#06110350000094">
	<p pid="a.530.0/1">My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, on securing this debate today, and apologise to him and to your Lordships for my delayed arrival. I add my thanks for the work he, as chairman, and his sub-committee have done in producing this very useful report. It has exposed some serious issues, many of which have been referred to by noble Lords today, and on which we look forward to the Minister's responses. This debate is particularly appropriate so shortly after a study by the DTI, to which the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, referred, that showed that Britain is losing ground against countries both within and outside the EU in the R&amp;D race, casting doubt on the effectiveness of government policies to incentivise research spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.0/2">This debate has enabled your Lordships to consider the Commission's detailed plans for the seventh framework programme for research andtheir potential implications. This is an important framework programme, particularly because of its focus on energy and, in light of the Stern review, climate change. I am sure noble Lords will agree that climate change is one of the key challenges we face, and we need technological developments to help us tackle it.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.0/3">Inextricably linked to climate change, and one of the foundations of our economy, is electricity generation. We need new technologies to provide new, cheap, clean electricity generation. I am pleased that funds have been allocated to Euratom-related research. The European Atomic Energy Commission is carrying out research to demonstrate the viability of fusion as a future energy option to meet the needs of a growing world population. The relative abundance of fuel resources, the inherent safety aspects and the environmental friendliness of fusion are all reasons why Europe and the large nations of the world are so interested in it. In the area of energy more generally, I am also pleased to see hydrogen and fuel cells being specified by the Government as among their priorities for joint technology initiatives.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.0/4">I share many of the committee's views and concerns. I join them in applauding the intention to simplify the programme, reduce bureaucracy and deliver genuine improvements for the participant, including the academic community, while at the same time increasing the involvement of, and support for, industry. The dynamism of the European economy is increasingly dependent on investment in education, R&amp;D and innovation. However, while understanding the assertion that the encouragement of experimentation in research can be undesirably frustrated by demands for justification of every cent of expenditure, there is on the other hand a considerable danger that the remoteness of decision-making on spending from the ultimate provider of funds, the hard-pressed taxpayer, can lead to insufficiently rigorous justification of such spending decisions. Indeed, there has been agreement in the debate today that it is essential that FP7 is transparent and accountable.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.0/5">While I join the sub-committee in welcoming the increased funding for FP7, then, I do so with an important caveat: increased funding needs also to be efficient funding. One way of trying to form at least a partial judgment on that is to look at historical performance. As the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, asked, what work have the Government done to gauge the efficiency of the use of money in FP6 and earlier frameworks, and what plans exist to review regularly the use of FP7 money?</p>
	<p pid="a.530.0/6">Among other serious questions the CBI asked, it mentioned its concerns at increasing the budget so dramatically over FP6 without a sound cost/benefit analysis. We share its concerns that some areas of industry believe that no competitive gain for UK business has been attributed to EU research programmes. We note the Government's response to that. Will the Minister give an assurance that there will be regular reviews of the extent to which the Commission's assurances in this regard on FP7 are honoured? What consultation do the Government plan to undertake with regard to concerns expressed in the report and its evidence about national mobility programmes? Subject to that, and to the resolution of certain industry concerns, we welcome the proposal to reinvigorate the Marie Curie fellowship scheme, and would like to see it given equal priority with European technology platforms, joint technology initiatives and the European Research Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.0/7">Will the Minister update the House on the joint technology initiatives, and in particular whether Research Councils UK has held discussions with the UK industrial and academic communities about the demand for technology platforms, as suggested in paragraph 35 of the report? Also, as the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, asked, have more concrete plans now been made to put in place monitoring and reporting systems to safeguard these projects?</p>
	<p pid="a.530.0/8">The CBI mentioned its concern that the European Research Council must serve scientific priorities, as opposed to political ones. It must concern itself with challenges that cannot be tackled at national level, and place a strong emphasis on supporting business needs. The Government's response to the report indicated that there was provision for a mid-term review by 2010 of the operations of the ERC, which would allow an assessment of the adequacy of procedures to ensure its performance and its independence. We question whether waiting three years or more is necessary to allow a proper assessment of these things. Furthermore, if such a review finds the ERC to be lacking, what step will Her Majesty's Government take?</p>
	<p pid="a.530.0/9">I turn briefly to the space and security programme discussed in chapter 3, over which, as my noble friend Lord Bowness mentioned, there are some serious concerns. I look forward to the Minister's response to them. I note that both the committee and the Home Secretary accept Commissioner Verheugen's letteris a,</p>
	<p pid="a.530.0/10" class="indent">&quot;significant statement which goes a long way towards alleviating our concerns&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.0/11">Has that letter been placed on the official record in the European Parliament?</p>
	<p pid="a.530.0/12">I note in paragraph 77 the rather interesting wording that the budget line for space and security under FP7 has not yet been agreed, but will need to be reduced. What progress has been made, and what steps do the Government plan to take if they are not happy with the outcome?</p>
	<p pid="a.530.0/13">The Government's response to the report accepts the recommendations made on this issue in paragraph 78. What cross-departmental discussions have been held in Government to date? After all, a joined-up approach is essential on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.0/14">The Government said that they were sceptical of the Commission's proposal to establish a European Institute of Technology. We shared that scepticism, as did the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, and other noble Lords. Nevertheless, the Commission adopted the proposal on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October</phrase>. The proposal, as the noble Baroness, Lady Sharp, mentioned, has changed to a more virtual concept than that which was originally proposed, but it will still involve considerable investment. The EIT must demonstrate beyond any doubt that it adds value, creates new projects, and does not either reinvent wheels or divert funding from other valuable research.</p>
	<p pid="a.530.0/15">As regards a time frame for FP7, previous framework programmes for research have run for five years, whereas this one is proposed to run for seven years. I would be interested to hear the Minister's views on the merits of that proposal. Seven years has the advantage that it provides a longer-term investment framework for businesses, but there may be other considerations. There can be no doubt, as the report states, that efforts to strengthen the research base and activity are important for the competitive position of the European Union and of course the United Kingdom, as a member. But we cannottalk about competitiveness without discussing productivity. Redesign of the nuts and bolts of an organisation or an industry is in some eyes just as important as innovation. It increases productivity and thus competitiveness. Blue sky thinking and research need to go hand in hand with improved efficiency of processes and a serious look at the burden of regulation, which can depress productivity. I hope that the Minister will agree with me on this point and inform your Lordships what discussions he has had on this matter during negotiations on FP7. Will he also expand on the extent to which he is comfortable that the competitiveness and innovation programme has been properly integrated with existing programmes, such as the framework programme, the EU industrial policy and structural funds. Is he satisfied that the problems inherent in current initiatives have been adequately addressed?</p>
	<p pid="a.530.0/16">Finally, in my quest to highlight poor use of English, I draw attention to the phrase &quot;non-report&quot;, which appears more than once in the letter from the then-Home Secretary on page 22. I am sure that this phrase has been used for many years, and I understand the meaning attributed to it, but seen in the cold light of day one surely must agree that it has a certain flavour of Edward Lear, or perhaps more relevantly Hilaire Belloc, about it. I am pleased, however, that there have been no non-speeches today. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Woolmer, for initiating this valuable debate. We on these Benches will be keeping a careful eye on the progress of the FP7 discussions. I look forward to hearing the Minister's comments on the many questions raised and the assurances sought today.</p>

	<p pid="a.540.2/1">My Lords, I want to make it absolutely clear that I am not opposing the order, but simply using the device of praying against it to discuss some of the problems of enlisting social landlords in the provision and management of Gypsy sites. This is not a simple matter, as one can see from the fact that it was two and a half years ago when the then Minister, Yvette Cooper, said in another place that she would amend the purposes for which the Housing Corporation could provide funding to include the construction, maintenance and management of these sites. We agree with that policy, which we advocated under the heading &quot;Enlisting Social Landlords&quot;, in a document that the Liberal Democrats published in 2002, although we do not claim any particular monopoly of the idea, which was widely canvassed at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.540.2/2">At a meeting last week with the Minister, Gypsy and Traveller organisation representatives expressed disappointment that it was taking so long to get in place the new system of site provision, of which this order is an essential component. The delay in bringing forward the order was occasioned by the need to consult on the definition of Gypsies and Travellers. As your Lordships' Merits of Statutory Instruments Select Committee explained in its useful memorandum on the subject, we now have two definitions, for reasons which are comprehensible but which may lead to some confusion. The one used here is based on nomadism rather than ethnicity, but it is extended to include those who are no longer nomadic because of illness or old age, and travelling showmen, who I am glad are included because frequently in the past they have been left out of these discussions. It includes people who are not Romany Gypsies or Irish Travellers but who follow a cultural tradition of nomadism or living in caravans. For the purposes of the Housing Act, under which local authorities are required to assess the accommodation needs of Gypsies and Travellers in their areas, a broader definition was needed to encompass ethnic Gypsies and Irish Travellers, many of whom are permanently settled either voluntarily or because of the huge difficulty of following a nomadic way of life now that it is unlawful to stop anywhere except on transit sites, which are few and far between.</p>
	<p pid="a.540.2/3">The first thing to say about the order is that social landlords are not expected to make provision for ethnic Gypsies who may be tempted to resume living in a caravan because of the greater availability of land for Gypsy sites as a result of the permissions that will be granted following the implementation of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act. Yet there may be cases where extended families, some of whose members are in bricks and mortar and others on caravan sites, would like to be reunited on a site provided by a social landlord. Is the order flexible enough to cope with that kind of demand, when some people may come from bricks and mortar and others from substandard sites or sites that are to be eliminated?</p>
	<p pid="a.540.2/4">Secondly, at the recent meeting between the All-Party Group on Gypsy and Traveller Law Reform and Meg Munn MP, it was made clear that the priority for social landlords would be to cater for those among the 3,000 families living on unauthorised sites who will be unable to buy landto develop sites for themselves when the landfinally becomes available following the completion of the needs assessments and the incorporation of the numbers resulting from those assessments in the regional spatial strategies. It will be many years before Travellers who are living on some of the grossly unsatisfactory sites provided under the 1968 Act&mdash;some of which are next to sewage works or under motorways&mdash;can be rehoused. As far as I can see, there is nothing in the order to prevent schemes to rehouse people from sink sites. If they are identified as needing to be rehoused in the needs assessments, social landlords might well have a role to play. I hope that the Minister will say something about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.540.2/5">In some areas, local authority sites are being closed without alternative provision for the residents being made. In London, there has been a sharp decline in the number of pitches: 76 were lost in the 10 years to 2004, according to the London Gypsy and Traveller group and sites in Newham and Hackney on land needed for the Olympic Games are threatened with imminent closure, with no agreement on how they are to be relocated. It would be ironic if the Olympic Games, which were touted as a means of reducing social deprivation in London, were to decrease further the supply of accommodation for the most deprived community of all. I hope that Ministers will knock heads together, particularly in the LDA, to see that that does not happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.540.2/6">I mentioned that case to indicate that the longer it takes to mobilise social landlords, the bigger the task confronting them will be. They cannot really get going until the local authority has been through the needs assessment and has produced the development plan document identifying the land needed for the purpose. In the mean while, they might occasionally be able to use Circular 1/06, as described in the Planning Inspectorate letter of <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-24">24 July</phrase>, to get planning permission on suitable land that has not yet been designated in the DPD. However, as with private individuals, that approach means additional trouble and expense and might sour relationships between social landlords and local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.540.2/7">That brings me to the question of whether RSLs are going to come forward in sufficient numbers and with sufficient resources to match the need. During the passage of the Housing Bill, the Government rejected a proposal to give local authorities a reserve power to develop sites in areas where the need for rented pitches was not being met, so RSLs are assumed to be capable of rising to the challenge and providing rented sites throughout the country. At the meeting of the all-party group, we were told that there were new entrants&mdash;until recently, Novas has had the field to itself. Who are those new entrants, in what areas of the country are they operating and what sites have they provided or are in the course of providing? What efforts is the DCLG making to enlist new providers?</p>
	<p pid="a.540.2/8">At that meeting, we raised the problem of rising land prices, which are likely to create problems for RSLs as well as for private developers of sites. Once the land has been identified in a DPD, its value is likely to be considerably higher than it would be for agricultural land, which would have to be reflected in the rent charged by the RSL. In the case of county council and RSL-owned sites, which have been brought under a procrustean system of regulation so that the amount of housing benefit payable is less than the economic rent, many existing sites are now loss-making, and there is no incentive for social landlords to develop new sites where the rents would need to be higher if they cannot recover the amounts from tenants who are on benefit. Research carried out for the DWP led to a recommendation that the allowable rent for benefit purposes on all Gypsy sites should be increased by &pound;15 per pitch to reflect the cost of management on the site, depending on its attainment of quality standards for maintenance and health and safety. Families who need a lot of support will not be well catered for under these arrangements and the assumption that all Gypsy sites require the same amount of management resources is manifestly untrue. RSLs would naturally tend to offer places on their sites to Gypsies who they think will not give rise to major problems, leaving difficult families who need a lot of support to fend for themselves. The arrangements recommended by Spark are not flexible enough to cope with the wide range of situations, and it would be preferable to abolish rent controls for social and local authority landlords, who may be expected to act responsibly without that incentive.</p>
	<p pid="a.540.2/9">I welcome the extension of funding for Gypsyand Traveller sites to RSLs as well as local authorities&mdash;&pound;28 million will be available in 2006-07 and &pound;35 million will be available in the following year in order to provide new sites or refurbish existing ones. The extent to which RSLs were involved inthe bids for the current year and their expressionsof interest for 2006-07, which had to be in by<phrase class="date" code="2006-09-30">30 September</phrase>, would be an indication of their likely interest in the Housing Corporation funding resulting from this order. I would be grateful if the Minister could give us the figures. It would also be useful to know how many RSLs have constitutions that allow them to take on the provision of Gypsy and Traveller sites or have applied for consent to the necessary changes to their constitutions under paragraphs 9 to 11 of Schedule 1 to the Housing Act 1996.</p>
	<p pid="a.540.2/10">When we meet Gypsies and Travellers, as in the meeting with the Minister last week, they are naturally sceptical about the ultimate success of the strategy for ensuring that members of their communities have a place to live. Inevitably, residents in the neighbourhood of unauthorised encampments are dissatisfied with the rate of progress that is being made. It is important that the Government should keep both sets of people informed of what is being done, and this order is one essential piece of the jigsaw.</p>
	<p pid="a.540.2/11">Moved, That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the order, laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-26">26 July</phrase>, be annulled (S.I. 2006/1968).&mdash;(<I>Lord Avebury</I>.)</p>

	<p pid="a.547.2/1">My Lords, I do not support the proposals that the Government have set out in the local probation boards SI. It would be better for our criminal justice system if the Government withdrew them today so that both Houses can debate them constructively and effectively within the context of our forthcoming scrutiny of the Management of Offenders and Sentencing Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/2">These regulations are due to come into force on<phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November</phrase>&mdash;well, they have. That shows a measure of the problem for this House in scrutinising legislation and negative instruments when they are already law. They will significantly change the membership and governance of the 42 local probation boards in England and Wales. Yet when the Explanatory Memorandum to the statutory instrument was first published, it was opaque to the extent that it was misleading. That was poor practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/3">The report of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee states that the memorandum gave no adequate explanation for the changes or how they would affect the rehabilitation of offenders and the service provided to the community. The committee therefore asked for better information. It is only as a result of their work that we have been provided with the supplementary information given by the Home Office to the committee. As a result of scrutinising that, I still do not believe that the Home Office has yet made a case for the regulations before us today.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/4">The boards are a comparatively recent innovation, established by the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000. Yet the Government now wish to rip them up and start again, without even carrying out any evaluation of the existing governance, as far as I can see. If they have, where is it? Why has Parliament not been allowed to see it?</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/5">In addition, there has been no formal public consultation exercise. Why? Because the Home Office says,</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/6" class="indent">&quot;we did not consider that one was required for this Statutory Instrument&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/7">The Home Office was wrong. They should have carried out an effective consultation on what constitutes a significant policy change.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/8">Why make these changes now? If the Government intend to abolish the boards anyway as part of the National Offender Management Service Bill reorganisation, why not wait until that has been properly scrutinised by Parliament. What are they afraid of that makes them act with this haste?</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/9">At present, each probation board has up to15 members comprising a chair, the chief officer, a judge appointed by the Lord Chancellor, and 12 other members, of whom four, where practicable, should be magistrates and two elected members of a local authority. The quorum is seven. They were created to provide local accountability through the agreementof strategic objectives and the monitoring of performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/10">The regulations make three main changes, all of which are unnecessary and will damage the quality of work carried out by the boards. First, the quorum will be reduced to five, allowing smaller boards to beput in place. Since 2001, probation has beenmoving towards increased local involvement with communities and the boards have drawn membership from a wide cross section of the population. That has been beneficial. Therefore, it is obvious that if the Government now reduce that representation that must have a negative effect on the level and scope of local involvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/11">The Government say that the new boards will be seen as businesses. What exactly do they meanby this? Many current members have extensive experience in private sector business, but they recognise that while they must run their services in a business-like fashion, when it comes to running a justice agency, many decisions are simply not primarily business decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/12">Secondly, it is intended that it will no longer be necessary for four members to be magistrates. But the primary customer of the service is the local courts, so that is also a retrograde step. Magistrates sentence on behalf of very local populations. I note that the Magistrates' Association is opposed to that change. I have read the letter that John Thornhill, chairman of the Judicial Policy and Practice Committee, sentto Richard Cullen at the National Probation Directorate. Mr Thornhill wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/13" class="indent">&quot;we are all dismayed at the suggested changes to the SI and bewildered at the suggestion within the context of stressing how much magistrate membership of Probation Boards is welcomed and valued&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/14">Thirdly, it is intended that two local authority members will no longer be necessary. Partnerships with the local police and local authority are at the heart of modern probation practice. It is increasingly necessary for close liaison, joint funding and joint planning through local area agreements. So it is not surprising that that change is opposed by the Local Government Association. Councillor Hazel Harding, chair of the LGA Safer Communities Board, wrote to Mr Cullen to express its opposition to it. She points out:</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/15" class="indent">&quot;Councillor members of Probation Boards are essential because they provide local accountability and strengthen partnership working, as well as bringing a range of skills from their experiences as councillors and their diverse professional backgrounds...Removing the requirement for councillor representation on local Probation Boards runs contrary to the recognition given by other parts of the HO of the need for local political leadership on crime and disorder matters&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/16">We have just witnessed that very focus from the Home Office in our discussion of the Police and Justice Bill, which has now successfully gone through this House. There, the Government drew back from some changes. They have reinstated magistrates of right on police authorities and at the request of the Association of Police Authorities, retained the authority of police authorities to make their own appointments. So there is recognition in other parts of the Home Office of the value of magistrates, local authorities and local councillors, yet here, we see the reverse happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/17">The regulations will weaken local involvement in criminal justice, begin the process of centralising probation governance on Whitehall and remove the critical local partners on whom effective work with offenders depends. It will do all that even before Parliament has the chance to consider the proposals in the NOMS Bill&mdash;a rather inelegant title&mdash;which we expect to be published by the end of this month. It is wrong of the Government to take action to pre-empt that debate. The Government should think again. They should withdraw the order, engage in proper consultation, and listen to the views of Parliament when we debate the legislation&mdash;in November, December, or whenever it reaches Parliament. Then and only then should they bring forward proposals to alter the structure and character of probation boards. I beg to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.547.2/18">Moved, That this House regrets the proposals set out in the Local Probation Boards (Appointment and Miscellaneous Provisions) (Amendment) Regulations 2006 (S.I. 2006/2664) and calls upon Her Majesty's Government to withdraw the statutory instrument and to enable consideration of the proposals contained in it by each House of Parliament in the context of primary legislation on the management of offenders [<I>46th Report from the Merits Committee</I>].&mdash;(<I>Baroness Anelay of St Johns</I>.)</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-03a.556.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100610" speakername="Baroness Stern" colon=":" colnum="556"  time="014:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61103-0006.htm#06110350000232">
	<p pid="a.556.0/1">My Lords, I support the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, wholeheartedly and am very grateful for the interventions of the noble Viscount, Lord Eccles, and all the other speakers. This measure seems to be based on a profound misunderstanding of what makes probation successful. The Government's policies on probation have slowly but inexorably moved it away from its base in local communities and diminished its relationship with the magistrates' courts, yet those two relationships are crucial for its success. It is important to remember what probation has to offer to those whom it aims to supervise, control and reintegrate into society. It actually has nothing to offer except for its skills, persuasiveness and contacts. It cannot provide someone with a GP or a roof over their head; it is not an education provider and it cannot give anyone a job. It does not have the resources to sort out a family problem&mdash;that is the job of social services. It has no mental health or drug treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.556.0/2">Rightly, those services are all provided by various local agencies, most by the local authorities and some by the health service. Some are obtainable only through good local knowledge and local connections. Without that local knowledge, those local connections and some local legitimacy at a time when resources are under pressure, probation officers can do nothing for those whom they supervise except listen to them, advise them, assess their risk and redirect them elsewhere for what they really need.</p>
	<p pid="a.556.0/3">Similarly, there is the relationship with the magistrates' courts, which is even more extraordinary. The relationship between the probation service and the courts is crucial; it has to be one of considerable trust, built up over time. Never has it been more important&mdash;and I am sure that the Home Office understands this&mdash;that probation officers should be able to make recommendations for community sentences that the courts have confidence in. How else are the Government going to deal with the massive overuse of prisons?</p>
	<p pid="a.556.0/4">Over the years, the magistrates on probation boards have been vital supporters of probation and made its case with their colleagues on the Bench. They have been supporters of the probation service in the wider community. Magistrates are respected figures in local communities, with considerable legitimacy. How will a probation board with no magistrates or local authority representatives establish the relationships that it needs?</p>
	<p pid="a.556.0/5">There are other issues of legitimacy and propriety. Probation officers exercise considerable powers over the liberty of the subject. They can recall someone to prison on their own initiative. The person can stay there for weeks or even months before the Parole Board gets round to looking at the case, because, as I understand it, the Parole Board is swamped with such cases. Should these powers be exercised by a body whose governance contains no judicial persons&mdash;unless the Minister tells me that judges are to continue to sit on boards, even when they have begun to be described as businesses?</p>
	<p pid="a.556.0/6">Finally, I echo other speakers in asking: is it appropriate that this order is being debated on a Friday afternoon by this process? It is a vital matter of the governance of an organisation that last year spent &pound;0.9 billion on its work and it is of considerable importance to whether or not people can live safely in their communities. Should such changes not be debated properly by Parliament? Is this not rather an unacceptable way in which to sneak in some changes? I wondered whether the word &quot;sneaking&quot; was appropriate to use in this House but, having heard it used by my noble friend Lord Tenby, I am sure that it is. Surely this is a sneaky way for the Government to try and get through a part of a much larger plan, for which we have not yet seen the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.556.0/7">I hope the Government take note of the strengthof feeling expressed here and the opposition of the Magistrates' Association, the Local Government Association and all organisations that know anything of how the probation service works to make our society safer. I hope that the Government will reflect on the damage that they are doing here today, or that they did on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-01">1 November</phrase>. I support the Motion of the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay.</p>

	<p pid="a.559.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful for the attention and interest that the issue has aroused in your Lordships' House. I thank all those who have contributed to the debate. I felt as if we were debating a Bill that has yet to be announced and is probably yet to be drafted; it has certainly not yet seen the light of day. However, it is anxiously anticipated. We shall probably debate at length many of the issues that were raised when and if&mdash;many of your Lordships expect that this will happen&mdash;a Bill on the National Offender Management Service is introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/2">I shall try to restrict my comments to the matter before us and to the Motion that the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, has properly brought forward for our consideration. Everybody who contributed to the debate was aware that the regulations were subject to comments in the 46th report of the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee published last week. Before I explain the background to the regulations, I express my sincere apologies that the standard of the Explanatory Memorandum fell below that expected by the committee, and that it did not contain sufficient background detail. I apologise unreservedly for that. The Home Office has taken steps to remedy that and has put more information in an expanded memorandum. I hope that those who have had the opportunity to study it consider that the extra information is valuable. It was certainly intended to be. It was not in any way the Home Office's intention to show disrespect to the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee or to sell people short, as it were, in providing the information that was properly required.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/3">That said, it is important to put the regulations in context. The purpose of the amendments is to ensure that from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase> the regulations governing the membership of probation boards match the competencies and skills that will be required for boards to deliver in an environment of public value partnerships, mixed economy and competition. They amend the period for which a board chair or member can be appointed from three years to a period not exceeding three years and reduce the number of board members required for a local probation board meeting to be quorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/4">While this statutory instrument does not seek to pre-empt any future legislation in respect of the National Offender Management Service, it seeks to ensure that boards have the skills they require to operate in the current increasingly complexand competitive environment. Although these amendments have the advantage of preparing probation boards for the transition to the envisaged probation trusts, we obviously wish to address immediate improvements in performance through the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/5">The recently published <I>Public Value Partnerships</I> document requires probation boards to focus on public protection and the management of high risk offenders. As part of this strategy, boards will be required to increase their level of subcontracting to10 per cent in 2007-08. That means that boardswill require extra expertise on purchasing and commissioning standards. It is essential that boards are able to fulfil that function successfully. Skills in business acumen will ensure that boards have the necessary expertise to move forward confidently to meet future expectations and challenges.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/6">I do not think that should simply be read as meaning that we want those boards to be just like a business; that is not the intention. What we are after is adding something to the current range of skills that are quite properly contained in those boards. We certainly acknowledge that the boards have performed well; but in this era of expanded commissioning and the development of a more mixed economy in terms of service provision, added acumen must be an important feature of those boards.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/7">Each House of Parliament will, of course, have the opportunity fully to consider primary legislation in the proposed Bill relating to the National Offender Management Service and the future of probation boards. The proposed legislation will create probation trusts, which will be public sector providers subject to competition and contestability. Should legislation be successfully passed, the Government do not envisage a &quot;big bang&quot; move to probation trusts, but a phased approach over a period of years. The regulations address the period from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase>, with, at the earliest, some boards converting to trusts in 2008. That change is obviously reliant on legislation, but it is seen as part of a longer-term process. The regulations will allow boards to develop their skills and expertise, not just to meet the requirement of the public value partnerships document, but to allow them to be effective public sector providers in a future of mixed economy, commissioning and contestability.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/8">I will give noble Lords some brief background to why we seek to make the changes. When the statutory instruments governing the formation of probation boards were written in 2000 and 2001, they took into account the previous funding arrangements between central and local government, and they were intended to be a bridge between what had gone before and the new wholly centrally funded boards. It was therefore decided that each board would, where practicable, have four magistrate members and two local councillors. I wish the House to be quite clear that the regulation in respect of magistrate and councillor members does not minimise the value that we place on their contribution to probation boards. It is clear that each board will wish to retain magistrate and councillor members wherever possible, but we also need to ensure that they bring with them an understanding of the needs of greater business sensitivity to improve the performance of the probation service.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/9">Why are we seeking to introduce these regulations now? Board chairs and members are appointed to hold office for a maximum of two three-year terms, and thus a substantial number of chairs and board members who were appointed in 2001 will come to the end of their terms of office on <phrase class="date" code="">31 March 2007</phrase>, and a major campaign is under way to recruit their replacements. The regulations allow flexibility in the length of appointment of up to three years, rather than a fixed period of three years. When this recruitment exercise was initially discussed, several boards identified an opportunity to reduce the quorum of board meetings, leading to smaller, more effective boards. Legislation requires that probation boards have a membership of between seven and15 members. Some 36 of the 42 boards have opted to reduce the number of board members, and that is most easily achieved if we reduce the present quorum of board meetings from seven to five. It is a positive message that local boards want smaller boards anda reduced quorum at meetings. Now, with the recruitment campaign under way, this is the right opportunity and environment in which to make the changes outlined in the regulations.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/10">To facilitate the preferred reduction in the size of boards, we need to rebalance the board profile. In addition to the chair, the chief officer and the judge appointed by the Department for Constitutional Affairs, the board would lack balance if it were to maintain the block of four magistrate and two councillor members. This inflexibility regarding membership creates a lack of local choice. A number of Members have already referred to the importance of partnership, and we place a very heavy reliance on that because we see it as having great value. We believe in the importance of local choice; and that is what we want to ensure in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/11">With no reduction in the current arrangement, there would be a board of nine&mdash;the chair, the chief officer, the judge, four magistrates and two councillors&mdash;and if a board wanted to reduce its total membership from 15 to, say, 12, that would allow for only three lay members. We do not think that such a position is sustainable, as we feel that boards need to have a more balanced and broader membership.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/12">We entirely accept the argument made by a number of noble Lords about the value of rooting probation boards in local communities, and we have sought to retain and enhance localism in the current recruitment campaign. The local response to the campaign has been excellent, with more than 3,000 applications, and the interview process is now under way. As part of the recruitment process, Ministers and officials specifically wrote to, among others, MPs, the Local Government Association and the Magistrates' Association, encouraging locally based individuals to apply for board membership.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/13">These regulations meet the needs of today's probation boards and will allow them to be more effective and responsive, providing them with more local discretion and the ability to meet more closely local circumstances and needs. We consider the regulations as essential to the development of probation boards, and that is why we wish to introduce them now, thus allowing the challenges to be met in the interim period between now and the introduction of probation trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/14">I listened very closely to what was said about the value of the local magistracy and local councillors. I assure the House that we do not in any way devalue the contribution that those members make to the work of probation boards. It is not our intention to force them out and eliminate their representation on boards. I was an elected member of a local authority for some 16 years and I know the value that local councillors can add to other local services. Indeed, I think that over a considerable number of years my authority regularly appointed members to probation boards, and many of them were, as ever, involved in the work of the magistracy. I know, too, from my work in local crime and disorder reduction partnerships that a broad mix of people has to be involved in the localist aspect of criminal justice. I bring that flavour to this debate, and I know that it is a view much shared by Ministers in the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/15">Noble Lords made a number of specific points and raised concerns. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, was concerned about the position of alcohol services. That will be the subject of contestability withinthe new arrangements, as with many of the other probation programmes. However, I think that the noble Lord was probably more generally concerned about outsourcing. As is the case now, there will be a variety of providers, from which I think the service is benefiting, so that expertise can be focused on the service that is required. That is one reason why, in a nutshell, we need a broader range of membership on the boards. We need to develop the ability to manage contracts and ensure effective supervision of the different providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/16">The noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, was, as ever, very concerned about morale in the service&mdash;a matter that he has raised in connection with other services, not least the Prison Service and the Prison Service inspectorate in recent weeks. It is obviously an important issue. It is worth saying that, as we have been in government since 1997, we have put significant funds into the probation service and there has been a large increase in the number of people employed in it. The statistics that I have tell me that the number of those employed has risen by some51 per cent. When we came into government, I remember hearing much criticism of the previous Government over the way in which it was thought that the probation service had been run down. I make no comment other than that. It was during the previous Government's time that the ability to fund trainees on degree courses was taken away.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/17">I know that Paul Boateng, one of our early Ministers for the probation service and prisons, reinstated that in 1997. The attrition of probation staff&mdash;the rate of turnover&mdash;is much lower in comparison with other areas of public service. Our feedback shows that the service is developing well; it is responding to different pressures within the criminal justice system; and it is meeting those challenges with confidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.559.0/18">There was some criticism of the consultation process that was conducted prior to this statutory instrument. I willingly place in the public domain and confirm points made by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, and the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and others that there was no formal public consultation exercise because we did not consider that one was required for this statutory instrument. That is not to say that we do not recognise the importance of consultation, because we do. However, we have consulted informally with a number of probation boards and probation members. We have sent correspondence to local authorities, to the Local Government Association, the Magistrates' Association and the Probation Boards' Association, in which we clearly trailed and explained the changes and actively encouraged councillors and magistrates during the application process to apply for positions as members of boards as part of the continuing recruitment exercise.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-03a.563.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="563"  time="014:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61103-0007.htm#06110350000267">
	<p pid="a.563.1/1">My Lords, I was about to say that I thought the noble Lord had raised a very valid point. I had jotted that down in my notes. There would be some value in me referring the issue to the Cabinet Office. I know it is quite properly concerned about the way in which consultation operates across government. That point is very valid and I shall refer it forward. We need to give it some further thought.</p>
	<p pid="a.563.1/2">I have explained the recruitment process. As I understand it, the current exercise is to replace the30 board chairs and around 300 board members who complete the second of their three-year terms on<phrase class="date" code="2006-03-31">31 March</phrase> next year. That exercise should ensure that a broad range of interests is represented on the boards; that we have the proper focus on business continuity; that we bring in that added element to the board's range of expertise; that we reflect on the value of the current magistrates' appointments and counter-appointments; and that that experience is part of the broader board membership.</p>
	<p pid="a.563.1/3">The overall aim is simply to achieve a rebalance while retaining in membership those with sentencing and other valuable local experience. That is a very important strength. Early indications on the recruitment exercise are that a large number of councillors and magistrates have applied to be board chairs and members. The early sifting reveals an apparently very high standard of applicant. We should take great heart from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.563.1/4">I know &quot;modernisation&quot; is a word that many noble Lords do not greatly love, but this is a programme of modernisation and reform of public service and the probation service is part of that. It will require more partnership working and a greater familiarity with competitive and business environments within which they operate and skills in commissioning and contestability. By rebalancing the membership of the boards, improving their range of skills and competencies, we think we will improve the delivery of probation services. I would have thought that we could all sign up to that in order to prepare the service better for the challenges that it faces.</p>
	<p pid="a.563.1/5">I understand the concerns that have been raised. We shall reflect on the voices raised on all sides of your Lordships' House where a diverse group of noble Lords has been present today. The concerns and issues that have been raised will surface again when we debate the fundamentals of what is likely to be in the next legislative programme. I place on record my thanks to noble Lords who contributed to this debate and our thanks for the contributions of noble Lords who serve on the Merits Committee, take an interest in the probation service and are as passionate as I and our Ministers are to ensure that standards within the service continue to improve.</p>
