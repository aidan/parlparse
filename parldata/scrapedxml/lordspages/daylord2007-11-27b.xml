	<p pid="b.1118.6/1">My Lords, it is clearly right that we should remember and commemorate on all occasions those who have given their lives and our sympathies are always with their families and, indeed, with those who have been injured in activities. As to withdrawal and the end of operations, the Prime Minister set out the situation very clearly in a Statement in another place on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-08">8 October</phrase> and our policy has not changed. We have constantly said that UK forces will stay in Iraq until we have provided the opportunities that are required to give the Iraqi security forces the necessary confidence and ability to take over their responsibilities. We have announced our intention to reduce troop levels, dependent on conditions, by spring 2008. There are two separate matters: the drawing to a conclusion of the operations there, which has to be done in an orderly way for the benefit of the people of Iraq; and the later responsibility that we all have of remembering those people who have made sacrifices during this campaign.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-27b.1141.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100384" speakername="The Lord Bishop of London" colon=":" colnum="1141"  time="016:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71127-0004.htm#07112752000153">
	<p pid="b.1141.0/1">My Lords, I am particularly glad to follow the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam. Not only has he made a most distinguished contribution to the preparation of this debate, but he has introduced a note into our deliberations that is absolutely vital. As we have heard, the science develops but the moral imperatives stay the same, and we cannot really look at this issue without taking that seriously into consideration.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/2">One of the reasons that we have had this debate with remarkable unanimity so far today is the exemplary way in which the process of consultation has been undertaken. The principal issues have been identified, and the Government are to be congratulated on the way Ministers have listened and responded. One of the big issues is the development of the science that has put a question mark against the adequacy of the 60 per cent target, and there is now persuasive evidence that an 80 per cent target is more appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/3">The church is also involved here. In 2006, using the same sort of scientific basis and analysis, the Church of England through the General Synod pledged itself as an institution to reducing its own carbon footprint by 60 per cent by 2050, and we launched the Shrinking the Footprint campaign, which I chair. In the light of the new scientific evidence and the debate on the Bill, the church will also urgently review moving to an 80 per cent target. We are also looking for ways of making our contribution to redressing another aspect of this problem, in which we are by no means world leaders: the use of renewables. We have already heard from the Minister about our poor performance with regard to waste. We are supplying rather less from renewable sources to our total energy needs. We want to look as an institution at what we can do about that. Already we have put solar panels on all sorts of church roofs. I look forward to the day when every place of worship in the country will be generating energy for the national grid. I look for some help, as the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, was saying, in overcoming the planning difficulties that stand in the way of doing such a sensible thing.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/4">This topic unites people of all faiths. We are already working with Christians of every kind and members of other faiths. My friend the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Liverpool has been a prime mover in a Liverpool and north-western initiative called Faiths for Change, which engages the faith communities in environmental transformation. The Northwest Regional Development Agency has embraced and backed the initiative. It could be a model for other parts of the country, where the potential of the faith communities in bringing moral passion, numbers and practical resources is still underestimated.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/5">People of faith are increasingly united in the conviction, which is clearly stated in the Bible, that we are placed on earth as viceroys and not tyrants, with a duty to keep a balance between its development and preservation. Representatives of all the Christian churches in Europe met recently in an ecumenical assembly in Transylvania&mdash;I travelled by train, it is true&mdash;and agreed that all member churches should aim to give a creation focus each year to the period from <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-01">1 September</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-04">4 October</phrase>. The accent during that period will be on the promotion of sustainable lifestyles. A papal encyclical on the topic is eagerly awaited.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/6">The Environment Agency has just published an interesting survey of the views of 25 leading environmental experts. They were asked to identify the top 50 things that are necessary to save the planet. Number one, as we might all expect, is reducing energy use. Number two is,</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/7" class="indent">&quot;a leap of faith&mdash;it's time the world's faith groups remind us that we have a duty to restore and maintain the ecological balance of the planet&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/8">Number three is solar power.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/9">A change of language is needed. We talk of sustainable development and sustainable economies, but it is time to move on to restorative development and restorative economies. We need clearly enunciated principles which form the content of public education and which we can share and promote&mdash;new commandments, if one likes. I suggest four things that are unoriginal but central to this debate: leave the world a better place than you found it; take out no more than you need; try not to harm life or the environment; make amends if you do. That is not too theological, but it is at the centre of what we are setting ourselves to do this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/10">Regulatory frameworks are vital, but what the Prime Minister has described as,</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/11" class="indent">&quot;the great project of this generation&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/12">depends on countless personal decisions, and something more than the conversion of light bulbs or the conclusions of developing science will be needed if we are to be successful in a campaign for the common good, which could easily be derailed by individual selfishness. I hope that the Committee on Climate Change will be able to look also at the effectiveness of the public education effort.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/13">As we have heard already, one of the fruits of the consultation period has been a highlighting of the theme of adaptation, which now has its own part in the Bill. In London, the mayor's team is preparing the first regional climate change adaptation strategy in the UK and the first for a world city. Consultation on the plan will begin in January next year. As the noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, pointed out, it is urgent. The new Lord Mayor said in his Guildhall speech:</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/14" class="indent">&quot;It is a very sobering thought that London is ranked within the top ten cities globally at risk for catastrophic natural disaster&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.1141.0/15">We have cause for concern about the impact of extreme weather events, but as the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, so powerfully pointed out, and as so many other surveys have emphasised, the immediate impact will fall principally on the poorest and most vulnerable people in the world. The committee needs among its membership people who are sensitive to this international development dimension. We hang together in confronting this challenge, or we shall certainly hang separately.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-27b.1179.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100377" speakername="The Earl of Liverpool" colon=":" colnum="1179"  time="018:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71127-0010.htm#07112760000072">
	<p pid="b.1179.0/1">My Lords, it is a great pleasure to take part in the Second Reading debate today because there is greater consensus and general agreement in your Lordships' House than I can remember for a very long time.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/2">The first thing that I want to say is somewhat tangential to the Bill but, none the less, relevant. If we are serious in our desire to lead the world in combating climate change, we must encourage our newer, more enterprising and innovative companies. However, Richard Lambert, the current director-general of the CBI, makes it clear that the Chancellor's recent shock announcement on changes to CGT, both on rates and taper relief, will handicap not only small and medium-sized businesses in the enterprise economy but larger businesses as well. It will have an impact on the tax bills of employees in company share-ownership schemes; it will discourage business angels and venture capital funds; and it will hurt private equity and pension funds.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/3">Promoting enterprise and risk-taking will be vital ingredients as we search for cutting-edge technologies in our effort to reduce our carbon footprint. I believe that the Chancellor really must listen to the director-general of the CBI, who said recently that the changes to the CGT regime compound this anxiety among the CBI's members and put the Government's 10-year effort to create a pro-enterprise agenda into reverse gear. I know that our ability to influence money matters in this House is slight indeed but I hope that the Minister will at least acknowledge that there are real concerns and convey them to the Chancellor.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/4">Coming to the Bill itself, Part 4 refers to adaptation. I agree with my noble friend Lord Waldegrave that extra powers will need to be given to the committee, or commission, to enable us to achieve some of the less palatable measures that we must take&mdash;flood protection and managing and harvesting our water supplies being just two examples. More emphasis will need to be put on recycling grey water in the future, and I also believe that every new-build home should henceforward include some form of rainwater capture, particularly as we address the building of 3 million new houses by 2020.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/5">I should now like to take up briefly an old chestnut of mine&mdash;tidal lagoons. For too long, the DTI adopted a negative stance on the introduction of such lagoons off our shores, despite the fact that we have the second highest tidal range in the world. I believe that, over time, they would be twice as efficient as tidal stream turbines and they could be built without employing any public funds. The Sustainable Development Commission's recent report sadly failed properly to endorse this technology, so I beseech the Government to seize this opportunity to have a Damascene conversion. After all, they have nothing to lose and everything to gain.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/6">I should also mention briefly CSP&mdash;concentrated solar power. I shall not weary your Lordships too much with this detail today, as I referred to it in the energy debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-12">Thursday 12 July</phrase> last. This technology has the potential to supply sufficient electrical power for the whole of Europe if 80-odd square miles of the Sahara desert could be utilised. The German Government commissioned a detailed study into this and was favourably impressed. Will the Minister kindly answer the question that I put to his ministerial colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham, during that debate, and to which I have so far received no reply? I asked,</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/7" class="indent">&quot;whether the Government have given proper consideration to this technology and whether there has been any exchange of views with the German Government&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report, </I>12/07/07; col. 1539.]</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/8">I now ask, if not, please will they undertake to do so?</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/9">Part 5 of the Bill makes provision for the introduction of waste reduction schemes. I am delighted that that is included, and hope that the Secretary of State and the Committee on Climate Change will pay close attention to the very important role that both rotating and non-rotating autoclaves can play in achieving this. These devices are capable of reducing the volume of household rubbish by up to 85 per cent. After 45 minutes' operation at 160 degrees centigrade and five-bar pressure, the residual waste is inert, sterilised and free of all pathogens.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/10">If anaerobic digestion of the organic element is undertaken, it can provide sufficient biogas to run a CHP system, making the whole process energy positive because the waste steam from the electricity generation is sufficient to run the autoclaves. The noble Lord, Lord Oxburgh, mentioned the gasification of urban waste. I am not a sufficient authority to know whether I am stealing his clothes or whether the scheme that I have proposed is in some way different. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss this with him after the debate.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/11">Like the noble Baroness, Lady Jones of Whitchurch, who has just spoken, I believe that there is a groundswell of enthusiasm among the public for dynamic action in this area, and many householders are keen to do whatever it takes to reduce carbon emissions. The problem is that technologies are developing so fast and there is no specialist advice centre currently available to direct the public. For example, how many householders are aware that there is paint currently on the market using nanotechnology that provides phenomenal insulation and can reduce heating bills by up to 40 per cent? Geothermal heating, new generation gas condensing boilers and micro CHP plant are just a sample of the other products on the market that could help householders reduce their carbon footprint, so I hope that the Government will set up properly resourced regional advice centres where both business and the public can go and see what is currently available. The internet works for some, but for others a one-stop shop or advice centre would be immensely helpful and would really kick-start things. After all, it has often been said that if we are really serious about reducing our CO2 emissions, first we have to conserve and save what we currently waste.</p>
	<p pid="b.1179.0/12">Finally, I want to end in a spirit of consensus. The Bill is to be welcomed; the carbon budget period should be three, not five years. I agree that the bar should be raised from a 60 per cent to an 80 per cent reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050. I agree with my noble friend Lord Taylor that the committee should be elevated to a commission and report to the Prime Minister, and I agree that we should endeavour to include aviation and marine from the outset. I look forward to the Committee stage.</p>
