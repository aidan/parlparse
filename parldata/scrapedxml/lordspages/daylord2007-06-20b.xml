<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-06-20b.220.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100797" speakername="Baroness Morgan of Drefelin" colon=":" colnum="220"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70620-0002.htm#07062045000093">
	<p pid="b.220.3/1">My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/2">Noble Lords who were involved in the Greater London Authority Bill late last night will be well aware of the valiant efforts made by my noble friend Lady Andrews to speak through a very difficult cough&mdash;which I am afraid has made it impossible for her to address the House today. However, we are very much looking forward to her joining us for the remainder of her Bill. I am looking forward alsoto the two maiden speeches which we will hear later from the noble Baroness, Lady Campbell of Surbiton, and the noble Lord, Lord Mawson.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/3">The Bill is about greater devolution of power to local government and greater local democracy. As such, it reflects a vibrant public debate which has called for a shift in power away from central government and towards local government and the citizen. The Bill is therefore perhaps more radical in the changes it will bring than it may seem&mdash;changes not only in the organisation of local government and the work of councils and councillors but in the culture of partnership and the shaping of local services. It is driven essentially by the aspirations and experience of local government itself.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/4">The Bill is essentially pragmatic. It is driven by what changes have worked well and by a two-year conversation with local authorities and partners across England which culminated in the White Paper. The Government have continued to listen intently and that is reflected in the many changes made in the other place which have strengthened local control in different ways. In that respect this Bill is significantly different from every other local government Bill that has come before this House.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/5">Quite simply, we seek to build on success. I begin by celebrating the great improvements that have been made in the quality of our local public services over the past decade. Homelessness is at its lowest since the early 1980s and housing supply has increased by over one-third. Nearly 80 per cent of authorities are now rated good or excellent. We have increased funding by 39 per cent in real terms since 1997, and every local government in England now has a local area agreement providing increased flexibility for local government and partners. These improvements have been achieved by local government but they have been largely and deliberately driven from the centre. Now we need to change our approach and give local authorities and partners the freedom and space that they need to shape and make places for the future. That is increasingly seen as the defining role of local government and it is a role that needs to be strengthened. The Bill will make local authorities more powerful and more visible.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/6">Part of the challenge for local government now is to work more strategically and particularly to work closely with health partners to take greater shared responsibility for delivering more coherent services. That is why, throughout the Bill, we address how health fits into the picture. Crucially, we are giving a stronger voice to local people, whether in the ability to create new parish councils, to seek greater help from councillors or to have new rights to be informed, consulted and involved.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/7">I will outline the key themes of the Bill; five key elements will strengthen local government. These are set out variously in Parts 1, 3, 4 and 5. First, authorities in two-tier areas will be enabled to propose a move to simpler structures. This will be matched by promoting better partnership working in the remaining two-tier authorities. Secondly, we shall build on successful models of strong local leadership. Thirdly, we shall remove the power of the Secretary of State for traditional and specific responsibilities, for example in relation to the creation of parishes. Fourthly, we shall create a better, more proportionate way of ensuring and measuring local improvement. Fifthly, we shall create a transparent way of agreeing between central government and local government and its partners a small number of core priorities specific to each locality which cover the social, economic and environmental needs of local areas.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/8">One of the most profound challenges we face is to create greater knowledge and confidence in local government, not least so that improvement is recognised and to make the work of local government immediate and relevant to people. There is no doubt that however effective it may be, the complications of a two-tier system of local government makes this much more difficult.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/9">Eighteen months ago, therefore, we invited councils to tell us what was working and what was not, and what they wanted to improve and change. In a number of areas there is determination to make the two tiers work better. However, in some areas there is a strong feeling that the current system cannot be made to work and that the unitary option makes more sense. We have responded to that. This Bill puts in place a procedure for voluntary structural change. This is not about change for change's sake; it is about improving accountability and leadership, increasing efficiency and achieving better and more responsive services for communities.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/10">I shall explain the process and the timetable. The timetable is driven by a full recognition that proposals for restructuring can create uncertainty and tensions. That is why we are committed to progressing towards implementation as soon as possible. The invitations for proposals were issued last October. As a result we shall be able to move towards implementation quickly, with new unitary authorities up and running byMay 2009. We are consulting on 16 proposals for unitary structures. Each of these proposals was judged against strict criteria, including the need to show that there is a broad cross-section of support, affordability and value-for-money services. The Government's assessment was that there was at least a reasonable likelihood that those proposals, if implemented, would meet the criteria. The consultation closes on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-22">22 June</phrase>. Decisions will be made at the end of July.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/11">I want to address a related point. In the other place there were concerns about the Secretary of State's power to direct councils to submit proposals for unitary structures set out in Clause 2. Working with the LGA, we have therefore made amendments in the other place so that now this power can be used only during a narrow window. In addition, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State indicated at Second Reading that we would use this power to deal only with residual areas in order to ensure that a proposal received in response to our invitation and which we are minded to implement, works properly for the whole area concerned. I am pleased to be able to reiterate this commitment publicly today.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/12">Clearer local responsibilities need to be matched with clearer local leadership and clearer accountability. I am pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Heseltine, recognised the value of strong local leadership and direct elections in his interim report from the Cities Taskforce. Improving local areas has never been more difficult. It seems that we are in agreement that council leaders need the power to take tough decisions and to develop and communicate a clear vision for their area.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/13">While the best leaders can be successful in any system, the evidence shows that executive governance arrangements are most likely to lead and support the strong and accountable leadership that places need. We are confident that the three executive models set out in the Bill will provide this leadership. The three models are an elected mayor, an elected executive and a leader and cabinet executive. The small number of authorities that because of their size have opted to operate alternative arrangements will continue to be able to do so if they choose. Where an authority has a leader and a cabinet executive, executive powers will be vested in the leader, who will be able either to exercise the powers himself or herself or delegate them. We will expect a council's constitution to continue to explain which functions are to be discharged by the executive. Overview and scrutiny committees will be able to investigate the way in which executive powers are used. Functions that legislation or a council's constitution require to be discharged by the full council will be unaffected and will continue to be discharged in the usual way.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/14">We are greatly strengthening powers of scrutiny so that they extend beyond the council. For the first time, overview and scrutiny committees will have the power to require information from certain key local powers, which will already have an enhanced role in the making of community strategies and local area agreements. Those local partners will be required to have regard to the reports and recommendations that the committees produce.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/15">The third area of change will increase the autonomy of local authorities, for example by transferring the responsibility for decisions on the electoral cycle of a local authority from the Secretary of State to local government. We are taking the Secretary of State out of the equation in relation to community governance and by-laws. We are increasing local ownership of conduct issues by devolving most decision-making on conduct to local authorities. Crucially, we are also devolving powers to the National Assembly for Wales to enable Wales to legislate for itself on a range of local government matters covered in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/16">The conversations that we have had with local government have made it clear to us that they and their partners spend too much time addressing the requirements of central government rather than those of citizens and communities. That is why we are seeking through the Bill to increase the ability of local authorities to determine and focus their own local priorities. The best value regime will be streamlined and will sit alongside a completely revised framework for monitoring and reporting on local authorities' performance. The number of national indicators will be reduced from 1,200 to a robust set of 200 indicators that will focus on outcomes and will make sense as local priorities. That will be complemented by a new comprehensive area assessment system that will focus less on upwards reporting and more on identifying risks to service delivery in an area and on citizens' experiences. Other changes will bring local authorities into a new and more effective connection with other local partners that are responsible for the well-being of the community. That partnership has already been enhanced by the local area agreements in every local authority, but the local area agreements have been too limited to reach their potential to become the delivery plan for the whole sustainable community strategy, which is the sum of the needs and aspirations of the whole community.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/17">The Bill makes this possible by expanding and strengthening the role in two ways: first by placing them on a statutory basis and secondly by extending their coverage and partnership, so that they become the sole delivery agreement for the issues which local authorities wish to tackle on their own or in partnership with others; such as community safety, childhood obesity or economic inactivity.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/18">I shall explain how this process will work in practice. Each responsible local authority, its partners and the relevant government office will identify the core challenges facing each local area. Against these priorities will be set around 35 local improvement targets, although in some areas there may be fewer. These will be designated targets and will be set against the 200 or so national indicators. But the local authority and its partners will also be free to set other local targets, should they wish to do so.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/19">Most significantly, we are placing a statutory duty on key public agencies to co-operate. This will give local authorities the levers that they need to bring together all the key partners in an area to agree the core community priorities for action. These duties will not exclude other organisations from participating in the negotiations or even from signing up to local improvement targets on a voluntary basis. As a result, local people will have a clearer idea of the priorities of their local council, how their needs will be met and who will be responsible.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/20">In another innovative step, we are requiring local authorities and primary care trusts to work together to produce a strategic assessment of the health and social care needs of their local population. This will also feed into the sustainable community strategy and, in turn, the priorities agreed in the local area agreement. We are also providing the opportunity for greater flexibility and efficiencies in the delivery of waste services&mdash;both collection and disposal&mdash;through powers to allow the voluntary establishment of the statutory joint waste authorities.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/21">We want to improve the relationship between local government and the local community by amplifying the voice of the local community and giving more scope for local councillors to champion their interests. We are also placing a statutory duty on English best-value authorities to inform, consult or involve representatives of local people&mdash;for example, through newsletters, posters and neighbourhood forums. Of course, many best-value authorities already do a great deal to involve and consult citizens and communities, but we want to ensure that all people, irrespective of where they live, work or play, have opportunities for involvement. We are adopting a similar approach with regard to the health services by strengthening the existing requirements on NHS organisations to consult patients and the public in the planning and development of health services.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/22">Local people will also have a louder voice in another way. We are introducing the Community Call for Action, through which a councillor will be able to refer an issue to an overview and scrutiny committee and require a response.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/23">That brings me to the final element of the Bill that I want to discuss. The fact that it is at the end of the Bill and confined to a single part&mdash;Part 14&mdash;does not diminish its importance. We can see by the number of speakers who have an interest in health that this is held up in your Lordships' House as well.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/24">For several years, we have been engaged in trying to ensure that patients and the wider public are properly involved in their local health services. Patients' forums, which we debated in this House in 2002, moved patient and public involvement on, raising its profile and producing many success stories. I pay tribute here and now to the hard work, expertise and enthusiasm of patients' forums throughout the country. As I shall make clear, we feel that it is essential that the energy and expertise of the forums, far from being lost, must be captured within the new local involvement networks. I shall explain the key features set out in <I>A Stronger Local Voice</I>, published in July 2006, which was based on a nine-month review of patient and public involvement.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/25">The changes that we propose are, first, to make patient involvement genuinely local. It will no longer be confined, as patients' forums were, to single institutions such as acute hospitals or PCTs, but will cover all services provided across the whole local authority area. Secondly, they are intended to involve more people: not just individuals, as patients' forums did, but networks and organisations so that patients' voices are heard from many different and organised perspectives. Thirdly, they will cover social care as well as health. LINks will be established for an area and, for the first time, will consider all the health and social care services used by people within the area. This is a huge advance.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/26">Why do we believe that these changes are necessary? First, without wishing to diminish the work of patients' forums in any way, there have been significant new configurations in the health and social care system, not least the move towards greater coterminosity between PCTs and local authorities, and greater joint commissioning across health and social care. But more importantly, the experience of many patients is that they cross services as they require care; for example, a stroke patient may experience services that range from care in an acute hospital, a specialist stroke unit, a rehabilitation unit and then they may need social care. Therefore, if local people are to have a key voice, it makes sense that they are able to speak up on all these stages and issues. LINks will be able, by virtue of their role and larger membership, to consider the whole patient journey.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/27">So LINks will do the following things. Their role will be to collect the voices of the local area with regard to health and social care services across the sector; to monitor the range and quality of care services; to consider, report on and make recommendations about all relevant services; and to promote greater public involvement. To allow them to do that effectively, properly trained members of the LINks will have a power to enter and view services, just as the patients forums do now. That will include health and social care premises as appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/28">How will they be organised? The Bill requires local authorities to make contractual arrangements for the support of these networks: procuring an independent host organisation, well versed in health and care issues, and likely to be from the voluntary and community sector, to support the LINk in carrying out its activities to facilitate user involvement.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/29">The Bill, deliberately, does not set out detail of size and shape of membership or governance. That must be the responsibility of the LINk organisation itself; we will support the process by providing model contracts and guidance, but that must be locally owned and designed. Currently, there are nine early-adopter schemes which are not pilots, but areas which are working through these issues. Their experience will inform our guidance and the support we will give the emerging LINks.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/30">LINks will be independent, as are patient forums. They will build on the best work of patient forums and we would encourage all forum members to become involved in their LINk, as the experience they have built up over the past three years will be invaluable to the success of the new system. As I think you can see, these changes are driven by a genuine desire to involve more people. They will be locally hosted and driven and they will set their own priorities locally.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/31">In conclusion, you will no doubt agree that this is a wide-ranging Bill. So much so that there are some elements that time does not permit me to cover, but I hope I have demonstrated how seriously we are taking this opportunity to give local government, local partners and local people the tools and support they have asked for. We are putting the trust in local government and communities to find their own solutions that best respond to local needs and to shape their own agendas. It is for them to rise to the challenge going forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.220.3/32">I should note that we still have some improvements to make to the Bill, and we will be bringing forward some amendments in Committee. Indeed, we have received a most helpful report from the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, to which my noble friend Lady Andrews will be responding. It may be that we will wish to bring forward some amendments to address their recommendations. I look forward to robust debate on the Bill, both today and in the coming weeks. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-06-20b.267.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100541" speakername="Lord Roberts of Conwy" colon=":" colnum="267"  time="018:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70620-0009.htm#07062059000001">
	<p pid="b.267.0/1">My Lords, I draw your Lordships' attention to the Welsh dimension of the Bill, as I was invited to do by my noble friend on the Opposition Front Bench, Lady Hanham. I am glad to say that the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, who opened the debate, also mentioned Wales in particular.</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/2">I wish to speak about the constitutional aspect of the Welsh dimension, which involves the transfer of primary legislative powers from this Parliament to the National Assembly for Wales. The transfer is achieved in Clause 234, which simply states:</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Schedule 17 (powers of National Assembly for Wales) has effect.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/4">The effect of Schedule 17 is to add five &quot;matters&quot; to the &quot;field&quot; of local government where the Assembly may legislate under the terms of the Government of Wales Act 2006. That Act provides that measures passed by the Assembly&mdash;Assembly measures, as they are called&mdash;will have the same force as Acts of this Parliament. The first matter added by the schedule enables legislative change in,</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/5" class="indent">&quot;(a) the constitution of new principal areas and the abolition or alteration of existing principal areas, and</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/6" class="indent">(b) the establishment of councils for new principal areas and the abolition of existing principal councils&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/7">In short, we are talking about powers to create and abolish local authorities in a country where we already have single-tier authorities. Of course, in Wales there is no time limit as there is in England.</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/8">That is only part of the first matter where legislative power is devolved. There are four more matters relating to local authorities where the Assembly may legislate: bye-laws, conduct of members and employees, community planning and partner authorities, and best value. Of course, local authorities in this context also embrace national parks, fire and rescue authorities and police authorities to a limited extent.</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/9">These are substantial, radical powers to devolve in a minor clause and an obscure schedule. They are so minor and so obscure that I can find no mention of them or the powers that they transfer by any speaker at Second Reading of the Bill in another place on<phrase class="date" code="2007-01-22">22 January</phrase> this year. In addition, there was barely a mention in Committee or at Third Reading in the other place. Is it credible that the other place disposes of its powers with so little concern and without so much as a passing reference? Apparently it is. The disposal is, incidentally, as permanent as anything done by Parliament can be.</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/10">The transfer of what are described as &quot;framework legislative powers&quot; has two precedents, and it will have yet another if the Further Education and Training Bill passes unscathed through the other place. What gives a certain dubious distinction to this Bill is its timing, coming before your Lordships, as it does, shortly after the <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-03">3 May</phrase> election of a new Assembly in Wales. That Assembly is composed differently in membership and governance from its predecessor and is guided by a new, very shaky minority Labour Assembly Government with fresh powers derived from the 2006 Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/11">We are bound to ask whether the new Assembly has approved of the contents of the Bill. I doubt it; in fact, I am pretty sure that it has not. Therefore, the UK Government are proceeding on the basis of a consent given by the old, pre-election Assembly. Have the new Assembly Government approved of the contents of the Bill? I doubt that too; I doubt whether they have had time. True, the new Government have much the same faces as the old, but they have been shuffled into new jobs. Their powers are different too.</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/12">There is no formal indication that these new bodies have approved the Welsh provisions in the Bill. So the UK Government are gratuitously bringing in these new powers to legislate over local authorities without so much as by leave of the new Assembly or its Government. I doubt whether they have the leave of the local authorities either. That is not so much devolution as imposition of powers. That is made clear in a memorandum from the Secretary of State to the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee of your Lordships' House. I shall have more to say on that shortly. Furthermore, we have no real indication of what the new Assembly Government wish to do with those powers. We know from his memorandum what the Secretary of State thinks they might do with them, but there are no Assembly measures in the pipeline as far as we know. So we are, in effect, dishing out blank cheques for legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/13">Another method whereby primary legislative power can be transferred to the National Assembly is by Orders in Council which grant legislative competence in specific areas. The procedure for the approval of such orders has been closely examined by the Welsh Affairs Committee in another place. The procedure has not yet been tried out and, such is its complexity, that I do not think anyone will be in a hurry to do so. But the procedure has the undoubted advantage that it provides for full discussion at every democratic level before a transfer of primary legislative power takes place.</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/14">The Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has examined the Welsh provisions with its customary thoroughness and I express my sincere appreciation and gratitude to it. The committee stated:</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/15" class="indent">&quot;Whether the particular matters listed in Schedule 17 to this bill should be the subject of enhanced legislative competence for the NAW is a matter of policy for the House&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/16">Some of us would find it easier to decide that issue if there were a clearer indication of how the National Assembly for Wales Government intend to act when they have these powers. The Secretary of State for Wales has anticipated our difficulty and has included in his memorandum to the committee some hints on how the powers might be used. For example, with regard to the power that I quoted at the start of these remarks, the Secretary of State says it might be used,</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/17" class="indent">&quot;for voluntary or directed mergers of local authorities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/18">Unlike England, Wales does not have a sunset clause, but this is no more than a tantalising inkling of what is in store and comes from a Secretary of State who has only a marginal role in the devolved system compared with the First Minister of the Assembly Government.</p>
	<p pid="b.267.0/19">For all we know these powers may be used to amalgamate local authorities on a large scale. Once granted by Parliament, these powers cannot easily be withdrawn. I would therefore be grateful if the Minister who is to reply could tell us a little more about the likely application of these powers and provide better and stronger justification for their transfer than we have at present.</p>

Although it is a small item of business for Parliament to consider, theorder is vital because it ensures that the Armed Forces Act 2006 and the three service discipline Acts will remain in force for a further 12 months. As noble Lords will know, Parliament is asked most years to consider an order of this kind as part of the process by which service discipline Acts are kept in force, but the order we are considering today is breaking new ground because it provides for the continuation in force for another year of the three service discipline Acts&mdash;the Army Act 1955, Air Force Act 1955 and Naval Discipline Act 1957&mdash;and the Armed Forces Act 2006.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.2/3">When the 2006 Act was considered by Parliament, there was an expectation that it would replace the three service discipline Acts, and that remains our intention. However, we need to continue the service discipline Acts in force until the 2006 Act is fully in operation. That is why they are included in the order. In years gone by, these debates have provided an opportunity to give the House a progress report on the forthcoming legislation. This year's debate is different because we now have an Act in place. That, however, is not the end of the story. Having received Royal Assent to the Armed Forces Act last November, our focus has shifted to the significant amount of work that will be needed to deliver a single system of service law for our Armed Forces. Foremost among that work is the huge amount of secondary legislation that will put flesh on the bones of the Act. Her Majesty's Government have been hard at work producing this since the Act received Royal Assent last year.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.2/4">Altogether we expect to produce about 65 statutory instruments. Many of those will contribute to the single system of service discipline that we intend to have in place by <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2009</phrase>. Since it is not possible to introduce some parts of this disciplinary system in advance of the other parts, we plan to bring them all in together. Our target date for this is January 2009. At that point, the Armed Forces will move across from the three separate systems in place at present to the single one that will replace them.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.2/5">The change will have consequences for police investigations, summary dealings, prosecutions and court martial trials to name but a few. So, as well as statutory instruments there will need to be manuals, guidance instructions and training for a wide range of personnel and organisations to ensure that the change happens efficiently and with the minimum of fuss for our Armed Forces. We expect to lay almost all of the 65 or so statutory instruments during 2008. We recognise that it would not help the House if they were all laid at the same time, so we will look to see how they can sensibly be grouped together and laid in batches, perhaps according to the issues that they cover.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.2/6">Towards the end of this year officials therefore propose to seek views from staff working for the Merits Committee and the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. It goes without saying that officials would be happy to talk to other committee officials and staff who might be involved in this work. We hope that, by doing that, we will be able to present the information in a way that assists parliamentary scrutiny and avoids the system being overloaded.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.2/7">At present, we plan to make some statutory instruments earlier than the majority. These are ones that stand alone and are therefore capable of being dealt with separately from those which go together to underpin the single disciplinary system. They will make provisions in two particular areas. The first deals with service complaints, which might be better known by some noble Lords as redress of individual grievance. The second is in relation to service inquiries, which will replace the existing boards of inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.2/8">I should now like to speak to the two other orders before us today: the Armed Forces (Service Police Amendments) Order 2007 and the Armed Forces (Alignment of Service Discipline Acts) Order 2007. The first provides for consequential amendments to nine statutory instruments following the change of name from Royal Navy Regulating Branch to Royal Navy Police. The change is to provide clarity so that the role of the organisation is understood by all those with whom it does business. Various provisions in primary legislation have already been amended to reflect the name change. The affected primary legislation is set out in Schedule 16 to the 2006 Act, the relevant paragraphs of which were brought into force on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-10">10 May</phrase> by the first commencement order under the Act.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.2/9">The second order removes the current restriction in the three service discipline Acts on the number of civilians who may sit as lay members of courts martial when the defendants are civilians. Removal of this restriction will allow new courts martial rules made under the service discipline Acts, which we expect to lay before Parliament towards the end of this year, to provide that the military court service may select all-civilian panels when a civilian defendant is tried by court martial.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.2/10">The need to make this change arose from the judgment in the 2006 European Court case of Martin v UK, when the court said that it would be appropriate to try a civilian by a military tribunal only in &quot;very exceptional circumstances&quot;. Since the court did not provide examples of what those exceptional circumstances might be, it is up to the Government to consider when it might be appropriate to have a mix of military and civilian personnel on a court martial panel. We are clear that, if a civilian faces court martial trial, the default position is that the lay members will all be civilians. However, there are circumstances in which it might be appropriate for a civilian defendant to be tried by a military panel. I give one example. If a soldier is accused of committing an offence while he is in the Army but subsequently leaves the service and is brought back for a court martial trial, should he be tried by a military panel or a civilian panel, or by a mix of military and civilian personnel?</p>
	<p pid="b.296.2/11">The Government have very carefully considered the implications of the judgment, and we believe that the ability to have all-civilian panels when civilians are being tried provides the remedy. The fact that the judge advocates who provide legal direction at courts martial are all civilian judges provides a further safeguard. In a wider context, making these changes demonstrates once again the Government's determination to ensure that the military justice system and the legislation that underpins it are compliant with the European convention.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.2/12">I should like to make a further observation about the orders that we are considering. Her Majesty's Government have given an undertaking that Ministers moving instruments subject to the affirmative procedure will tell the House whether they are satisfied that the legislation is compatible with the rights provided in the European Convention on Human Rights. The first order is a brief document that raises convention issues only in that it maintains in force three Acts which, as they have been amended over the years, reflect convention rights. As my right honourable friend the Secretary of State declared last year, we consider that the provisions of the Armed Forces Act 2006 are compatible with convention rights. Of the remaining two orders, the second has no bearing on convention rights, and the third will help to preserve those rights&mdash;in particular the right under Article 6 to a fair trial&mdash;as they extend to civilians subject to the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="b.296.2/13">In conclusion, I hope that noble Lords have found it helpful to have an update on progress towards full implementation of the legislation. I look forward to future discussions in the House as we bring forward the important secondary legislation that will be needed to establish the single system of service law. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="b.300.0/1">My Lords, I declare an interest as having appeared as an advocate in a number of courts martial, not least the case involving Baha Musa, to which the noble Lord, Lord Astor, referred, and the case of Martin, which is the fundamental issue in one order before your Lordships' House tonight. It took me back some 11 or 12 years to a time when I stood in a court martial in Monchengladbach, wondering how I could ensure a fair trial for a young boy of 17&mdash;although at the time of trial he was 19&mdash;charged with murder, who had been taken to this country on remand and had been on remand in Colchester for12 months but was flown back to stand trial before a court martial, although he was a civilian and although his father, who had been a serving soldier, had left the Army. It struck me at that time&mdash;and I made an application as a result&mdash;that nothing could be more unfair or appear to be unfair than to have a young civilian boy tried for the most serious crime before military officers when he had not himself ever become a member of the military.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/2">It was a tragic case. The unfortunate victim had undoubtedly been murdered, but although she was not a serving soldier herself she was a member of the officers' mess, which to my mind made it rather worse. As your Lordships know, we appealed it all the way to the Judicial Committee of this House, on the basis that the trial was unfair. The Appellate Committee unanimously held that if Parliament had said that a 17 year-old boy was subject to service discipline and could be tried for murder in Germany, it could not be described as an abuse of process. This was before the Human Rights Act had come into force or was even a Bill. Consequently, we lost the appeal. However, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Slynn of Hadley, said that it was,</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/3" class="indent">&quot;disturbing and... wrong in principle&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/4">and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Hope, said that it was quite inappropriate.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/5">I pay tribute to my instructing solicitor, Mr Gilbert Blades, who has done so much to improve military law in the course of his career and who with great determination took the matter to Europe. It took12 years&mdash;or nine years, anyway. The date of the application was 1998 and the decision was made in the autumn of last year that there should be a judgment from the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg to the effect that only in exceptional circumstances should a civilian be tried by a military tribunal.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/6">I raised this matter at the Bill's Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-14">14 June</phrase> last year. I was delighted that, in the end, the legislation contained provisions for the members of trial tribunals to be entirely civilian laymen but, as yet, the Act has not come into force. It seems to me that, by introducing this provision tonight, the Government have responded perfectly properly and have indicated how the Human Rights Act andthe European Court of Human Rights can work. The Minister will appreciate how pleased I am by the Government's decision to take this step and by how far it ensures that the military system of justice will work properly for the civilians who accompany armed forces abroad.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/7">I now come to the draft continuation order before us. Last year's Act was a significant step forward: it did a great deal to improve the quality of military justice. From these Benches we put forward certain suggestions which were not acceptable, even to military people on the Cross Benches. We suggested that at times the services should sit as, for example, a joint tribunal and that there should be input from each service into a case. That was not acceptable, but our proposals were all minor compared with the thrust of the Bill that brought the three service disciplines together. I hope that in future there will be a fair and proper system of military justice based on the principles set out in that Bill.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/8">The noble Lord, Lord Astor, referred to the acquittals that have taken place. They have not occurred because of any weaknesses in the military justice system but, in my view&mdash;I merely give my opinion and have declared my interest&mdash;because of a lack of resources in the investigation phase and mistakes made at that point which led to the prosecutions that did not succeed. However, if the Government are prepared to provide the investigatory branch of the Armed Forces with full and proper resources and training so that they are on an equal footing with the investigation forces in the United Kingdom&mdash;if they are capable of doing the samesort of thing forensically and so on&mdash;I have no doubt that the procedures will be fair for everyone. Consequently, I am looking at only one aspect of the measure. I know that the continuation order covers a lot of military matters which have nothing to do with courts-martial, but I am very pleased to see the order continuing. I assure the Minister of our active interest in, and probable support for, the many statutory instruments that will follow.</p>
	<p pid="b.300.0/9">On the service police amendments order, I have nothing to add to what the noble Lord, Lord Astor, said, save that we support it.</p>
