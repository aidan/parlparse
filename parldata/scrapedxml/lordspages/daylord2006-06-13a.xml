<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-13a.142.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100299" speakername="Lord Holme of Cheltenham" colon=":" colnum="142"  time="016:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60613-09.htm#60613-09_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.142.2/1">My Lords, it is a great pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, and his wise words derived from experience about the need to curb the regulatory state in all its aspects. I am afraid that I may not be able to avoid returning to those lofty constitutional heights, as it is my honour to serve as chairman of your Lordships' Constitution Committee, but I hope that I will do so in the practical sense that we have just heard.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/2">I am conscious that the Government want, as they so often do nowadays, to move on and not to examine too closely the origins of the Bill. I have two questions. How and why did this Bill in its original form&mdash;which has been called the &quot;Abolition of Parliament Bill&quot;&mdash;ever see the light of day? Secondly, given that it mercifully has been substantially amended in the light of widespread disquiet, is it now satisfactorily balanced? Is it, in the words of the Minister, &quot;fit for purpose&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/3">Perhaps it would be helpful if I prefaced my remarks, which on the whole will be critical of the Government, by saying that their avowed purpose of making it easier and speedier to streamline and rationalise regulation&mdash;to deregulate&mdash;is in my personal view thoroughly sensible. If that is properly provided for, it will be likely, as has been evident already this afternoon, to command widespread cross-party support. In this context, I recommend the Constitution Committee's report on the regulatory state. I welcome the proposal of the Liaison Committee that your Lordships establish a Select Committee on the accountability of regulators so that we can take a sort of overview of the burgeoning power of this sector and make sure that good practice is properly shared.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/4">I acknowledge that, as was said on Report in another place, once the Government finally realised that they were standing shoulder deep in a hole of their own making, they had the wit to stop digging and to try to clamber out. I am afraid that that is as far as politeness will extend on my part this afternoon. In every way, this could stand as a case history of how not to introduce a Bill with constitutional implications. My committee described the consultation process as &quot;lamentable&quot;, but I am afraid that we were guilty of understatement.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/5">Why was there no pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill as there was of the Regulatory Reform Bill in 2000? Why was the Committee stage not taken on the Floor of another place? Why was there no joined-up interdepartmental thinking with the DTI on the Company Law Reform Bill, which embarrassingly foreshadowed these extraordinary ministerial powers with no cross-reference whatever to this Bill? As we know, that provision was withdrawn at the last minute. Why was there no early warning system in Whitehall to tell the Government that they had produced a constitutional monstrosity? My committee in its own small way did its best in January by writing to the Lord Chancellor, the guardian of constitutional matters within the Government, but on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-07">7 February</phrase> we received a reply of unwavering blandness, protesting the good intentions of the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/6">This road has been paved with good intentions. Indeed, later in the Bill's passage through the other place, ministerial assurances were given in profusion, not least by Jim Murphy, the Minister responsible, that these extraordinary powers would never be abused. But ministerial assurances are walls of sand. I do not for a moment doubt the good faith, integrity and the personal &quot;intentions&quot; of Ministers, but, first, Ministers change, secondly, governments change and, finally, political memories are short and selective. That is why constitutions are about laws, not men, and it is why the bulwarks against the arbitrary misuse of power have to be made of constitutional concrete, not the shifting sand of good intentions.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/7">Some have seen the original Bill as a straightforward power grab by the Executive at the expense of Parliament. I am more charitable. It is more likely to be a question of what so many people in business complain about in regulation&mdash;the phenomenon of gold-plating. This Bill was gold-plated; the Government tried to anticipate every eventuality and that process made the legislation too wide-ranging. Whatever the reality, I very much hope that the Government have learnt their lesson. When the Minister responds to the debate, can he assure us that Bills with deep constitutional implications will not be treated in such a reckless and cavalier manner in future?</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/8">In case the Government are not sure what is constitutional, which is not always easy with our unwritten constitution, our report on the Bill, House of Lords Paper 194, provides two checklists that the Government might care to refer to in identifying what is likely to have constitutional significance, as my noble friend Lord Goodhart has stated.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/9">So, what now? Our report suggests that the balance of the Bill, even as amended, between rapid reform&mdash;which is often needed in the regulatory sphere&mdash;and proper parliamentary control is still not right. We have made several suggestions as to how that might be redressed and I welcome the concession made by the Minister in his opening remarks. The nature of amendments that are passed is, of course, a matter for your Lordships' House and, no doubt, amendments will be produced along the lines that we suggest and in other ways. The key issue is how the two watchdog committees can ensure that they bark and bite to good effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.142.2/10">I sincerely hope that the Government will maintain their tardy discovery of flexibility and continue to pay attention&mdash;and I welcome the assurances made this afternoon&mdash;to the legitimate concerns of Parliament. The need to reconcile the demands of a benign deregulatory impulse with the careful operation of parliamentary procedures and the principles of democratic government is a topic worthy of the skills and experience of Members of your Lordships' House. I hope that we reach a successful conclusion.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-13a.179.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100352" speakername="Lord Kingsland" colon=":" colnum="179"  time="019:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60613-18.htm#60613-18_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.179.0/1">My Lords, in a solitary moment of emotion in an otherwise dispassionate and well argued speech, the noble Lord, Lord Holme of Cheltenham, turned to the government Benches and cried, &quot;How on earth did this Bill see the light of day?&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/2">I think that I can provide the answer to the noble Lord. It lies in the attitude of the Government to our fundamental freedoms. We have only to glance at the recent meretricious record of the Government on our long-standing constitutional protections. Your Lordships will recall that in 2004, in the Bill dealing with asylum appeals, the Government attempted to remove the power of the courts to review the decisions of asylum tribunals. They sought to oust judicial review. Mercifully, because of the revolt of the judges, the Government withdrew from the brink. More recently, another attempt was made when, effectively, the Government sought to suspend <i>habeas corpus</i> by introducing a measure in another place which would allow detention without charge for 90 days. That was defeated by a revolt of the Government's own Back Benchers. We have even more recent evidence of a fundamental freedom being threatened&mdash;the attempt by the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General to introduce a piece of delegated legislation which would have removed the right of jury trial in fraud cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/3">Taking those three issues&mdash;the ousting of the court, the suspension of <i>habeas corpus</i> and the attempted removal of jury trial&mdash;is it so surprising that the Government presented a Bill to abolish Parliament? Effectively, that is what the Bill in its original form would have done. As I understand it, the distinction between primary legislation and delegated legislation is that Parliament is supreme and, therefore, it can do anything; but a Minister can make delegated legislation only within the constraints of a parliamentary statute. The original draft of this Bill abolished, effectively, that distinction. The Bill simply required the Minister to make legislative reforms; so there was a complete elision between the tradition that law is made by Parliament and the delegated law-making authority of Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/4">Thankfully, that was stopped by a combination of the growing recognition, first, by the Liberal Benches and then by the Conservative Benches, that the Bill contained a cancer, and, secondly, a remarkable campaign in the press. The sum of those two things made the Government think again. As a number of my noble friends have said, that fact should not be forgotten when we consider the provisions of the Bill. There are still certain proposals that echo what the Government originally attempted to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/5">The noble Lord, Lord Holme of Cheltenham, also drew attention, quite rightly, as chairman of the Select Committee on the Constitution, to the issue of pre-legislative review. Is it not remarkable, unlike the Bill of 2001 which had proper pre-legislative review and proper consultation, that neither of those was undertaken before this Bill saw the light of day? There was no draft Bill and there was no pre-legislative consultation. It is worth reading to your Lordships what the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Holme, said on this point. I quote from paragraph 19 of the report of the Select Committee on the Constitution, which was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-08">8 June</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/6" class="indent">&quot;We are concerned by the way in which a bill with constitutional implications has been handled. The consultative process was lamentable: for example, the consultation document on reform of the Regulatory Reform Act 2001 did not capture the full extent of the Government's proposals as they emerged in the original version of the bill. It is unfortunate, too, that the opportunity was not taken to give pre-legislative scrutiny to the bill, in sharp contrast to the approach taken in 2000 to the Regulatory Reform Bill, where pre-legislative scrutiny was commended as 'a model of this process'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/7">A number of your Lordships have asked the question&mdash;I think particularly of the contribution made by my noble friend Lord Goschen&mdash;do we really need the Bill at all? What can the Bill do that its predecessors cannot do? The Minister must answer that question when he replies on behalf the Government. This point was considered in the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee report, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Dahrendorf, who I am very pleased to see in his place. Paragraph 16 of that report states:</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Neither the Government's review, nor any evidence to Parliament which has accompanied this bill, has demonstrated that there are significant structural flaws in the 2001 Act. We asked the Government for examples of proposals which they wished to deliver under the 2001 Act but were not able to do so due to the wording of the current test: other than the examples in Annex C to their memorandum, they have not been able to do so. Given this, it is our opinion that the block to regulatory reform is departmental priorities rather than the 'burden' test in the 2001 Act&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/9">So it is quite clear that the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee has reached a clear view on that&mdash;opposite to the view that the Government have advanced today in their opening.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/10">To what extent is a Bill of this kind an answer to the kind of problems that have been identified, for example, by my noble friend Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, and by the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald of Tradeston? I have been looking at the report by Mr Philip Hampton, which has not received much attention in this debate. It is called <i>Reducing administrative burdens: effective inspection and enforcement</i>. Chart 2.2, on page 11, sets out the 10 largest national regulators by volume of inspection and enforcement staff. These are, in order of the greatest number of employees, the Environment Agency, the Health and Safety Executive, the Financial Services Authority, Companies House, something called CAA-SRG&mdash;I confess I do not know what that is&mdash;the Rural Payments Agency, the Meat Hygiene Service, the Office of Fair Trading, the Housing Corporation, environmental health, and trading standards.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/11">Those regulators are at the coal face of industry. How will the Bill relate to what they do? Can the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, tell me what concerns the Government have about the current way in which the Environment Agency is regulating the people whom it regulates? Why is that regulation so costly? What can this Bill do specifically to reduce the burden of regulation by the Environment Agency on those whom it regulates? I shall not ask him to do that for the other nine, and he can choose another body if he wishes. I believe that the House would like to hear how what is set out in the Bill will be relevant to what we hope those agencies will do to the people whom they regulate. Unless we can have an answer to that, I do not understand why we are wasting our time here tonight. This is all about regulatory culture, as my noble friend Lady Wilcox said, but as far as I can see, there is nothing whatever about regulatory culture in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/12">Assuming that we will not vote against the Bill at Second Reading and that we shall advance to Committee stage, it is only fair that I let the Minister know what line we will take on amendments. Our first concern is with the scope of Clause 1, which is entitled:</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Power to remove or reduce burdens&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/14">I have two observations on that. First, why is the title not &quot;Power to remove or reduce regulatory burdens&quot;? As my noble friend Lord Onslow said, the scope of that clause is immense. Apart from the Bill, when it subsequently becomes an Act, and the Human Rights Act&mdash;exceptions are made for both of those categories&mdash;Clause 1 could amend any piece of primary legislation or any piece of the secondary legislation. Given the concerns expressed in your Lordships' House today, would it not be better if the Government limited the scope of Clause 1 to regulatory burdens? That, after all, is what the Bill is supposed to be about.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/15">I also draw the Minister's attention to Clause 1(2):</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/16" class="indent">&quot;That purpose is removing or reducing any burden, or the overall burdens, resulting directly or indirectly for any person from any legislation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/17">Focusing on the expression &quot;or the overall burdens&quot;, as I understand it, power can be used to increase burdens on a particular group under this Bill provided that, overall, there is a net reduction. If the Minister agrees with me about that interpretation, how does he justify it? How can a deregulating Bill actually, in certain phases of deregulation, increase the regulatory burden on certain individuals?</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/18">A question dealt with, in my respectful submission, totally satisfactorily by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, was about which areas should be excluded from the Bill. We already know that the Bill can no longer amend itself. As a result of considerable pressure, we now know that the Government have accepted that they cannot amend the Human Rights Act 1998. In paragraph 53 of the report of the noble Lord, Lord Holme of Cheltenham, we find a long list of measures, referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, which ought also to be excluded from the Bill. I should be most grateful if the Minister would tell us in his closing speech whether he accepts paragraph 53 in total or, if not, which particular measures in that paragraph he agrees ought to be excluded and which should not.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/19">The veto has excited much attention from many of your Lordships around the House&mdash;if I mention my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding, I hope that I do not do any other noble Lords a disservice by not mentioning them. The veto measures in the Bill, even with the Government's concession this afternoon, for which we are of course grateful, are simply not adequate protection. The fact that a committee of another place&mdash;or, indeed, your Lordships' House&mdash;can issue a veto is of no comfort at all if that committee is run politically; because all that is necessary is for the whip majority to vote for the measure. Moreover, there is also a provision in the Bill allowing a decision of another place to override the decision of the committee, even if the committee issues a veto.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/20">I should be interested to know what the Minister will propose to extricate himself from that difficulty. I suggest one possible solution: to follow the suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald, and, rather than have a committee of another place deal with this matter, have a Joint Committee in which no single party has an overall majority. There might be a sufficient number of, for example, Cross-Benchers from your Lordships' House to sit on it. In those circumstances, with a Joint Committee that is not dominated by any one party, a decision to veto, or not, would have a great deal more credibility and would be much more likely to be accepted by both Houses of Parliament and more generally in the outside world of regulators and regulatees. We shall certainly return to the veto issue in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/21">I entirely endorse everything that has been said about the Law Commission proposals, from the Liberal Democrat Benches, our own Benches and from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick. That matter was also addressed in the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee's report at paragraph 63. I hope I shall not be over-tiring your Lordships if I read it out:</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/22" class="indent">&quot;For these reasons, we conclude that it is inappropriate for Law Commission recommendations to be implemented by order and we recommend that the House seek the removal of clause 3 from the bill. Such legislation (if outside the scope of clause 1) is better made by bill, where all members of the House may participate and propose amendments; and amendments may be made by, and reconciled between, the two Houses in the usual way.&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/23">That ought to be absolutely conclusive as far as the Government are concerned. It could not have come from a more authoritative source. The Government want to expedite Law Commission measures, and I entirely endorse everything that has been said about the importance of raising their profile, particularly those which are uncontroversial. However, it has at its disposal the Jellicoe procedure, which was used four times between 1964 and 1967, three times with complete success. The fourth failed only because the Bill was plainly controversial to certain parties in another place.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/24">It was said by the noble Lord, Lord Garden, in winding up, that not much attention has been paid to the EC dimension. I say only that one of the great problems we have had with EC measures, particularly directives, is that many civil servants&mdash;it is unfair for me to criticise civil servants&mdash;many government Ministers have not been able to resist the temptation to implement directives in a way that raises the compliance requirements contained in the directives themselves. We shall therefore be tabling an amendment in Committee obliging the Government to implement directives to the standards contained in the directives and no higher. In that way, there is a reasonable chance of our being able to compete on a level playing field with every country in the European Community subject to the same rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.179.0/25">As my noble friend Lady Wilcox said towards the end of her speech, surely the best way of confronting this problem is to produce fewer regulations in the first place. The biggest contribution the Government can make to improving competition in this country and lowering the regulatory burden is, starting tomorrow, to stop regulating.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-13a.184.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="184"  time="019:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60613-19.htm#60613-19_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.184.2/1">I thought that there would be some agreement, my Lords. I have now listened for some four hours to contributions and comments from all sides of your Lordships' House. I have got to the stage where I cannot quite make up my mind exactly where the main focus of interest in the Bill will lie.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/2">The noble Lord, Lord Garden, set out a fair summary of the four generalities of issues raised in the debate. But noble Lords opposite, in particular, seem uncertain as to whether they wish to get rid of the whole Bill or parts of the Bill, welcome some of the Bill, welcome even more bits of the Bill or simply raise fundamental constitutional objections. I find that slightly confusing because, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-13">13 April</phrase>, after some amendments had been placed in another place, the Conservative Party issued a press release welcoming the Government's approach to amending the Bill and the further focus on delivering the better regulation agenda. Some of the contributions from the Benches opposite have certainly welcomed our approach; others have, as I said, been rather more fundamental in their approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/3">There were, at the outset, some warm words from the noble Baroness, Lady Wilcox, among some slightly less warm words. She said that we had listened to concerns and that the Bill was fresh and a step in the right direction. The noble Baroness said that you had to have political will in the deregulatory field and that, rather than just talking about it, you had to do it. I entirely endorse that approach; it is exactly what we are attempting to do with this Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/4">The noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, reminded us that this was initially a rather uncontroversial measure. He then said that it became rather more controversial when Members in another place&mdash;principally, I think, Mr Heath and Mr Howarth from the Liberal Democrat Benches&mdash;decided that it was controversial and deeply flawed because of what they saw as profound constitutional implications.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/5">So the debate has ranged far and wide. I particularly enjoyed the contribution from the noble Lord, Lord Haskins, which was a necessary corrective view of the Government's intentions. In the same vein, I enjoyed the supportive contributions of my noble friends Lord Lipsey, Lord Macdonald and Lord Whitty. Their support is based on a profound understanding of what the Government are trying to do so far as deregulation is concerned. My noble friend Lord Macdonald is very experienced in this field, particularly with his business expertise, and he reminded us that former government Ministers from the Conservative Party let the cat out of the bag when they told the public that they got gold stars by becoming heavily exercised regulators in their time.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/6">The problem, if there is a profound problem, has been with us not just during the life of this Government, but across Governments. But this Government are committed to having a long look at the way in which regulation works and trying to create procedures that unpick that, as were the Conservative Government in the early 1990s. I was grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury of Preston Candover, for his contribution, which focused on practical considerations. I well remember the work of the task forces and, although at times I would have disagreed with some of their propositions and proposals, I think that they were going in the right direction. In some ways, the Bill builds on that work, because its genesis goes back to 1994 and the first deregulatory measure in legislation, the Deregulation and Contracting Out Act of that year. There is agreement that it is important to create an effective legislative vehicle for delivering better regulation, and I hope that we will have the constructive debates that some Members of your Lordships' House have focused on in their contributions today.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/7">Much of the debate focused on Clause 3, which provides the power to implement Law Commission recommendations. I listened particularly carefully to the contribution made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, which was echoed by the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland, Lord Holme, Lord Norton, Lord Garden and Lord Goodhart, as well as by many other noble Lords. So I think that I should start by focusing more of my time on that part of the Bill. I think that we would all agree that it has taken Governments in general too long to implement worthwhile law reform proposals recommended by the Law Commission, of which the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, gave some useful examples. The Law Commission's annual report for 2005 showed that there are 16 currently accepted but unimplemented Law Commission reports and that the average waiting time for enactment of Law Commission reports is now over seven years. An example of Law Commission recommendations that could be implemented by order are those on third party rights against insurers. That perhaps illustrates the value of Clause 3 as currently drafted.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/8">I would have been deaf indeed if I had not heard the breadth of concern expressed by Members of your Lordships' House about the power in Clause 3. As the noble Lord, Lord Garden, and other noble Lords said, the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee raised a fundamental question about the appropriateness of the power to implement Law Commission recommendations by order. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, suggested that I might acknowledge that this evening and offer to remove Clause 3. I am not going to do that, but I am going to ensure that we give careful consideration to the comments that have been made so that we can meet and match the concerns that lie behind them.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/9">I ought to say that my noble friend Lady Ashton will be dealing with this Part of the Bill, and I will be working with her to study closely the comments made on Clause 3. I have no doubt that in Committee much time will be spent carefully going through the various amendments that will be tabled. I want to put on record our thanks to noble Lords for having raised those concerns, because I recognise their constitutional importance. I think it only fair to say that we need to spend more time taking careful note of Law Commission proposals, not least because they can uncontroversially make valuable changes to the law. However, Law Commission proposals require careful consideration, and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, said that we have to find a mechanism for ensuring that non-controversial Law Commission proposals can find their way more rapidly on to the statute book. I remain wedded to Clause 3 in its current form, but we will give careful consideration to the argument made on that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.184.2/10">During my original contribution, the noble Earl, Lord Onslow, raised the issue of the sort of measures and proposals that the Government might wish to repeal using this legislation. He asked which Acts of Parliament will be repealed. It is right to focus on specifics, and there are some that I can put forward this evening. Specific examples of measures that we may seek to abolish as a consequence of carrying through the legislation were attached to the Government's memoranda to the Delegated Powers Committee. Of course, it is possible to repeal Acts of Parliament under the 2001 Act. There are many examples of parts of legislation that we may wish to get rid of, review or amend in some way. For instance, the Charity Commission plans a review of the financial thresholds at which certain audit and registration requirements are required of charities. The DTI plans reviews to simplify&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.190.1/1">My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. This short Bill of two clauses comes from the other place unamended. It has the support of Her Majesty's Opposition who commended the Bill to the House, stating that they wish to help secure the Bill's speedy passage. It also has the support of the Liberal Democrats, who observed that they look forward to the Housing Corporation being able to continue to carry out its functions efficiently.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/2">It is not the longest Bill that has ever come before this House, but it has significance beyond its length in safeguarding social housing. That takes us to the heart of the Bill. Its purpose is simple. It gives the Housing Corporation a power of delegation from its board to below board level to any of its members, committees or employees in the future. It also deems the corporation always to have had such a power since it was founded in 1964. We need primary legislation because it is the only way in which we can be absolutely certain that the full range of past decisions of the corporation are valid and can provide a power of delegation going forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/3">I will give noble Lords a bit of history on why we are in this position. My speaking note is rather long, but I shall try to cover some of the issues that were raised in another place. Until the end of last year it was believed that the Housing Corporation board had an implied power of delegation. It was not just the corporation that thought it had such a power. Everyone else with an interest&mdash;my department, the lending community, housing associations and the 2 million people who live in housing association homes&mdash;thought that it had.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/4">I know that noble Lords are aware of what the Housing Corporation does and its importance to the provision and maintenance of high quality social housing in this country. However, perhaps I may explain what the Bill needs to achieve and put that into some context. The Housing Corporation was established under the Housing Act 1964 to oversee the housing association sector. Its position was later consolidated in subsequent legislation and its role and functions are now principally set out in the Housing Act 1996. Today, the corporation plays a crucial role in regulating nearly 1,800 housing associations&mdash;registered social landlords, or RSLs&mdash;which own or manage more than 2 million units of social housing and provide a range of other services to the broader community. The activities of the Housing Corporation have a direct impact on the lives of several million people in our society, many of whom are among the most vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/5">In carrying out its duties as regulator, the corporation drives improvements in housing association performance and efficiency to ensure that tenants have high quality homes to live in. It also has a strong focus on ensuring that housing associations are financially viable in order to protect the public investment in social housing and to ensure that associations continue to attract private finance at competitive rates to build and improve affordable homes.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/6">Equally important, the corporation is also the delivery agent for the provision of new social housing in England. It helps to develop and implement regional and national housing strategies, using public subsidy to procure affordable housing, being responsible for the national affordable housing programme. As noble Lords opposite know, after many years of experience, it has a very far-reaching role. It is obviously important therefore to facilitate the smooth passage of this Bill in order to safeguard the valuable work that it has done since 1964.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/7">The powers of the Housing Corporation need explanation. When it was created in 1964, it was very much a creature of its time. It was common for public bodies and non-departmental public bodies not to be given an explicit power of delegation. One reason for this is that at the time many bodies took fewer statutory decisions. It was therefore plausible for all such decisions to be carried out by the board. However, the primary reason that such explicit powers of delegation were not included in the legislative provisions establishing bodies such as the corporation is that at that time powers of delegation were more readily taken to be implied. Since then, the majority of bodies set up without explicit powers have been wound up or have had their legislation modernised to confer such powers. However, that did not happen in the case of the Housing Corporation.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/8">It appears that the reason for the failure to modernise the legislation was administrative oversight. We are not aware of any other NDPB being in the same predicament as the Housing Corporation. With hindsight, it is clear that the corporation's powers should have been reviewed at the time of the passing of the Housing Associations Act 1985, which this Bill amends. An explicit power of delegation should have been included in that Act. Unfortunately, no such action was taken. Subsequently, the passage of further Housing Acts in 1996 and 2004 would have provided another opportunity to give the corporation such a power, but it was again overlooked. It is very regrettable that that did not happen because we now have to spend separate parliamentary time on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/9">I should like to emphasise again that the board of the corporation believed that it had an implied power of delegation and has been acting in good faith on that basis since its inception in 1964. We know that because the corporation's board minutes record numerous instances of delegation of decisions taking place. Nowhere is there any suggestion that the corporation thought that it was acting unlawfully in doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/10">The problem was uncovered during preparations for an internal training course on delegations at the end of last year. The corporation discovered that an express power to delegate did not exist, and that it was unlikely that such a power could be implied. Legal advice to my officials confirmed that this was the case, and we promptly set about addressing the problem. It became clear that legislation was the only way to rectify the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/11">The Bill merely seeks to give the corporation a power which analogous bodies already have. Similar bodies, including the Audit Commission, English Partnerships, English Heritage and the Commission for Social Care Inspection, already enjoy such a power. The Bill seeks to give the Housing Corporation a power of delegation which everyone concerned thought that it already had, and therefore to return to the position that we thought we were in before the problem was discovered.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/12">I should like to explain two things. First, I shall outline the specific detail of the Bill and its provisions for the record. Secondly, I want to look at some of the key issues raised in debate in the other place in order to reassure noble Lords and to demonstrate why the Opposition and Liberal Democrats supported the Bill and urged its speedy passage through Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/13">The Bill has two clauses. Clause 1(1) gives the corporation an express power going forward to delegate the exercise of its functions to individual members of its board, its committees, sub-committees and employees, which it does by putting a new paragraph in Schedule 6 to the Housing Associations Act 1985. This subsection brings the powers of the corporation into line with the vast majority of other bodies and allows for administrative efficiency. Given the thousands of statutory decisions which must be taken by the corporation on a day-to-day basis, it is simply not practical for all such decisions to be taken by the board itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/14">Subsection (2) gives the corporation and Housing for Wales a retrospective power of delegation to any of its members, committees, sub-committees or employees to ensure that statutory decisions are not invalid by reason of being delegated by the board on the presumption that it had an implied power to do so. This is to remove any doubt about the validity of such decisions on the grounds that they were not taken by the board itself and essentially restores what was assumed to be the status quo.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/15">Subsection (3) operates to validate past decisions taken or evidenced by a document duly executed under the seal of the corporation or Housing for Wales. As I have explained, the corporation believed that it had the power from its inception to delegate and, acting on that assumption, set up delegation procedures. Although the board's delegation procedures are often well documented, in many cases it would be impossible at this stage to provide evidence to demonstrate beyond doubt that a decision which may have been taken 40 years ago was valid. To do so, it would be necessary to show that the decision in question was made by a committee of the corporation or by someone who was a member or employee at the relevant time, and to whom it was intended that the power to take the decision would be delegated. This subsection has been included to relieve the burden on third parties and the corporation to provide evidence to establish those facts. Without such a provision, uncertainty about the validity of large numbers of past decisions would remain.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/16">It is also intended that the clause should be broad enough to cover all eventualities: every decision where the parties have acted in good faith. So the legislation provides the certainty we require. For example, it covers instances where informal instructions were given to a member of the board to take decisions, so no formal decision to delegate was even documented. In practice we believe that this happened very rarely, if at all, but without this provision it is possible that third parties acting in good faith would be disadvantaged. To provide certainty without making provision here, either we would have to go back and look at each decision, informal or formal, to see whether it had been delegated informally or formally. Given the corporation's history, in most cases it would not be possible because records may no longer exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/17">Subsection (4) provides that where the fixing of the seal has been witnessed by any member or employee of the corporation or Housing for Wales during the period prior to this Bill, it has been properly witnessed. The previous legislation enacted in 1996 provided that the fixing of the corporation seal may be authenticated by the signature of the chairman or any other person authorised for the purpose, but it would be difficult and in some cases impossible to establish years after the event that the individual authenticating the fixing of the seal was an employee or a member at the relevant time and had in fact been authorised to take that action.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/18">To reiterate, the intention of these two subsections is to give complete certainty about the validity of the corporation's decisions and to draw a firm line under past decisions made by the corporation which have been duly executed under seal and authenticated by a member, employee, the corporation or Housing for Wales. It removes any doubt about their validity. Essentially, third parties can assume that any decision properly executed by the corporation under seal is valid.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/19">Obviously, I must stress that these subsections will not be used to validate fraudulent decisions. We are not suggesting that any such decisions have ever been made, but under Clause 1(3) decisions of the corporation must have been duly executed to have validity. Clearly decisions which were fraudulent would not have been duly executed.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/20">Moving on to Clause 2, this sets out the Title of the Bill and the fact that it will extend to England, Wales and Scotland in the following ways. The legislation will have effect in Wales in respect of decisions of the corporation relating to housing associations in Wales before the establishment of Housing for Wales and during the later period when the corporation's former functions were carried out by Housing for Wales. Since 1999 these functions have been carried out by the National Assembly for Wales and there is no question about the validity of such decisions. The Bill will have effect in Scotland in respect of decisions of the corporation relating to housing associations in Scotland made prior to the commencement of the Housing (Scotland) Act 1988. That Act established Scottish Homes, which took over the responsibilities of the Housing Corporation in relation to housing associations in Scotland. Those responsibilities were subsequently transferred to Communities Scotland, an agency of the Scottish Executive. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-10">10 May</phrase> the Scottish Parliament formally approved a legislative consent motion in respect of this Bill, which allows it to apply to Scotland in the way described. The Housing Corporation has never operated in Northern Ireland and therefore the Bill does not extend there.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/21">Before I close, perhaps I may go over one or two of the key issues raised in the other place to provide noble Lords with reassurances and to stress that the swift progression of this Bill is the only way to rectify the situation the Housing Corporation finds itself in today. Honourable Members of opposition parties expressed worries about the retrospective nature of the legislation in the sense that it might legitimise past decisions delegated by the corporation board. I should stress that the usual concerns about legislative retrospection do not apply here. We are well aware of the potential dangers attached to retrospection and we are careful about it, in particular where the legislation imposes a penalty on individuals. But the other reason for scrutinising retrospective legislation carefully is that it is often inconsistent with the need for legal certainty and could operate against the interest of individuals in an unfair or arbitrary manner. However, this Bill does not seek to alter the rights of individuals to the benefit of some and the disadvantage of others. It does not seek to unravel transactions with unforeseeable consequences. In fact, as I have pointed out several times, the reverse is true: the Bill will establish what was thought to be the status quo and will put parties in the position they all considered they were in before the problem was discovered. It gives the Housing Corporation and stakeholders a power everyone had previously thought applied and therefore self-evidently there are no issues or additional costs arising in respect of implementation. The Bill simply ensures that those who have acted in good faith in reliance on Housing Corporation decisions are not disadvantaged.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/22">I turn now to the detail. Honourable Members also rightly expressed an interest in the kinds of delegated decisions of concern here. There are several types of decision. The major concern relates to Section 9 of the Housing Act 1996 which requires the consent of the corporation to be obtained by a registered social landlord for any disposal of land or housing stock under Section 8 of that Act. In most cases where a valid consent has not been obtained, the disposal would be void. A disposal includes the placing of charges on property by lenders as security against a loan. It is obviously very important to have certainty about these consents because they are significant and have important implications for the future of social housing, new build and the levels at which housing associations can borrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/23">Legal advice has assured us that in fact the effect of land registration is likely to protect purchasers and owners with an interest in land. Under the system of land registration, the fact of registration itself is the source of title, so charges registered are valid and binding unless the registrar or the court can be persuaded to rectify; namely, to amend the register following a challenge. Legal advice is that in these circumstances it is unlikely that rectification would be granted. Nevertheless, that qualified reassurance has not been sufficient to provide the sector with the certainty it requires. There remains uncertainty among those who consider that they had a valid and enforceable interest in land. The situation raised questions about decisions that could have had an important and long-term impact on the future of social housing such as, for example, the interest rate at which housing associations could borrow against assets. This could be raised to reflect the increased risk to lenders; the draw-down of loans in general terms; or the confidence that lenders might have in individual housing associations or broadly in social housing. All these things might be affected in the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/24">I have no doubt that the noble Baronesses will agree that maintaining the confidence of the social housing sector in these long-term decisions is a very serious matter. It is essential that lenders feel that they can continue to invest; that housing associations continue to function as normal; and that tenants who depend on social housing continue to feel assured of the financial viability of their organisations. Because of the close involvement we have had with lender organisations and their representatives since the problem was discovered and because we have taken prompt action in addressing it, lenders have thus far been persuaded to take no action. They have, however, agreed to this on the condition that we legislate as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/25">I should also stress that we have closely involved not only the Housing Corporation but representatives of RSLs and the Financial Services Authority in the preparation of the legislation and they support its speedy passage.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/26">There are a few other areas of concern about which we need to have complete certainty. One of these is the status of other regulatory decisions taken by the corporation, such as statutory appointments to the board of an RSL which has experienced problems and is under supervision. We would not want those sorts of decisions challenged opportunistically by interested parties, particularly where an RSL is already under supervision and needs to be regulated further in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/27">There are also potential concerns about housing association registration and rule changes. The corporation is responsible for registering social landlords. Registration brings them within the scope of regulation, which establishes the basis on which the social housing grant is paid to them, and the corporation must give its consent to any changes in the rules or objects of an association. For example, it might be to extend the range of activities undertaken by an association or the client groups that the association was established to serve. A failure to obtain a valid consent may call into question subsequent constitutional amendments since the initial incorporation of the RSL and the actions that had been taken were on the assumption that the rule changes were valid.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/28">A number of RSLs have adopted changes to include express powers in relation, for example, to lending matters, to borrowing limits, to swap powers and to powers to create floating charges. If those powers are not in place it is very difficult to be certain that loans, guarantees and hedging agreements would be valid.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/29">Finally, decisions made under Schedule 1 to the Housing Act 1996 to grant special determinations to the RSLs permitting them to make specific payments to staff and board members would also have a degree of uncertainty cast upon them. That, again, would leave the way open to challenge in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/30">As I have said, in some areas of concern we can take some comfort from other legislation. I have mentioned the Land Registration Act 2002, which should provide comfort about the enforceability of transactions; and the Companies Act 1985 and the Industrial and Provident Societies Act 1965 might give some comfort in regard to rule changes. But having looked into this in some detail, it is clear that those provisions offer insufficient certainty and comfort whether we are talking about the associations, lenders, residents or the Housing Corporation.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/31">I want to be clear that we are not saying that the decisions taken by the corporation or the subsequent actions of RSLs are invalid, rather that we cannot be 100 per cent that a court would find them valid if challenged. That goes to the heart of the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/32">One further issue that was raised in the other place concerned the review of housing and regeneration. As noble Lords will know, my department is carrying out at the moment a review of the roles of the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships. It was suggested in the other place that the Bill might be delayed until the outcome of that review was known. We have not yet made a decision about the relationship between the Housing Corporation and English Partnerships. If the two organisations were to merge, obviously we would need primary legislation. It would take time to draw that up and to take decisions about the functions that any new body would have. So we could not delay the measures without being irresponsible and having to face uncertainties about the legislation being introduced and the timing available to us.</p>
	<p pid="a.190.1/33">There is a wide-ranging consensus among all stakeholders as well as support from all parties in the other place that this Bill is the only way to solve the problem that we find ourselves in. It restores what we all believed until the end of last year to be the status quo. I am sorry to have spoken at such length but I hope that the degree of detail will reassure the noble Baronesses that the Bill does exactly what it is intended to do. I wholeheartedly commend it to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.201.1/1">My Lords, I will certainly write to the noble Baroness about this, because my advice is that delegated powers will apply whether or not the seal is used. However, she has asked me what sort of decisions might fall into the category and I am sure that I can give her a fuller answer in writing about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/2">The noble Baroness also asked me whether there are any other implications for other bodies that might find themselves in similar positions. We know that all our DCLG bodies are fine&mdash;we have checked that. The Cabinet Office wrote to all departments on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-02">2 June</phrase> asking them to check that their NDPBs were not in the same position, and requested that they take any further action as required. That is a recent development. I cannot give any detail on that, but maybe while the Bill progresses as fast as possible we shall inform the House about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/3">I think that I have answered all the specific questions but, if I have not, I shall add to the letter that I intend to write to the noble Baronesses opposite.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/4">I am grateful for this very helpful response and, indeed, the questions that the noble Baronesses have asked, because they have been very much to the point. The Bill is obviously being brought forward for the reasons that we know now, as a consequence of the discovery that the Housing Corporation did not have the implied power. It gives the express power to delegate, and deems the corporation always to have had such a power. It gives it the power to delegate below board level, which it was always assumed to have had, and so restores the status quo. It is essential to enable the Housing Corporation to function effectively again, to protect RSLs and their residents, and to reassure other stakeholders such as lenders and the financial regulator. I think that we all want to secure that.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/5">I am happy that we have had such positive contributions. We want to move quickly to reduce any anxiety and resolve the issues that have far-reaching ramifications for people doing very important work. As I have said, the Bill went unamended through the other place, and I hope that we will be able to secure that result here, too. It is the only practicable way in which to address the problem, and I am very grateful for the support. I wholeheartedly commend this Bill and invite the House to give it a Second Reading.</p>
	<p pid="a.201.1/6">On Question, Bill read a second time.</p>
