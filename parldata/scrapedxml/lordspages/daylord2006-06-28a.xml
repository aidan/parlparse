<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-28a.1208.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="1208"  time="016:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60628-08.htm#60628-08_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1208.0/1">My Lords, I beg to move that the House do not insist on its Amendments Nos. 5 and 11 and do agree to Amendment No. 11A proposed by the Commons in lieu.</p>
	<p pid="a.1208.0/2">We have covered this ground many times during our debates on the Bill. I shall therefore be brief. As the House will recall, Clause 2 makes amendments to Section 78 of the Civil Aviation Act 1982. That section enables the Secretary of State to take steps to limit or mitigate the effect of noise and vibration connected with the taking off or landing of aircraft at designated airports. The current legislation&mdash;Section 78(3) of the 1982 Act&mdash;does not require operating restrictions. If partial restrictions are set for this purpose, they must be in the form of a numerical limit on movements by aircraft of the types that it is intended to restrict. At present, the night flying restrictions at the designated airports&mdash;Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted&mdash;comprise a numerical movements limit and a noise quota set for each summer and winter season. The noise quota is a supplementary measure designed to encourage the use of quieter aircraft. That is the structure of the regime that will apply at those airports from October 2006 to October 2012, as my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-06">6 June 2006</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1208.0/3">In the White Paper, <i>The Future of Air Transport</i>, which was published following consultation on our long-standing aircraft noise ban, the Government said that they would amend the current legislation so that operating restrictions could in future be set on a different basis&mdash;for example, one more directly related to the noise nuisance caused. That is exactly what Clause 2 set out to achieve. Amendment No. 5 removed subsection 2 of that clause and removed the requirement on the Secretary of State to set a movements limit as part of any operating restriction limiting aircraft noise at a designated airport. The Secretary of State would not be prevented from continuing to set movement limits, but could consider additional alternatives; for instance if they proved a more effective incentive to use quieter aircraft.</p>
	<p pid="a.1208.0/4">In proposing Clause 2 we were not seeking to reduce restrictions. We were seeking to make the restrictions more appropriate to the challenge that we face. The Secretary of State could, for example, impose a restriction in the form of noise quotas or a limiting noise contour area without specifying a maximum number of movements. I emphasise that our intention in bringing forward Clause 2 was not, and never has been, to prevent Governments setting stringent controls on night flying at airports.</p>
	<p pid="a.1208.0/5">It has been suggested by opposition parties that we are seeking to remove a statutory cap on movements. As I mentioned, the legislation does not impose an obligation to set operating restrictions. It is therefore misleading and inaccurate to suggest that we are planning to remove any restrictions. The suggestion that the Government intend to relax restrictions must be seen in the context of our recent announcement on night flights at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, which did not provide for any relaxation of current limits and tightened a number of controls. The Government intend to act over the next six years without any suggestion of relaxation. That demonstrates our commitment to the effective management of noise impacts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1208.0/6">We do not think that the Opposition have any basis on which to sustain the claim, voiced on a number of occasions, that we are manoeuvring to allow a significant increase in night flights. I hope the announcement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-06">6 June</phrase> that the night flight restrictions will apply at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted until October 2012 will put an end to the equally groundless accusations that the Government intend to ignore the basis on which they consulted and bring in a new restrictions regime on a totally different basis once these provisions receive Royal Assent. That is not our intention, and that is not what the Bill provides.</p>
	<p pid="a.1208.0/7">We understand the value of movement limits to residents presently around the designated airports. That is why we have announced that they should continue to be set as part of the next regime. But movement limits alone are a pretty blunt instrument, as they would not directly control the amount of noise permitted at night. Neither could they affect the types of aircraft used at night, because as long as the aircraft meet the numbers, it is immaterial what kind of aircraft they are. That is why noise quotas are set alongside the movement limits at present to drive the use of the quietest aircraft available. That is why we are concerned to emphasise that part of the policy.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-28a.1236.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100352" speakername="Lord Kingsland" colon=":" colnum="1236"  time="018:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60628-16.htm#60628-16_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.1236.2/1">My Lords, Amendment No. 38 and all the other amendments in its line seek to remove Part 3 from the Bill. I spoke at some length on this matter in Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-03">3 May</phrase>, at cols. 519 to 521 and 530 to 533 of <i>Hansard</i>. My mind has remained unchanged since then, so I need do no more than summarise what I said on that occasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1236.2/2">There are four reasons why this part should be removed. The first is a drafting reason, the second concerns the lack of a referendum, the third relates to the minimised involvement of your Lordships' House and another place and the fourth concerns the degree of discretion that is transferred from Part 3 to the Secretary of State.</p>
	<p pid="a.1236.2/3">I can deal with the first point very briefly. As I said in the discussion on the first amendment, the structure of Part 3 seems entirely illogical. The natural process is, first, for authority to be delegated by Parliament to the Welsh Assembly to do certain things additional to those that it does at the moment; and, secondly, when it has that general authority, to enact particular measures that conform to the delegated powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1236.2/4">Your Lordships may think that that is the way in which Part 3 ought to be set out&mdash;but not a bit of it. Part 3 starts in Clause 92 with stage 2 and making Welsh Assembly measures. It then goes back in Clause 94 to the act of delegating the authority to legislate to the Welsh Assembly and, at the end, comes back again to Assembly measures. My minimal requirement is for the Government to go away at this stage and reorder the clauses in Part 3 so that the Bill can make more sense to the electorate. I challenge anyone to understand before they have read it at least three times. It is plain throughout the deliberations in another place that as many interventions were made on the basis of misunderstanding as on the basis of true understanding&mdash;and that applies to government Ministers as well as to Back Benchers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1236.2/5">My second reason for removing the part is the absence of a referendum. We have said repeatedly from these Benches that we would be entirely content for Part 4 of the Bill to become operative following a referendum. We would far prefer that Part 4 formed the basis of Welsh devolution than Part 3. Indeed, I would go as far as to say that I would prefer Part 4 to form the basis of Welsh devolution without a referendum than Part 3. I am not very well disposed towards referendums, as I think that they undermine the system of representative democracy in this country. But the fact of the matter is that the powers of the Welsh Assembly were originally devolved following a referendum; and I do not see how a further act of devolution can be undertaken without a further referendum.</p>
	<p pid="a.1236.2/6">These points were well canvassed in another place. Mr Ainger, the Minister in another place, said with complete openness and frankness that the reason why the Government had not contemplated a referendum was that they knew that they were not going to win it. Mr Ainger based his approach to the absence of the need for a referendum with respect to Part 3 on the manifesto; but there is nothing in the manifesto to indicate that Part 3 was in the Government's mind before the election. There was a debate about devolution, but that was entirely limited to the proposals put forward by the commission chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Richard. In short, the absence of a referendum ought to be fatal to Part 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.1236.2/7">Then there is the third issue of parliamentary involvement. We have already looked at that in some detail when considering Amendment No. 36A and I do not wish to say any more about it, as it is a matter on which your Lordships' House has already voted. The fact is that there is no parliamentary involvement in stage 2. As for stage 1, under the Bill there is the same parliamentary involvement as in the making of any Order in Council. Parliament has a short opportunity to debate, with no opportunity to amend, followed by a take-it-or-leave-it vote. That seems entirely unsatisfactory when one considers the monumental constitutional consequences of what we are doing in Part 3.</p>
	<p pid="a.1236.2/8">The Government to some extent recognised this in another place when they suggested a pre-legislative process involving perhaps both the Welsh Affairs Committee and the Welsh Grand Committee. Mr Ainger foreshadowed the possibility that amendments by these committees would be seriously considered by the Welsh Assembly in considering the final draft of the Order in Council; but at no stage will Parliament have any opportunity to amend the draft Assembly measure for adding to the fields contained in Schedule 5. Moreover, at no stage have the Government given any indication that they might allow Parliament to amend that draft Order in Council. This is wholly unsatisfactory, given the scale of the issues that the Bill confronts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1236.2/9">Finally, the Government's rhetoric suggests that this is a big transfer of powers from one Parliament to another; but that is far from the case, as one sees when one grapples with the detail of the Bill. The real shift in power is from this Parliament to the Executive and the Secretary of State. We have already seen, in the second stage process under Part 3, that the Secretary of State can under Clause 100 intervene to prevent a Welsh Assembly measure, properly passed by the Welsh Assembly under clear delegated authority under Schedule 5, from being considered by the Privy Council. As for the first stage devolution, the Secretary of State has wide powers to prevent the draft Order in Council from going to Buckingham Palace.</p>
	<p pid="a.1236.2/10">We consider any one of these considerations to be sufficiently powerful to ask the House to excise Part 3 from the Bill. In our view, all four of them make out of a case of the greatest cogency. I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-28a.1263.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100521" speakername="Baroness Rawlings" colon=":" colnum="1263"  time="020:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60628-24.htm#60628-24_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1263.0/1">My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, for giving us the opportunity to debate this Question. The DfID report highlights an area of international aid and development that has recently been widely reported but that may now well fall into its customary obscurity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1263.0/2">Recent years have seen a tragic loss of life and enormous damage to infrastructure and to economies caused by natural disasters. The Asian tsunami at the end of 2004 showed us just how enormous the impact of a natural disaster can be, and how long the effects of one can last throughout the region. Even before 2004, the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies 1998 report said that natural disasters that year created more refugees than did armed conflicts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1263.0/3">I hope that the debate will help to keep the lessons learnt from recent years to the forefront of our minds. The risk of natural disasters will not lessen as the memories of the Pakistan earthquake or Hurricane Katrina fade. Many noble Lords have stressed how the recent disasters have also made clear the enormously different impacts on rich and poor countries alike. In one, a natural disaster may cause significant damage to property and infrastructure, but little loss of life. In the other, a natural disaster will cause enormous loss of life and long-term damage or even obliteration of the regional economy and infrastructure. That contrast highlights just how much can be done to protect communities in future; not just by improving the response to a disaster, but also in prevention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1263.0/4">The public response to the Asian tsunami was tremendous, as has been appreciated many times in this House. However, public fundraising campaigns cannot be relied on for a long-term solution. The recent famines in Africa, which many have pointed out could have been prevented by more timely aid at an earlier stage, show how less dramatic but equally tragic events do not gain enough media coverage or public support until it is too late.</p>
	<p pid="a.1263.0/5">I am glad to see that the DFID report acknowledges the importance of making certain that preventative strategies are given their due priority by donor countries and organisations, and the national governments of the countries at risk, as stressed by the noble Baroness, Lady Northover. That policy, as is emphasised in the report, must not be seen as bleeding limited resources away from crucial short-term projects for a distant and speculative gain. Actions taken to prevent deforestation and to improve river drainage and water courses, or to enforce building standards, will all bring considerable short-term benefits as well as lowering the likelihood of a future natural disaster.</p>
	<p pid="a.1263.0/6">We on these benches are broadly in agreement with the report, but there is much in it that we feel has not been addressed. The policy objectives are very clear on the need to support the international system which can provide long-term, co-ordinated aid. But what steps are the Government taking to make certain that other countries are doing the same? On <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-12">12 June</phrase>, Hilary Benn proudly announced the sums that the UK had contributed to the UN's Central Emergency Response Fund, but the UK cannot give all that is needed; we must encourage other countries to increase their efforts too.</p>
	<p pid="a.1263.0/7">The DFID report also highlights the need to build institutional structures within the disaster-prone countries. It says that it,</p>
	<p pid="a.1263.0/8" class="indent">&quot;will focus on collaborating with developing country governments&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1263.0/9">Yet we know from past experience how ineffective those governments can be in setting up such ambitious institutions. How can the noble Baroness assure us that funds, whether bilateral or channelled through the United Nations or other international organisations, will not be lost through corruption?</p>
	<p pid="a.1263.0/10">The report lays out the intention for DfID to use its regional divisions and country offices. I am glad that the importance of local knowledge and awareness of local conditions is appreciated, but can the noble Baroness explain how this policy is to be implemented in the face of closure of many overseas offices? How are DfID directors expected to work effectively with the recipient country if there is no FCO office remaining in the country? We have heard many of the policies laid out in this report in the 1997 White Paper. I can hope only that the next nine years see more progress in reducing the risk of natural disasters than the past nine years have done. We need a consistent and thorough approach to improving systems in the developing world and we hope that this Government will now be able to deliver.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-28a.1265.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100828" speakername="Baroness Royall of Blaisdon" colon=":" colnum="1265"  time="020:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60628-24.htm#60628-24_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.1265.0/1">My Lords, I, too, congratulate my noble friend Lord Dubs on securing this debate and I thank all noble Lords who have taken part. Development organisations, including DfID, have underinvested in disaster risk reduction, or DRR. While continuing to respond generously to disasters, the Government recognise in their new policy paper that we must invest more in prevention. This is, however, long-term and low-profile work, which deserves much greater attention. I therefore warmly welcome this debate as an opportunity to raise its profile.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265.0/2">As noble Lords have pointed out so graphically, the past two years have seen some of the worst natural disasters in living memory: the Asian tsunami; droughts in Africa; floods in eastern Europe; devastating hurricanes in the Caribbean and the US; and, most recently, the Pakistan and Java earthquakes. These disasters have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives, ruined millions of livelihoods and caused billions of pounds' worth of damage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265.0/3">The number and frequency of disasters are growing. According to Munich Re, one of the world's largest reinsurers, economic losses from disasters in the 1990s totalled more than US$608 billion. That is greater than losses over the four previous decades combined. Climate change is bringing an increase in the frequency and severity of floods, storms and droughts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265.0/4">In addition, the resulting social and human costs are immense, with death, hunger and displaced persons, and with communities and infrastructure destroyed. We know that the poorest people are worst affected and suffer the most when disasters occur. We recognise that raising awareness of the risks is vital. That is why we are supporting the work of ActionAid, Plan UK and the International Strategy for Disaster Reduction to educate children about such risks. Many noble Lords have rightly emphasised the role of children. I acknowledge that perhaps we did not in the policy document talk enough about educating children and young people about the risks that they face from natural hazards, which is one of the best means of strengthening communities' resilience to disasters. That is exactly what ActionAid and Plan UK, with our support, are doing. I congratulate them on their excellent work. Of course, as noble Lords have pointed out, we must listen to and learn from children. That is the best way forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265.0/5">I hope that with the Education for All initiative, which was recently launched by my right honourable friends the Chancellor and the Secretary of State for International Development, together with the President of Mozambique and President Mandela, there will perhaps be an opportunity to ensure that DRR is included in the curriculum, where appropriate, in developing countries. As the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, said, children in the wider communities must be familiar with the system and how to respond. We are supporting work in the Indian Ocean region to ensure that communities know not only about the tsunami early warning system, but how to use it to their benefit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265.0/6">The capacity to cope with and reduce risk is much more limited in poor countries. You only have to compare the two earthquakes mentioned by my noble friend Lord Dubs to understand that. Poor countries not only suffer great economic and social loss, but their capacity to reduce risk is also limited. Disasters affect economic development in poor countries and slow down progress towards the millennium development goals. For example, education becomes more difficult. Women and girls have increased responsibilities and, of course, children are often at most risk in floods and drought. The number of people living below the poverty line in Aceh increased from 30 per cent to 50 per cent following the 2004 tsunami.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265.0/7">The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, is right that the public response to the tsunami was extraordinary. But, of course, the international community needs to learn the lessons from the way in which the disaster caused by the tsunami was handled. We look forward to a report by the Tsunami Evaluation Commission, which will be launched in London on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-14">14 July</phrase>. We will look carefully at its recommendations. Before I leave the issue of communities, I should respond to the noble Baroness, Lady Howe. She is absolutely right that no two communities are alike. We have to enable communities to respond in the way that best meets their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265.0/8">It is clear that we need a renewed effort on DRR. In his speech on humanitarian reform in December 2004, my right honourable friend Hilary Benn committed DfID to giving a higher priority to DRR, which we have done. Following his speech, a tsunami devastated large swathes of the Indian Ocean region. Shortly after the tsunami, the world met in Kobe at the World Conference on Disaster Reduction to agree the way forward on DRR over the next decade. These events reinforced the need for this step change in DfID's DRR work. We are encouraging the international community to follow suit. As the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, said, that is the real challenge, but I am very glad that he pointed out that there was mention of risk in the G8 conclusions last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265.0/9">As part of the step change, DfID launched its new DRR policy on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-30">30 March</phrase>. This policy, which is fully in line with the Hyogo framework for action, has three overarching objectives. The first is to promote better integration of DRR into development programmes. We have recently agreed a &pound;4 million programme with the Word Bank to include DRR measures in the poverty reduction strategies of several disaster-prone countries in Africa, Asia and central America. DfID is also planning to train its staff to implement DRR in its own programmes. To answer to my noble friend Lord Tunnicliffe, we are supporting comprehensive disaster management planning in a range of countries, including Bangladesh. Of course, we also understand the need for the MoD and the FCO to agree the way forward so that we are ready to respond to disasters when they, sadly, happen. We are also working with the UN, the EU and other donors to consider how disaster risk can be more effectively incorporated into national level planning processes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265.0/10">Secondly, we are working to improve the international DRR system. The Secretary of State for International Development called on the United Nations to consider whether its institutional set-up was adequate for the scale of the challenge. The UK has worked closely with the UN to reform the international strategy for disaster reduction, and we have recently contributed &pound;3 million to this. Thirdly, we are working to reduce the vulnerability of poor communities by building their resilience to hazards. Over the past year or so, we have invested around &pound;16 million in the Red Cross, ActionAid, Christian Aid and other NGOs to support community-level DRR work in Africa and Asia. We are also committed to allocating 10 per cent of the funding provided by DfID in response to each natural disaster to prepare for and mitigate the impact of future disasters where that can be done effectively. We will spend &pound;7.5 million on DRR work in the tsunami-affected region and around &pound;6 million in Pakistan following the earthquake.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265.0/11">The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, asked how we can ensure that funds are not lost through corruption. We are working on governance issues, and we are building the administrative capacity and the other capacity needed in developing countries with some of this money. Just last week, my right honourable friend the Prime Minister announced that my right honourable friend Hilary Benn would be the Minister responsible for addressing corruption across the Government, and I am sure that he will have a large role to play in ensuring that these moneys are well spent in a properly accountable way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265.0/12">The noble Baroness, Lady Northover, and other noble Lords have rightly raised the link between the increasing number of disasters and climate change, since the vast majority of the world's disasters are climate-related. Clearly, climate change and disaster reduction communities must work more closely together to reduce the vulnerability of people to those hazards. The Government are contributing to a range of international environment and climate change initiatives, including a pledge of &pound;140 million to the global environment facility, as a signal of our commitment to addressing global environmental problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265.0/13">Naturally, we recognise that we must invest more in preventing slow-onset disasters such as drought, which increase the numbers of destitute and therefore the need for relief over the years. DfID is therefore increasing its support for timely, adequate and guaranteed small payments of cash and/or food, fertiliser and seeds on a regular and long-term basis to the neediest. Those safety nets help to protect people from selling their assets in crisis and build resilience against shocks. In Ethiopia, for example, we have given &pound;52 million of our &pound;70 million commitment to support 8.24 million people. We are working with African Governments to scale up this approach in Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Zambia and Lesotho. Providing additional financial resource is important, but much can be done to reduce disaster risk without extra money. Reducing disaster risk will in part be achieved by ensuring that our ongoing development and humanitarian work and that of our partners effectively takes account of risk&mdash;for example, through ensuring that infrastructure is properly designed to withstand possible climatic and seismic shocks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265.0/14">There is also an important role for the private sector. In developed countries, the private sector is at the heart of risk management, but that is not the case in developing countries. There needs to be greater engagement with the private sector to promote the more active engagement in emerging markets and poor communities. Naturally, insurance companies have a very large role to play, as mentioned by my noble friend Lord Hunt of Chesterton. We have to build on the examples provided by microinsurance and microcredit institutions&mdash;their potential applications to risk reduction should be explored. That could include encouraging the private sector to incorporate disaster risk issues in their CSR programmes. I am pleased to report that companies such as Cable &amp; Wireless are talking to DfID about how best to get involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.1265.0/15">We know that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. What will we be doing on Monday morning? One thing that we will be doing is announcing the funding of a programme as part of the conflict and humanitarian fund to look at the cost benefit analysis of DRR interventions in Pakistan, India and Nepal. We really are putting our money where our mouth is. We are absolutely committed to doing more to reducing the impact of disasters, particularly in the poorest countries. We are providing substantial resources, but we have a challenge in galvanising and sustaining sufficient resources from the wider international community. That will require continued attention and advocacy both from Ministers and from civil society groups. The Government cannot solve the disaster risk reduction funding issue on their own. We must continue to give high priority in making the case for disaster reduction, and we should work to strengthen the commitment of partner country authorities to recognise the importance of disaster reduction and give it due priority in their policies. We will continue to do all that we can to ensure that that happens.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-28a.1270.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100809" speakername="Lord Rowlands" colon=":" colnum="1270"  time="020:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60628-25.htm#60628-25_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.1270.4/1">My Lords, in moving Amendment No. 43 I have no wish to rehearse or readdress the debate that we had in Committee on this issue but, perhaps drawing upon that debate and also on the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January</phrase> in another place, to see whether we can come to a conclusion about the nature and contents of Orders in Council. When my noble friend replies, perhaps we could have the equivalent of a definitive statement on what he sees as the essential elements of the contents of an Order in Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.1270.4/2">I venture, therefore, to offer two or three thoughts about such contents as a contribution to his conclusions. It seems to me that the first conclusion we can draw from the discussions that we had in Committee, and certainly from those in the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January</phrase>, is that any Order in Council can be brought forward only in a particular policy context. In other words, it cannot be brought forward in a kind of vacuum. That has been emphasised over and over again by my noble friend in this House and certainly by Mr Nick Ainger in the other place. In fact, it appears that before we ever see an Order in Council there is going to be a very elaborate pre-Order in Council process. The Parliamentary Secretary described it on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-24">24 January</phrase>: there will be memoranda explaining what the measures will cover; the reasons behind them; the policy developed and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.1270.4/3">Then there will be, as my noble friend emphasised in the debate in Committee, a thorough pre-legislative scrutiny. Again, the Parliamentary Secretary said that the proposed draft orders can be amended, which would mean that more weight would be given to pre-legislative scrutiny than usual&mdash;possibly because orders are ultimately not amendable. I find it very comforting and reassuring that there will be a considerable run-in to an Order in Council coming before us in draft form and, subsequently, in its final form.</p>
	<p pid="a.1270.4/4">However, none of those statements quite answers the question I posed in Committee&mdash;that is, what will be included in the Order in Council as presented to us? The only way in which we can answer that so far as I can see now is to fall back upon the two mock draft orders that the Government helpfully offered us as examples of the shape that an Order in Council will take. Looking at the two mock draft orders&mdash;the transport and public ombudsman orders&mdash;we notice, first, that there has to be a specific identification of the field within which enhanced legislative competence is being sought. For example, the transport order will obviously identify that it is field 10 under which the competence is being sought. Then, under that, there is &quot;The Matter&quot;; and under &quot;The Matter&quot; there is, possibly, &quot;Provision&quot;. There could be more than one provision or a provision and a series of subsections. I shall come to the transport order in a minute.</p>
	<p pid="a.1270.4/5">I assume from these two mock draft orders that the principal purpose or purposes for which the enhanced competence is being sought&mdash;and the reasons why&mdash;will be included in the Order in Council. That is one of the assurances that I would like my noble friend to give me, because that seems to be the only conclusion we can draw from the two mock draft orders we have received. This is a fundamental point as it demonstrates that these are not open-ended orders in many respects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1270.4/6">On the draft transport order, in Committee I raised the question&mdash;my noble friend did not deal with it, but I do not blame him because he was replying to a fractured debate of one kind or another&mdash;why this order did not include one of the most eye-catching aspects of the original transport Bill: the power which the Assembly was seeking to fund and support or subsidise air services and airports. I hope my noble friend will say why that was excluded, especially because on rereading the draft transport order, he may have come to the same conclusion to which I have come, that as the order was drafted I do not believe that it would have given the Assembly such competence. Interestingly, the last part of the provision in relation to it refers to financial support for such bodies by levy or precepts. The reference to such bodies is in paragraph (b), and all those are about local authority transport functions. Therefore, I suspect that as drafted, and by leaving out the specific reference to the support for air services, it may be that the Assembly would not have such competence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1270.4/7">All that I wish to do is to emphasise the importance of the essential elements of the Order in Council so that we know what we are voting for. The kind of assurance that I seek is that we do not have a draft order that reads something like this:</p>
	<p pid="a.1270.4/8" class="indent">&quot;Field 16: support for sport and recreation&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1270.4/9">or,</p>
	<p pid="a.1270.4/10" class="indent">&quot;provisions in relation to support&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1270.4/11">or,</p>
	<p pid="a.1270.4/12" class="indent">&quot;Field 5: provisions in relation to nursery education&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1270.4/13">We expect, and I hope that my noble friend will give us the assurance, that such minimally worded orders with such huge potential for expansion of Assembly legislative competence will not be considered or come to this House or the other place. I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-28a.1275.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100352" speakername="Lord Kingsland" colon=":" colnum="1275"  time="020:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60628-27.htm#60628-27_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1275.4/1">My Lords, Amendment No. 44 deals with Clause 94(4), which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1275.4/2" class="indent">&quot;An Order in Council under this section may make provision having retrospective effect&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1275.4/3">Orders in Council under Clause 94 are what I have called, in the course of our debates, stage 1 orders. They delegate legislative authority to the Welsh Assembly by enhancing its fields of legislative power under Part 1 of Schedule 5. This matter was debated at some length on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-06">6 June</phrase> at columns 1169 to 1172; I do not wish to repeat all the arguments that were deployed at the time, either on our side or the Government's side.</p>
	<p pid="a.1275.4/4">The worry that we have is clear. We are concerned that the retrospective power will be used to change decisions in litigation. If, for example, an Assembly measure is in issue in a trial, which has been authorised under one field or another of Part 1 of Schedule 5, and the judge concludes that the Assembly measure is <i>ultra vires</i> that field, we do not want an Order in Council made under Clause 94(4) to widen the scope, retrospectively, of the field in Part 1 of Schedule 5 so as to make what was decided by the judge as <i>ultra vires, intra vires, </i>thereby changing the decision of the court.</p>
	<p pid="a.1275.4/5">We quite accept that if, as a result of litigation, an Assembly measure is decided to be <i>ultra vires, </i>an order might then be made changing the law for the future. That would be entirely understood and completely acceptable; but we would find it wholly unacceptable if the results of litigation could be changed by this subsection. I think that that summarises three columns of exchanges in Committee. I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-28a.1299.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100460" speakername="Baroness Noakes" colon=":" colnum="1299"  time="022:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60628-34.htm#60628-34_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.1299.3/1">My Lords, it is a pleasure to be returning to the House this evening to debate matters financial at such a pleasant hour. Amendment No. 75, which the Whips will be pleased to hear is probing, would delete Clause 135, which deals with examinations by the Comptroller and Auditor General&mdash;that is the UK's Comptroller and Auditor General and not the Auditor General for Wales. The C&amp;AG can carry out examinations into the Welsh Consolidated Fund payments and can report to the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1299.3/2">In Committee, my noble friend Lord Crickhowell raised the question of the role of the UK Parliament in Welsh financial affairs generally. He did not get an answer from the Minister, and so I have tabled Amendment No. 75 to tease out how the financial relationship will work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1299.3/3">In Committee, the Government ran a nice line in pro-Welsh democracy rhetoric. For example, when I moved an amendment to probe whether UK Ministers could impose conditions on payments made to Welsh Ministers, the noble Lord, Lord Evans of Temple Guiting, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1299.3/4" class="indent">&quot;The ability to impose such conditions . . . would subordinate Welsh Ministers to their colleagues in Whitehall . . . The Assembly is a democratically elected body accountable to the people of Wales; it is not an agency of central government&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 6/06/06; col. 1227.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1299.3/5">Minutes later, the Minister said that there were mechanisms that ensured that money was actually spent on the purposes specified by UK Ministers. That would be via the Auditor General, who would audit against ministerial agreements. The Minister set that out in more detail in his helpful letter to me, which I received on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-19">19 June</phrase>. Further, when I probed on the ability of the Treasury to grab receipts by virtue of Clause 119, the answer again was that the UK Government had to have that power. Despite the rhetoric, the UK will retain some significant influence over receipts and payments under the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1299.3/6">That brings us to the audit arrangements. The Bill re-enacts the public audit arrangements for Wales in the shape of the Auditor General for Wales. He will pursue propriety and value for money issues in respect of the Welsh Consolidated Fund. Why, then, do we need Clause 135 and the powers of the Comptroller and Auditor General to do the same thing as the Auditor General for Wales? What happens if the Comptroller and Auditor General issues an adverse report? In Committee, my noble friend Lord Crickhowell raised the recent case of a critical&mdash;indeed, a very damning&mdash;report on the financial management of the Home Office. What would happen if a similar report was issued in relation to Welsh finances by the UK's Comptroller and Auditor General? Would that report go to the PAC? Whom would the PAC call? What happens in the UK Parliament about such reports?</p>
	<p pid="a.1299.3/7">Clause 135 calls into question the robustness of the accountability arrangements in Wales. It imposes a separate accountability from Wales to the UK Parliament. I hope that the Minister will explain why the clause is necessary. I beg to move.</p>
