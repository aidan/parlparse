	<p pid="a.1145.3/1">My Lords, it may be for the convenience of the House if I explain what will be happening this morning. This House has completed all its substantive business on Bills, but there are three Bills which have still to be considered in another place this morning. It is therefore necessary for us to adjourn and await Messages from the Commons on those three Bills. I am afraid that I do not know how long it will take for the Commons to complete its business and send us the Messages. I understand that it is likely to be something between one and three hours. It would be wrong to make invidious comparisons between the two Houses on the expedition of business.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145.3/2">I suggest that the House should adjourn during pleasure. We will then watch developments in the Commons carefully and when it becomes clear that the Messages are on their way I shall arrange for a message to be put on the annunciator which will give 10 minutes' notice that this House will reconvene.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145.3/3">We will then sit to receive the Messages, which I should tell your Lordships will be very brief indeed. It will then be necessary to adjourn again for about 30 minutes to allow the various formalities to be gone through. We will then sit for a third time for the Royal Assent and that will complete our business.</p>
	<p pid="a.1145.3/4">I hope that your Lordships will find the arrangements acceptable. I beg to move that the House do now adjourn during pleasure until a time to be announced on the annunciator.</p>
