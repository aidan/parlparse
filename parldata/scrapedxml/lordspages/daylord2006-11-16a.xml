<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-16a.20.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="20"  time="011:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61116-0001.htm#06111637000025">
	<p pid="a.20.2/1">My Lords, it gives me great pleasure to open the debate on the detail of the Queen's Speech. The last and only other time I did this was in my maiden speech in 2001, when I applauded the fact that there were not many Home Office Bills that year, if I recall. Local government, the environment, transport and agriculture are substantive issues relating to the content of the Queen's Speech and the Bills therein and I shall deal briefly with the Bills that the House will be discussing in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/2">Certainly the Bill relating to climate change will be crucial. We said on the day the Stern report was published that the potential for damage to the climate was the greatest long-term threat faced by humanity and all countries are affected. The Stern report made clear that the costs of inaction outweigh the costs of action. It is estimated that the cost of inaction could be five to 20 times more than the cost of doing something about it. We still have time to avoid catastrophic climate change but, in order to do so, we have got to ensure that global carbon emissions peak in the next 10 to 15 years. That means we need a cut of 25 per cent in global carbon dioxide emissions by 2050&mdash;that is 60 per cent for the rich or higher emission countries. We are confident that climate change can be tackled and that the technologies to reduce energy use, improve efficiency and create a low-carbon society are well within reach.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/3">But, of course, global as well as domestic action is required; that is why the Government are encouraging world action. As we have said before in this House, we make no apology for taking a lead on this issue even though our emissions are only about 2 per cent of global emissions. We need to work with others to increase the use of biofuels and to reduce deforestation. At home we are on track to double our Kyoto targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/4">The proposed Climate Change Bill will provide a clear, credible long-term framework for the UK to become a low-carbon economy and it will put into statute the Government's long-term goal to reduce by 2050 carbon dioxide emissions by 60 per cent on 1990 levels. As we said on the day the Stern report was published, the Bill will establish an independent body, a carbon committee, to help to reduce emissions and it will create enabling powers to introduce the new emissions reduction measures needed to achieve our goals. It will also be able to assess what additional reporting and monitoring arrangements are necessary to support our transparent emissions reduction framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/5">The Stern report made it clear that we need to develop emissions trading schemes around the world. We are committed to strengthening the European Union emissions trading scheme as the nucleus of a global carbon market. We need to extend it to new sectors such as aviation and link it to other emerging emissions trading schemes. We have proposed that the EU commits to new targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent by 2020 and at least 60 per cent by 2050.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/6">Farming is completely at one with the climate and climate change. Efforts to stop dangerous climate change are not just down to large-scale manufacturing or energy generation operations. I think that that is appreciated in this House. Farming is not in the dock on this, but it is responsible for about 7 per cent of the country's greenhouse gases, notably nitrous oxide and methane. Farming needs to play its role, like other industries, in reducing our environmental footprint.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/7">Farming has a major role in our lives. It dominates our land use&mdash;by and large we have no wilderness; all the countryside is purely manmade&mdash;and it has a massive impact on the environment. Farming contributes to the landscape and biodiversity. It helps us live within environmental limits, for example<I></I>through replacing fossil fuels with bioenergy or meeting consumer demand for high quality, seasonal produce delivered through strong local food chains. The more we can do that the less impact on the environment there will be in this country and across the world. We value the farming and food industry. Our goal is to develop a profitable, competitive, domestic farming industry which contributes to the environment and reduces the environmental footprint of food production.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/8">I am not saying that this applies to every aspect of farming, but I was delighted that when the National Farmers' Union published its latest <I>Farming Outlook</I> report on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-03">Friday 3 November</phrase>, it made the point that recovery in the fortunes of many of Britain's farmers is set to continue. Many positive trends were identified in the industry by a sector analysis of agriculture and horticulture. The NFU is predicting various aspects where consumption will remain strong and improved wheat and barley prices are set to continue. The chief economist went on to say that there has been a remarkable turnaround in the fortunes of farming, even in the past few months. People are waking up to the fact that demand for renewable energy measures and the comfortable assumption that there will always be unlimited supplies of cheap food on the world market are no longer valid. There are aspects of farming where there have been a lot of pressures, particularly in the dairy sector. Nevertheless, the NFU's assessment is that the situation is good.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/9">We want farmers to be sustainable and profitable. As one of our goals, we have to remove as many barriers as we can to farmers who want to diversify and, while maintaining farming, do other things with their land. We cannot say that we want them to be sustainable and profitable and stand on their own two feet while putting in their way barriers relating to planning and other matters that prevent them diversifying. The Government are looking at these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/10">The common agricultural policy has not been good for the environment in some parts of Europe. Currently, it is an inefficient way to address the needs of rural areas and is not the best way to help farmers compete successfully in a globalizing market. It is a poor way of using EU money in the best way for society, and it needs further reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/11">We are not proposing to abolish the common agricultural policy; we believe that the European Union needs a common policy structure for agriculture just as much as it needs a common market in goods, services and jobs. Nor are we advocating radical reform overnight. The vision is for 10 to 15 years, but radical change is needed. We need to ensure that the pace of change is manageable for the farming industry. There have been enormous changes in agriculture in the past decade or more that I do not think farmers have been given credit for by other sectors of society and businesses. That is mainly because you cannot see it&mdash;you do not see the smokestack industry change, simply because of the way that farming is set up around the country. We hope that the farming and food sectors will seize the benefits of reconnecting with the public and becoming much more market-oriented.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/12">I intend to be present for as much of this debate as possible, although I have a couple of duties to complete at Defra which means that I will come and go during the day. One of my pleasurable duties follows on from a visit I paid to the Royal Show in the summer when I came across and exhibition that had been put together by young farmers from Derbyshire. These are people coming into farming&mdash;and it is really great that people are coming in&mdash;who put together an exhibition of some good parts, bad parts and parts that needed change. It was such a fantastic exhibition that I said, &quot;We should have this on display in Defra's headquarters&quot;. I have 25 young farmers and their families coming today and the exhibition will be opened at lunchtime. It will be there for a month, and if noble Lords want to pop into Defra's HQ they will be more than welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/13">In respect of local government and communities, the Government's view is that partnership is central to what we do. My experience&mdash;although I accept that it is not as a councillor&mdash;is that every good, well-run local authority that I have ever come across as a Member of the other place and in carrying out my ministerial duties has used partnership with the public, private and voluntary sectors. If they do not have partnership in place, they will generally speaking not be well-run local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/14">The Local Government Bill that will be introduced in due course will provide the basis for a comprehensive and coherent new settlement between central and local government. It will allow stronger local leadership across the country with greater freedoms and capacity for local leaders to act and take the tough decisions to improve public services. It will also make it easier for voters to hold their councils to account through the ballot box by bringing greater clarity to the electoral process. Councillors will be given power to resolve issues of concern to the communities that they represent, if necessary by requiring overview and scrutiny committees to consider them. Communities will get more say in running local services through a new duty on local authorities to get more local people involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/15">In line with the Government's better regulation agenda, the Bill will cut bureaucracy in local government, promote greater transparency and allow more flexibility for local services to meet the needs of local communities. It will also create local area agreements between central government, local government and its partners on a statutory basis. These partners will generally be statutory bodies from the public sector but, as I said, no successful local authority will be able to work unless it has good contact with the private sector and the voluntary and community sector. Otherwise it will not be able to provide efficient services for local people and we will not get effective outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/16">In due course, we will also receive the Greater London Authority Bill, which will help to provide better planned and co-ordinated strategic public services in London and help further to improve the quality of life for its inhabitants. The Bill covers a wide range of policy areas, including housing, planning, waste, health, climate change and energy as well as culture. We believe that the Bill will contribute to better strategic services in London by ensuring decision-making at the most effective level. In most cases, that means devolving powers from central government to London itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/17">The Queen's Speech also forecasted a Road Transport Bill. The Government will announce powers for local authorities through that Bill to meet transport needs for their local area through the proposals in a draft Road Transport Bill. Congestion on our roads has a negative impact on the economy, the environment and the quality of life&mdash;not to say on the increased blood pressure of people who cannot be patient. Congestion has a detrimental effect and, if we do nothing at all about it, it is estimated to increase by 25 per cent by 2015, which would be quite unacceptable. Our strategy for tackling congestion includes sustained investment, adding road capacity where appropriate, better management of the existing network and, in line with the manifesto commitment, exploring the scope for developing a national scheme for road pricing. In central London we have seen that our package of measures combining road pricing with real improvements to buses and other public transport services can make a genuine difference. There is no single factor and no one policy that will work everywhere&mdash;this is not a case of &quot;one size fits all&quot;. For local authorities outside London, measures in the draft Road Transport Bill will provide a range of enhanced powers to tackle their local congestion problems and improve local public transport to fit their particular circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/18">In and around London public transport will be boosted by the Crossrail Bill that will grant powers for the Crossrail project. This new railway is expected to provide a peak service of 24 trains an hour in both directions through central London, carrying nearly 200 million passengers a year. It would increase the capacity of the rail network into and across London, and relieve congestion and overcrowding on the existing national rail and Underground networks. It has the potential, we believe, to add an estimated &pound;20 billion to the UK gross domestic product. We believe it could lead to the creation of up to 13,000 jobs by the year 2016&mdash;and 40,000 jobs by the year 2026&mdash;in the high-value financial and business centres of London, and attract an additional 80,000 jobs to regeneration areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/19">There is one final travel-related Bill that I must refer to. It relates to concessionary bus travel. The Government recognise the importance of public transport for older people and the role that access to transport has to play in improving social exclusion and maintaining well-being. Through the Concessionary Bus Travel Bill the Government will provide up to &pound;250 million to enable around 11 million older and disabled people to take advantage of the concessionary fares. The scheme will offer guaranteed free local bus travel in England for those eligible, from 9.30 am to 11 pm on weekdays, and all day on weekends and bank holidays. I have no doubt that in due course, when the Bill comes to this House, most of us&mdash;although, from yesterday's speeches, clearly not all&mdash;will be declaring our interest as being eligible for that concession. I have in my pocket my Freedom Pass, and when I use it, it is damned convenient to be able to do so. I am extremely grateful for that, and I declare my interest to that extent.</p>
	<p pid="a.20.2/20">That is a brief summary of the package of wonderful Bills we are about to receive in relation to the Queen's Speech. All those Bills will have a direct impact on people's lives in this country. It is important to make the connection between what we do as legislators and the ordinary lives of people outside, as we try to make them better. After all, that is what we are here for.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-16a.38.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100400" speakername="Baroness McIntosh of Hudnall" colon=":" colnum="38"  time="012:13:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61116-0003.htm#06111637000108">
	<p pid="a.38.0/1">My Lords, I begin by congratulating my noble friend Lady Jones of Whitchurch on her excellent maiden speech. I should like to say to her that if before she started to speak she had any fears that she would not be able to compete in this Chamber, I think she need not have any such fears now. We look forward to hearing much more from her in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/2">I was encouraged by the news in the gracious Speech that the Government intend to bring forward a Bill on climate change and it is clear that everyone else in the House is equally encouraged. Let us hope that we can look forward to some cross-party consensus on the issues that will arise. However, I am afraid that I shall return to a matter on which I have addressed your Lordships' House more than once; namely, the increasingly damaging impact of aviation on the environment. This theme touches not only on the big issue of climate change, now pushed so dramatically up the political agenda by among other things the publication of the Stern report, but also&mdash;as the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, has just pointed out&mdash;by the very significant change in public opinion which we are beginning to see reflected in opinion polls and in comment. There is a much stronger sense of the issues we are facing over climate change, a sense that is more widely shared than perhaps we in the Palace of Westminster have quite got a handle on yet. But beyond the big issue of climate change, the question of aviation also touches on more local environmental impacts which we can sometimes overlook as we contemplate the scale of the global threat we face.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/3">In preparing for this debate I looked at recent research from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change at the University of Manchester, as well as work from the Environmental Change Institute at Oxford University. What these much-respected groups have to say about the dangers we face from the current explosive growth in air travel makes for very sobering reading. They tell us that unless something radical is done to curb the current rates of growth in aviation, particularly in air travel, we have no chance of meeting the targets on carbon emissions put forward by my noble friend Lord Rooker in his opening remarks. This leads me and, I think, many others to the conclusion that current government policy on air transport, as outlined in the 2002 White Paper, is in urgent need of review because it is significantly behind the game so far as environmental impacts are concerned.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/4">On every previous occasion when Ministers have been pressed on the issue, the response has always been to point to growing demand and to suggest that restricting growth in the air industry would amount to an unfair denial of the supposed democratic freedom to fly. Even my noble friend Lord Davies of Oldham, when answering my recent Question on this issue and doing his noble best to look green but clearly feeling more like a chameleon on a tartan rug, felt obliged to say,</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/5" class="indent">&quot;One in every two of our fellow citizens took at least one flight last year&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/6">and to refer to this activity as part of ,</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/7" class="indent">&quot;our people's needs&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 2/11/06; col. 403.]</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/8">But in what sense can the wish to fly, say, to Italy for next to nothing or, come to that, the wish to eat strawberries in December honestly be described as a need? We have a tendency in a consumer-led economy to conflate needs with desires and call them freedoms. In few areas is this more apparent than in our ambivalent attitude to transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/9">But the time has surely come to recognise that the price we are asking our children and grandchildren to pay for our freedom to consume energy and pollute the atmosphere is simply too high and we have to do some big things now to make a difference. I welcome, of course, the Government's intention to introduce a Bill on climate change and I look forward to seeing exactly what it proposes, but I fear that it will be too little and its effects will come too late in respect of aviation.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/10">Let me give a couple of statistics taken from the Oxford Environmental Change Institute study published last month. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/11" class="indent">&quot;In just ten years, between 1990 and 2000, carbon dioxide emissions from UK aviation have doubled. During the same period, the combined emissions of carbon dioxide from all other UK activities fell by around 9%. A review of various forecasts of UK air travel growth indicates that aviation emissions are set to more than double again between 2000 and 2030 and could increase to between 4 and 10 times their present level by 2050&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/12">It also states,</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/13" class="indent">&quot;the UK generates more flights than any other European country; a fifth of all international air passengers worldwide are on flights that arrive or leave from UK airports. Hence, aviation makes a proportionally greater contribution to climate change for the UK than for most other countries&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/14">It goes on,</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/15" class="indent">&quot;there are now five overseas holiday flights for every business flight made overseas by a UK resident&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/16">And it says:</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/17" class="indent">&quot;Passenger traffic at UK airports has grown at an average annual rate of about 6% since the mid-1970s, with an increase of 12.5 million new passenger movements in the last year. Much of the recent expansion in flying has occurred because better off people are flying more often. There is little evidence that those on low incomes are flying more; flying cannot be regarded as a socially inclusive activity&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/18">Further evidence was published only last week by the Civil Aviation Authority showing that it is the well off who benefit from cheap travel. Eighty-three per cent of passengers using Stansted airport in 2005 were As, Bs or C1s. Only 7.7 per cent were Ds or Es.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/19">There is further evidence from the Office for National Statistics which has just published figures showing that the trade deficit on air travel in 2005 was &pound;18.8 billion compared to just &pound;2 billion 10 years earlier. Fifty-four million overseas flights were made in 2005 by UK residents, who spent &pound;28 billion while they were away. This compares with only 22 million foreign visitors coming to the UK, who spent only &pound;12.3 billion. We are often told that imposing significant as opposed to minimal constraints on the growth of air travel would have terrible consequences for our economy. I do not underestimate the importance of jobs in the aviation industry and of the economic activity it generates more widely but, set against the social and economic disbenefits of growth now becoming apparent, I wonder whether the evidence for that claim really stacks up.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/20">I sense that the Government's preferred option&mdash;and, indeed, that of the party opposite&mdash;is to think about these matters as essentially problems for the future to which we should take a responsible but gradual and incremental approach. In most circumstances, I am a natural gradualist, but on this matter I believe the future is now and there are choices we must make now. I know the Government are already considering some of them. It must be right to include aviation in any EU emissions trading scheme, although this measure will take a long time to achieve any significant impact and its effectiveness will depend crucially on the design of the scheme, as the European Committee of your Lordships' House pointed out recently in its report.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/21">It is right that the cost of air travel should rise. The Civil Aviation Authority figures seem to indicate that the people flying most frequently could certainly afford to pay a lot more. Bringing in an air passenger duty would be one effective way of countering the trend towards even cheaper fares and would not, as the Oxford institute points out, require international agreement, unlike the taxing of aviation fuel, although that must surely also be pursued.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/22">Another possibility would be the application of VAT to domestic air tickets. The Oxford study points out:</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/23" class="indent">&quot;An appropriate fiscal package for flying would also raise significant public revenue ... One estimate suggests that aviation's tax advantages amount to &pound;9 billion p.a. of lost revenue for the UK Treasury&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/24">There is one further thing that could be done now which would have a major effect and is at the top of the list for both the Tyndall Centre and the Oxford institute. I refer to an immediate moratorium on further expansion of runway capacity at UK airports. At this point, I must declare an interest, because I live less than 10 miles from Stansted and am directly under its main flight path. It might be thought, therefore, that everything I have to say is driven by self-interest. Oddly enough, my life would probably be made slightly easier if the extra runway proposed for Stansted were built, because the flight paths would change. But for every other reason, the plan should be sent back to the drawing board, along with similar plans for Luton, Birmingham and Edinburgh, and all the proposals arising from the 2002 White Paper to increase passenger numbers at virtually every UK airport.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/25">The best, quickest and cheapest way to limit demand for air travel is to limit the capacity for aircraft to take off and land. I suspect that when my noble friend comes to reply, she will say that to do so would shift business to other European airports and damage our economy thereby. But what is the evidence for this belief? She may say that technologies are leading us to quieter, less polluting aircraft, making restrictions on growth unnecessary. If this has crossed her mind, I refer her to Dr Alice Bowes of the Tyndall Centre who, in a recent e-mail to me, put paid to that hope as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/26" class="indent">&quot;The fundamental point is that all of the other sectors within the UK's economy have many opportunities to improve energy efficiency and use alternative fuels, even today. However, the aviation sector does not have that luxury and, furthermore, the long lifetimes of aircraft lock the aviation industry into current airframe designs and high-carbon fuels for around 30 years. Hence the need to tackle growth&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/27">I fear that my noble friend may also say that it is undemocratic to prevent people flying if they want to. But is it not far more undemocratic to concrete over vast swathes of this country for extra runways, for car parks and support services, creating not only enormous growth in carbon emissions but misery for hundreds of thousands of people through increased noise, traffic and other pollution, so that more of our better-off citizens can fly more often on holiday abroad, taking their spending power with them?</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/28">The Stop Stansted Expansion campaign, to which I am grateful for its excellent briefing, has estimated that if BAA's current planning application for full use of the existing runway at Stansted were to be approved, an extra 80,000 flights a year would be generated, giving rise to 12 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, an increase of 5 million tonnes on present rates. If a second runway were to be built, emissions would rise to the equivalent of 23 million tonnes per year; in addition, there would be huge extra pressure on an already fragile infrastructure, such as road and rail links, for which no proper provision has been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/29">These effects are replicated in all the proposals for UK airport expansion. To allow airport capacity to grow, knowing what we know now about the environmental effects of aviation, would be fundamentally irresponsible, benefiting nobody in the long term. I can put it no better than the <I>Independent </I>leader writer who wrote on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-02">2 November</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/30" class="indent">&quot;From now on, everything the Government does will be seen through the green prism of the Stern report. The last thing Britain needs&mdash;whether in 2030 or before&mdash;is anything that could be seen as facilitating more air travel&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.38.0/31">Amen to that, my Lords.</p>
