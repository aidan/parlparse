	<p pid="a.249.1/1">My Lords, I am grateful to my noble friend for giving me an opportunity to give exactly that assurance to the House. We have excellent relations with the Pentagon at all levels. At the highest level, the Secretary of State has regular discussions with his opposite number; he met him most recently on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-28">28 September</phrase> at the NATO Defence Ministers summit, at which they discussed a number of issues. I think that it is clear that the United Kingdom has influenced and continues to influence US policy on Iraq. For example, we have had an effect on the conditions for transition in Iraq, which were drawn up by the joint committee, on the strategy for the multinational division in the south-east of the country, and on the negotiations on the renewal of UN Security Council resolutions. We focus on outcomes, and we can see the way in which the first of the provinces have achieved transition in Iraq as evidence&mdash;given that those were areas under the leadership of the United Kingdom&mdash;of our clear influence on the US Administration.</p>

	<p pid="a.252.0/1">My Lords, I beg to move that the House do not insist on its Amendment No. 1 to which the Commons have disagreed. I hope we can dispose of this amendment relatively swiftly. When we last debated the issue of police force mergers on Report, I indicated that, while the Government were no longer pursuing the amalgamation of forces, it was necessary to retain the powers in the Police Act 1996 for the Home Secretary to initiate mergers, so that they were available as a backstop. When the matter was debated in the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-24">24 October</phrase> the shadow Minister for Police Reform, Nick Herbert, sought five assurances on this issue. My honourable friend the Minister for Policing, Security and Community Safety, Mr Tony McNulty, was happy to give a broad yes on all five points.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.0/2">For the record and for the benefit of this House, I am ready to repeat those assurances. First, I say again, enforced amalgamations will be a last resort, for now we are looking at other means to narrow the protective services gap. Secondly, of course a proper case for any future amalgamations must be made. Indeed, the 1996 Act requires the Home Secretary to set out his case for any merger. Thirdly, we accept that any proposals for mergers must be subject to full public consultation and that this should not be confined to the statutory four-month consultation period required by the Police Act. Fourthly, on the question of parliamentary scrutiny, merger orders initiated by the Home Secretary are subject to the affirmative procedure under the Act, so a measure of scrutiny is already built in. However, we are ready to consider additional opportunities to debate any merger proposals. Finally, if we in the Home Office have learnt anything from the previous experience, it is that the financial implications, including the issue of precept equalisation, must be fully resolved before any merger proposals are finalised. I hope that in the light of these assurances the House will now feel able to agree not to insist on this amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.252.1/1">My Lords, the Minister has explained why she feels it appropriate for this House not to insist upon its original amendment. My amendment would have ensured that the Secretary of State could not lay a statutory instrument containing an order regarding the alteration or merging of police areas unless that course was requested by the police authorities that would be affected by any changes. The other proviso was that the Secretary of State believed it was right and in the interests of the efficiency and effectiveness of policing. We objected to the Government's plans to press ahead with forced mergers. When we argued the merits of our case in Committee, the House agreed with us by a margin of 198 votes to 130, so I should put on the record, however briefly, the reasons why we appear to be backing off from that strong position.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/2">During the summer the Government signalled that enforced mergers were going deeper and deeper into the long grass. We remained concerned that they might bring back their plans when the fuss had died down and public attention had perhaps been drawn to other, more objectionable policies. On Report I tabled an amendment on the importance of a cost benefit analysis to ask the Minister to put on the record an assurance about the Government's plans with regard to forced police mergers.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/3">The Minister set out her assurances in detail on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-09">9 October</phrase> at cols. 61-62. We then had the opportunity to consider her words very carefully. We believe that the words she uttered before the House then, together with the assurances put clearly on the record by her honourable friend Mr McNulty in another place, provide sufficient reassurances for this House to rely upon. That is why we have not tabled an amendment today to object to the Government's Motion, which overturns the decision of the House made in June. We remain convinced that mergers should proceed at some future date if, and only if, they are with the consent of all the police authorities concerned in that merger or alteration, and if the Government have demonstrated persuasively that the key principles set out by the Minister are met. In the interests of time I will not repeat those principles today.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/4">With regard to the financial implications referred to by the Minister, it is right that I put on record my own concern about the announcement made by the Home Office on Monday&mdash;that it would pay police forces just &pound;4 million to reimburse them for the money they were forced to spend on the abandoned police mergers programme, when the real costs incurred were &pound;6.5 million. My own police force in Surrey is one of those that is, as a consequence, unfairly treated, because of the capping of payments to a maximum of &pound;100,000 per force. Surrey had to incur expenditure of &pound;649,311. As Bob Jones, chairman of the Association of Police Authorities, pointed out, the failure to reimburse all the money was not just regrettable; the money police authorities spent was money that would otherwise have been spent on improving local policing for local communities.</p>
	<p pid="a.252.1/5">We rely on the assurances given by the Minister and by Mr McNulty. We therefore believe that if the Government were to bring forward proposals for forced mergers at some future date, this House would be justified in relying upon those assurances and in taking a view on whether it should take the somewhat unusual step of objecting to a statutory instrument being made. In the mean time, for the reasons I have set out today, I do not object to the Government's Motion.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-01a.253.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100278" speakername="Baroness Harris of Richmond" colon=":" colnum="253"  time="015:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61101-0002.htm#06110149000101">
	<p pid="a.253.0/1">My Lords, I support the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay of St Johns. Although it preoccupied us all far too much earlier this year, I hope that the possibility of police mergers is now dormant. But that does not mean that they will not be reactivated in the future. I hope that the Government have leant lessons about the way that the matter was approached and that we will not see the mistakes repeated.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/2">As we have just heard, the recent Statement by the Minister for Policing made clear that this measure had been an extremely costly way of achieving very little. As the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, made clear, Surrey incurred great expense&mdash;the relevant sum was more than &pound;250,000&mdash;as did my local force, North Yorkshire. We should remember that the figure of nearly &pound;4 million set out in the Statement reflects only the limited range of eligible costs directly attributable to restructuring and is only a fraction of the total sums involved in the very extensive and detailed work that was undertaken by forces and authorities. This represents a lot of time, effort and money, which has been diverted at the expense of real policing. Since that time some excellent collaborative policing has taken place. A very good example of that was demonstrated earlier this month. I refer the Minister to a Thames Valley press release issued on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October</phrase>, which states:</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Officers from across the south of England have arrested 14 people aged between their mid-20s and mid-50s in a series of raids this morning in connection with a series of crimes valued at over &pound;30 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/4" class="indent">The arrests, which took place in Oxfordshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, are a significant development for Operation Haul, which was set up in October 2005 jointly by Thames Valley Police, West Mercia Constabulary, Warwickshire Police, Wiltshire Police and Gloucestershire Police to target an organised crime network believed responsible for 23 serious offences throughout the five force areas. Thames Valley Police Assistant Chief Constable Francis Habgood, Operation Haul commander on behalf of the five forces, said, 'The crimes being investigated by Operation Haul include some of the highest profile&mdash;and highest value&mdash;burglaries this country has ever seen'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/5">That is an excellent operation and shows exactly what police forces can do, and what we said they could do when the Government put forward their ill judged proposals on mergers.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/6">The five assurances to which the noble Baroness referred, and to which the Minister again referred, which were asked for in the other place and given by the Minister for Policing, are important. I wholeheartedly support them. For me the one that resonates is the need to ensure that adequate consultation takes place. This consultation needs to listen to what is being said by both the public and the experts. Merely paying lip service to consultation, having predetermined the outcome, is completely counterproductive, as I hope the Government have learnt. Local identity matters to local people. They feel a bond with, and take a pride in, their local police force which is based on this identity. That is not to say that local identity is all that should be considered, but minimising its value and ignoring alternatives which might accommodate it is asking for trouble. The other assurances are equally important. Clearly, any future proposals must take account of what is allowable under financial rules in relation to precepting. They must involve making a meticulously and preferably independently evaluated and costed case. It must be a last resort that no other approach will solve, otherwise the public will never be convinced that some other way of doing things is not more important than their local allegiance.</p>
	<p pid="a.253.0/7">Finally, it must be subject to detailed parliamentary scrutiny. It is, after all, a key constitutional issue if policing by consent is to mean anything. Like the noble Baroness I shall be keeping a very close eye on any future statutory instruments dealing with police mergers. It is vital to ensure that there is adequate opportunity for a robust debate to explore whether mergers might, at some point in future, be sensible, and to address the other key criteria set out by the noble Baroness. Half-baked proposals that do not meet those criteria will not pass the test. With the promise of a gimlet-eyed watching brief, I am reasonably content to leave matters regarding mergers in the Government's hands for the present.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-01a.258.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100016" speakername="Baroness Anelay of St Johns" colon=":" colnum="258"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61101-0003.htm#06110149000124">
	<p pid="a.258.0/1">My Lords, we remain concerned that the Government are taking our judicial system down a route that could lead to the widespread use of administrative punishment instead of the impartial hearing that is given in a magistrates' court. Fair trial safeguards and the involvement of the independent court in the delivery of punishment are in the wider public interest and in the interest of the victims of crime. As the noble Baroness knows, I would have preferred to have seen the full report on the operation of conditional cautions, as introduced in the Criminal Justice Act 2003, before we pressed ahead with extending them to punishment.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/2">This morning I have been in contact with the Magistrates' Association and I have made sure that the noble and learned Lord's office knew that. I know that the Magistrates' Association shares our concern that these proposals breach the basic principle that sentencing is a matter for the independent judiciary and will still breach that principle despite the concessions offered today.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/3">Why am I not opposing the government amendment and why have I not tabled a Motion? We have very carefully considered the arguments set out on Report by the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General (at col. 130 of the <I>Official Report</I> of <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-10">10 October</phrase>) that the law currently prevents an offender who has admitted criminal damage from being able to carry out restorative work when the damage has already been dealt with and that the law prevents him from being ordered to carry out other work in lieu&mdash;the indirect reparation to which the noble and learned Lord referred in moving the government Motion.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/4">We have certainly considered that and we see the practical arguments behind the Government's reasons for wishing to press ahead on such a basis. Today the Attorney-General has come forward with amendments that do much to allay the concerns that I brought forward in Committee. I am grateful to him. They should restrict the degree of discretion which may be exercised by prosecutors in relation to imposing punitive cautions that effectively impose a fine and, despite that, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, said, we seem to be shifting, I hope&mdash;by the nature of what may be happening&mdash;from regulations towards more of a fixed penalty.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/5">I am certainly grateful to the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General for arranging meetings on these matters yesterday. Although, of course, we had seen the published government amendments that came out on Monday, when I met the noble and learned Lord I was not aware of the letter that was winging its way to me from the noble Baroness which gave further explanation. It was not on my desk when I went to see the Attorney-General, but a quarter of an hour later, when I got back, it was on my desk. I only hope that the noble and learned Lord did not think I was looking somewhat vacant and surprised when he made some of his proposals&mdash;they certainly came fresh to my mind. It means that today we do not have to object to the Government's Motion.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/6">It was constructive to hear that the Government will prescribe, in secondary legislation, the offences to which a financial penalty will apply. That is in the printed amendments. However, as we were told in the letter, the practical application is that only a limited range of offences will be prescribed. That is important. They will be listed in banded groups, giving a limited discretion to take the offender's financial circumstances into account. I agree entirely with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, about the financial advantages of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/7">We shall, however, wish to monitor closely the use of the punitive conditional caution. It should not be an &quot;Open Sesame&quot; for widening administrative punishment without conclusive evidence being produced to both Houses that it is both necessary and appropriate. But, as a result of today's amendments and the further clarification in the Government's letter, we do not object to the Motion.</p>

	<p pid="a.287.1/1">My Lords, I shall speak also to my amendment in Motion F1.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/2">In the many incursions that this Government have made into individual liberties during their time in office, the matters concerned with the bilateral treaty on extradition with the United States is a special case, because that agreement was negotiated in secret. The press knew nothing about it; neither did Parliament. It appears from the proceedings in another place that not even Mr John Denham, the Minister of State at the Home Office at the time, knew anything about it. As a result, we were presented with a fait accompli on <phrase class="date" code="2003-03-31">31 March 2003</phrase>. The treaty, containing many clauses that applied directly to the rights of individuals in this country, was wholly unsupervised by our parliamentary system.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/3">One might well ask what animated the Government in engaging in such a negotiation. Were they simply supine in the face of a country they wanted to please beyond anything else? Did they deliberately decide to reduce the rights of British citizens in relation to extradition? Or were the negotiators simply incompetent; were they wholly unaware when accepting the American Fourth Amendment&mdash;the probable cause matter to which the Minister referred&mdash;that we also have constitutional protections in the European Convention on Extradition, particularly Article 7.1?</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/4">Whatever the explanation, and I suspect history will finally produce an analysis that gives us a more accurate audit trail than I have today, I am absolutely convinced that, in future, Parliament must have a role in the scrutiny of treaties before they are signed. That is the big constitutional lesson that comes out of this sorry story. I would like to see all treaties produced in front of a committee while they are in draft, and the House should debate them before they are signed. I very much hope that this is a matter the House will take seriously in the coming months.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/5">In opening, the Minister quoted certain things from the speech I made in Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July</phrase>, at cols. 625-29 of the <I>Official Report</I>. Her quotations demonstrate all the dangers of quoting out of context. I made it absolutely clear at the beginning of my speech that I had two objections to the treaty. One was the issue of ratification, to which she referred. The other was the issue of reciprocity, or fairness, to which she did not refer. I do not need to elaborate on this point because the noble Lord, Lord Goodhart, has made it for me. He has said in terms that what principally concerns him is the issue of reciprocity; and I do not need to add anything to that observation. I share exactly the same opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/6">The fundamentals that lie behind this issue have already been well debated, and I do not intend to repeat in terms what I said in Committee. I shall just refer to a number of points the Minister made in opening. The first one concerns the question of prosecutors and judges. She quoted a famous passage from Lord Dilhorne about judges interfering in matters that are none of their concern. Extradition matters, however, are very much judges' concern, as we learn from Article 7.1 of the European Convention on Terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/7">I ask the House to forgive me for quoting this to your Lordships, but it is germane. Our forum amendment says:</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/8" class="indent">&quot;If the conduct disclosed by the request was committed partly in the United Kingdom, the judge shall not order the extradition of the person unless it appears in the light of all the circumstances that it would be in the interests of justice that the person should be tried in the category 1 territory ... In deciding whether extradition is in the interests of justice, the judge shall take into account whether the competent United Kingdom authorities have decided to refrain from prosecuting the person whose surrender is sought for the conduct constituting the offence for which extradition is requested&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/9">We have entered into a binding obligation with our European partners which in terms gives the judge, not the prosecutor, the power to decide whether or not somebody should be extradited. I can think of nothing less desirable than giving this power to the prosecutor. You can just imagine what might happen; the prosecutors in the United Kingdom and the United States get together over an issue and they do a deal over whether or not somebody should be extradited. There is no judicial intervention or objective analysis of the interests of the person whose freedom is in issue. The whole proposition that these matters of extradition ought to be in the hands of the prosecutor rather than the judge is quite alien to our traditions; yet it is precisely what the treaty requires us to do. I ask your Lordships to reject the argument upon which the noble Baroness founded her contention&mdash;that these matters are much better dealt with by prosecutors.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/10">There is also a deeper unfairness here. What made the United Kingdom give way on the Article 7.1 point? No other country has done so. Both France and Denmark have bilateral treaties with the United States; but France refuses to extradite any French citizen under any circumstances and, in the case of Denmark, the forum provision applies. If the offence in issue is partly committed in Ireland, it will be tried in Ireland unless the interests of justice dictate otherwise. Why on earth did we not have a similar provision in relation to the United States? That is why I cannot understand what the negotiators thought that they were trying to achieve. The noble Baroness has said how important it was to the United States that the fourth amendment on probable cause should be protected. The United States was not prepared to give way on that. Why were we prepared to give way on Article 7.1? Perhaps the noble Baroness has some explanation for that; but it seems to me inexplicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/11">Then there is the question of the relationship between the Human Rights Act and the extradition treaty&mdash;a relationship dealt with in Section 87(1) of the Extradition Act. Here I think that the Government deserve a little more understanding because in the course of the debate on the then Extradition Bill the Government made it quite clear that the Human Rights Act applied. But in a recent Court of Appeal decision in relation to the NatWest Three, the court decided that where there is a conflict between the Human Rights Act and the American extradition treaty, the extradition treaty trumps the Human Rights Act. So all the protections of the Human Rights Act, which we assumed would be there when the Extradition Bill was debated, seem to have evaporated. That is also a matter of considerable concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/12">The noble Baroness explained at great length to your Lordships why she believes that these amendments are misplaced. I believe that they are essential to restore what I consider to be a balanced arrangement with the United States. This treaty is deeply unfair. I simply do not understand why citizens in the United States should have one level of protection and we should have another. I beg to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.287.1/13">Moved, as an amendment to Motion D, leave out from &quot;House&quot; to end and insert &quot;do insist on its Amendment No. 36, but do not insist on its Amendment No. 85&quot;.&mdash;(<I>Lord Kingsland.</I>)</p>

	<p pid="a.289.0/1">My Lords, since your Lordships' House last debated this issue the Senate has, as the Minister pointed out, consented to the ratification by the President of the 2003 treaty. That treaty confers some benefits on the United Kingdom such as the right of extradition to the United Kingdom even if the prosecution would be time barred in the USA. That is something I have always recognised. The ratification does not remove the main objections to the treaty, which are, first, the unequal nature of the treaty and, secondly, the fact that the treaty assists the aggressive use by the United States of extra-territorial jurisdiction.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/2">Amendment No. 36 cancels the designation of the USA under the order made in December 2003 as a country to which people can be extradited without establishing probable cause, or indeed a prima facie case, under the Act. The Liberal Democrats&mdash;and we alone&mdash;voted against the order in both Houses in December 2003 on the ground of its inequality. Amendment No. 36 was rejected by the House of Commons in the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-24">24 October</phrase>. In that debate, the Government relied yet again on the old chestnut that there is in fact no real inequality. That is not so. The Minister has put less emphasis on that on this occasion than she did on the earlier occasion, but she did repeat it.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/3">It is true that, under Section 71 of the Extradition Act, the USA must provide information that enables it to get a warrant for the arrest of the defendant with a view to his or her extradition from the United Kingdom. For obvious reasons, where an arrest warrant is being sought, no notice is given to the defendant of the application for the warrant. Information on which it is based is not shown to the defendant. There is no hearing. The first the defendant knows of the application is when he or she is arrested. Then an extradition hearing follows, but where the country requesting the extradition has, like the United States, been designated under Section 84(7), there can be no review at the hearing of the adequacy of the evidence or information against the defendant.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/4">For extradition from the USA to the United Kingdom, the position is quite different. The United Kingdom has to show probable cause at the extradition hearing. The existence of probable cause can be challenged by the defendant at the hearing. The information relied on by the United Kingdom is disclosed to the defendant and can be challenged. The defendant is able to argue that the information is in fact insufficient to amount to probable cause. That is entirely different from an application for an arrest warrant on its own, carried out in the total absence and ignorance of the defendant. That is spelled out in the treaty in Article 8.3, which says that,</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/5" class="indent">&quot;a request for the extradition of a person who is sought for prosecution shall be supported by ... for requests to the United States, such information as would provide a reasonable basis to believe that the person sought committed the offence for which the extradition is sought&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.289.0/6">There is no requirement for any corresponding information for extradition from the United Kingdom to the United States. That on its own makes it clear beyond doubt that there was a deliberate decision of those who drafted the treaty that there was to be a significant difference in procedure between extradition from the United States and extradition from the United Kingdom.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-01a.320.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="320"  time="019:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61101-0011.htm#06110160000075">
	<p pid="a.320.3/1">My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2005-12-15">15 December 2005</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced that the current &quot;netting off&quot; funding arrangement for safety cameras operating within the national safety camera programme is to cease at the end of March 2007. From April 2007, all fines from speeding offences will go to the Treasury in the same way as any other fine, so there will no longer be a surplus of fine revenue. This means that the provisions in this clause will no longer be appropriate and, as such, the clause will not be needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.3/3">Under new funding arrangements, local authorities will receive additional money for road safety through the local transport plan process&mdash;some &pound;440 million over four years. The money will be available for funding safety cameras, but equally it will be available for funding any other form of road safety initiative. So, the Government will deliver the level playing field on funding that may be one of the purposes of Clause 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.3/4">This new arrangement will mean that safety cameras and other road safety measures will be funded in exactly the same way. Also, it will integrate safety cameras into the wider road safety delivery process and give local authorities and road safety partners greater flexibility to implement whichever locally agreed mix of road safety measures will make the greatest contribution to reducing road casualties in their area.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.3/5">Furthermore, the revised funding arrangements that the Government are introducing from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase> have two clear and important advantages as compared with the provisions of Clause 2. First, Clause 2 could give an incentive to local authorities to seek to increase the amount of fine revenue generated by safety cameras, because that would increase the surplus funding which Clause 2 would make available for other local transport purposes&mdash;whereas, under the funding arrangements being introduced by the Government, there would be no possibility of such a perverse incentive.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.3/6">Secondly, the arrangements being introduced by the Government will give to local authorities and their local partners much greater stability and certainty about the amount of funding available. If local authorities had to rely on surplus fine income from safety cameras, that could be unstable and uncertain, because the objective of the camera programme, which we all share, is to improve compliance with speed limits, which will reduce the level of fines over time and hence also reduce the level of any surplus&mdash;and very possibly lead to a deficit, where the costs of operating cameras are greater than the income from fines generated from camera detections.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.3/7">I must ask the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, whether it is really his intention that local authorities which succeed in improving compliance with speed limits, thereby reducing the income from speed cameras, should be penalised by receiving less money for other transport purposes. Is it his intention that local authorities which succeed in driving up the level of fine income from cameras by whatever means should be rewarded by receiving more funding for other transport purposes? Those would be the effects of Clause 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.3/8">In the Government's view, the clause would create perverse and dangerous incentives. As it is, some motorists suspect that the safety camera scheme is a revenue-generating device. That is a widespread misapprehension among motorists and others. There is currently no justice in that suspicion, but if Clause 2 were enacted, there would be real grounds for it. That would be damaging, because it is important that the Government's road safety policies should command the respect of the great majority of road users, including motorists.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.3/9">Finally, I must advise the noble Lord that Clause 2 is technically defective in at least three respects. First, it refers to,</p>
	<p pid="a.320.3/10" class="indent">&quot;income from the enforcement of offences under subsection (2)&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.320.3/11">which is an inaccurate phrase of uncertain ambit and could well extend to income from offences detected by police officers as well as offences detected by cameras. Secondly, it refers to a &quot;relevant national authority&quot;, which is a strange and undefined notion; by contrast, Section 38 of the Vehicles (Crime) Act 2001 confers powers on the Secretary of State. Thirdly, there are other undefined terms such as &quot;safety camera scheme&quot;, &quot;relevant local transport authority&quot; and &quot;local transport facilities&quot;. The noble Lord may think I am nitpicking&mdash;he does&mdash;but this legislation is at a very late stage and our obligation is to ensure that it is as accurate as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.3/12">The crucial point is that Clause 2 is now no longer necessary. Given the changes which the Government are making as from next April, Clause 2 would also create dangerous and perverse incentives. The clause is seriously defective. I hope the noble Lord, having pursued these issues with his customary assiduity, will on this occasion feel that he can safely withdraw his amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.320.3/13">Moved, That the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 1.&mdash;(<I>Lord Davies of Oldham.</I>)</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-01a.330.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100269" speakername="Baroness Hanham" colon=":" colnum="330"  time="019:34:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61101-0012.htm#06110171000033">
	<p pid="a.330.1/1">My Lords, I listened with great interest to the Minister's reply. It is interesting how many different things can be said about, for example, the Loughborough report. The Department of Transport's 2005 road casualty statistics, published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-28">28 September</phrase>, show that despite a 1 per cent drop in the number of fatalities from road accidents, deaths from accidents involving heavy goods vehicles increased by 8 per cent to 485 in 2005, even though there are proportionally fewer goods vehicles on the roads.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/2">These figures represent 15 per cent of all road deaths, and clearly demonstrate that new measures are required as soon as possible to reduce this disproportionate number. Research by the Darmstadt University of Technology&mdash;the Minister did not produce that report&mdash;has found that adding retro-reflective contour markings reduced accidents involving trucks and passenger cars under poor visibility conditions by 95 per cent. The Loughborough University report, published in May 2005, to which the Minister referred, also concluded that,</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/3" class="indent">&quot;there is a cost benefit for fitting retro-reflective line markings to newly registered vehicles greater than 7.5 tonnes&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/4">A subsequent consultation by the Department for Transport also indicated that there was overwhelming public support for introducing this measure. However, the Department for Transport's own research shows that this would be an effective means of saving lives and would prevent 385 collisions involving heavy goods vehicles each year. As we have heard from the Minister tonight, the Government continue to oppose its immediate introduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/5">The Minister has cited the European position, but I direct him to an earlier discussion in the House of Commons when the Transport Minister was Stephen Ladyman. He stated that if the Government were to introduce this measure it would certainly be breaking EU law and action would be taken against us, which I think is what the Minister was referring to as &quot;infraction proceedings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/6">The European Commission disputes this, and has now confirmed that this measure is likely&mdash;as the Minister said&mdash;to become mandatory across the European Union from 2010. But it has stated that member states are free,</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/7" class="indent">&quot;to lay down national requirements concerning the use of retro-reflective markings&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/8">in the mean time, so we would do nothing to offend EU law if we introduced them as from now. That is the point of the amendment today.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/9">During the same debate, Dr Ladyman claimed that the European Commission had &quot;started the preliminary stages&quot; of infraction proceedings against Italy as a result of its decision to introduce this measure in 2003. The Minister even stated that there were objections to Italy's decision,</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/10" class="indent">&quot;not only from Great Britain, but from France and Germany&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 9/10/06; col. 93.]</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/11">The Commission also disputes that, stating that there are no grounds to take action against Italy and that it has,</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/12" class="indent">&quot;not received to date any complaints concerning the Italian legislation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/13">The Government also stated that the UN Economic Commission for Europe regulations do not allow contracting parties to make the ECE104 mandatory before 2010. However, Italy, like the UK, is a contracting party to the regulations but has suffered no action as a consequence of introducing the measure. Indeed, the United Nations ECE secretariat has also confirmed that it,</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/14" class="indent">&quot;has not been informed about complaints on the Italian national legislation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/15">If you introduce it, it does not seem to infringe or impinge against any European directive.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/16">The final argument that the Government raised against introducing this measure is that it would damage the competitiveness of the UK haulage industry. Not only would this amendment reduce the number of accidents involving heavy goods vehicles, enabling more heavy goods vehicles to remain on the road and reducing the cost of repairs, it would require only newly registered HGVs to fit retro-reflective markings at present. The Loughborough report again estimated this would cost about &pound;100 or 0.001 per cent of the total cost of a new vehicle. Surely that is a very small price to pay for saving lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/17">The amendment has received cross-party support in both Houses. It is now clear that there is nothing to stop the Government taking action. In the light of this, I hope that the Government will support the immediate introduction of this life-saving measure and allow this amendment to stand.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/18">There is some disagreement about the interpretation of what the EU said and what it believes would happen, but it seems to us that there is nothing, except the Government's intransigence, to stop the fitting of these reflectors on new vehicles as from today or as quickly as the regulations can be produced. We all know that some regulations can arrive quicker than others. The time for action is now. If the Government wait until this measure is introduced across the EU, more than 1,100 collisions involving heavy goods vehicles could occur, and they could involve serious injuries and fatalities which this amendment would prevent.</p>
	<p pid="a.330.1/19">Moved, as an amendment to the Motion that this House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 5, leave out from &quot;House&quot; to end and insert &quot;do disagree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 5, but do propose Amendments Nos. 5B and 5C in lieu.&quot;&mdash;(<I>Baroness Hanham</I>.)</p>

	<p pid="a.367.1/1">My Lords, I appreciate that the time to consider these amendments has been constrained. We are in the usual period at the very end of the Session when there is great pressure on time, and I can only express my regret to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, that we did not have longer to consider the amendments. I, too, was up until midnight on Monday, and then had to get on top of a completely separate Bill. I entirely sympathise with the points that she made. If it is any consolation, there has at least been an equality of misery across the Chamber in this respect.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.1/2">Part of the reason why we have so many amendments is to consider the points that were raised in this House, which we have sought conscientiously to respond to. They were on difficult issues such as the definition of pornography, the amount of work the barred individual should be able to engage in and the vexed issue of the definition of &quot;frequently&quot;, which occupied us for a good deal of time. We have sought to respond to a whole set of issues in amendments, many of which are detailed and technical.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.1/3">I believe that the Bill that has come back to us is much better as a result. I note that Mrs Maria Miller, speaking for the Opposition at the last stage of the passage of the Bill through another place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-23">23 October</phrase>, commended the Government,</p>
	<p pid="a.367.1/4" class="indent">&quot;for the way in which they have listened to the arguments, and for their willingness to amend the Bill and thus&mdash;we hope&mdash;improve it&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 23/10/06; col. 1348.]</p>
	<p pid="a.367.1/5">We, too, hope that it is improved by this process.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.1/6">I am glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, welcomed Amendment No. 99 and the support that it gives to volunteers. I am sorry that I am not in a position to say more to the noble Baroness, Lady Buscombe, on costs but I can state again that we expect annual operating costs to be in the range of &pound;16 million to &pound;18 million a year over the first five years of the scheme, starting in 2008-09. We are continuing to refine our estimates as we develop the operating model for the scheme. The budget for setting up the scheme is &pound;16.6 million over the three financial years 2005-06, 2006-07 and 2007-08. This figure for annual operating costs is additional to the costs of the existing CRB disclosure and related processes, which amount to about &pound;78 million per annum.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.1/7">Putting those two figures in perspective, we accept that additional costs will arise from the scheme, but the great bulk are those already incurred in managing the existing CRB disclosure and related processes, which cost nearly &pound;80 million a year, as I said. Because we have not entirely refined the cost model, we are not in a position to give the revised figure for the CRB checks. We expect it to be higher than the current &pound;31 for a standard disclosure and &pound;36 for an enhanced disclosure, on the basis of the figures that we have given to Parliament. We believe that the costs will continue to be reasonable and that the great bulk of the costs involved in the scheme are those already incurred in managing the existing CRB scheme.</p>
