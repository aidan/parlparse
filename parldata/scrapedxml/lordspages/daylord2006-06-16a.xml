<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-16a.444.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100348" speakername="Lord King of Bridgwater" colon=":" colnum="444"  time="012:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60616-05.htm#60616-05_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.444.0/1">My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Macdonald, will excuse me if I do not follow him on the issues which I know are very important to him and which I had the pleasure of hearing him address when we discussed them in Grand Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/2">I start by paying warm tribute to my noble friend Lord Fowler. I know that all my colleagues who had the privilege of serving with him thought that it was an outstanding Select Committee and that it did this House great credit. I hope that noble Lords respect that. We attach great importance to the view that there is a genuine role for this committee in the rapidly evolving world of communications. I say that speaking as a former Member of another place, because Members of this House have an independence which, bluntly, Members of the other place do not always have in dealing with the media due to the pressure that can be brought on them and the electoral consequences that they may face.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/3">I preface my comments with the clear statement&mdash;my noble friend Lord Fowler also made this clear&mdash;that if we criticise the BBC or the structure, we do so with the honest and genuine desire to support what we consider to be an outstanding and admirable national institution. The comments and criticisms that we make were devoted entirely towards ensuring that it remains so, and that is at the heart of our concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/4">It would be wrong not to remember where the process started and why perhaps the committee faced difficulties and frustrations as regards a number of what it believed to be well founded improvements and suggestions made in the criticisms on which the Government have refused to budge. It was hugely influenced by the most unhappy saga of events concerning Dr David Kelly, Andrew Gilligan and the resignation of the chairman and director-general of the BBC. There was acute anxiety at the time that the charter review process was about to be embarked upon with no BBC chairman in place and with the need for a chairman to be appointed as soon as possible. Questions were asked about whether those unhappy circumstances and the unparalleled row between the Prime Minister's official press spokesman and the BBC at that time would influence the charter process. History will probably reveal to us to what extent that was the case. I have my own deep suspicions that the problems that we now face and the solution that the Government have put forward may indeed be influenced by a desire to move away from those unhappy circumstances as quickly as possible and, as my noble friend Lord Fowler said, that a deal between the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport and the chairman of the BBC underpins the arrangements that we are discussing today. Following this, our final discussion, this House will then wave goodbye to the matter and will have no further chance to influence events.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/5">I make it clear that I regard this as a very unhappy arrangement and I hope that my colleagues will excuse me if I repeat what I said in Grand Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March 2006</phrase>. I took the opportunity to quote Sir Howard Davies, who in a newspaper article commented on the Government's proposals at that time. He accurately quoted our report, in which we said that we thought that the,</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/6" class="indent">&quot;proposals for reforming the governance and regulation of the BBC are confusing, misguided and unworkable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/7">He drew attention to the fact that, in evidence to our committee, important features of the proposals were opposed by Ofcom, by Michael Grade, the BBC chairman, by his predecessors, Gavyn Davies and Sir Christopher Bland, by Greg Dyke and by the noble Lord, Lord Burns. He went on to say that, had he been allowed to appear, the noble Lord, Lord Birt, would surely have opposed them, too. The noble Lord, Lord Birt, subsequently appeared before us and, indeed, that was the case. Sir Howard Davies, in his article, went on to ask:</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/8" class="indent">&quot;How has the government achieved this remarkable full house of opposition?&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/9">He also said why he believed that such confusion exists and why Sir Christopher Bland is also extremely critical. He wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/10" class="indent">&quot;In the light of this devastating and unanimous critique it seems astonishing that the government appears determined to plough on&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 26/3/06; col. GC 249.]</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/11">What we have today is ploughing on.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/12">I realise how wide the degree of criticism and opposition was. Yesterday, I happened to have the pleasure of listening to the former Cabinet Secretary, the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, in an interesting debate in this House on the Statistics Commission. I pricked up my ears because in the middle of it&mdash;this is a peek behind the curtain of No. 10&mdash;the noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/13" class="indent">&quot;Some have argued that the board&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/14">that is, of the Statistics Commission&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/15" class="indent">&quot;cannot be responsible for both the delivery and the oversight of the system&mdash;pretty much the same arguments that led some, including myself, to criticise the new structure for the BBC&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/16">He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/17" class="indent">&quot;In this case, however,&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/18">that is, in the case of the Statistics Commission&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/19" class="indent">&quot;I support the Government's proposals&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 15/6/06; col. 416.]</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/20">What he meant was that, in the case of the BBC, he certainly did not support the Government's proposals, and I am still on the hunt to find anyone other than the Secretary of State, her loyal supporter the Minister and the chairman of the BBC, who has no choice, who supports these proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/21">Perhaps I may instance why I think we are moving in such difficult country. The Minister kindly allowed me to intervene to ask what was happening about the appointment of the chairman of the executive board. I made a mistake in calling him the chairman of the BBC. I had not read the passage in the draft charter which makes it clear that I should not have done that, because the chairman of the trust may also be known as the chairman of the BBC. However, I then looked at the complaints procedure, which sets out how complaints will be handled in the BBC. In case anyone thinks that they can write to the chairman of the BBC, the complaints section of the revised draft framework agreement states:</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/22" class="indent">&quot;The Trust should not have a role in handling or determining individual complaints in the first instance&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/23">The point that many of us made was that we would now have two chairmen and the poor public would wonder who was going to be seen as the chairman of the BBC&mdash;as I understand it, as we sit here, we do not know. We do not know when the new chairman of the executive board is to be appointed, or whether he is to be executive or non-executive. If he is to be executive, it has to be the director-general, because that is set out in the conditions of the charter. But we do not know who that will be and we do not know when he will be appointed. I may not have heard the Minister correctly, so perhaps, when he replies to the debate, he will make that clear. The chairman has to be appointed by the trust but, as I understand it, things are going to go ahead before the trust is fully appointed and there will be a shadow situation. I did not quite understand that point. I can see that a bit of scribbling is going on in the Box, so the Minister may have a reply to that point before he makes his winding-up speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/24">I make that point to show that many of us are worried that duplication and confusion will exist. I have already made a mistake myself and I have been considering these issues on the Select Committee for God knows how many months. The point about the public knowing who the chairman of the BBC is going to be illustrates that very well.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/25">The next shock concerns how the trust members will be appointed. If the Minister does not understand why some members of the committee&mdash;perhaps all of us&mdash;got frustrated when what we thought were a number of constructive and correct suggestions were continually rebuffed by the Government, perhaps I may deal with the appointment of trust members. We suggested that the chairman of the BBC should be chosen on the recommendation of a truly independent panel; that the selection panel should have a majority of non-political members; that its members should be balanced between those with explicit political allegiances; that it should be chaired by a non-political member who is not a civil servant; and that it should operate according to Nolan principles. We recommended that other members of the BBC board or the BBC Trust should be appointed in a similar manner to that described above. So my mouth fell open when, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-07">7 June</phrase> in this House, the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, replied to the noble Baroness, Lady Howe, on what I thought must be broadly acceptable to a Government who claim to be interested in transparency and openness in these matters. She had asked about conforming to those principles and the Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/26" class="indent">&quot;Nolan principles will apply. The selection panel will consist of a DCMS director, the chairman, Michael Grade&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 7/6/06; col. 1256.]</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/27">There is also to be an independent assessor, which I take to mean that he will not actually be on the panel, but that he will assess the work of the other two.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/28">That is absolutely outrageous. How will people have confidence in the BBC Trust? Some may criticise my noble friend for saying that it always appears that some of these arrangements are a stitch up between the Department for Culture, Media and Sport and the chairman of the BBC. Finding that that is to be the arrangement by which the trust members are appointed, I hope it is not too late, as other noble Lords have suggested, for that to be looked at.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/29">I want to comment on one point that my noble friend addressed: the involvement of the National Audit Office. In the vacuum of a proper independent assessment of the licence fee and the justification for it, others are joining in. ITV has retained consultants to advise it on the financial justification for the licence fee application by the BBC. The Minister and other noble Lords may have received, as I have, that independent accountants' report, which says, in summary, that the BBC has underestimated household growth revenue, which on its own adds up to &pound;800 million, sufficient to cover the BBC's &quot;overstated&quot; &pound;640 million digital switch-over infrastructure costs.</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/30">I know that the DCMS has used other consultants, perhaps subject to commercial confidentiality&mdash;I do not know. I do not know whether the ITV independent consultant is right. In such a situation, is there not a compelling case for having a respected, independent body, of the standing of the National Audit Office, that can conduct an inquiry, so that it is not turned into a battle between outside paid consultants and accountants who are retained to advise the different bodies?</p>
	<p pid="a.444.0/31">As regards the involvement of this legislature, we now say goodbye to the BBC charter. I have made a number of criticisms which, as the Minister will know, are echoed by many, much better qualified people than me, commenting on the difficulties and challenges of the governance of the BBC. I recognise that the die is now cast and that the Government are determined to plough on. They have a very heavy responsibility and the chairman of the BBC and the new trust members now have a major challenge. Any organisation, no matter how unwise, ultimately can be made to work with the willingness and the capability of the people determined to address it. I do not believe that the Government have given them the best opportunity to achieve that but, at the end of the day, that is what will happen. I am obliged to say that I hope to goodness that it does not damage the BBC which, as I said at the very start my remarks, is such a valued and admired part of our national institutions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-16a.453.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100806" speakername="Lord Gould of Brookwood" colon=":" colnum="453"  time="012:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60616-07.htm#60616-07_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.453.0/1">My Lords, it is with some humility and a great deal of trepidation that I follow my noble friend Lord Bragg. If anyone exemplifies public service broadcasting, it is him&mdash;for the BBC and elsewhere. It was a superb speech well made. I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, and his committee on their excellent report. This has been a good debate and a serious and timely one.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/2">I am speaking today hoping to follow on from what was an excellent debate yesterday on political participation. I must say at the outset that I am not an expert on the BBC or on broadcasting and I would not claim for any moment to be able to pronounce with confidence about an institution and an industry which is hugely complex and, for the most part, hugely successful. I leave that to others who have better earned their broadcasting credentials.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/3">What I want to say, without any kind of hesitation, is that the BBC is an extraordinary institution and one that genuinely represents the best of public service values in Britain. It is one of those things about Britain which can claim to be genuinely outstanding. Because it is so successful so often, it can irritate&mdash;it certainly irritates me on occasion&mdash;but in part, that is the price that you pay for success.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/4">For a public organisation to be a world leader in an industry which globally is as fast-moving and competitive as any other in the world&mdash;probably more than almost any other in the world&mdash;and in which serious and contentious bets on the future had to be taken a decade or so earlier, is something of which we should all be proud. Because the BBC has been successful does not mean that it was ordained to be so successful; we should all be mindful of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/5">In general, when it comes to a financial settlement I tend to agree with the noble Lord, Lord Birt, who had so much to do with the success that I have described, who said that although he is a hawk on value for money, he believes that the BBC has to be very well funded. That is my certainly my view. I believe that in part because the growth of media fragmentation, channel proliferation and the almost exponential growth of new media outlets does not make the BBC less necessary, but more. One of the lessons of the growth of new web-based news communications is that the websites that bloggers use most often are sites that are both free and substantial enough to be the gateway to massive amounts of other information. There are very few such major gateway sites; the BBC is one of them; that position must be preserved.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/6">If the BBC retreated as an organisation in any way now, it would not just lose the battle of the present, but, far more disturbingly, the battle of the internet future also. Winning that future is important not just for broadcasting, but for Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/7">There is a second reason for maintaining the strength of the BBC in a world of media proliferation. It is that all research into the patterns of behaviour in the use of new media shows that the internet is both a medium of individual communication and of community cohesion. In that context, the BBC can act as facilitator both of personal connection and of social bond. The BBC has never been more necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/8">The issue on which I want to focus today is news. I can feel the whole House inwardly groaning: here is yet another new Labour apparatchik complaining about BBC news. I assure the House that I am not concerned today with political balance; I leave that to my private rants in front of my television set&mdash;they are definitely best left private.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/9">The issue for me is how the BBC develops appropriate news coverage for a new media age. For me, that issue first arose almost as a by-product of work I was doing for the election in 1997. Confirming the prejudice of all in this House, I personally conducted focus groups for each night of the election, including, amazingly, bank holidays. As part of that process, I used to show television coverage of each day's campaigning. I noticed something that I thought was interesting. It was that the public simply did not want to see the news interpreted for them; they wanted to be informed and then to make up their own minds. They saw the BBC correspondent or political editor not as an aid to understanding, but as a barrier to understanding.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/10">In contrast, a rival channel, which will remain nameless, had a different approach, allowing the politicians to speak for themselves and allowing the public to make up their own minds. That was far more popular and far more engaging. That struck me as a serious piece of learning. As each election progressed, that tendency has grown. People wanted information on which they could make up their own mind, not opinion that had already been made up for them by others.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/11">What I did not know then was that I was seeing in its nascent form the beginning of probably the biggest revolution in media attitudes in many generations. It is the shift from communication that is one-way to communication that is two-way and participatory. The point about the communications revolution is that people are increasingly no longer prepared to accept communication that comes from one top-down source, especially when it contains an opinion or a point of view. Instead, people want facts. They want to hear the facts and make up their own minds. They want bottom-up communication.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/12">When a senior political correspondent of the BBC asked me the other day: &quot;Would it really be better to go back to the old way when the news participants gave interviews directly, and BBC correspondents just gave the facts?&quot;, he was absolutely right. Not just because it would make for better and more serious news, but because it is closer to the mood of modern times.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/13">What is perhaps most interesting about the BBC in the face of this news challenge is that it is taking two bets at once. It has mapped out two futures for BBC news. On the one hand, with its website, it plugged straight into the new communications zeitgeist. The website makes absolutely clear the distinction between news and comment. Every BBC correspondent writing a piece on current political events visibly strives for impartiality. All serious issues are examined seriously and explained in depth, and the arguments made for and against. Opinions are made; the BBC political editor has his blog, but we all know that it is his opinion and his opinion alone. Anyway, we can all respond to it, if we want to, on his blog. The BBC website is a model for the communication of news in modern times and must in no way be harmed. But the other bet the BBC has made is different. If the website is mostly about information, the main terrestrial news is about opinion. What was a nagging concern in 1997 became the basis of the whole BBC approach to television news. So-called two ways proliferated, political correspondents became more and more judgmental, and slowly but surely the crucial gap between information and opinion began to blur.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/14">Finally, the next and fatal step was taken. We moved from a situation in which not only the correspondents in the news bulletin articulated opinions but the whole news broadcast began to have an opinion, by which point we became very close to tabloid news. An example of this is the BBC six o'clock news on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-22">22 May</phrase>, which began, &quot;A country awash with drugs; our special investigation into the crime ruining our communities. In our exclusive poll, drugs are a problem for three-quarters of people in their area. We live in a country in which countless families cower in their homes while dealers rule the streets, and where three out of four families we talked to experience a drugs problem on their front door&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/15">This information, which was contentious enough already, was presented in a sensationalist style that was a cross between Fox News and the <i>Daily Mail</i>. What was the information based on? I am embarrassed to say that it was based on an opinion poll, but one whose findings were at odds with the interpretation placed on them in the programme. Eighteen per cent of those surveyed said there was no drugs problem, 43 per cent said there was a small drugs problem, and about two-thirds said that drugs were no problem or only a small problem. There was no mention in the survey of a country awash with drugs, or of drugs taken outside the front door. This was all interpretation, opinion and sensation. This broadcast, I am afraid, was a classic example of tabloid TV.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/16">I know there are reasons for this. Time is short, ratings press and audiences are high, but this is the wrong response to the challenge of engaging the public at this time. People do not want the news to do their thinking and form their opinions for them; they want to do it themselves. The BBC will respond by saying that it retains the trust of the public; it does, but this may be changing. A survey commissioned by the BBC on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-03">3 May</phrase> says that 51 per cent nationally trust the Government, while 49 per cent trust the media. That is not a huge difference, but for the Government to be trusted more than the media in these times is a pretty remarkable feat.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/17">My point is clear; the BBC has taken two routes into the future at the same time. On its website, it has put information first and trusted the user to make up his or her mind. On its news, it has put opinion first as a way of creating interest and ratings and of maximizing accessibility. I am confident that I know which one is right; it is the modern way, the participatory way. It is to trust the viewers and allow them to make up their own minds, because that is the way of the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/18">I close by quoting Michael Grade, the current chairmen of the BBC and someone whom I greatly admire. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/19" class="indent">&quot;We may have created a tension&mdash;on the one hand the expectation that editors should deliver the traditional serious news agenda, and on the other a perceived pressure on editors to win audiences&mdash;with the result that a certain confusion may have taken afoot about which is the right road to follow&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.453.0/20">This is a false dichotomy and a false tension. My view is simple; opinion blocks accessibility, but information assists it. We are no longer in a world of chasing ratings by creating impact and sensation; we are in a world of creating understanding by providing information and inviting response and feedback. In this new media age, there is no tension between seriousness and accessibility. If we allow people to have all the information they need, and we trust them, they will make up their own minds in their own time. That is the future, and thanks to the extraordinary work that it has done in recent years with the internet, the BBC is very well placed to face it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-16a.469.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100877" speakername="Baroness Deech" colon=":" colnum="469"  time="013:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60616-11.htm#60616-11_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.469.0/1">My Lords, I start by declaring my interests: I am a BBC governor. Your Lordships will not see or hear my like again. I am the last of a species that has served the country and the BBC well over 80 years, and overseen its growth into the respected and influential organisation that it is now, with 250 million worldwide listeners and news that reaches 80 per cent of the population every week. I was appointed in response to an advertisement in the newspapers, according to Nolan principles. Like my fellow governors, once led by my noble friend Lord Ryder, I am beholden to no one, except the licence fee payers. I have no other interests to promote. The governors have been remarkably good value for money, with salaries way below those paid by Ofcom.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/2">Even in my few years as a governor, we have seen changes introduced that would not have been contemplated or imagined 10 years ago, when the charter was last renewed, or even five years ago&mdash; 24-hour news, online services, the website, in its position of prominence, and widespread public interaction with the BBC through all sorts of new technologies. Those changes have enabled every citizen to express himself or herself if they want to, make common cause with others and communicate with the BBC. In most recent years, with licence fee money, the BBC has launched a digital curriculum for the education of children&mdash;or grandchildren in your Lordships' case&mdash;and it has started digital switchover. It has become a leader in Europe in its field, with the assistance of Freeview.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/3">With that record, why is change necessary? It is necessary not because of problems with the governors, but because the broadcasting market has changed and our national views on appropriate corporate governance have developed to such a point that they must be taken into account in a new charter.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/4">The draft charter, which I am happy to support, is the product of the most sustained consultation and debate process I have ever known. It was starting when I became a governor four years ago. The Government's first consultation paper was in 2003. Arguably, too much time has been spent on examining and digging up programmes and services that have barely bedded in. There was never such a deep consultation before&mdash;DCMS seminars, White and Green Papers, public and private debates. That is more, dare I say, than a parliamentary timetable might have allowed for were the BBC to be based on an Act of Parliament, instead of, as it should be, a Royal Charter. It is not at the mercy of political cross-currents or priorities. The result is a charter with four times as many clauses as last time and changes fit for the 21st century. The charter is renewed and the licence fee is to be retained. The public, as I will show, rate the independence of the BBC very highly. That independence rests on a constitutional structure that has stood for decades&mdash;tinker with it at your peril.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/5">In all the discussions and examinations that have preceded and will follow this debate, your Lordships must not risk losing sight of the two essences of the BBC that need defending&mdash;its independence and its quality. They will be safeguarded by the trust, but they are not at the forefront of the concerns of its competitors. Only the trust can safeguard independence and listen to the licence fee payers, whose interests must dominate. The trust needs the strength and the mandate to do that job. The trust will follow the governors in setting the strategic direction of the BBC and overseeing the work of the executive board. The trust will be the final arbiter of complaints. It will seek the views of the licence fee payer and will set objective measures, as has been mentioned earlier in the debate. It will have regard to the BBC's impact on the market, bearing in mind that up to half the BBC's network production will be available for independents.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/6">Your Lordships might ask whether too much sensitivity is being shown towards the BBC's market impact on its commercial competition, whose concern is its own commercial self-interest and not innovation, creativity or independence. The BBC has agreed to rein itself in for the sake of the preservation of competition and a broader market in a way that would never be applied to competition in new health or education measures in the NHS or the education system. The BBC's overriding duty must be to its licence fee payers and it has to give them the best return for their money. Indeed, the website has already been trimmed back solely in response to market fears, yet there is no guarantee in return that commercial broadcasters would thrive and grow more if the BBC were to be diminished&mdash;on the contrary. The charter will ensure that there is no unchecked expansionism.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/7">The licence fee concept gives stability and a measure of freedom from political interference and manipulation. In return, the BBC has an obligation directly to its public. The trust will consult and listen to the public, as did the governors. The licence fee does not only bring TV; let us recall also radio, the website and the training of media people throughout the industry. The BBC sets standards throughout the whole industry, educates the young and learners of all ages, talks to minorities in their own languages, mirrors local communities back to themselves, preserves the languages of the nations and is a guarantee of news and information regardless of the ups and downs of the rest of the audio-visual industry. To follow my own interest, it is above all a supporter of live music. The classical music scene of this country, with the Proms and the orchestras and choirs, rests to a large extent on the BBC and the licence fee payers' resources&mdash;and well used they are.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/8">Our informed democracy has come to rely on this provision and communication. Even if the fee rose to &pound;150 or &pound;180 a year, it is still under &pound;4 a week, which is less than buying a daily newspaper, no more than the cost of a few tickets for the more popular entertainment and less than subscriptions to commercial rivals. The licence fee forms 23 per cent of the total revenue of the entire industry, a figure that is down from 46 per cent in 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/9">It has been shown that there is public support for the level of the fee as bid for by the BBC. Professor Patrick Barwise's independent report on public opinion on the licence fee bid shows that most licence fee payers would, if they had to, pay substantially more than the current &pound;10 a month for BBC services. In fact, when new services were brought to mind, up to 70 per cent to 75 per cent of them were happy to pay a higher fee. They are evenly divided over paying extra fees to help the vulnerable to achieve digital switchover, which is a government proposal accepted by the BBC in the interests of ensuring universality of digital reception.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/10">The BBC is highly trusted and valued by the public and realises that the adaptation to changes in markets and technologies requires a slightly higher licence fee. According to Barwise, the public want the BBC to continue as one of the pillars of broadcasting and would prefer it to be strong and innovative, even if it takes a few more pounds a year. Like a husband or wife in a long marriage, there is always something to grumble about in the daily offerings, but it would be intolerable to weaken that companion to our daily lives. The support is not begrudged, for the strength of the union is recognised.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/11">I see no room for further scrutiny by the NAO. The current arrangements came into play only in 2003 and appear to work well. There are special issues of creativity and risk-taking that cannot be amenable to ordinary audit and need to be shared by the BBC and the NAO. The BBC's expenditure is under other agents of scrutiny. The BBC's commercial arm is striving for efficiencies and self-help. There are plans to save some &pound;350 million a year and to cut many thousands of staff. Above all, there is no lack of accountability&mdash;to Parliament, as witnessed by this debate, to Select Committees from time to time, to Ofcom in certain areas, by service licences and by approvals for new services. Indeed, never was a body so accountable, given the need to preserve its independence.</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/12">Given the BBC's record of leading the way in revolutions&mdash;its website, its digital progress and the way in which it provides the public with a technology that it now seems our lives cannot do without, noble Lords, to quote Barwise,</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/13" class="indent">&quot;should not be asking the BBC for a Soviet-style plan which says exactly what it will be doing, and how it will allocate its resources, in five or seven&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.469.0/14">or 10 years' time. Its past record is its defence, and the new charter achieves the right blend of obligation and flexibility. We have seen the problems that can be caused in other areas of public life by micro-management and too much target-setting. Your Lordships should have confidence in the future of an organisation that it has watched over for 80 years. The BBC should speak to and listen to the public who fund it, with no unnecessary regulatory or political barriers between them to distort the message.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-16a.472.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100247" speakername="Lord Gordon of Strathblane" colon=":" colnum="472"  time="013:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60616-12.htm#60616-12_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.472.0/1">My Lords, the disagreements between the Select Committee and the Government are very succinctly set out in the letter of the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, to the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport. It may therefore seem strange that I feel able to congratulate both the Government and the Select Committee on the work that they have done. I feel that both have done their job well.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/2">My noble friend Lord Davies, in opening the debate, said that this had been the most open and transparent review ever, and I think that that is true. I think that the Government have not moved in the direction of agreeing with me as they should have done&mdash;but that is entirely up to the Government. They have moved some way on a lot of issues. It is also a hugely difficult process to manage the renewal of the BBC charter and licence fee. In some ways, if we could decouple one from the other, it might help, because we are left with the most important question of all&mdash;the quantum of the licence fee&mdash;still hanging in the air. I would recommend that a committee from time to time be set up. My noble friend Lord Lipsey and I served on the previous one, under Gavyn Davies, looking at the licence fee. That helps to distance the matter a bit from the Government and it gives the Government an outside viewpoint on what might be appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/3">I should also like to congratulate the committee under the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, on its work. It has been a very thorough series of reports. This is now our third debate, and each of them has been highly illuminating. The clamour of support for a permanent Select Committee on communications and the media evidenced in this House on Wednesday is not only tribute to the importance of the subject&mdash;which is, I think, vital in a modern democracy&mdash;but a recognition of how well the committee did that job.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/4">I open with one regret. Exactly as happened 10 years ago&mdash;when, slightly ahead of time, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-09">9 January</phrase>, this House was having exactly this debate, with exactly the same concerns about governance and accountability, and about the renewal of the charter&mdash;a speaker observed how convenient it was that the next week we would have the Second Reading of a broadcasting Bill where we would be able to look at the rest of broadcasting. I have never understood the logic of looking at all of broadcasting except the BBC, which is the biggest part of it, and then at the BBC. That simply cannot make sense. You cannot look at the ecology of broadcasting and divorce from that survey the activities of its major player.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/5">I am on record throughout all the debates on the Ofcom Bill as wanting the BBC under Ofcom. I think that that would have safeguarded the BBC. The Government have set their face against that. They have moved in some regards, but I think that to some extent we may well have the worst of both worlds. We will have a board of trustees who are more divorced from the day-to-day running than the governors were and therefore cannot influence from the inside, and yet not sufficiently divorced to satisfy those who feel that the board should be wholly independent. That could well create problems. For example, I foresee problems, although I hope that they will not occur, between the market impact assessment that will be conducted by Ofcom and the public value test that will be conducted by the trustees. Ultimately, however, the trustees will be able to overrule Ofcom. That is a recipe for tension which need not exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/6">It is very important to recognise, as the noble Lord, Lord Bragg, and others have, that the BBC is our most important public service broadcaster. But broadcasting in this country would be immeasurably the poorer if it were the only one. The commercial sector has exactly the same public sector obligations as the BBC. It discharges them without the subvention of the licence fee; it discharges them by raising money through advertising revenue. Once we have a private sector that no longer values the licence&mdash;because, frankly, you can replicate access to the viewers through other means&mdash;the incentive to retain that licence and to perform public service at no cost to the public disappears. I share the view of the noble Lord, Lord Bragg, that the Government should bring forward their review of public service broadcasting in the round so that we do not wait until 2011, which may well be too late.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/7">As regards the points on which the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, disagreed with the Government, I should indicate which side I am on. I am afraid that I agree with the Government regarding the Royal Charter. I recognise the point about Acts of Parliament, and it all sounds very nice and democratic, but the grave danger is that we would end up with amendments from pressure groups changing the nature of the charter. The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, pointed out that the current charter has four times as many clauses as the previous one. No one could quarrel with the new public service obligations, but why should we not add promotion of a healthy Britain or promotion of a safe Britain? The problem is that, the more clauses you add, the less severe the scrutiny will be of any of them. We shall end up with corporate governance, ticking boxes; there will be no real scrutiny. We need to be careful about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/8">I will make some broad points on the quantum of the licence fee. We need to be careful here. I fully appreciate that the BBC does its job extraordinarily well. It would do other jobs extraordinarily well, but is it in the public interest that we have a degree of mission creep, as it were, where the BBC gradually moves more and more into other fields, thus making it impossible for a commercial operator with public service obligations to operate in those fields? I suggest that it is not.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/9">Most of the BBC's morning programmes are concerned with home improvement. Should the BBC publish magazines on home improvement? If it did, would it not have a considerable advantage over a commercial provider of such a magazine, simply because of its ability to promote it on air? The BBC does excellent holiday programmes, but should it produce a holiday magazine? Should it even run BBC holidays? Where do you stop? The BBC would do all those things extraordinarily well, but there has to be a limit. We have to be careful about whether we are funding a public service broadcaster or a public service provider of things well beyond broadcasting. That will be a constant problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/10">My next point relates to the market impact assessment of the size of the BBC settlement in relation to other broadcasters. I hope that it is not intended to safeguard anyone from competition. The BBC does extremely good programmes, but it is important that we do not have a settlement that fuels inflation in broadcasting rather than simply enabling the BBC to meet it. The BBC is the biggest payer in broadcasting because it has the most money. If you exacerbate that situation, you will further weaken the rest of the sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/11">The popularity of some BBC radio programmes is fully justified, but I hope that no one would suggest that the BBC should be under less stringent regulation when changing a service than the commercial sector is. They both should have identical obligations to say what they are going to do and then stick to that. One should not be weaker than the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/12">On the process for determining the licence fee, the case for NAO involvement in scrutinising the BBC's bid is overwhelming. It would help the BBC. The BBC did not do its own case any good when the figure for Manchester suddenly switched from &pound;600 million to &pound;400 million. It gave some credibility to the crack made by Charles Allan of ITV that these were calculations done on the back of a fag packet. I am sure that they were not, but it did not help the BBC's case. As the noble Lord, Lord King, observed, the BBC had seriously underestimated the benefit to it of the increasing number of households in this country brought about for very distressing reasons, such as single parent families and divorces. There are more households than ever before and the benefit to the BBC in increased licence income has not been fully brought out.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/13">I recommend that all noble Lords read the evidence given to the Select Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Birt. I am concerned that he thought that it would be impossible for an outsider to decide whether the BBC was giving value for money. In a way, that is quite worrying, and his criticisms of the previous regimes at the BBC as being profligate with licence fee payers' resources are quite worrying. It is a pity that that was not recognised more at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/14">I have very quick points on things that should be included in taxation rather than in the licence fee. Digital transmission is properly part of the licence fee, because one of the key obligations of public service broadcasting is universality of provision. There was a time when the BBC owned its own transmitters, before it sold them to an American company, Crown Castle, and the ITV transmitters used to be owned by the Independent Broadcasting Authority to make sure that they were held in the public interest. By contrast, I agree with the Select Committee that, as it were, the social costs of giving free licences to people, or helping people with the licence fee, is frankly a perfectly laudable social objective; however, it should be met out of general taxation and not out of the licence fee.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/15">Most important of all, I am concerned about moves to charge for spectrum and the unfortunate unwillingness of the Secretary of State to rule that out when asked about it directly by the noble Lord, Lord Fowler, in the recent hearing. Spectrum will be auctioned off by the Government; no Treasury will resist the opportunity to make a bit of money. All public service broadcasters should be exempt&mdash;not just the BBC, but all who profess public service and adhere to public service obligations&mdash;from paying that. That is the only carrot that you can offer a public service broadcaster nowadays to retain public service obligations. If you do not, you will gradually have more and more of a free-for-all, with fragmentation replacing regulated competition and a resultant loss of quality. We must also consider the impact of high definition television, which will require more spectrum. Will that be held up because it is using more spectrum and therefore, arguably, costing more money?</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/16">I have two closing points. Fragmentation of the industry has caused a major problem in the commercial radio sector. A few years ago, the commercial radio sector had a 51 per cent listener share against the BBC's 49 per cent, and the BBC fully expected its share to go down. In fact, the BBC share has now gone up to 56 per cent and commercial radio is at 44 per cent, although it is much higher in the younger age groups. The reason for that is not only very good programmes from the BBC&mdash;which they are&mdash;but the increase in the commercial sector of about 100 new stations, very few of which are making any money whatever. They are fragmenting the audience. It is incumbent on the regulator to ensure that we do not over-saturate the market with more services than can reasonably exist. We must ensure that we have enough human, technical and financial resources to support the services that are introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/17">My final point is linked to the technology argument. The real danger that we now face, and we will certainly face it when we next have this debate in perhaps 10 years' time, is that technology is taking over. I am afraid that a lot of the public service arguments have disappeared. The pupils are now deciding the curriculum. The days when someone at the centre could give the listener or the viewer a tolerable leavening of what they should have are gone. The viewer or listener demands the news bulletin that he or she wants, when he wants it, for as long as he wants it. If his only interest in life is Wayne Rooney's metatarsal, &quot;Big Brother&quot;, and one other thing, fine: that is the news bulletin that he will get. I am afraid that that is happening increasingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.472.0/18">I recommend to the Select Committee in its new form the following subjects for early discussion. Do we need to regulate the internet in the light of what is happening? How do we recognise the effect of internet migration on existing broadcasting and newspapers that depend on advertising? Those are only two subjects among many that would justify the continuance of a Select Committee on media and communications, which I hope this House will set up shortly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-16a.490.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="490"  time="014:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60616-16.htm#60616-16_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.490.1/1">My Lords, the decision about free licences was taken in relation to the actual cost of buying the licence. We are talking about costs that are not the immediately and readily identifiable, precisely quantifiable costs that apply under the free licence scheme. The scheme of support will vary according to the needs of the citizen. There will be gradations with regard to the help that needs to be given and it is different in kind from the straightforward position on licensing costs. That is the Government's position against a background where, quite clearly, we recognise that the process of switchover will be a cathartic event for the whole nation, not only those who have obvious financial difficulties in meeting these requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/2">The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester questioned me, as I would expect, on the issues that he addressed to the Secretary of State in a letter about the future of religious broadcasting on the BBC. I assure him that the reply to his insightful letter is being prepared and will be sent to him shortly. However, I want to indicate the broad terms of that reply. The Government recognise that the BBC has a key role to play in providing a range of programming reflecting different religions and other beliefs. It is appropriate to a multi-faith Britain that these will need to be in prominent positions on TV and radio schedules. I can offer an element of reassurance to my noble friend Lord Macdonald, who raised the other dimension with regard to belief. Scepticism and challenge to religion will also be part of those debates and form part of the obvious aspect of the BBC in informing the nation and ensuring that programmes have balance and are reflective of the nation's needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/3">The noble Lord, Lord King, was exercised about the arrangements over the summer. I cannot be precise about the date, but the trust will appoint the chairman of the executive board as soon as is reasonably practical after the charter is granted. It will happen sometime during the autumn in plenty of time before the new regime comes substantively into force on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January</phrase>. The process will take place during November.</p>
	<p pid="a.490.1/4">I heard what the noble Lord said about the process by which members of the trust will be established. The Government not only have nothing to apologise for in the strategy in these terms, but deserve recognition for their guarantee that the appointments process, which is a critical factor with regard to such important positions as the trust, will be conducted according to Nolan principles in agreement with the Office of the Commissioner for Public Appointments. We are confident that these standards will enable appointments to be made in a fair and transparent way, based on merit. We have no doubt that it will be recognised throughout the nation that the demands on the trust are extensive and greater than on the previous governors of the BBC. Advertisements will be placed in the press and elsewhere and people will apply according to their abilities. The board will certainly need to have the balance and range of expertise that guarantees that it can meet the extensive obligations which the BBC has to face. However, I assure the noble Lord, Lord King, that there is no question but that these processes will be entirely fair and proper.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-16a.499.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100388" speakername="Lord Luke" colon=":" colnum="499"  time="015:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60616-18.htm#60616-18_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.499.0/1">My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Beaumont of Whitley, for introducing his Bill, and I congratulate him on the publicity obtained on television and radio this morning. It quite enlivened my breakfast. It is nice to have the opportunity to expand a little on the debate that arose from his Unstarred Question on noise pollution on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-13">13 February</phrase> this year. It is a shame that his Bill has not attracted the greater interest that was anticipated by my noble friend Lady Hanham at that time.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.0/2">Piped music, for me, stirs up images of wandering minstrels playing at wedding feasts in Tudor times or, indeed, pipes being played at Roman feasts and possibly orgies, although I was not there so I am not sure about that. However, if you search for its modern definition on-line, on Wikipedia you are directed to,</p>
	<p pid="a.499.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Elevator Music, also known as piped music or Muzak, the gentle, bland instrumental arrangements of popular music designed for play in shopping malls, grocery stores, telephone systems, cruise ships and elevators&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.0/4">The noble Lord, Lord Beaumont, has highlighted piped music and TV programmes which are found beyond that definition&mdash;in our hospitals, on buses, trains and planes and even in taxis, some of which now have &quot;Cab TV&quot;, which I believe you cannot turn off. In fact, I have tried and you cannot. Indeed, muzak is the very type of music to which your Lordships all made personal reference in the last debate as &quot;irritating&quot; or, in the case of the Minister, as &quot;intrusive and pointless&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.0/5">Far from soothing the savage breast, hanging on the telephone while being regaled by the &quot;Ride of the Valkyries&quot;, can be a real pain. However, one's attitude is sometimes coloured by the music itself. Is it, by chance, a favourite of the listener? Perhaps it is too loud? Very often it is, which is half the trouble. On the other hand, gentle background music can often be very therapeutic, provided it does not repeat frequently.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.0/6">Like the noble Lord, Lord Addington, I smiled when I saw the piece about the plans of a council in Australia to play the supposedly calming tones of Barry Manilow, to drive young gentlemen away. It would have driven me away too. The article also referred to a shopping centre in Warrawong Westfield, Australia, which had succeeded in driving away other loitering teenagers by playing non-stop Bing Crosby. So the debate is split between the joys and uses of modern piped music.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.0/7">The statistical examples given by my noble friend in the last debate showed that it is clear that there is strong public reaction to this matter, and it is one of which businesses, organisations and authorities take note. For example, she highlighted the fact that Gatwick airport has stopped playing piped music since it discovered that 43 per cent of the people it surveyed disliked it intensely.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.0/8">The emphasis of the noble Lord's Private Member's Bill is to tackle situations where one cannot escape the music, where one has no choice but to listen, although in a public place. The question we must ask is: do we really need legislation to address this issue? Does a little light music do any harm? I am sure those of you who have had the horror of a tune repeating in your head all day because of one train ride would say, &quot;Yes&quot;. However, on the whole there is little evidence at the moment of significant health and safety risks arising from piped music. I wonder whether anyone has gone to sleep as a result of too soothing a performance thus causing an accident.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.0/9">I would support some of the measures contained in the noble Lord's Bill as I feel the same about some situations. However, I do not believe that legislation is the way to deal with the matter. On these Benches, we are forever mindful of over-regulation, and the need for proportionate legislation. The changes that are proposed could potentially be achieved by people power as we saw with Gatwick. It is important for passengers, workers, indeed all users, to have access to processes by which they can make their views known on both piped music and TV programmes in public spaces, such as in hospitals and on public transport.</p>
	<p pid="a.499.0/10">I hope the Minister can outline in his reply the procedure by which the public can currently do that with regard to the two areas highlighted by the noble Lord, and explain what steps are currently taken to ensure public awareness of those options, should they wish to use them.</p>
