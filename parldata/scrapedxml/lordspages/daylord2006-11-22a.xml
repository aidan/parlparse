<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-22a.345.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="345"  time="015:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61122-0002.htm#06112242000148">
	<p pid="a.345.1/1">My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time. Of the many Northern Ireland Bills to come before this House over the years, few have been as important as this. It is potentially the most significant for generations. It gives effect to the St Andrews agreement with its twin pillars of power-sharing on a fair and equitable basis and support for policing and the rule of law across the whole community. These twin pillars stand or fall together. This legislation means that the vision set out in the Good Friday agreement can at last be fully realised: a Northern Ireland of equals where political difference can be accommodated, cultural diversity celebrated, division healed and where young people can look forward to a safe, secure and peaceful future.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/2">We are now at the point where we must complete this transition with the local political parties delivering on a stable and lasting political settlement. In Armagh last April, the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach made it clear that 2006 is the year of decision for the political parties in Northern Ireland. My right honourable friend the Secretary of State made it clear in another place that the political process can not be allowed to become an end in itself and that politicians could not, and would not, continue to be paid without doing their jobs&mdash;as they have been for more than four years&mdash;as if there was no tomorrow. Northern Ireland's public will not tolerate that. They deserve better. The time has come for action on restoring devolution, ending the democratic deficit and closing down direct rule. The people of Northern Ireland have waited long enough for locally accountable, democratic government. This Bill delivers that goal. It is now up to the parties to deliver on their obligations too.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/3">As has been the case throughout this process, little is ever easy or straightforward, and I can understand why the parties might wish to edge forward with caution. In Northern Ireland's politics, it has always been easier to say no, and always harder to say yes.I know that there are issues on which all sideswant reassurance. Where the Government can give reassurance, we will. Where the parties must give reassurance to each other, they should. However, as the Secretary of State said yesterday, there is nothing that cannot be resolved within the timeframe set out in the St Andrews agreement, given the will to do it. I believe that the will is there, and the St Andrews momentum must be maintained to achieve that end.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/4">The timetable for devolution is clear. On<phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>&mdash;two days from now&mdash;the Assembly will convene, and the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein, as the two largest parties, will indicate who the First Minister and Deputy First Minister will be come restoration on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-26">26 March</phrase> next year. This indication will trigger the transitional Assembly, which can then get down to the real work of preparing a programme for government.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/5">In January next year we will have the 13th report of the Independent Monitoring Commission. Significantly, this will be the seventh report since the IRA declared it would end its illegal activity. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase>, there will be an election in which the people will speak and on<phrase class="date" code="2006-03-14">14 March</phrase>, members of the Executive will be nominated by the party leaders. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-26">Monday 26 March</phrase>, power will be devolved and the d'Hondt process of choosing an Executive will run, with Ministers assuming office taking the pledge of office. That will indeed be &quot;democracy day&quot; for Northern Ireland. But the Government are under no illusions. There is still much work to be done. Nobody can be forced into government. The Government cannot force people into government. Neither this House nor the other place can force people into government.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/6">If at any stage between now and <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-26">26 March</phrase> we run out of track then devolution will become dissolution. The clock is stopped; the election scrapped; that is the reality. This is not a threat either from me or the Secretary of State. There would simply be no point in continuing. In that event direct rule and plan B, with even closer co-operation with the Irish Government, will stretch into the foreseeable future. So a choice is to be made by the parties and the people&mdash;not next week, not next month, not next year and not the year after that, but now. The imperative is to do it now.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/7">The twin pillars of power sharing and the rule of law are enshrined in the pledge of office that all Ministers must take on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-26">26 March</phrase>. The pledge of office requires all Ministers to,</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/8" class="indent">&quot;promote the interests of the whole community represented in the Northern Ireland Assembly towards the goal of a shared future&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/9">to represent and work for not only those who voted for them and loaned them their mandate, but also for those who did not.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/10">The pledge requires all Ministers to,</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/11" class="indent">&quot;participate fully in the Executive Committee, the North-South Ministerial Council and the British-Irish Council&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/12">If devolution is to deliver good government, all the institutions of government must function effectively. Any less than a full commitment to that will sell short everyone in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/13">The pledge of office also requires Ministers to,</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/14" class="indent">&quot;observe the joint nature of the offices of First Minister and deputy First Minister&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/15">These are fundamental tenets of power sharing, which go well beyond the symbolism&mdash;important though that is&mdash;of two different political traditions working together in equality without sacrificing either principle or integrity.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/16">On support for the rule of law, the pledge of office could not be clearer. It states that all Ministers will,</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/17" class="indent">&quot;uphold the rule of law based as it is on the fundamental principles of fairness, impartiality and democratic accountability, including support for policing and the courts as set out in paragraph 6 of the St Andrews Agreement&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/18">Let me remind the House what paragraph 6 of theSt Andrews agreement, and, indeed, Clause 7(2) of the Bill, says about support for law and order. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/19" class="indent">&quot;We believe that the essential elements of support for law and order include endorsing fully the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the criminal justice system, actively encouraging everyone in the community to co-operate fully with the PSNI in tackling crime in all areas and actively supporting all the policing and criminal justice institutions, including the Policing Board&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/20">We recognise that the issue of policing has been contentious ever since Northern Ireland came into being, and still more so during the conflict of recent years. But we are in a very different and much better place now. There is no greater example of this than in the transformation that has taken place within the Police Service of Northern Ireland, so ably led bySir Hugh Orde.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/21">The St Andrews agreement also included a clear commitment, and a target of May 2008, for the devolution of policing and justice powers to the restored Executive. We expect all concerned to take that target seriously. Indeed, the Bill requires the Assembly to report to the Secretary of State before <phrase class="date" code="">27 March 2008</phrase> on progress towards the devolution of policing and justice powers.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/22">I want to make clear that, once policing and justice is devolved, there is nothing in the pledge which would remove or unreasonably constrain any future Minister for policing and justice from making any legitimate criticism of the police. After all, proper accountability was central to the Good Friday agreement's vision for new policing arrangements in Northern Ireland and proper accountability was a core element of the Patten report's recommendations. Proper accountability, which can sometimes include constructive criticism, is essential in delivering the police service that Northern Ireland deserves. There is a world of difference between that and a failure to support Northern Ireland policing and justice institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/23">I remind the House that, this summer, Parliament legislated for devolution of policing and justice. We want to see it delivered so that the whole of Northern Ireland can have better ownership of the rule of law and policing. That is in the interests of everyone. Of course, much of policing has already been devolved and I pay tribute to the work of the Policing Board, the police ombudsman and the district policing partnerships for the role they play in making the Police Service of Northern Ireland more accountable than perhaps any force anywhere else in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/24">The future of devolution in Northern Ireland rests on those twin pillars. If either collapses, the whole edifice collapses. We must know that the parties want to move forward to <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-26">26 March</phrase> on that basis. That is why <phrase class="date" code="">24 November</phrase>, two days from now, is so important. When that deadline was set&mdash;well before St Andrews, of course&mdash;the Government said that we needed to know by then that a deal was on and that we were on track for a lasting political settlement: devolution. That remains the case.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/25">Without knowing that, there cannot be a transitional Assembly. Without knowing that, there cannot be an election. Without knowing that, there cannot be devolution. The sequence set out in St Andrews will not be set aside. If the Assembly has to be dissolved because we cannot move forward, it will be, but of course we sincerely hope that it does not come to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/26">We are conscious that there were a range of views on how the commitment at St Andrews to consult the people should be met. There is a powerful case for a referendum. It has the attraction of being a single-issue question. But if a referendum was held, an election to the Assembly would follow within a year of the new Executive getting down to work. We think that what the newly devolved institutions will need is a prolonged period of stability over their incoming four years. That will allow the MLAs to get on with the business of government on the wide range of challenges that will face them: on education, rates, rural planning, water charges and so on. That is what the people want to see their locally elected politicians taking charge of.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/27">Between now and March&mdash;and well beyond, we have no doubt&mdash;there will be challenges that some will call a crisis. The media will try to strike divisions where they do not exist, but there will be challenges. Those can be overcome if everyone delivers on their commitments. Just last week, the cutting-edge travel guide, <I>Lonely Planet</I>, said that Northern Ireland was one of the must-see destinations for tourists. The guide said that Northern Ireland is,</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/28" class="indent">&quot;abuzz with life: the cities are pulsating, the economy is thriving and the people, the lifeblood that courses through the country, are in good spirits&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.1/29">There could be no greater incentive for the parties in Northern Ireland to be an active part of that. This is their opportunity: they can be. Indeed, the House trusts that they will be. Therefore, I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-22a.349.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100241" speakername="Lord Glentoran" colon=":" colnum="349"  time="015:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61122-0002.htm#06112242000167">
	<p pid="a.349.0/1">My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, for setting out the context of the Bill in his usual clear and forthright style. I will be relatively brief at this the Second Reading stage of the Bill. However, we will go into more detail on one or two contentious issues in Committee. We are showing our support for the Bill by agreeing to set aside our usual objections to pushing through legislation of this kind in a single day in order to facilitate a process on which the Government are clearly embarked and which we support.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/2">The title of the Bill makes it clear that the Bill's purpose is to give effect to changes in the so-calledSt Andrews agreement, announced by the British and Irish Governments on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-13">13 October</phrase>, which will require legislation. I am not sure how much agreement there really was in that agreement, but we will find out in the next few days.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/3">That agreement set out a timetable for the restoration of power-sharing devolution in Northern Ireland, with in effect a new deadline of <phrase class="date" code="">26 March 2007</phrase>. However, as the Minister pointed out, the Democratic Unionists and Sinn Fein must indicate this Friday&mdash;the day after tomorrow&mdash;whom they would nominate for the posts of First Minister and Deputy First Minister. That will be followed by an election on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/4">We support devolution. We want the institutions to be restored. We have had enough experience, not least in recent weeks, of the inadequacies with which Northern Ireland business is conducted at Westminster, by no fault of government, noble Lords or officials. No one disputes the fact that it would be infinitely better for Northern Ireland if devolved legislation was debated and passed at Stormont. However, if devolution is not to be, we must change the Westminster/Northern Ireland process. Let us all pray that we do not get to that point. However, there is more to it than that.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/5">I believe that the economy would be better served by having a local administration in Northern Ireland that would be better able to respond to the needs and concerns of local businesses. A local administration would present a new, forward-looking and optimistic face of Northern Ireland to the outside world, helping it in the global battle to attract inward investment. A local administration would be better able to tackle some of Northern Ireland's deep-seated social problems, such as social exclusion and sectarianism, much more effectively than they could ever be tackled under direct rule. It would in many respects set the seal on the progress that has been made in Northern Ireland in the past 15 years. But&mdash;there is always a &quot;but&quot; in Northern Ireland&mdash;we in the Conservative Party are clear that stable and durable devolution can be restored only if all parties that aspire to join the Government of Northern Ireland play by and observe the same democratic rules. That means supporting the police, the courts and the rule of law unequivocally. We all know that currently only one party&mdash;Sinn Fein&mdash;refuses to do any of these things. This must change.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/6">Support for the police, the courts and the rule of law is a basic requirement of any citizen, let alone of someone who aspires to be a Minister in any democracy. We cannot tolerate a lower standard of conduct in Northern Ireland than we would in any other part of the United Kingdom or, indeed, would be tolerated in the Republic of Ireland. Clause 7 amends the pledge of office to include a reference to upholding the rule of law and supporting policing. We welcome these changes, which closely resemble something that I sought to achieve when the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill was before your Lordships' House and which the Minister rejected. But although the pledge is undoubtedly important, actions on the ground are just as important, if not more so. After all, it was de Valera who, when entering the Dail, justified taking the oath of allegiance by dismissing it as an irrelevance. There must be no question of a repeat of history whereby Sinn Fein Ministers take this new pledge on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-26">26 March</phrase> and subsequently dismiss it as an irrelevance.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/7">Support for the police has to mean encouraging people from republican communities to report crime. It has to mean giving evidence and co-operating with investigations. It has to mean encouraging young republicans to join the PSNI. After all, it is what increasing numbers of people in nationalist parts of Northern Ireland&mdash;places like west Belfast and south Armagh&mdash;are now demanding. They want real policing in their areas, something which I know the PSNI is delivering with increasing acceptance and success&mdash;for which all credit is due. It is about time Sinn Fein caught up.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/8">It does not mean that there cannot be constructive criticism of the police force by Sinn Fein or by other parties for that matter. That is part of living in a free and democratic society in which the police are accountable to those whom they serve, but it does mean accepting that the authority exercised by the PSNI and the Northern Ireland courts is legitimate.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/9">Unfortunately, support for the police and the timing of the Sinn Fein conference or ard fheis is the one element missing from the timetable set out in theSt Andrews agreement. So if we are to move beyond this Friday to the elections on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase> and the eventual devolution of power on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-26">26 March</phrase>, we need to see the Sinn Fein ard fheis take place soon, and take a clear decision in favour of the police. Without wishing to introduce yet another deadline or seeking to tie Her Majesty's Government's hands, I would have thought that progress has to be made by the time the Assembly is dissolved on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase> and the election campaign begins. Given that Christmas comes in between, that is not very far ahead. I certainly cannot see any unionist going into an election on the basis of a Sinn Fein promise or as the prelude to a further round of negotiations. In fact, I cannot see Her Majesty's Government agreeing with that either. If Sinn Fein does not deliver, it would be as well not to have an election at all. It is, after all, supposed to be an electoral endorsement, not an election for more process.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/10">What is the delay? In 2004 in the draft comprehensive agreement, Sinn Fein signed up to an aspirational date for the devolution of policing and justice powers. The draft comprehensive agreement said that the Government anticipated Sinn Fein joining the Policing Board at the point at which legislation to pave the way for the devolution of policing and justice gained Royal Assent. That legislation, the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act, gained Royal Assent in July this year, and noble Lords will recall how insistent the Government were that they needed this legislation before the Summer Recess. Well, we are still waiting for Sinn Fein.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/11">If republicans do what is required of them, I am in doubt that, painful as it will be for many people who have suffered butchery at the hands of the IRA, the DUP would be doing the right thing in entering a power-sharing government. From my conversations with the right honourable Member for North Antrim, Dr Paisley, and other members of the DUP, I believe that is what he and his party will do. But there has to be delivery from Sinn Fein: no more ambiguity, no more conditions and no more promises of action that does not happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.349.0/12">We will give this Bill a fair passage as we understand the significance of it gaining Royal Assent tomorrow in preparation for what might happen on Friday. As we move into Committee there are, as I said earlier, a number of points which I and other noble Lords on these and the Cross Benches will wish to explore. But I trust that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, is left in no doubt of the seriousness with which we approach the policing issue. It must be resolved, and in the way that I have set out today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-22a.353.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100910" speakername="Lord Trimble" colon=":" colnum="353"  time="016:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61122-0003.htm#06112242000189">
	<p pid="a.353.0/1">My Lords, I feel that I approach the Bill in much the same temper as the noble Lord, Lord Smith of Clifton; I have mixed views about it. It contains, as we shall see later in the day, some clauses and provisions that are plain bad. Others are there, I think, largely as window dressing to enable a certain party to try to cover its tracks as it executes a not-very-elegant U-turn. Some of them are quite unnecessary because most of the material in the Bill on ministerial accountability just reflects the practice that occurred under the first Assembly and the provisions of the revised ministerial code which, but for a little embarrassment that I was under at the time, would have been published long before the suspension of the Assembly. However, that is a matter to which I shall return.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/2">While I have mixed feelings about the Bill, its substance is the Belfast agreement and its procedures try to implement that agreement. Consequently, I will adopt, so far as I can, a positive approach towards the Bill and will seek to amend but not oppose it.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/3">The big question is whether it will work. Already some of the portents are not good. The original timetable has slipped; there was to be an absolute deadline at the end of this week, but that has melted away. We have other deadlines, explicit and inferential, in the Bill, but the fact that one has melted away will only encourage those who think that they can drive through the others as well. I suspect that some of the boisterousness&mdash;some of the cockiness, I should say&mdash;that we saw in the other place last night reflects the views of that party&mdash;I refer, of course, to the Democratic Unionist Party&mdash;that it has been successful in defeating one deadline and will be able to deal with another one again.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/4">However, again and again in its contributions last night and in previous weeks and months, that party has declared its present commitment to power sharing, and to power sharing with republicans. It no longer has a principled objection to it; it is simply a matter of when republicans will do what everybody knows republicans must do&mdash;to move on the policing issue&mdash;and then the problem will be solved. This is light years away from the historic position of the Democratic Unionist Party, a position it took until not that long ago. In its movement in recent years, there are matters which will encourage us as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/5">If I am concerned about the timetable, I am even more concerned about the fundamental mistake the Government are making. They are not putting, they are not seen to be putting, and I do not think they are privately putting, any significant pressure on republicans to move. They have been too indulgent of republicans over the past years. That is the reason we have had repeated crises; it is the fundamental reason why the Assembly collapsed just over four years ago; and it is why the prospects are not good now. The noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, drew attention to the need for republicans to move in supporting policing. It is essential not only that they move but that they do so wholeheartedly to indicate their full support for the existing policing arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/6">We must bear in mind what has happened in Northern Ireland in recent years. Put simply, eight years ago a majority of unionists&mdash;a narrow one, admittedly, but a majority&mdash;decided to give republicans a chance. Fairly soon afterwards, they felt that their generous gesture was cast back in their face by the behaviour of republicans and their failure to honour their obligations under the agreement. This culminated not only in the events which led to the suspension of the Assembly, but also to those of December 2004, where we see saw the clearest demonstration of republican involvement in criminality. And what was the Government's response to that? They quite happily opened the door of10 Downing Street a few weeks later to let in the robbers' political leaders for a chat, and they repeatedly declared that the republicans were still an essential part of the process.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/7">That failure by the Government to police and uphold the basic principles of the agreement has produced considerable revulsion among the greater number of people in Northern Ireland, and quite naturally so. They are not in any mood to see republicans back in the centre of things, especially moving towards taking some influence or control over policing. The only thing that will change their mood is if republicans now move on policing and do so in such a way as to completely change the atmosphere. The holding-back by republicans over recent weeks and months of what they know in their hearts is necessary only reinforces the suspicion among most unionists that republicans are not being genuine. They have to move and they have to move quickly. The Government have to do what is necessary to make them move. Their current approach will not work. It is commonplace for commentators to say that deadlines do not work and that republicans do not move under pressure, but the truth of the matter is that republicans move only under pressure. They would never have started decommissioning but for the pressure which we brought to bear on them. They would never have moved even to endorse the Assembly but for the pressure which the Government brought to bear on them back in 1998. I give the Government credit for the pressure that they then brought to bear on republicans, just as I am criticising them for having failed to do that in recent years. So it is essential that republicans move and move quickly. For that to happen, they will have to be put under pressure.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/8">Mr Hain virtually said in another place yesterday that they would have to move by January. That has been echoed here today and amendments to which we shall come this evening would compel them to do so. I very much hope that the House is prepared to accept them.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/9">Other matters in the Bill give us concern. Perhaps our greatest concern is about a last-minute change which was made to the legislation. It virtually ensures that, if something is not done, the election will be a disaster. I shall speak more about that change when we come to it, but, put simply, it will enable the DUP to go around Northern Ireland saying, &quot;You must vote for us or you'll get a Sinn Fein First Minister&quot; and, at the same time, enable republicans to go around Northern Ireland and say to nationalists, &quot;If you vote for us, you will get a republican First Minister&quot;. The product of such a campaign can obviously be seen. It would not have happened but for a clause which slipped into the Bill at the last minute. I have no doubt that it slipped in because it suited both the DUP and Sinn Fein, and possibly because this was the only element of agreement that the Government could see between those two parties and so they grabbed it. However, they should have thought first before grabbing it because its consequences will be grim. As things stand at the moment, we face the prospect of a deadlocked Assembly.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/10">My colleague, the Member for North Down, reminded the Government in another place last night that the Prime Minister made a promise to the people of Northern Ireland on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-06">6 April</phrase>: that, whatever else happened, there would not be another election to a deadlocked Assembly. Despite the fact that it was only in April that that Statement was jointly made by the Prime Minister and Mr Ahern, the Irish Taoiseach, that promise has been broken. The breach of that promise is in this Bill. We should look at that carefully in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/11">One should get an agreement first and then proceed. That should have happened and it should happen now. The truth is that we do not have an agreement. The Minister concluded by saying that it is up to the parties to deliver on their commitments. He was echoing the words of Mr Hain in another place yesterday. What commitments? There was no agreement atSt Andrews. There was an agreement between Mr Blair and Mr Ahern, but who else was party to it? As far as I can see, no one was. I am not aware of any commitment that has been made, certainly not publicly, by the DUP or Sinn Fein, so what commitments are there? I would be delighted if I could be shown to be wrong in this matter because it seems that rather than knowing that there are commitments&mdash;and the Minister referred to a need to know&mdash;the Government are proceeding on optimistic assumptions that are unlikely to be fulfilled in the event. So I am concerned about the next few weeks and months.</p>
	<p pid="a.353.0/12">To end on a slightly more positive note, there are consolations in the present situation. Neither of the principal parties&mdash;Sinn Fein and the DUP&mdash;is seeking any other objectives. The DUP once wanted to smash the agreement and replace it by a new agreement; now it is just tinkering with procedures to give itself face savers but not pursuing any other objective. Republicans are not pursuing any other objective either, as they know that their ambitions, which they pursued by such violent means over the years, cannot be realised and that they have to make do with the political process. They are not going anywhere else. We now have parties which are moving along a road hesitantly&mdash;but both moving along the same road&mdash;which will lead to the implementation of the agreement. I am confident that sooner or later the process is going to work, although as this Bill is currently drafted it will be later rather than sooner.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-22a.360.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100629" speakername="Lord Tebbit" colon=":" colnum="360"  time="016:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61122-0004.htm#06112242000223">
	<p pid="a.360.0/1">My Lords, I shall have some hard words to say about some aspects of government policy. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, will understand that that does not affect my respect for him personally. I only wish that the Secretary of State could answer to this House rather than the unfortunate noble Lord, Lord Rooker, being left to carry the can. It should not be thought that I do not applaud and support what has been achieved to end the bombings and shootings, even if not yet the beatings and robberies, in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/2">I was fascinated to read in the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> that animal behaviourists have discovered that chickens are not as stupid as we thought. It seems that they are not fooled into believing that something has ceased to exist when it is hidden from them. They know that it is still there but simply hidden. That brings me back to the IRA and why I will not in future pay the Government the compliment of calling them bird-brained.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/3">The noble Lord, Lord Smith, reminded us of the amount of fudge that has had to go into persuading both the DUP and IRA/Sinn Fein that their wish lists have been granted, although they were completely and mutually exclusive. Back in the days when I had some experience of industrial relations at grass-roots level, it was always clear to me, when an agreement was drawn up that meant different things to the different parties, that it would be the basis for the next dispute. I fear that that has all too often happened in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/4">Today, we are dealing with a Northern Ireland Bill, but our audience will spread well beyond that Province. We have to accept that this Bill is another stage in the relentless march of Sinn Fein/IRA into power in Northern Ireland&mdash;power which has been won by bombs and bullets because it could not be won by the ballot alone. As this may be&mdash;we hope that it will be&mdash;the last piece of Northern Ireland legislation in this House for a while, I hope that I will be forgiven for speaking for slightly longer than I normally do.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/5">It is deplorable that this legislation should be required to complete all its stages in both Houses in about 36 hours chock to chock. I wonder whether we have forgotten that good old parliamentary adage, &quot;Legislate in haste but repent at leisure&quot;. It was only this morning that I saw the report of the proceedings in another place. I hope that most noble Lords have now had a look at those words. I shall not repeat the wise words of Mr Lembit &Ouml;pik speaking there yesterday. As the Secretary of State had no answer to the points that he raised, I shall not waste the House's time by expecting answers here. He spoke out not just as a parliamentarian but as an Ulsterman, so I suppose it was no surprise that he got the brush-off.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/6">When we read the <I>Hansard</I> report of debates on Northern Ireland in the other place, we forget that, as usual, although Sinn Fein/IRA hold seats in that House, its Members never turn up to participate in the enactment of legislation. I suspect that there is a fairly strong message in that for us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/7">I know that some will be muttering to themselves that my views on Northern Ireland are distorted by what Sinn Fein/IRA did to my wife. I must say that that annoys me. My views were formed long before 1984. What happened then did not distort but merely informed those views, as did the murders of my friends Airey Neave, the Member for Abingdon, the Reverend Robert Bradford, the Member for Belfast South, Tony Berry, the Member for Southgate, Ian Gow, the Member for Eastbourne, and many others from outside the ranks of parliamentarians.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/8">Those who commissioned, authorised, planned and financed those murders and not hundreds but thousands more are now sanitised&mdash;almost sanctified&mdash;and are about to be put into office to govern Her Majesty's subjects in Northern Ireland. This morning the press is expressing its horror at the murder of a politician in Lebanon.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/9">I said that what we say and do here will be heard outside Northern Ireland, and so it will. It will be heard by terrorists worldwide, and there is a lesson that they will learn: if you are dealing with the British Government, bomb and kill, then negotiate. If you do not get what you want, then bomb and kill some more. When you have it almost all, bargain the release of your bombers and killers for a ceasefire. Then threaten more bombing and killing if you do not get even more.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/10">Unlike Alfred the Great's Anglo-Saxons, Tony Blair's new Labour pays Danegeld again and again and, as we have heard today, Sinn Fein/IRA is holding back still. Why is it holding back? If it is going to pledge that it will support the Police Service of Northern Ireland and the forces of justice, why does it not do that now? Why did it not do it yesterday or last week? Why is it pushing the Government along to slide through one deadline after another? I fear that that is because it asked for something more, and I fear that it will get something more.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/11">Today we face not so much IRA terrorism&mdash;one hopes that we will not face that again&mdash;but Islamic terrorism. We rightly ask that imams true to the teachings of Islam condemn the terrorists who invoke the name of Islam to justify bombings and murders. On<phrase class="date" code="2006-11-11">11 November</phrase>&mdash;perhaps a well chosen day&mdash;a newspaper published a picture, which I have here, of Mr Martin McGuinness, who is soon to be a Minister in Northern Ireland if the Government's plans go ahead, wearing his IRA gunman's uniform at the funeral of an IRA bomber. It seems that he has graciously given consent to the publication of this picture now, from which we might draw the inference that he thinks his past is no longer a threat to his future.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/12">I come back to the superior intelligence of chickens. Something at that funeral was hidden from the camera, but it was there all right. It was a Roman Catholic priest conducting the burial service for a terrorist being buried on consecrated ground, having been granted a Christian service and absolution. He should have been excommunicated.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/13">I have no animus towards the Catholic Church or faith&mdash;would that our bishops defended their faith with such courage as the Catholic Church does&mdash;but how do we expect an imam to condemn Islamic terrorists when he sees how Christian priests in a Christian country have sheltered, excused and supported Sinn Fein/IRA terrorists? The Government have done precisely the same.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/14">I was speaking recently to my old friend Robin Chichester-Clark, one time Member for Londonderry, and the last Ulster Unionist to hold office at Westminster, whom a number of noble Lords will have known in the other place. I had the privilege to serve as Robin's PPS, which is how I became drawn into the politics of Northern Ireland well over 30 years ago. &quot;May be&quot;, opined Robin Chichester-Clark, speaking of Her Majesty's Ministers, &quot;they are cleverer than we think. The Labour Party has long been in favour of a united Ireland, but the majority in Northern Ireland would not give its consent. But if you can destroy the grammar schools without the consent of the people, if you can impose a catastrophically unfair system of property taxation on them, if you can impose on them a compulsory place in government for Sinn Fein/IRA murderers, perhaps even the staunchest Orangemen will look over the border to a more successful, lower-tax country, without gunmen in the Cabinet, and wonder what loyalty to the Crown has brought to Northern Ireland&quot;. He might have added: if you can impose on them the sexual orientation orders by which it seems a Christian priest would be at risk if he read out 22:5 of Leviticus or 18:22 of the Book of Deuteronomy.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/15">I have two specific questions about the Bill. First, why does it not put funding for the Northern Ireland parties on the same basis as for the political parties in the rest of the United Kingdom? Why is it so essential that money from dubious sources in north America should be allowed to be recycled through the Republic of Ireland into the politics of part of this kingdom? We do not allow it anywhere else. What is so different?</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/16">Secondly, how will the Secretary of State know whether the pledges to support the police and justice systems, which we expect may be made, are honest? We must have our doubts. I understand thatMr Adams objects to MI5 operating in Northern Ireland. Must he recant on those remarks? Is it a requirement, understood in the pledge which will have to be made, that references to the police include references to MI5, or will a part of Her Majesty's Kingdom be off limits to MI5? Will the Secretary of State require Sinn Fein/IRA not merely to make an airy pledge, but to remove the bar which they currently have in place on witnesses coming forward to help bring to justice the killers of Omagh and the McCartney killers? If they do not remove that barrier, which currently prevents the prosecution of those responsible, what will happen?</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/17">I know&mdash;as the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, put it to me here the other day&mdash;that the people of Northern Ireland now enjoy something nearer to peace and normality than for the past35 years and more. That is important and I know that, in some quarters, peace counts for morethan principle. What is more, peace has brought jobs to Northern Ireland. If devolved government is established there, there will, most importantly, bejobs for politicians. If it is not, then the politiciansin Northern Ireland&mdash;although happily not in Westminster&mdash;will lose their jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/18">Of course we are all in favour of peace, but at what price? Noble Lords in the Government and their right honourable friend the Prime Minister are in favour of peace in Iraq&mdash;which is why, I understand, we made war on that country. I have no doubt of their commitment to peace for the Iraqi people, even if they go about it in a funny sort of way. I accept that Ministers may think that the way in which Airey Neave, had he lived, would have gone about securing peace in Northern Ireland, and the way in which I would have gone about it if I had had responsibility, might be different from this Government's approach. Of course, that would be right.</p>
	<p pid="a.360.0/19">This Bill will underline the truth of the old adage that the road to hell is paved with good intentions. I hope that I am proved wrong.</p>

	<p pid="a.367.0/1">My Lords, I do not know whether I gave a good answer or not, then. Obviously, I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/2">We can have a detailed debate in Committee; we are not limited in that. I fully accept and confirm once again that, if all this collapses&mdash;if there comes a point when it is not worth continuing&mdash;that will be recognised and the plug will be pulled. The Secretary of State made that abundantly clear and if anyone wants confirmation of that, I invite them to read what he said in yesterday's <I>Hansard</I> from the other place at cols. 420-21. I do not need to repeat that. The point is that, if the plug gets pulled on the devolution process, our commitment remains that the parliamentary process for dealing with direct rule in respect of Northern Ireland must change. We fully accept that. It is quite unacceptable as it is. In the period up to March, we have no plans for further change but, if the plug is pulled, we will change the parliamentary process in line with the commitments that we have already given.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/3">Of course it would be better for Sinn Fein&mdash;I say for Sinn Fein&mdash;sooner rather than later to make its position abundantly clear. It is in its interest. It is not for me to lecture to it. It is not helpful to put a date on that. We have set out dates in the Bill: two days' time; <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase> for the dissolution to start the election process; <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase> for the election; <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-14">14 March</phrase> for the appointment of Ministers; and <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-26">26 March</phrase> for the return of devolution and the pledge of office.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/4">I fully accept many of the points made by and certainly would not seek to argue with the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, given his immense experience of being First Minister in Northern Ireland. The process will be watched, it is true. I do not want to get involved in differences between the parties. Many aspects of the Bill have been requested by political parties; that is why the Bill is here in this form. I shall not spell out which parties, but they have all had a finger in the pie. That was made abundantly clear to me by the Secretary of State and was made clear in the other place yesterday.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/5">On the point made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mayhew, we have got to this stage and it is worth trying. This is the final lap. We have made it absolutely clear that if the dates are not met&mdash;the first is two days away and to get that far needs just the indication of a nomination&mdash;we will have to ask ourselves whether it is worth continuing.</p>
	<p pid="a.367.0/6">I interrupted the noble Lord, Lord Laird. I must repeatedly make it clear&mdash;because, to be honest, words that are said get out there into the media and positions are then changed&mdash;that this issue of on-the-runs is not returning. I cannot be clearer than that. We were absolutely clear about that when the legislation was withdrawn. I accept that the Bill was put forward; I am not arguing about that. The position has been made abundantly clear. I cannot get into what other people have said in other countries, because I do not know. I have not discussed this with them. I want to make this absolutely clear so that there is no doubt and no need for amendments on this in Committee; the on-the-runs Bill is not coming back to this Parliament.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-22a.369.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100910" speakername="Lord Trimble" colon=":" colnum="369"  time="016:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61122-0005.htm#06112250000008">
	<p pid="a.369.6/1">I shall be reasonably brief in speaking to Amendment No. 1. It would add two new subsections to the clause relating to the conduct of elections, particularly with regard to the financing of political parties, and refers to the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, which was enacted earlier this year.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.6/2">Section 11 of that Act provides for the disapplication period to end on <phrase class="date" code="">31 October 2007</phrase>. At that time the disapplication of certain rules on donations to political parties which applied to the rest of the United Kingdom but not to Northern Ireland was to end. Certain requirements for declaration and publication did not apply to Northern Ireland for obvious reasons, and the 2006 Act provided that the disapplication of those provisions would end in October next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.6/3">That date was chosen largely because, when the 2006 Act was enacted, it was expected that the next Northern Ireland Assembly election would be in 2008, so Parliament's intention was to allow these requirements to continue for a while but to end the disapplication before the next Assembly election. Under this Bill, the Northern Ireland Assembly election is moved forward to <phrase class="date" code="">7 March 2007</phrase>, and proposed new subsection (4) in the amendment would move forward the end of the disapplication period so that the election on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase> would be fought subject to the same requirements as for the 2008 election anticipated by Parliament. I hope that this aspect of the amendment will be quite uncontroversial. It is entirely in keeping with the spirit of the 2006 Act and it is right that this should be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.6/4">Proposed new subsection (5) is slightly different. It seeks to attack a provision in the 2006 Act whereby new Section 71B was inserted into the Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act 2000. This concerned the extension of categories of permissible donors in relation to Northern Ireland recipients to include, among others, Irish citizens. This destroys any form of regulation. The concept of Irish citizenship is such that it embraces not only all persons who are currently citizens of the Irish Republic but a large slice of the Irish diaspora worldwide. There are thousands, if not millions, of people in the United States who, under the Irish law, are Irish citizens and could therefore contribute. It would not be difficult for Sinn Fein fundraisers to find in the United States persons who would be exempt Irish citizens for the purposes of contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.6/5">The enactment acknowledged that there was a loophole but effectively it has not been closed. This definition of Irish citizenship means that in practical terms we are allowing foreign donations to political parties in Northern Ireland, which is banned for any other part of the United Kingdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.369.6/6">I hope that these two aspects of the amendment will commend themselves to the Minister. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.377.0/1">I will speak to Amendments Nos. 26, 27 and 28. Actually, on second thoughts, I will speak to Amendment No. 28 alone and not to the other two, because it is the crucial amendment in my mind with regard to this Bill and to the Government's proposals for the future. The amendment would add some words to Clause 27 on page 20, subsection (2) of which reads:</p>
	<p pid="a.377.0/2" class="indent">&quot;section 3(1) shall come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">26 January 2007</phrase>&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.377.0/3">Clause 3(1) provides for the Assembly election to be held on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase>. My amendment proposes that the crucial part of the Clause 27 would state that,</p>
	<p pid="a.377.0/4" class="indent">&quot;section 3(1) shall come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">26 January 2007</phrase> if all the parties that would be entitled to nominate ministers under section 18 of the 1998 Act, if it were to be applied on that date, have publicly indicated an intention to comply forthwith with all aspects of section 7(2)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.377.0/5">Clause 7(2) contains paragraph 6 of the St Andrews agreement, which was read to us by the Minister during his introductory speech, requiring people to endorse the essential elements of support for law that were set out in the agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.377.0/6">I do not want to get into an argument about the effectiveness of that paragraph, because it encapsulates the issue. One might quarrel here and there with the use of words, but that is not important; the crucial matter is that the paragraph in Clause 7(2) involves a pledge of support for policing and the institutions. My amendment, if it were carried, would ensure that that pledge would have to be given or that the parties would have to indicate publicly that they would comply forthwith with all aspects of that by <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-26">26 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.377.0/7">That is not very different from what Mr Secretary Hain said yesterday&mdash;that, as regards the timetable, if there is no movement by republicans on this issue in January, the wheels will come off the wagon. It may be that in such a situation, the Secretary of State would use his discretionary power to stop the process. But doing so would be a huge act and there would be great pressure on the Secretary of State not to make an order to abort the process. I am quite sure thatthe tendency in that situation would be for republicans to make some encouraging noises and for the Government to grasp at straws to avoid doing something deeply controversial. I have seen it happen previously; we all have.</p>
	<p pid="a.377.0/8">It would be much better for the legislation clearly to state that a declaration of intention to support the police would have to be made in January so that things could move smoothly. I would be delightedat that. There would be a much better chance ofthat happening if my amendment was included. Experience shows that if you want the republicans to move, you must make it absolutely clear to them that they have to move. If they do not have to move and if they think that they have internal problems, they will favour their own problems, rather than the public interest. They have done that again and again.</p>
	<p pid="a.377.0/9">We need to set a clear framework; this amendment would do that. I mean what I said at the outset: it is crucial to the success of the Government's plans. I hope that they will have the good sense to adopt the amendment. I am not sure of the correct procedure at this stage, but it would be my intention to test the opinion of the Committee if the opportunity arose. I say that in the hope that the Minister accepts the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.378.0/1">I support the principle of the noble Lord's amendment and I think that the Government are nearly there already, given what was said last night and on other occasions. As I understand it&mdash;although I may have got it all wrong, considering our rush&mdash;the principle is that the deal should be settled before an election is declared by the Secretary of State on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>. I thought that the Government stated last night that it would be wrong to go call an election on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase> until they were confident that everyone was signed up to the deal and was committed, as the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, has asked.</p>

	<p pid="a.378.1/1">I will address Amendment No. 28 in some detail, but will first speak to the points made by the noble Baroness regarding Clause 3 and the date. It is true that the position was, when we were considering the other Bill in the summer, to have the Assembly up and running on Friday of this week. It did not make sense to do that and then hold the election in 2007. That is why there was a delay. We wanted a gap. We wanted people to be able to get the Assembly up and running and start governing Northern Ireland without, in this case, facing an election in a few months. Therefore, we put off the date until 2008.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/2">This timetable is slightly different but the objectives are the same. Obviously we have hadSt Andrews in the mean time, so the timetable is configured slightly differently. We end up with a fresh election to a new Assembly and with a fresh mandate for the parties based on whatever they put forward in their manifestos. It then makes sense to let that Assembly run its full course for four years so that the Members are not starting next year and then having to fight an election within a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/3">That is why Clause 3 is there. It is not, as the noble Baroness said&mdash;I thought a bit unkindly&mdash;a case of the Government interfering with the electoral process. We have just taken a practical view of how politicians would operate if they got back and were faced with an early election. They would have to work with each other and then go out and fight each other almost straight away, which would not make much sense. That is why Clause 3 provides for the date for the next election to be <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-07">7 March</phrase>. Obviously, for that to take place, the Assembly that was elected on <phrase class="date" code="2003-11-26">26 November 2003</phrase> needs to be dissolved on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/4">Clause 3(2) and (3) disapply Article 7 of the Northern Ireland Assembly (Elections) Order 2001, which requires the chief electoral officer to call a by-election to fill a vacant seat in the Assembly. This disapplication is in respect of any vacancy which exists between the passing of this Bill and the date of the Assembly election, whether the vacancy arose before or after the passing of the Act. I think that that is quite practical within the time span that we are dealing with.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/5">Clause 17, which was also spoken to by the noble Baroness, allows the Assembly and, by virtue of paragraph 9(6) of Schedule 1 to the Bill, the transitional Assembly to make standing orders to make provision in respect of the right to vote in the Assembly in cases where a seat has been vacated but not filled. That is the purpose of those two clauses.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/6">Amendments Nos. 26 and 27, which I shall deal with on their own before I come to AmendmentNo. 28, would remove the urgency procedure for orders made by the Secretary of State relating to consequential provisions under Clause 23. Clause 23 allows the Secretary of State to make orders in relation to matters arising as a result of things done under the Bill. It is intended that it will be used to sweep up any consequential or unforeseen matters relating to, in particular, the repeal of the 2000 Act, the postponement of the elections and the dissolution of the Assembly. In short, we are referring to a technical supplemental provision. The power is not wide enough to permit substantial policy changes to take place. I hope that noble Lords will be reassured on that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/7">As the power is designed to sweep up any consequential or, indeed, unforeseen matters, it would be prudent to allow for the urgency procedure to be put in place where exceptional circumstances require it. I agree that it is better for the orders to be fully debated in Parliament before they become law and, in ordinary circumstances, they would be, but I reiterate that the provisions in subsections (4) and (5) are to cover exceptional circumstances in the same way as is already provided for in the 1990 Act. Therefore, I hope that those amendments will not be pressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/8">The noble Lord, Lord Trimble, has already given notice that he will probably wish to test the view of the House on Amendment No. 28, unless I can accept it. I do not think that I can but I shall seek to explain why in some detail. It is an important issue to the parties and it was the subject of some debate in the other place yesterday. As the noble Lord said, the amendment would place a requirement on the political parties to indicate their support for paragraph 6 of the St Andrews agreement, which will be inserted at the end of the pledge of office set out in Schedule 4 to the 1998 Act by virtue of Clause 7(2) of this Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/9">Paragraph 6 of the agreement, which I read out, makes it clear that support for law and order includes endorsing the policing and criminal justice institutions and actively encouraging everyone in the community to co-operate fully with the police in tackling crime. Paragraph 6 is therefore a key aspect of the St Andrews agreement and one that all parties must sign up to before the institutions can be restored.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/10">All Ministers must affirm the pledge of office before taking up office, and the amendment to the pledge, provided for in Clause 7 includes support for policing and the courts, as set out in paragraph 6 of the agreement.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/11">The noble Lord's amendment&mdash;AmendmentNo. 28&mdash;would make the March election conditional on all parties &quot;publicly indicating&quot; their intention to comply with paragraph 6. While I agree with the noble Lord that it would be desirable for all parties to subscribe unconditionally to the principles laid down in paragraph 6 as early as possible, we do not believe that specifying this explicitly in the Bill as a condition for an election will help in achieving that. I reiterate that the Government would like all parties to endorse paragraph 6 of the agreement as early as possible. While we would not wish to be advising other parties on electoral strategy&mdash;that is the last thing I am in a position to have them do&mdash;it would be an odd situation if a party such as Sinn Fein had not indicated its position to the electorate on such a crucial matter as policing before the election itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/12">In the other place yesterday, the shadow Secretary of State for Northern Ireland put it succinctly when he said that,</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/13" class="indent">&quot;it seems that if the transitional Assembly is to be dissolved on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-30">30 January</phrase>, and if parties are then to go to the electorate and ask people to vote for their candidates, there must, by then, be certainty about Sinn Fein endorsing policing. In practice, it will be very difficult to persuade voters to support at the ballot box a package based on St. Andrews in the absence of such a commitment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/14">He went on to say that,</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/15" class="indent">&quot;to seek election on the basis of a 'perhaps' or a conditional promise is asking a lot. The electoral process will start to impose its own pressures on the timetable&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 21/11/06; col. 429.]</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/16">I hope it will satisfy the noble Lord that events themselves will force Sinn Fein to indicate its position on policing, and that he will agree that there is no need to press the amendment. If the noble Lord is concerned that some parties may simply be seeking to force an election without being serious about forming an Executive&mdash;that is the implication, and I fully accept that possibility&mdash;I point him to Clause 2(1) of the Bill, which provides for the Secretary of State to postpone elections indefinitely and dissolve the Assembly if at any time he considers that the parties will not form an Executive. The Secretary of State has made it abundantly clear that he does not want to do that, but he will do it. If we do not get devolution, we will get dissolution. It is as simple as that.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/17">Also, Clause 2(4) provides for dissolution and the postponement of elections automatically if Ministers do not take office on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-26">26 March</phrase>. To that extent, I fully accept that the original legislation was about taking office and getting the Assembly by midnight this week. The same procedure will apply on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-26">26 March</phrase>. It will be automatic that we will not proceed, and there will be dissolution and postponement of elections.</p>
	<p pid="a.378.1/18">We hope that all parties will endorse paragraph 6 of the agreement as soon as possible&mdash;the sooner, the better; that goes without saying. They will have to do it in the end. If they want the Assembly back, we all know what has to be done. On the other hand, we must let them do it in their own way. They know the timetable. I hope Parliament will pass this legislation, but the parties have to endorse the agreement if they want the Assembly back. That is quite clear; there can be no fudge. It will not help if the amendment is pressed today. The noble Lord is free to do so, but I ask him not to do it.</p>

	<p pid="a.384.0/1">I hope I will be able to deal with the points raised. I shall deal first with AmendmentsNos. 2 and 29. I am happy to deal with the generality of Clause 5 as well. Amendments Nos. 2 and 29 relate, as the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, said, to the ministerial code under Clause 5 and the draft ministerial code provided for under paragraph 4 of Schedule 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/2">Amendment No. 2 seeks to remove subsection (10) of new Section 28A of the 1998 Act, which is inserted by Clause 5. Subsection (10) provides that a Minister or junior Minister does not have ministerial authority,</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/3" class="indent">&quot;to take any decision in contravention of a provision of the Ministerial Code made under subsection (5)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/4">That is, where the ministerial decision in question relates to a matter which should fall to the Executive Committee for consideration and agreement by virtue of Section 20(3) and (4) of the 1998 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/5">Clause 5 makes provision for a statutory ministerial code to be in place to safeguard appropriate ministerial accountability to the Executive. New Section 28A(10) makes it very clear that a Minister has no authority to flout the duty he or she is under to refer matters which are for the Executive Committee. Of course, in some cases, where the duty is breached, the Executive Committee might, nevertheless, choose retrospectively to ratify a decision or to re-take it. But that would be a matter for the Executive Committee. We are satisfied that subsection (10) is appropriate and does not in any way hamper ministerial autonomy when exercised in a proper fashion.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/6">I turn to Amendment No. 29. As drafted, paragraph 4 of Schedule 1 places a duty on the Secretary of State to impose a draft ministerial code in the event that the transitional Assembly is unable to approve a draft code before <phrase class="date" code="">24 March 2007</phrase>. The Bill provides that the basis for the Secretary of State's code must, as far as practicable, be in the form of any parts of the draft ministerial code that havebeen approved by the transitional Assembly before<phrase class="date" code="">24 March 2007</phrase>; or otherwise in the form of the former ministerial code approved by the Executive and that applied to members of the Executive prior to the most recent suspension.</p>
	<p pid="a.384.0/7">Noble Lords will be aware that, as we have been informed by the noble Lord, prior to the suspension of the Executive and the Assembly, the former ministerial code was undergoing a review process and a revised version had been drafted by officials, although not agreed by the Executive. Amendment No. 29, in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, would amend the definition of a former ministerial code on which the Secretary of State must base his code to mean a revised draft code drafted prior to suspension, but which had not been considered or agreed by the Executive, and had not therefore applied to members of the Executive&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-22a.385.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="385"  time="019:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61122-0007.htm#06112250000090">
	<p pid="a.385.3/1">I fully accept that and I am grateful for the elucidation because I do not think that there is a conflict between us. In spirit, there was a revised draft&mdash;clearly, the noble Lord was there and he and his colleagues were operating it. It had not been formally approved. Thank heavens I am not a lawyer, but I suppose that because it had not been approved, if there were any judicial review or anything like that, that may have been a problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.3/2">Before I say anything further, because I do not think that there is a conflict between us, it is the sincere hope of the Government and the Secretary of State that the duty to impose a draft code will never be triggered anyway. We want the transitional Assembly. Parties have engaged in much valuable work over the summer, by the way. It is not as though they have not been talking to each other. They have been involved in the Preparation of Government Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.3/3">I hope that noble Lords share my hope that that engagement will continue in the transitional Assembly from Friday this week and that it will agree its own code before <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase>, negating the need for the Secretary of State to impose the code. But if it comes to that, notwithstanding what the noble Lord has just said, the only code that the Secretary of State should reasonably use as a model on which to base his code is the one agreed, applied and in legal being before suspension&mdash;although versions of that were applied in spirit, if not formally agreed.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.3/4">I take on board what the noble Lord said. The Executive were doing their best to operate a new system under a new code, but it had not been legally promulgated. The Secretary of State could probably find himself in trouble if he went for a code that had not gone through that process. That is what we are seeking to cover, so that we are not in the courts. I understand that judicial review is frequently used in Northern Ireland. That is why I ask the Committee not to accept the amendment, although I fully accept the spirit of it and what the noble Lord said, which was important.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.3/5">I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Morrow, on his maiden speech this week. I am sorry that I was not present. I sincerely hope that he will make good use of this place. He asked about the status of the ministerial decision. First, a decision taken in contravention of the code, and therefore without ministerial authority under new Section 28A, would expose that Minister to existing procedures under the 1998 Act. Secondly, the noble Lord is right that any ministerial decision taken without ministerial authority is open to legal challenge. That is the formal legal position.</p>
	<p pid="a.385.3/6">There will be a duty on the transitional Assembly&mdash;we sincerely hope there will be an Assembly after Thursday&mdash;to prepare and approve its own draft code before <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase>, as I said. It is our wish that it does so. It would be open to the Assembly to prepare and agree a code in the form of the code that the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, said was operated by the Executive although not formally agreed by them. That is completely within the gift of the transitional Assembly. We do not seek to impose one on it. That is the whole point of this. We want these decisions to be taken by locally elected politicians in Northern Ireland. They should come forward with their code, and if that code is based on the shadow code that has been formally operated, that is entirely up to the transitional Assembly. That is its choice. It must do so, however, before the said date: <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase>.</p>

	<p pid="a.401.2/1">I will be speaking to Amendments Nos. 9 and 11 in the group. Amendment No. 9 places a statutory duty on the review committee to look at community designations.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.2/2">Liberal Democrats have always been opposed to the use of designations within the Assembly. It has been clear from the beginning that there are problems with this system. It institutionalises sectarian divisions, there is inequality of votes between MLAs, it is unable to adjust to changing demographic and political circumstances, and it enables minorities to hold the process to ransom.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.2/3">Problems with designation and the voting system were brought into clear focus by the attempt to elect a First Minister and a Deputy First Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2001-11-02">Friday 2 November 2001</phrase>, when 70.6 per cent of the 102 who voted supported the election of David Trimble, as he then was, and the honourable Member for Foyle to the top two posts. This comprised 38 designated nationalists&mdash;100 per cent; 29 designated unionists&mdash;49.2 per cent; and five designated others. On the following <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-06">Tuesday, 6 November</phrase>, 70.7 per cent of the 99 who voted supported the election of David Trimble and Mark Durkan to the top two posts. This comprised38 designated nationalists&mdash;100 per cent; 31 designated unionists&mdash;51.7 per cent; and one designated other. The only substantive difference between the votes on<phrase class="date" code="2006-11-02">2 November</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-06">6 November</phrase> was that three alliance MLAs temporarily&mdash;and tactically&mdash;changed their designation in line with the rules from centre&mdash;treated as &quot;others&quot;&mdash;to unionist. In virtually every other legislative body in the world, a 70 per cent vote would be more than sufficient to elect a prime minister or form a government; but not in Northern Ireland. There is something seriously wrong with a system whereby MLAs cannot elect a First Minister and Deputy First Minister, even though more than 70 per cent of Assembly Members supported them.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.2/4">The difficulty is more fundamental than that and extends to the heart of the designation system, which requires Assembly Members to designate themselves as unionists, nationalists or other. Although this was proposed as a way to ensure cross-community consent, it actually contributes to reinforcing sectarian divisions. Right from the top down, the message is given that Northern Ireland society is rigidly divided into two separate communities and that people can be neatly pigeonholed into separate categories. Designations imply that that society is for ever to be two separate communities, requiring continual skilful conflict management, rather than becoming a united&mdash;although diverse&mdash;community with common goals and shared interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.2/5">That &quot;two communities&quot; or &quot;both communities&quot; language fails to acknowledge that a significant number of people cannot be labelled as unionist or nationalist, Protestant or Catholic. Some people come from mixed marriages, are part of ethnic minorities or choose not to be described in such terms, preferring more multicultural and pluralist identification. That also ignores the reality that many Protestants and Catholics and unionists and nationalists have more in common with people across the perceived divide than they do with each other.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.2/6">Similarly, the insistence on a two-communities language and approach presumes that the ideal state of Northern Ireland society is of two separate but equal elements, each working to its own interests, rather than that of one united, multicultural community working towards common goals and interests. The current system discriminates against those Assembly Members who do not choose to designate as either unionist or nationalist, and the voters who put them there.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.2/7">Under the present system, on key cross-community votes in the Assembly, the votes of those representing cross-community parties designated as &quot;others&quot; either do not count or carry less weight. All MLAs have one vote, but some votes, it would appear, are more equal than others. Votes from the centre can countonly negatively in the system of 50:50:50&mdash;parallel consent. At first glance, it would seem that they count in the 60:40:40 method, as they are counted in the60 per cent overall, but the votes of designated unionists and designated nationalists are counted twice, as they are considered for the respective 40 per cent threshold, as well as the 60 per cent threshold overall.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.2/8">It is in the interest of a stable future in Northern Ireland to move away from such a divisive system. Amendment No. 9 requires the review committee to consider the issue of community designation, but does not ask the committee take any particular view. New Clause 1 is, perhaps, a more radical approach, but a better long-term solution to the problem, because it changes the definition of cross-community support to a simple two-thirds of Assembly Members present and voting. Given the strength of the unionist and nationalist designations in the previous Assembly, and in the current one, it is entirely reasonable to expect that a vote passed by two-thirds of the Members would have a cross-community element.</p>
	<p pid="a.401.2/9">We believe that to be a fairer way to proceed with votes on key issues than the current, rather divisive, arrangements. I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-22a.409.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100910" speakername="Lord Trimble" colon=":" colnum="409"  time="021:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61122-0010.htm#06112256000056">
	<p pid="a.409.2/1">We wish to oppose the Question whether Clause 18 should stand part of the Bill, because I want to make it clear that we view it with considerable trepidation. The devolution of justice and policing matters has to be treated very sensitively. I remember many years ago Seamus Mallon, who was then Deputy First Minister, saying in another place that this could be contemplated only when it could be shown that the Assembly and its Executive were stable and robust. Parachuting in this issue when the Assembly is not stable and robust would be a recipe for disaster. It is a matter which we in our discussions with government and other parties over the years treated with considerable caution. We were careful to avoid making commitments of the kind which Clause 18 imposes and which flow from the St Andrews agreement, presumably reflecting the discussions which took place between the parties there.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.2/2">I have heard a number of members of the DUP in recent days and weeks make it clear that those individuals do not envisage an early devolution of policing and justice matters, but, none the less, this clause comes out of the negotiation in which they were engaged and for which the Government believe they expressed broad support. They now have the opportunity to clarify that matter. I am concerned that they have already moved to the stage of discussions on devolution of policing and justice, which the St Andrews agreement states have progressed. They are moving towards agreeing a date and creating a process, whereas I had always taken great care not to commit to any date or process. In paragraph 7 of the St Andrews agreement, which is embodied in Clause 18, the Government state that,</p>
	<p pid="a.409.2/3" class="indent">&quot;implementation of the agreement published today should be sufficient to build the community confidence necessary&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.2/4">That implementation flows just down to March this year. Are the Government putting on record their view that, once the St Andrews timetable is implemented&mdash;immediately after <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-27">27 March</phrase>&mdash;that is sufficient to build the necessary community confidence? If so, that is a huge shift in their position and one of grave disadvantage to the unionist position.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.2/5">The matter should be raised, and for that reason I indicated an intention to oppose stand part. However, in view of the hour and the fact that some people have voted in favour of their stomachs, if not yet their sleep, I shall not press this beyond making those comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.2/6">I shall touch briefly on Amendment No. 17, which is in my name. We have discussed the issue many times here and in another place over the years, and have put on record our firm and unaltered opposition to discrimination in employment. It has always amazed me that this Government, who have embodied the European convention in domestic law and are proud of their commitment to human rights, turn out to have no real commitment to rights as such, because the first time that it becomes convenient to ditch rights they do so. They are constantly hinting at doing so in other fields as well. It amazes me that a Government who sometimes talk about commitments to human rights turn out to have merely a skin-deep commitment to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.2/7">We have always opposed the procedure. Over the years, we have managed to achieve a position in which it was said&mdash;only said, of course&mdash;that the next renewal was envisaged as the last, and that it would not be continued after that. My colleague the noble Lord, Lord Maginnis of Drumglass, said when we discussed this earlier that it was always envisaged in Patten&mdash;the provision flowed from Patten&mdash;that it would operate until such point as the percentage of Roman Catholics in the police force had got to 22 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.409.2/8">It astonishes me that the Democratic Unionist Party, which in the past was opposed to discrimination, now trumpets as one of its achievements that it has abandoned opposition to discriminatory employment, and that it supports its continuation until the percentage of Catholics in the police force reaches 30 per cent, which may run beyond the period for which it is envisaged that the provision will go. The DUP has actually agreed to an extension beyond the point originally envisaged. That is presented as a great thing, but I fear not.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-22a.414.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="414"  time="021:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61122-0010.htm#06112257000018">
	<p pid="a.414.0/1">I will take advice on this; there will be time because I have only just stood up. The Policing Board has issued a press release. My response to it is:</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/2" class="indent">&quot;The draft legislation&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/3">that is this Bill&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/4" class="indent">&quot;provides that the decision to reconstitute a district policing partnership is a matter for the Policing Board&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/5">I will get more chapter and verse on that as I am going through. If not, I will certainly write to noble Lords. It is a sensitive issue, for the reasons explained. I fully understand that. I am in no way diminishing what has gone on with people who have wanted to help their community by supporting the police and by being part of the district policing partnerships. As the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, said, they have been a success, having not initially been fully in favour.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/6">I will take the broad brush of Clause 18. I hope that I can allay the obvious fears of the noble Lord, Lord Trimble. The clause places an obligation on the Assembly to provide a report to the Secretary of State before <phrase class="date" code="">27 March 2008</phrase> on its consideration of policing and justice. The report is to address the preparations that the Assembly has made and intends to make for the devolution of such matters, which matters the Assembly is likely to seek to have devolved, and whether a request is likely to be made before <phrase class="date" code="">1 May 2008</phrase> that responsibility for such matters should be devolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/7">The clause also amends Section 4(2A) and (6) and Section 21A(8) of the Northern Ireland Act 1998, all inserted by the Northern Ireland (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006. All three subsections refer to a</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/8" class="indent">&quot;devolved policing and justice matter&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/9">However, while these are matters that the Government are committed to devolving when circumstances are right, they are currently reserved. The clause removes the adjective &quot;devolved&quot; in this context in order to clarify the position.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/10">The clause does not affect any of the safeguards on the transfer of responsibility. It remains the case that the First Minister and Deputy First Minister, acting jointly, must table a Motion for a resolution of the Assembly that policing and justice matters be devolved; the Assembly must resolve that issue with cross-community support; the Secretary of State must concur and lay a draft order before Parliament; and both Houses of Parliament must approve that order. That is a quadruple lock on the devolution of policing and justice matters. None of that is affected in any way, shape or form by Clause 18.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/11">Turning to the specific amendments that were spoken to, Amendment No. 18, relates to the temporary provisions for police recruitment. I know that noble Lords who have spoken and many others harbour principled misgivings about this measure, and that has been raised in the House in recent times. But the misgivings were there when the Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland, led by Chris Patten, now the noble Lord, Lord Patten, made its report. It reflected the agreed principle of the Belfast agreement that the police service should be representative of the society that it polices.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/12">The report highlighted the imbalance between the number of Catholics and Protestants as &quot;the most striking problem&quot; in the composition of the police, above issues of gender and ethnic minority representation, which the commission acknowledged were important. The report recommended recruitment of Protestants and Catholics on an equal basis as an exceptional measure, because no one knew what would happen, to try to provide a more representative police service within a reasonable timeframe.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/13">An astonishing 70,000 applications have been received from across the whole community since those provisions were introduced, clearly from a new generation of young men and women who are determined to devote their lives to policing. In only five years, because of the 50:50 temporary provisions, Catholic composition among regular officers has risen from 8.3 per cent to 20.79 per cent. In the same time frame, female composition has also risen from13 per cent to 20.8 per cent. This is undoubtedly a success story by any stretch of the imagination, in terms of both Catholic and female representation in the police service, and it is one of the most significant reasons why public confidence in policing is increasing across most of the community.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/14">I had personal experience of that when I went out with my drivers, if I may call them that, because they were more than that, as colleagues will know. When I have visited certain locations to have a chat with the police on the beat, more often than not I have happened to deal with female officers. That may be a coincidence, but nevertheless, there is a large number of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/15">We believe that temporary measures are justified to correct an acute historical imbalance in the composition of the Police Service of Northern Ireland. I emphasise &quot;temporary measures&quot;. We have also said, both in this House and another place, that they will not stay in place a day longer than is necessary and that is reinforced in annex B of theSt Andrews agreement. Government policy is firmly committed to achieving a progressive increase in Catholic representation in the police service. Our objective is and has always been to reach 30 per cent representation of Catholics as regular police officers by 2010-11.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/16">These temporary provisions are subject to a triennial review and will expire unless specifically renewed by an order, subject to the draft affirmative procedure. The temporary provisions are currently due to expire on <phrase class="date" code="">28 March 2007</phrase> and the basis for a further review is currently the subject of consultation. The Government intend to introduce a further renewal order to commence with effect from <phrase class="date" code="">29 March 2007</phrase>. This order will be subject to detailed debate in both this House and another place. Therefore, we want to continue with this until we hit the 30 per cent target. If we can do so within the time-frame, that will be excellent. At that point, it will stop because the objective will have been achieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/17">I reiterate that these are purely temporary measures. They do not tear up fair jobs and equality agreements. They are designed for a specific purpose out of a specific commission report and, what is more, they are working: the numbers are changing dramatically, as I have explained to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/18">The Government do not support the inclusion of the new clause proposed in Amendment No. 18. A key element of the Patten recommendations was the importance of accountability and, in particular, local accountability. This vital link has been forged by putting structures in place whereby the district policing partnerships are in line with both the PSNI's district command units and district councils. The Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000 gives effect to these structures, requiring the district policing partnerships to have the same boundaries as the PSNI's district command units and district councils. However, the implementation of the Review of Public Administration will have an impact on policing structures. The Police Service of Northern Ireland is currently developing these new structures and the Policing Board is still considering the post-RPA structures for DPPs. That&mdash;if I can say it in English&mdash;takes account of the decision of direct rule Ministers, which the Assembly will get a grip on, to reduce the number of district councils from 26 to seven. The police agree with that: they want to change their boundaries as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/19">We want to ensure that any changes to the current district policing partnerships structures as a resultof the implementation of the Review of Public Administration do not weaken local accountability and links to local communities. We want those to continue. We will carry on working with the Policing Board in the development of the post-RPA structures for DPPs to ensure that their proposals reflect Patten's vision of both strong local accountability and links to the local community.</p>
	<p pid="a.414.0/20">The Government do not support AmendmentNo. 30, as it would prolong the period of the review of each district policing partnership. The Government seek to have the Northern Ireland Policing Board undertake the review of each DPP as quickly as possible, as this is the first step in the process of reconstituting affected DPPs. Furthermore, we do not support Amendments Nos. 31, 32 and 35, which are consequential to it.</p>
