	<p pid="a.1086.2/1">My Lords, I am a little surprised at the question. The document was published, I think, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-23">23 March</phrase>, the consultation finished last week, and we are still in the first Session of this Parliament. We shall assess the consultations on this quite substantive document. There is a real problem around the coast, with there being so many different laws and agencies, and it depends on how far you are out from the coast. Different rules and regulations apply all over the place&mdash;high water, low water, mean water, harbour limits, and at three, six, 12 and 200 nautical miles. We need to get this sorted out, and we need to do it properly through consultation. So far, I think we have made quite good progress in the first Session of this Parliament.</p>

	<p pid="a.1092.8/1">My Lords, we are unaware of the basis for the figure of 5,000 cases quoted by the <i>Daily Mail</i> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-20">20 June</phrase>. Following the ombudsman's 2003 report, the NHS undertook a review of 12,000 cases back to 1996. In about 1,800 cases, the decision not to award NHS funding is known to be incorrect, as at July 2004. Some appeals remain with the ombudsman's office. To date, the NHS has paid restitution totalling &pound;180 million and has improved its processes as a result of the review.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-27a.1101.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100634" speakername="Lord Thomas of Gresford" colon=":" colnum="1101"  time="015:38:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60627-05.htm#60627-05_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.1101.0/1">My Lords, we welcome the Statement from the Government and congratulate the chief inspector, Mr Wooler, on the comprehensive nature of his report within the constraints set on him. It was particularly helpful that he was able, with the assistance of Professor Sally Lloyd-Bostock and Dr Cheryl Thomas, to interview the members of the jury. I also welcome the Government's acceptance of the substance of the 11 recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/2">Some matters of importance in the ongoing debate on complex and lengthy trials were comprehensively illuminated. There were six counts. The fundamental flaw in the proceedings was count 2: conspiracy to defraud. The report states at paragraph 11.95 that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/3" class="indent">&quot;count 1 was dealt with relatively expeditiously by both sides, and the evidence on the conspiracy to corrupt charges counts 3-6 was largely agreed by the defence making the admissions&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/4">that the Crown sought.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/5">The flawed decision was to bring an essentially vague charge of common law conspiracy to defraud in count 2 on the basis that the wrongful possession of commercially sensitive information by the defendants damaged the economic interests of London Underground Ltd. The decision was taken initially by the British Transport Police. However, although prosecuting counsel was initially ambivalent about continuing with the charge, as the report tells us, nevertheless he proceeded. As is the risk with the charge of common law conspiracy to defraud&mdash;as the report points out in paragraph 8(iii) of the executive summary&mdash;as the case progressed the Crown shifted its ground. The summary states that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/6" class="indent">&quot;there were a number of changes in the way the Crown stated its position, in particular on what they accepted that they had to prove&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/7">In its final formulation, says the inspector:</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/8" class="indent">&quot;It was inevitable that this would involve much detailed and repetitive examination of routine financial documents with witnesses&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/9">In the debates on the Fraud Bill both the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and I pointed out the fundamental weakness of common law conspiracy, which the Law Commission has recommended be abolished. Perhaps the noble and learned Lord will forgive me if I remind him of what I said on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-19">19 July</phrase> last year:</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/10" class="indent">&quot;To retain the broad common law offence of conspiracy to defraud is to leave things in the worst possible state. At times I have tried unsuccessfully to limit the scope of a conspiracy offence to the opening of prosecuting counsel, but I have not necessarily been successful in that effort. In one particular case I consider the ground had shifted over the course of a four-month trial, and that at the end I was being accused of something I was not being accused of at the beginning. That is the sort of problem which can be derived from the common law offence&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 19/7/05; col. 1442.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/11">I had no knowledge then that the Jubilee Line case was a prime example of the Crown shifting its ground in the course of the trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/12">The prosecution sought to blame the defence for the trial becoming unmanageable as carrying out a &quot;war of attrition&quot;. That is the sort of criticism that one frequently hears made against defence lawyers in all sorts of cases. However, it was not the defence who were responsible for the,</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/13" class="indent">&quot;slow and disjointed nature of the proceedings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/14">The inspector says in terms in paragraph 11.94 that the prosecution had an almost reflex reaction to what the defence was saying, so that it had a real reluctance to look at the merits of whatever the defence might say. As a result, there was a high degree of tension between the prosecution and the defence teams. But so far as the defence teams were concerned, the report concludes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/15" class="indent">&quot;There was no deliberate time-wasting, prolixity or unjustifiable obstructiveness as is hinted at in the phrase 'war of attrition'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/16">The responsibility for this trial failing is placed fairly and squarely upon the prosecution and there is no significant criticism of the defence in the report. The report finds that the jury discharged its duties in a thorough and comprehensive manner. The inspector says that it appeared months later that collectively the jury had a good grip of the evidence and the issues. There remained with it, he said, a real commitment to see through its period of public service. So the jury bears no responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/17">It is disappointing that, in the face of those conclusions, the noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General told us that he took a different view on juries in long, complex fraud trials. That is not surprising. The Government persist in trying to undermine the structure of the criminal justice system. Not only do the Prime Minister and the Home Secretary attack judges directly for their decisions, which they do not appear ever to have read, but the Attorney General also seeks to limit the role of the one institution, the jury, that commands public confidence as a protector of our liberties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/18">I have a number of questions. Why in 1997&mdash;a significant date&mdash;was the Fraud Investigation Group, set up originally as part of the CPS, wound down and assimilated in central case work, and the authority to sign transfers of cases to the Crown Court devolved to grade six lawyers? Why did a culture develop in the succeeding years within the CPS which allowed a lack of engagement with and responsibility for prosecutions at levels above that of the case lawyer? This trial had been running for nearly two years before the DPP became involved and started to oversee what was going wrong with it. Is it not a disgrace that the report concludes:</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/19" class="indent">&quot;The other notable feature of the period spanned by the case, 1997-2005, is the persistent lack of clarity in relation to where responsibility for decision making lay, and consequently accountability&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.1101.0/20">When will the new fraud prosecution service be fully operational, because it is not yet, and what will its relationship be with the Serious Fraud office? The report says that re-establishing the CPS capacity to handle substantial fraud cases will require significant investment. What does the Treasury say about that? Perhaps the &pound;25 million wasted on these proceedings might have funded the necessary reforms.</p>

	<p pid="a.1157.7/1">My Lords, may I say in my maiden speech, and as I come from the perhaps more adversarial reaches of the Scots Bar, what a pleasure it has been to experience the warmth of the welcome that one receives in this House? I take the opportunity to note the helpfulness and courtesy that I have received from the officials and staff in this House. This has made the translation from the Scottish courts to Advocate-General for Scotland far easier than I had anticipated. In presenting an order that deals with a natural force that flows majestically from Scotland to England, may I say immediately that I intend no metaphor for the office of Advocate-General for Scotland?</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.7/2">Salmon and freshwater fisheries are an important commercial and recreational asset, and it is important that the legislation dealing with them should be clear and effective. It may be helpful to your Lordships if I briefly set out the background to this order. It is sensible, and has long been the practice, for legislation dealing with salmon and freshwater fishery matters to set up a general framework and to enable discrete provision to be made within that framework for the particular circumstances of particular rivers. A &quot;river&quot; in this context means the entire catchment area of that river and its tributaries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.7/3">Prior to devolution, this caused difficulty only in relation to the border rivers&mdash;the Tweed and the Border Esk&mdash;which of course run through two different legal jurisdictions. Prior to 1857&mdash;just the other day&mdash;it was agreed that, although the lower reaches of the Tweed and some of its major tributaries lie in England, Scots law should nonetheless apply in relation to that river. Accordingly, historically, the salmon and freshwater fisheries legislation in force in relation to the Tweed, including those parts which are situated in England, has been Scots law, notably the Tweed Acts of 1857 to 1969. Other Scottish primary legislation relating to salmon and freshwater fishing has also routinely been applied to those parts of the Tweed which lie outside Scotland. Similarly, the River Esk catchment area is governed under English law, and the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has the responsibility for legislation governing that river.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.7/4">With devolution, that convenient arrangement could not continue because, although fishing in rivers is a devolved matter, the Scottish Parliament could not legislate for the parts of the Tweed outside Scotland, and it would be inappropriate for the UK Parliament to legislate, without the approval of the Scottish Parliament, for those parts of the Border Esk outside England. Section 111 of the Scotland Act 1998 provides that Her Majesty may, by Order in Council, make provision for or in connection with the conservation, management and exploitation of salmon, trout, eels and freshwater fish in the border rivers. By virtue of Section 115 and Schedule 7, any such order requires to be approved by both Houses of this Parliament and by the Scottish Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.7/5">While Section 111 would, in theory, permit any regime to be put in place in the border rivers, the Scottish Executive, Defra and those currently charged with the management of fisheries in the River Tweed&mdash;the River Tweed Council&mdash;are all agreed that the pre-devolution arrangements should be retained and that the legislation in relation to the River Tweed should continue broadly to correspond to the legislation in force in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.7/6">The objective of this order, therefore, is to provide a clear, up-to-date legal framework for the conservation, management and exploitation of salmon and freshwater fisheries in the River Tweed district. While the general provisions of the order largely reflect the consolidation in 2003 of the general Scottish legislation on salmon and freshwater fisheries, the order is not a consolidation exercise, and the opportunity has been taken to review and modernise those areas where there has always been separate provision for the Tweed. The River Tweed Council has been fully consulted about these proposals and it is content with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.7/7">I trust it may assist noble Lords if I explain some of the changes and ameliorations. First, the order updates the administration of salmon and freshwater fisheries management in the Tweed, including election and operating rules for the River Tweed Commission. Under previous regimes, every proprietor of a specified salmon fishery in the Tweed was a commissioner and was entitled to vote to elect certain of his fellow commissioners to serve on the River Tweed Council. That seemed unnecessarily complicated. The order therefore removes the River Tweed Council as an entity and replaces it with the River Tweed Commission. Under the order, not every proprietor of a specified fishery will be a commissioner, but he or she will continue to have a vote. Only those elected to represent their fellow proprietors will become commissioners. The definition of &quot;proprietor&quot; is clarified in the order.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.7/8">Secondly, the limits of the Tweed district and the estuary have been defined. The geographical extent of what is described in the order as the &quot;Tweed district&quot; has been much amended since the Tweed Fisheries Act 1857. The end result of those amendments is that, for the purposes of the administration of fisheries, &quot;The Tweed&quot; has since 1863 included not only the river of that name but also all the other rivers flowing into the sea between the border between the local authority areas of East Lothian and the Scottish Borders, in the north, and the Holy Island fisheries, in the south. The order defines the district so that it can readily be drawn on a map.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.7/9">Thirdly, the definitions of methods of fishing have been brought largely into line with those provided in the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries (Consolidation) (Scotland) Act 2003. However, in some cases the opportunity has been taken to go further. For example, the definition of &quot;rod and line&quot; has been amended to prohibit catching fish by foul hooking, and the use of anything other than a landing net as an auxiliary to the taking of fish by angling has been prohibited.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.7/10">Fourthly, in relation to enforcement of the legislation, the modernised provisions in relation to enforcement, which were included in the Scottish consolidation on the recommendation of the Scottish Law Commission, have been incorporated into the order. It has been clarified that, in relation to any offence committed in the Tweed district, bailiffs may cross from the Tweed district into adjoining districts, including Environment Agency areas. Reciprocal arrangements for bailiffs from other salmon fishery districts or from the Environment Agency have also been clarified.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.7/11">Finally, power to make subordinate legislation under this order is conferred on the Scottish Ministers. That will enable matters such as annual and weekly close times, provisions as to baits and lures, and any necessary salmon conservation orders, to be dealt with without the requirement for further Orders in Council under the Scotland Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.7/12">I hope that noble Lords may have found this explanation helpful and a useful addition to the information contained in the order and the supplementary material. If there are further matters on which your Lordships would wish further detail, I will endeavour to deal with those either by oral or written answer. I suggest that the proposals in the order are a sensible and necessary use of Section 111 of the Scotland Act, and I commend them to the House. I beg to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.1157.7/13">Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-25">25 May</phrase> be approved [<i>29th Report from the Joint Committee</i>].&mdash;(<i>Lord Davidson of Glen Clova</i>.)</p>
