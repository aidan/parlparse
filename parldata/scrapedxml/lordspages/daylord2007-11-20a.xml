<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-20a.759.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="759"  time="016:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71120-0004.htm#07112060000242">
	<p pid="a.759.1/1">My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall repeat a Statement made by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in another place this afternoon. The Statement is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.759.1/2">&quot;With your permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a Statement on the breach of procedures which led to missing personal data relating to child benefit from Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. &quot;I shall set out the nature of the data and circumstances relating to how they went missing. However, it might be helpful to the House to set out the background before I do that.&quot;The National Audit Office, which is independent of government, but answerable to Parliament, has a right to ask for and access data from HMRC in discharging its compliance responsibilities. In March of this year, it appears that a junior official within HMRC provided the National Audit Office with a full copy of HMRC's data in relation to the payment of child benefit. It is clear that, in doing so, the strict rules governing HMRC standing procedures were not followed. These procedures relate to the security and access to data, as well as their transit, to ensure that data are properly protected. This information should not have been handed over by HMRC in the way that it was. However, I understand that, in this case, the National Audit Office subsequently returned all the information that it received in March to HMRC after auditing it.&quot;It now appears that, following a further request from the National Audit Office in October for information from the child benefit database, again at a junior level and again contrary to all HMRC standing procedures, two password- protected discs containing a full copy of HMRC's entire data in relation to the payment of child benefit were sent to the National Audit Office by HMRC's post system, operated by the courier, TNT. The package was not recorded or registered. It appears that the data have failed to reach the addressee in the National Audit Office. &quot;I also have to tell the House that, when it was found that the package had not arrived at the National Audit Office, a further copy of this data was sent, this time by registered post, which did arrive at the National Audit Office. However, again, HMRC should never have let this happen. &quot;Although it is believed that the data were sent from HMRC to the National Audit Office on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-18">18 October</phrase>, the fact that they did not arrive was not reported to HMRC's senior management until <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-08">8 November</phrase>&mdash;nearly three weeks later. I was informed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-10">Saturday 10 November</phrase> and immediately instructed that comprehensive searches be carried out of all premises where the missing data might be found. These searches are continuing.&quot;I asked for an immediate investigation, which was initiated that weekend. I also insisted that immediate steps be taken to prevent this happening again, and action has been taken. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-12">Monday 12 November</phrase>, HMRC informed me that evidence of the route taken by the data might have been found and that the data were likely to be found. However, by <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">Wednesday 14 November</phrase>, it was clear to me that HMRC's searches had failed to find them. I therefore instructed the chairman of HMRC to call in the Metropolitan Police to conduct a full investigation to find the missing package. That investigation is still under way. Our priority was and is to find those data. Searches have been and continue to be carried out, including of HMRC and National Audit Office premises. Staff are being interviewed, but so far the missing data have not been found. The police tell me that they have no reason to believe that those data have found their way into the wrong hands. The police are not aware of any evidence that they have been used for fraudulent purposes or criminal activity.&quot;Let me tell the House what is missing as a result of this extremely serious failure on the part of HMRC to protect sensitive personal data entrusted to it in breach of its own guidelines. In terms of protecting confidential data, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs is operationally independent of Ministers. It is established by statute. It is run by its chairman, Paul Gray, and a board of commissioners who are responsible for its operations, but answerable to Parliament through me. &quot;Last week Paul Gray told me on his own initiative that, given the seriousness of the operational failing, he felt that he should resign. He has now confirmed that intention. I am very grateful to Paul Gray for his contribution to the work of government in Her Majesty's Treasury, the Department for Work and Pensions and in HMRC.&quot;The missing information contains details of all child benefit recipients: records for 25 million individuals and 7.25 million families. These records include the recipient and their children's names, addresses and dates of birth, it includes child benefit numbers, national insurance numbers, and, where relevant, bank or building society account details.&quot;I regard this as an extremely serious failure by HMRC in its responsibility to the public. In making this Statement today, I have had to balance the imperative of informing the House and the public at the earliest opportunity, while at the same time ensuring that when I did so the appropriate safeguards were in place to protect the public, including in relation to bank accounts. Indeed, the banks were adamant that they wanted as much time as possible to prepare for this announcement. &quot;I discussed this with the Information Commissioner on Thursday who agreed that appropriate remedial action needed to be taken before a public statement was made. That action has now been taken.&quot;I have also sought the advice of the Financial Services Authority and the Serious Organised Crime Agency. Other government departments have been made aware.&quot;Mr Speaker, let me set out what we have done. First, the UK Payments Association, the British Bankers' Association and Building Societies Association have been informed. Through them HMRC informed individual banks and other financial institutions, including building societies and post offices, of affected accounts. Secondly, individual institutions are flagging these accounts, which enables them continually to monitor for irregular activity. They tell me that so far they have found no evidence of such activity.&quot;Thirdly, they are also tracking back and analysing transactions on affected accounts back to <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-18">18 October</phrase>. They have again so far found no evidence of unusual activity. They will continue to monitor these accounts so that if there is any suspicious activity, action can be taken immediately.&quot;Fourthly, if someone is the innocent victim of fraud as a result of this incident, people can be assured that they have protection under the Banking Code so that they will not suffer any financial loss as a result. &quot;The UK Payments Association has confirmed that it is confident that every action has been taken by the banking industry to minimise the risk of any fraud. It has also confirmed that the missing data are not enough in themselves for someone to access a person's bank account for fraudulent purposes, as additional security information and passwords are always required. But we have to recognise the increased risk caused by this missing data, so people will want to monitor their accounts and guard against any unusual activity.&quot;The advice of banks is that there is no need for customers to ask for a new account or to contact their bank or building society. But they should do what they should be doing anyway: they should check their statement and keep a close eye on their account for any unusual activity; if they see anything in their statement that concerns them, they should then contact their bank or building society immediately; and they should not give out personal or account details requested unexpectedly by phone or e-mail. &quot;I reiterate: the banks have made it clear that individuals will not have to pay out for any loss in the event that they are innocent victims of fraudulent activity. I can also assure the House that child benefit payments will continue to be paid as before. There are already clear HMRC standing procedures, which appear to have been broken. HMRC has initiated changes to security processes and procedures so that those will now take place only with written authorisation from a senior HMRC manager and with the appropriate protection for the transfer. &quot;The police investigation continues, though there is also likely to be an inquiry into the missing data by the Independent Police Complaints Commission, which has a responsibility for monitoring HMRC. I have kept the Information Commissioner informed. It is highly likely that there have been breaches in the Data Protection Act. That is something the commissioner will investigate.&quot;The Government take the protection of personal data, in whatever form, extremely seriously and have therefore put in place and are strengthening the rights and safeguards on use and handling of such data. The Data Protection Act set out the framework enforced by the Information Commissioner and the courts. Departments have specific controls on information sharing and duties of confidentiality that are being enhanced by amending the Data Protection Act to guard against misuse, and by providing further information for citizens about the information that the Government hold. &quot;Last month, the Prime Minister asked the Information Commissioner and Professor Mark Walport, director of the Wellcome Trust, to carry out a review of the framework in the UK to ensure the security of personal data. That review will look at government departments and other organisations. I can also tell the House that the Comptroller and Auditor-General, Sir John Bourn, has said that the National Audit Office will review its own procedures for requesting data, to confirm that these remain in line with best practice. It will apply any lessons arising. &quot;In addition, the House will be aware of other data security breaches by HMRC, including the loss in transit at the end of September of the records of around 15,000 people by HMRC's external courier. In the same month, a laptop and other material containing personal details relating to HMRC customers were also lost. I have therefore asked Kieran Poynter, chair of PricewaterhouseCoopers, to investigate HMRC security processes and procedures for data handling. I have asked for an interim report next month and a full report in the spring. That review will be conducted in consultation with the Independent Police Complaints Commission and a full report will be made available to the Information Commissioner. I express my gratitude to the Metropolitan Police for its investigation, to the Information Commissioner for his advice and to the banks for their co-operation in working with the Government to take steps to protect the public.&quot;The House will understand that because the investigation is continuing I am not yet in a position to give a full account of what has happened here, but I will continue to keep the House informed. This is an extremely serious matter. HMRC has a responsibility towards the general public who entrust it with highly sensitive personal information. It has failed to meet the high standards that should be expected of it. I recognise that millions of people across the country will be concerned about what has happened. I deeply regret this, and apologise for the anxiety that will undoubtedly be caused. &quot;Let me reiterate: there is no evidence that these data have reached the wrong hands, and no evidence of fraud or criminal activity. Banks and building societies are putting in place safeguards to protect people's accounts, and they will continue to monitor those accounts. No one will suffer any loss if they are an innocent victim of fraud and I will, of course, keep the House updated of any further developments&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.759.1/3">My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-20a.763.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100460" speakername="Baroness Noakes" colon=":" colnum="763"  time="016:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71120-0005.htm#07112060000243">
	<p pid="a.763.0/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement. This is a sorry tale of incompetence and mismanagement in the Treasury's own back yard. We already knew that HMRC was prone to running computer systems which caused operational problems and that its operation of the tax credits system resulted in the incorrect payment of more than 40 per cent of tax credits. Now we are told that the records for 25 million individuals have gone missing.</p>
	<p pid="a.763.0/2">The Minister has told us that after <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-18">18 October</phrase> when the junior official was first aware that the data were missing, the only thing that happened is that the official sent another copy of the information. Apparently, this person kept the information about the data loss to himself until <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-08">8 November</phrase>. Can the Minister explain what kind of organisation would encourage its junior staff to behave in this way? There is something very wrong with an organisation that is incapable of admitting to errors or unable to respond to them. We have learnt something very distressing about HMRC's culture and the way in which it behaves.</p>
	<p pid="a.763.0/3">This is not the first time that data have gone missing when in the care and custody of HMRC. A couple of months ago we heard that a disc with the confidential data of more than 15,000 people got lost between HMRC and Standard Life. In August 2007 it was reported on BBC radio that a laptop with confidential ISA data was stolen from an HMRC official's car. It took a number of questions from my honourable friend Mr Mark Hoban to extract from HMRC the fact that 41 laptops went missing in the 12 months to September 2007. In May 2007, a faulty printer was blamed by HMRC for 42,000 families in receipt of tax credits having their bank account details revealed to other people, and only this week the BBC &quot;Watchdog&quot; programme featured other errors which caused misery and mayhem to the life of some individuals whose data were incorrectly released.</p>
	<p pid="a.763.0/4">When we debated the creation of HMRC under the Commissioners for Revenue and Customs Bill in early 2005, we noted with some concern that the integration of the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise was proceeding with very little information about how the integration of the two organisations was going to be effected. We were concerned about the merging of two separate cultures without a clear plan of action and about the lack of specificity about the integration plans. It was clear to us that the Chancellor and his Treasury were fixated on realising &pound;100 million of ongoing cost savings above all else. Unfortunately, we did not suspect that the organisation that would be created as a result of the Act would be so careless about the data of individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.763.0/5">During the passage of the Bill, we pressed the Government hard on the data protection provisions and, in particular, wanted to be sure that the protection of confidential data was managed and overseen at the level of the board itself, with rigorous and documented procedures. We were only partially successful in persuading the Government to accept some changes to the Bill. We were often told that data protection was taken very seriously in both the Inland Revenue and in Customs and Excise and that we must not hamper the operational effectiveness of the organisation. We did not press all our amendments but, with the benefit of hindsight, we should have done so.</p>
	<p pid="a.763.0/6">Because we believe that data protection responsibilities need to start at the top, it is clearly right that the chairman of HMRC should resign. He and his fellow commissioners had plenty of warnings that things were not right and they should carry the can. But they are not the only ones and officials at all levels between the board and the junior official at the centre of this affair need to examine the part that they played, whether by act or omission, in this sorry tale.</p>
	<p pid="a.763.0/7">The Minister has said that Mr Poynter from PricewaterhouseCoopers will carry out a security review. Will the Minister make the terms of reference for that review available to Parliament and commit to making Mr Poynter's interim and final reports available to Parliament? Will he also say how the Information Commissioner will be involved? I am aware that he is carrying out the wider review described by the Minister this afternoon, but will the noble Lord confirm that the Information Commissioner can have complete and unfettered access to HMRC to carry out his own investigations if he so chooses? I am sure that PricewaterhouseCoopers will carry out a review admirably but we would also like to be sure that the public sector's own data protection expert will be able to pursue these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.763.0/8">The disclosure of personal data without proper reason is illegal under data protection legislation and specific offences are built into the 2005 Act. There are data protection offences all over the statute book but I do not believe that they have been used much. Can the Minister confirm that all individuals who are found to have breached the law in this case will be considered for prosecution?</p>
	<p pid="a.763.0/9">Over the past few years the Government have created statutory data gateways all over the public sector and seem intent on creating one great data free-for-all across the public sector. It is all in the name of customer service and efficient service delivery but it carries with it great dangers. We were assured that HMRC has the confidentiality of data at its core. There is even a statutory confidentiality declaration made by each member of HMRC's staff. If HMRC can make the kind of errors that we have heard about today, what could go wrong elsewhere in the public sector? We certainly await the review in which the Information Commissioner is involved and we hope that it will have at its heart the need to protect data and not compromise them in the name of modernisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.763.0/10">The case before us today involves child benefit records and therefore involves data concerning children. The organisation Action on Rights for Children has reminded us today of the concerns that it has expressed, and that we share, about the large children's database that the Government intend to create. Will the Government pause its development and think again about the dangers of information held on databases about children, some of the most vulnerable members of our society? Will they commit to a full review of the national identity database which will underpin the identity cards that the Government propose? Every citizen in the land will fear for the security of his or her information which has been entrusted to the Government. The Government ought now to recognise that there are huge dangers for individuals when their information is transferred, however well intentioned the policy intent.</p>
	<p pid="a.763.0/11">There needs to be a full public debate on the collection, handling and use of personal data before we go any further on these issues&mdash;including the national identity database&mdash;and I hope that the Minister will commit to that too.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-20a.767.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="767"  time="016:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71120-0005.htm#07112063000009">
	<p pid="a.767.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lords for the points they have made. The noble Baroness has accurately identified what we said in the Statement; namely, that there was an extensive gap between the disks being sent and lost and senior management being made aware of that loss. The loss was discovered on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-24">24 October</phrase> and senior management did not know anything was awry until <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-08">8 November</phrase>. We make no bones about it: that is completely unacceptable. When the noble Baroness says that all the individuals who have been close to the operation should examine their role in it, she is right, and I assure the House that others will also examine the role of those officials in this situation. What took place is quite unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.767.0/2">I do not accept the noble Baroness's suggestion that the problem comes from the merging of two cultures with the formation of HMRC. This kind of mistake and lax behaviour and the failure to observe proper procedures would be unacceptable in any culture. I assure her that the review that is being carried out will be made available to Parliament so progress will be monitored, although HMRC does not make its disciplinary procedures public. This is a severe crisis for the organisation. Its chair has resigned and the impact on all staff concerned with this sorry affair is still to be thoroughly investigated. No stone will be left unturned as we learn what we can from the situation. If people have been remiss, as some clearly have, in fulfilling their obligations, they will face appropriate sanctions, but the inquiry will also be concerned to learn lessons so there is no question of any repetition of such a development in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.767.0/3">Strict procedures were in place. They were not followed in these instances. HMRC has strengthened its guidelines and will make sure that its data security guidelines are followed meticulously; that will be a clear obligation upon all management throughout the organisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.767.0/4">What does this mean for the Government with regard to data sharing? I am not able to say how many disks have moved between government departments, and I do not think the noble Lord would expect me to be able to answer that question. The question that lies behind that is: &quot;Is the transfer of such information covered by strict guidelines and secure?&quot;, and the answer is that it is&mdash;unless there is a serious lapse of this kind, which has the widest repercussions.</p>
	<p pid="a.767.0/5">My right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer did not exactly enjoy telling the nation about this lapse, nor can he do anything except apologise for the implications for the large numbers of the public who will be exercised about this problem. All government departments will be well aware of the necessity of following correct procedures, which on this occasion were manifestly not followed. That is why, for instance, the disks had no greater security than passwords&mdash;they were not encrypted.</p>
	<p pid="a.767.0/6">I want to reassure the House on that front. The thrust of the noble Baroness's remarks was about identifying accurately what went wrong. Not only will lessons be learnt from that on how we can improve procedures, but action has already been taken to ensure that existing procedures&mdash;which, if followed, would certainly not have given rise to this lapse&mdash;will be followed meticulously.</p>
	<p pid="a.767.0/7">On the future of government information, the whole House will recognise that the Government will need to reassure the nation of confidence in data protection, not least because there is no way in which we can serve the community without guaranteeing that confidence to the nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.767.0/8">The noble Lord, Lord Newby, asked about failures in the recent past&mdash;which the Chancellor of the Exchequer identified in his Statement. Those were nothing to do with CDs in the post&mdash;a stolen laptop was one of the previous lapses, for instance. The subject of today's Statement was a specific case. The noble Lord said it was due to low morale among the staff. That is an easy thing to assert and difficult to refute. I say that members of the government service&mdash;we all meet many of them in our daily lives&mdash;carry out their duties with proper attention to their responsibilities, but here was a catastrophic lapse where someone did not.</p>
	<p pid="a.767.0/9">The noble Lord ought not to suggest that the National Audit Office was remiss in the way it requested the information. The National Audit Office asked for the information and it was the responsibility of HMRC to ensure that it was transmitted in a secure fashion&mdash;an obligation that was not followed through.</p>
	<p pid="a.767.0/10">I reiterate that the Chancellor of the Exchequer did not make the Statement to the House until he had assured himself of a severe tightening up of procedures within his department. He also set out to make sure that the public was safeguarded by the full co-operation of all those who would be in possession of customer accounts, in order to effect the best possible protection to people with such accounts.</p>
	<p pid="a.767.0/11">On ID, noble Lords will recognise that part of the problem arose because of the limited nature and degree of security involved. ID cards are meant to improve aspects of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.767.0/12">I reiterate, the lapse was unacceptable, but day by day, right across government, such procedures are conducted with care, scrupulously and according to proper procedures. Such a lapse is unacceptable and requires the most immediate and proper action. The Chancellor of the Exchequer has already taken such action, and promised further action to tighten up procedures for the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.771.0/1">My Lords, the Chancellor was informed of this serious incident on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-10">10 November</phrase>. Does the noble Lord agree that it is a serious matter that the House has not been informed for more than 10 days afterwards? Secondly, I would like to add to the question of the noble Lord, Lord Newby, about all this information being passed around on CDs. While I am not at all a computer expert, that seems to be a strange way of proceeding. How many other unencrypted CDs are floating around the country? Thirdly, HMRC has been stretched in many ways&mdash;it has been entrusted with the distribution of tax credits and the former Chancellor has demanded 25,000 redundancies or job cuts by way of efficiency savings. Is it any wonder that HMRC is in such chaos?</p>

First, regardless of whether Customs and the Inland Revenue had merged, if procedures had not been followed this breach could have happened under the old Inland Revenue. Secondly, can the Minister confirm that while there is a target of 25,000 cuts, in fact only 12,500 cuts have been delivered? If so, and if there is a problem with staffing, will he undertake to ensure that proper staffing is in place before the Government proceed with the further 12,500 cuts to meet the target? Thirdly, did loss of the disk on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-18">18 October</phrase> arise because of the internal postal service of the merged Revenue and Customs or is there an outsourced service that acts on behalf of the new department?

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-20a.803.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="803"  time="019:06:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71120-0010.htm#07112086000029">
	<p pid="a.803.2/1">My Lords, each year the Government report information to the Commission on the economic and budgetary position and our main economic policy measures. By formally sharing information from the Pre-Budget Report with our European partners, we can help to ensure a proper, accurate and effective EU system and meet our commitments, contributing to enhanced employment and growth. This information was set out in the Pre-Budget Report last month and this material forms the basis of what we are sending to the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/2">The background to this year's report and spending review is a time of increased international economic uncertainty and a more fragile global environment, which has already seen turbulence in America, Asia and Europe. As the Chancellor set out in his speech on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October</phrase>, provided that we maintain the course for economic stability that we have set, we can respond to this global environment. We will do so by taking no risks with stability and no risks with unaffordable promises that put public finances at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/3">The full impact from turbulence in the international financial markets is as yet unclear, but the IMF has said that this international uncertainty will have an effect on growth right across the world. Independent forecasters expect growth next year in America and the euro area to fall to 2 and 2.5 per cent. In these circumstances, it is right that we, too, should be cautious. The forecast for growth next year is also of 2 to 2.5 per cent. However, because of the strength of our economy, our commitment to openness and liberalised trade across the world and our flexibility and dynamism here at home, the forecast for growth in 2009 and 2010 is 2.5 to 3 per cent, in line with the economy's trend rate of growth and in line with the forecast in the Budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/4">Against the backdrop of recent events, in the UK decisive action has brought inflation down to around our target of 2 per cent, with it forecast to be on target next year and the year after, employment is at a record level and productivity is growing strongly, up 2.7 per cent in the past year. While growth in America this year is expected to be 2.1 per cent, in Japan 2 per cent and in the euro area 2.6 per cent, in Britain&mdash;with exports and investment rising&mdash;growth is expected to be 3 per cent. Britain is the fastest-growing advanced major economy in the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/5">The strength of the UK economy is the direct result of the monetary and fiscal policy framework that we have introduced. This Government's monetary policy framework seeks to ensure low and stable inflation. The framework has delivered the longest period of low and stable inflation since the 1960s, along with low interest rates. This has provided the platform for record employment levels, higher investment and economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/6">Our two fiscal rules are, first, the golden rule that, over the economic cycle, the Government will borrow only to invest and not to fund current spending and, secondly, the sustainable investment rule that net debt should be held over the economic cycle at a stable and prudent level. We are meeting our first fiscal rule, with the current budget in surplus over the cycle. In the last economic cycle&mdash;1986 to 1997&mdash;that rule was missed, with a deficit of &pound;240 billion. Over this cycle, with a current budget deficit last year lower than forecast, we have a surplus of &pound;18 billion and are, therefore, meeting our first fiscal rule. We will also meet our second rule that net debt should be at a sustainable level. In America, debt is 44 per cent; it is 49 per cent across the euro area, 86 per cent in Japan and 94 per cent in Italy. In Britain, debt is 37.6 per cent this year and below 40 per cent in every year of the projection period, so we are meeting our second fiscal rule. Debt interest was 3.5 per cent of national income in 1997. Next year, it is expected to be just 2 per cent. That low debt allows more investment in front-line services.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/7">We can afford sustained investment in our priorities only because of our two fiscal rules, which ensure sound public finances. The rules have protected an historically unprecedented increase in public net investment, while debt and borrowing remain low and stable. Last year, borrowing was 2.3 per cent of national income&mdash;&pound;4 billion less than forecast. Over the 10 years of this economic cycle, borrowing and debt in Britain have been lower than in Japan, the euro area, America and the OECD as a whole. Net borrowing is forecast to fall from 2.7 per cent this year to 1.3 per cent in 2012, compared to a peak in 1993 of almost 8 per cent&mdash;the equivalent of about &pound;110 billion today. The UK also continues to meet the reference value on the treaty deficit throughout the projection period, with the deficit reaching 1.6 per cent of GDP by 2012-13.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/8">The projections that the Chancellor set out are also consistent with the Government's prudent interpretation of the stability and growth pact. A prudent interpretation takes account of country-specific factors including the long-term sustainability of the public finances, the economic cycle and the important role of public investment. The reforms to the stability and growth pact agreed in March 2005 rightly place a greater focus on the avoidance of pro-cyclical policies and on reducing and maintaining low debt, with the flexibility for low-debt countries, such as the UK, to invest in the provision of public services.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/9">The challenges of the decade ahead require a balance to be struck between delivering further investment in public services to equip the country for change and entrenching the macroeconomic stability that is essential in the increasingly global competitive economy. Therefore, the spending review is tighter for many departments and the Government remain committed to ensuring that public spending delivers the public's priorities and value for money for the taxpayer. The spending review has identified substantial savings that can be made by departments. The resources released through the ambitious value-for-money programme, together with the increased spending delivered in the Comprehensive Spending Review, will enable the Government to sustain the pace of improvement in public services and focus additional resources on their long-term priorities. That will be matched with reform and clear objectives set out in new public service agreements defining the Government's top 30 priorities for the coming period.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/10">The key priorities are, first, to meet the challenge of globalisation by investing in the human and physical capital that will keep the UK economy competitive over the long term, with education spending in England growing by 2.8 per cent a year in real terms, investment in science and university research rising to over &pound;6 billion a year in three years' time and transport investment doubling to &pound;14.5 billion a year by 2011-12. The second priority is to make the UK a better place to live by continuing to improve the NHS, with investment in health in England rising from &pound;90 billion this year to a total of &pound;110 billion in 2010, and by progressing towards the Government's objective of decent and affordable housing for all, with total spending on new housing of at least &pound;8 billion over the next three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/11">Thirdly, we intend to protect the nation from external and internal threats, with total spending on counterterrorism and intelligence rising from &pound;2.5 billion in 2007-08 to &pound;3.5 billion in 2010-11; we are also continuing the longest period of sustained real increases in defence expenditure in over 20 years. Fourthly, we intend to tackle climate change and protect the countryside, with Defra's budget to increase to &pound;4 billion by 2010-11 and a new environment transformation fund with a three-year budget of &pound;1.2 billion. Fifthly, we intend to help to tackle international poverty. By growing DfID's budget by 11 per cent a year over the Comprehensive Spending Review period and enabling total UK official development assistance to reach over &pound;9.1 billion a year, we will be on course to meet our European commitment of 0.56 per cent of national income devoted to development aid by 2010, and then to meet our commitment to achieve, for the first time, the long-established United Nations goal of 0.7 per cent, which we intend to reach by 2013.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/12">Our task is to meet and master the global economic challenge, making the critical decisions to secure Britain's long-term economic future. The Pre-Budget Report drives forward the great economic mission of our time: to meet the global challenge, to unleash the potential of all British people and to deliver security, prosperity and fairness for all. That is the programme set out in the 2007 Pre-Budget Report and Comprehensive Spending Review and that, with the approval of the House, is the basis on which we are sending updated information to the European Commission. I beg to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.803.2/13">Moved, That this House takes note with approval of the Government's assessment as set out in the Pre-Budget Report 2007 for the purposes of Section 5 of the European Communities (Amendment) Act 1993.&mdash;(<I>Lord Davies of Oldham.</I>)</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-20a.808.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100280" speakername="Lord Haskel" colon=":" colnum="808"  time="019:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71120-0011.htm#07112086000054">
	<p pid="a.808.0/1">My Lords, it is not very often that we have a chance to debate Treasury matters, so I thank my noble friend for moving this Motion. Apart from the Minister, all the speakers in this debate spoke last Wednesday and so we may go over some of the same ground, but I am sure that it is ground worth repeating.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.0/2">I largely agree with my noble friend's analysis of the economy but I am a little more sanguine than he is about the rate of growth. Since the Pre-Budget Report on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October</phrase>, the clouds on the horizon have perhaps become a little darker, but I certainly do not agree with the description of the economy that we had from the noble Lord, Lord Marlesford. We are not going to slide into financial recession because of problems in the financial sector; the rest of the economy is working. According to the FT/Harris poll yesterday, business is surprisingly optimistic. Yes, credit may be harder to come by but there is life outside the financial services sector, and life outside that sector seems to be going pretty well.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.0/3">Last week, I congratulated the Government on maintaining a free and open economy since they came to power more than 10 years ago. Indeed, I think it is one of the triumphs of the Labour Government that they have managed to do this over the entire period that they have been in power. We can maintain a free and open economy only if we stick to the fiscal rules&mdash;that is why we have them. The Minister reminded us that, if our budget was not in balance and our debt affordable, there would be the same calls for protectionism that we are beginning to see in the United States and elsewhere. This free and open style of economy has to be supported by a strong monetary and fiscal regime, as described by my noble friend, and we also have to have a high degree of competitiveness.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.0/4">In his speech of <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October</phrase>, the Chancellor said that our competitiveness&mdash;that is, our ability to compete and succeed in this global age&mdash;will depend on our continuing investment in the economy. He went on to say that, in today's knowledge economy, this investment is not just in physical capital assets but also in skills, innovation and intellectual property. The Minister reminded us of that and I agree. In a modern knowledge economy as well as investing in buildings and machinery we also have to invest in design, training, branding, responding to customers' needs and all the related software and services. This is how you remain competitive in a modern knowledge economy. With the Pre-Budget Report my right honourable friend the Chancellor published a paper explaining how this kind of intangible investment relates to our competitiveness and productivity and how we actually seem to be doing rather well. I found the paper pretty convincing. The Chancellor is right to promote this kind of knowledge business in the Pre-Budget Report. Good jobs come out of it&mdash;jobs that are highly paid with a low carbon footprint and attractive working conditions. Skills training, investment in science and transport and support for local investment and local economic development will all help this kind of economy, as will the 2p reduction in corporation tax for next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.0/5">Compared with all this support for business, the outcry against the taper relief on capital gains tax seems to me to be out of all proportion. When I started my business, capital gains tax was either 60 or 80 per cent. It was such a long time ago I cannot remember. People starting up businesses do not think about this sort of thing. People who look upon a business as a financial commodity to be packaged and bought and sold from one to another may take a different view. I hope my noble friend will bear this in mind and not let it distract him. A tax rate for economic stability is what is important for us all.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.0/6">There is a distraction but it is not a distraction of tax. The distraction comes from the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and its meeting in Valencia. The panel tells us that the climate is changing more rapidly than we thought. There was practically unanimous agreement that the change was man-made but it agrees with the Stern report that there is still time to do something about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.0/7">The Minister spoke about investing in the environment. This means less time to spread out our investment. If we accept what the Joint Committee on the Draft Climate Change Bill said, there would be less time to spread out investment in flood defences, in carbon capture and storage, in the next generation of cleaner cars and in cleaner energy. It means bringing forward the rise in the climate change levy and reducing VAT on energy-efficient products. It means expanding the European Emissions Trading Scheme more quickly to other organisations on the ground and in the air. I wonder if the Minister has given any thought to this. If the realities of climate change demand more of our budget in the near future, how will this activity affect economic stability? If the environment becomes more of an economic imperative, what will be the social effects? What will be the budgetary effects? These are the kind of questions my noble friend will have to address between now and the Budget next April.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-20a.816.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100460" speakername="Baroness Noakes" colon=":" colnum="816"  time="020:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71120-0012.htm#07112086000086">
	<p pid="a.816.0/1">My Lords, we have had a short but very interesting debate and I thank my noble friends for coming out, as the noble Lord, Lord Haskel, pointed out, for the second week running to talk about the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/2">The Motion refers to the Pre-Budget Report which was announced in another place on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-07">7 October</phrase> this year. As I said in my speech on the humble Address last week, we on these Benches pressed hard for a debate on the PBR before prorogation but the Government refused. It has not been our custom to require that Budget Statements, Pre-Budget Statements and Comprehensive Spending Reviews are repeated in your Lordships' House. While they are clearly Statements of public importance within the terms of the <I>Companion</I>, they are generally long and often complex and we have judged that the convenience of the House is better served by a debate. But that is predicated on a debate being allowed on a timely basis, which this debate is not. The Government have forced us to re-examine our stance, and we may well in future wish to take such Statements in the House on the same day.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/3">Once the Government had got past Prorogation and avoided a timely debate on the PBR, they suddenly discovered a passion for a debate on it before the end of this month. But this is only to dance to the tune of an obscure European code of conduct and not because the Government believe that it is important that this part of their policies should be debated in your Lordships' House. We do not believe that this reflects well on the Government's approach to your Lordships' House.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/4">One of the few benefits of debating the PBR so late is that we have had an opportunity to reflect on the impact that it has had. It was a copycat PBR. Our abiding memory is that it was cobbled together at the last minute in order to launch a general election campaign, which the Prime Minister called off when he saw that his popularity was evaporating as a result of my party's highly successful conference.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/5">We have heard from a number of sources that the very late decision by the Government&mdash;almost certainly in No. 10, as the noble Lord, Lord Newby, said&mdash;to introduce additional inheritance tax relief was only because of the outstanding success of the announcement made by my honourable friend Mr George Osborne the previous week. On the other side of the equation, they copied us by tackling the long-running issue of non-doms.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/6">They also sprang some capital gains tax changes without any consultation. These penalise investment in business and enterprise. I am glad to say that this was all down to the Government; we would not have been so inept.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/7">The Government's successive forecasts generally show a deteriorating pattern. We were thus not surprised to find in the PBR that the Government would stay longer in budget deficit than in the earlier reports. A return to surplus is now put off until 2009-10. In consequence, the Government will be borrowing more than they previously estimated&mdash;&pound;16 billion over the next five years more than the last Budget forecast, to be precise. Net debt as a percentage of GDP rises to nearly 39 per cent, which is within a whisker of the Government's own rule of 40 per cent, as my noble friends Lord Marlesford and Lord Northbrook have already pointed out. As my noble friends have also pointed out, that figure excludes considerable amounts of off-balance-sheet debt and also excludes amounts for unfunded pension liabilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/8">The Government have revised their growth figures down for next year, blaming the turmoil in credit markets. The Bank of England made it clear last week that the UK will see a &quot;sharp slow-down&quot; in 2008 and the detail of the Bank's central forecast suggests growth of only 0.3 per cent in the first two quarters of next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/9">For the first time in a very long time the &quot;R&quot; word has crept back. The noble Lord, Lord Newby, reminded us of Alan Greenspan's comment on the likelihood of a recession in the US. But the Bank of England's chief economist last week said,</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/10" class="indent">&quot;there's a substantially higher probability of a recession&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/11">in the UK next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/12">We would not wish on our economy slow or even negative growth coupled with inflation. The big question is whether our economy has real resilience built into it. The Government's policy of high debt and budget deficits may well have left our economy vulnerable to external shocks. We obviously have to ask whether we can actually achieve the PBR's growth forecast of 2 to 2.5 per cent next year, followed by a bounce back to trend the year after.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/13">As the noble Lord, Lord Newby, has pointed out, household consumption has been a big driver of GDP growth in recent years and there are very significant areas of uncertainty around that. We do not know what path interest rates will take as there may well be inflationary pressures in our economy which could well defer a move in rates downwards and, as a highly indebted nation, interest rates are critical. As we heard earlier, personal debt is now nearly &pound;1.4 trillion, largely secured on property but with a significant unsecured element. Recent surveys suggest that 2.1 million adults are struggling with repayments.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/14">The Government have often asserted that people save when they feel insecure and they spend when they feel secure. &quot;Oh, people feel good about life under new Labour so they do not bother to save&quot; is a paraphrase of Ministers' responses to our questions about the plummeting savings ratio. The truth is that their spending was holding up economic growth, which the Chancellor rather liked. In the first quarter of this year, the savings ratio fell to 2.1 per cent, the lowest level since 1960. If that ratio starts to swing back to its pre-Labour levels of around 10 per cent, that will suck a considerable amount of spending out of the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/15">That would add to other strains on household spending capacity. The Government have steadily increased the tax burden since they came to power, often through the use of stealth taxes, and we can see a continuation of this pattern in the Pre-Budget Report, including the rising proportions of income tax and national insurance. The net disposable income of individuals as a percentage of gross income has been falling as a consequence and this seems set to continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/16">To this must be added the undoubted pressures on inflation, with food and fuel prices on an upward trend, as the noble Lord, Lord Newby, pointed out. He also pointed out that wage growth is overall less than RPI at the moment, which means that there is a real squeeze on the value of pay packets. People on very low incomes&mdash;for example, a large number of pensioners&mdash;experience even higher levels of inflation than the average shown in the RPI and will feel the pinch even harder.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/17">All of a sudden, an economy constructed on both personal and government debt starts to look problematic. What stress testing of the impact of a further squeeze on household incomes have the Government carried out? If consumer demand, for example, is one percentage point lower than currently forecast, what does the Treasury's model say about corporate profits, and therefore tax receipts, or about the need for additional debt?</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/18">I put some of these questions about falling consumer spending to the Government in the debate on the gracious Speech last week, when the Minister was not with us. The noble Lord, Lord McKenzie of Luton, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/19" class="indent">&quot;What happens is what is already happening: there is a rebalancing of the economy whereby business investment comes more to the fore&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/11/07; col. 565.]</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/20">I sometimes wonder whether Ministers are on the same planet as the rest of us. Business investment is at an all-time low&mdash;below 10 per cent of GDP&mdash;and the Government's own GDP forecasts show that business investment growth will be lower than in 2006-07.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/21">Lower consumer spending will provide an unpromising environment for some categories of investment. I ask again: what will happen to our economy if consumer demand falls further than currently forecast or fails to recover as quickly as forecast?</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/22">The Government will be judged on how well they have prepared our economy for rough waters. It does not much matter that the seas are being whipped up by forces outside their control, such as the fall-out from the sub-prime debt crisis. What matters is whether our economy can weather the storm. We have real fears about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/23">Little attention has been paid to the Comprehensive Spending Review. Today's Motion is expressed in terms of the PBR and does not even mention the CSR. Perhaps the Government are not keen on a debate on the CSR, but this appears to be our only opportunity to talk about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/24">Many of the CSR07 settlements had been dribbled out in earlier announcements. We knew that the overall budgetary position made the high spending of recent years impossible, so there was relatively little new to say last month. The big picture is that the Government are planning public spending increases of 2.1 per cent during the next three years, which compare with 4 per cent for the previous nine years. Increases of 2.1 per cent will be below the expected growth in GDP, hence the Government have copied our policies; namely, that expenditure plans should share the proceeds of growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/25">Some departments will get more than 2.1 per cent. For example, the settlement for health is expected to deliver 3.7 per cent. That sounds generous until it is compared with recent years, when the NHS absorbed spending increases of more than 7 per cent per annum. All the scenarios in the Wanless report needed more than 3.7 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/26">The big question is whether the CSR07 moneys will be spent any more wisely than any of the previous CSR settlements. We know that public sector efficiency has gone backwards during the years of high spending. We know also that we have not bought enough with the taxpayers' money poured into public services. In education, 40 per cent of 11 year-olds are unable to read, write or add up properly, and only a similar percentage get five good GCSEs. In the NHS, we have frightening levels of hospital- acquired infections; local hospitals are facing increasing threats of closure; and the Government have bungled pay settlements. Our crime rates are among the worst in the world, and rising, with prisons bursting at the seams because of inadequate planning. Despite massive increases in benefits, child poverty has been rising and the Government are missing their targets by miles. We can see nothing in the PBR or CSR which makes us think that money will be spent any better in the future. Indeed, the Prime Minister seems to be leading moves away from public service reform, which might make a difference, back towards the central, stateist policies which have never delivered.</p>
	<p pid="a.816.0/27">The Motion before us is that this House &quot;takes note with approval&quot; of the Government's PBR assessment. For these Benches, I am happy to take note of the PBR assessment, but I cannot bring myself to do so &quot;with approval&quot;.</p>
