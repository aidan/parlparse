	<p pid="c.505.2/1">My Lords, on <phrase class="date" code="">31 May</phrase>, Under-Secretary-General Gambari briefed United Nations Security Council members on his visit to Burma and his meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi. We understand that he requested that the regime should release her and put an end to the violence in Karen state. We support the United States' proposals for a proper discussion of Burma at the Security Council, which we hope will lead to a resolution. Today is her 61st birthday. The Prime Minister has made a statement, and I am certain that all sides of the House would want to wish her well.</p>

	<p pid="c.505.4/1">My Lords, I also deplore the continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and the attacks carried out by the Burmese army on civilians in northern and western Karen state. Representations on all those matters were made by my right honourable friend Ian McCartney on <phrase class="date" code="">15 June</phrase>. At the moment, my estimation is that there is not support for a binding resolution, but there is, we believe, growing support&mdash; much work still needs to be done on it&mdash;for a non-binding resolution, if we can overcome the objections, in particular, of China and Russia.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-19c.535.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="535"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060619/text/60619-10.htm#60619-10_spnew5">
	<p pid="c.535.1/1">My Lords, before turning to the amendment's deficiencies, I must, on behalf of the Government, respond to one or two of the points made during what I can only describe as almost a Second Reading debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.535.1/2">The provisions in Part 1 are based on robust evidence and the management of risk to health from second-hand smoke. Of course, important issues such as personal liberty and the regulation of business have been important in framing this policy. The risk to health, however, is the driving force behind this Bill. That is, ironically, the vital point that the Select Committee on Economic Affairs seems to gloss over in a slightly cavalier fashion.</p>
	<p pid="c.535.1/3">The evidence of the health risks of second-hand smoke is now extremely well established. The single medical expert that the committee sought evidence from was indeed Professor Sir Richard Peto, who has already been described as a distinguished medical epidemiologist. He told the committee in his evidence that:</p>
	<p pid="c.535.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The definite statement is that some people are killed by breathing other people's smoke&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.535.1/5">The risk level is set out in the two reports of the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health, of which Professor Sir Richard Peto is a member. In its 2004 report, the scientific committee concluded that there is an estimated overall 24 per cent increased risk of lung cancer in non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke and a 25 per cent increased risk of heart disease. As a result, the committee advised that,</p>
	<p pid="c.535.1/6" class="indent">&quot;second-hand smoke represents a substantial public health hazard&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.535.1/7">It was not just Caroline Flint who said that. She repeated that evidence of a committee, one of the members of which gave evidence to the Select Committee.</p>
	<p pid="c.535.1/8">A number of noble Lords have, I suggest, rather pooh-poohed the evidence that I tried to set out on behalf of the Government in Committee. The evidence base is recognised not just in this country but internationally, not least by the 168 nations that are signatories to the World Health Organisation's framework convention on tobacco control. The evidence on the risk of second-hand smoke comes from across the world, and has been scrutinised and reviewed in great depth. The literature base is substantial and the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer report, <i>Tobacco smoke and involuntary smoking</i>, published in 2004, reviewed all the evidence of the health risks associated with smoking and second-hand smoke. It is over 1,400 pages long. The evidence is absolutely overwhelming, whatever people choose to say.</p>
	<p pid="c.535.1/9">A number of people, including the noble Lord, Lord Monson, have asked for choice and fair play. The Government are very interested in securing fair play for all those who suffer at the hands of second-hand smoke, such as all those with medical conditions like lung cancer, heart disease, asthma attacks, childhood respiratory disease and sudden instant death syndrome. Those are not myths; they are the facts of life in our country regarding people's exposure to second-hand smoke.</p>
	<p pid="c.535.1/10">The noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, drew attention to the fact that his Select Committee's report was unanimous. I suppose that most noble Lords would pay tribute to his success as a Chief Whip in the past. I am not altogether surprised that he managed to achieve a unanimous report. He also drew attention, as have other noble Lords, to the fact that public bans on smoking may mean more smoking in the home.</p>
	<p pid="c.535.1/11">Let me give the House the evidence on that. International experience provides no evidence to support the view that smoke-free legislation will encourage more people to smoke at home; we know that bans encourage smokers to give up or to reduce the number of cigarettes that they smoke, which is a beneficial secondary effect. We also know that seven out of 10 people who smoke say that they want to give up. We have assessed the impact that a ban on smoking in public places would have in reducing smoking prevalence: up to 650,000 people would be affected, which would, thereby, have a beneficial impact of reducing smoking at home. Indeed, evidence from New York suggests that 100,000 people have quit smoking since the ban was introduced there. Recent research, reported by the Royal College of Physicians in the publication <i>Going smoke-free</i> points to a statistically significant increase in the percentage of smokers who banned smoking in their own home after smoke-free laws were introduced.</p>
	<p pid="c.535.1/12">Important research was published on <phrase class="date" code="">16 June</phrase> in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i>, which reported a household survey that was conducted in Ireland before and after the introduction of smoke-free laws. Before the ban, 58 per cent of people allowed smoking in their homes, but after the workplace legislation came into effect, that figure fell to 50 per cent. The evidence points in absolutely the opposite direction as regards smoking in the home to that stated by a number of noble Lords.</p>
	<p pid="c.535.1/13">Perhaps I can correct the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, who cited the Chief Medical Officer's failure to take up his suggestion about conducting a study among airline pilots. The Chief Medical Officer has responded that he did not think that that would be helpful, because the research proposed by the noble Lord would not have resulted in a study of a scientific calibre that could be relied on; there were good grounds for not accepting the helpful suggestion from the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-19c.542.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="542"  time="016:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060619/text/60619-12.htm#60619-12_spmin0">
	<p pid="c.542.1/1">My Lords, with permission, I would like to repeat a Statement made by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister. The Statement is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.542.1/2">&quot;With permission, Mr Speaker, I shall make a Statement about the European Council held in Brussels on 15 and <phrase class="date" code="">16 June</phrase>. I would like to thank Chancellor Schuessel and the Austrian Government for their arrangements for the summit and for the way in which they conducted their presidency.</p>
	<p pid="c.542.1/3">&quot;There were two parts to this Council. On the constitutional treaty, it was agreed that there would have to be a further period of reflection, because at present there is no consensus on how to proceed. A Europe of 25, not 15, soon to become 27, and in time enlarged still further, needs a modern set of rules to function effectively. Around 15 states have ratified this treaty, but of course, there have been the No votes in France and Holland. As a result, others, including the United Kingdom, have not proceeded with ratification. The German presidency, in the first half of 2007, will therefore consult member states and present a report to the European Council. Decisions will then be taken by the end of 2008. But it was made crystal clear that, in line with last year's conclusions, there can be no presumption about the outcome of this discussion.</p>
	<p pid="c.542.1/4">&quot;The bulk of the conclusions of the Council, however, deal with the specific issues of most immediate concern to Europe's citizens. One of the key outcomes of a positive attitude towards Europe on the part of Britain was the election of President Barroso to the Commission. I welcome thoroughly his commitment to the Council to transmit direct to national parliaments all new Commission proposals and consultation papers and to take due consideration of their views. This is an important boost to a long-held British concern over subsidiarity.</p>
	<p pid="c.542.1/5">&quot;In addition, on better regulation, the Commission has already announced the withdrawal of some 70 pieces of legislation. The European Council invited the Commission to report by early 2007 on further progress&mdash;and, in particular, asked the Commission to make proposals by that time on how to reduce administrative burdens on businesses by 25 per cent. This, again, is a central British objective, on which we built alliances with other partners.</p>
	<p pid="c.542.1/6">&quot;On the single market, the Council welcomed the agreement on the services directive; welcomed agreement on the competitiveness and innovation programme; and looked forward to the Commission's forthcoming review of the single market and proposals for completing it. The services directive, in particular, is expected to deliver some 600,000 jobs across the EU and add around &euro;31 billion to the EU economy. I pay tribute to the work of British MEPs from both the Party of European Socialists and the European People's Party in securing the compromise necessary to allow it to pass.</p>
	<p pid="c.542.1/7">&quot;The Council agreed a number of specific measures and initiatives to combat illegal immigration, designed to strengthen borders while improving co-operation with some of the main source countries of migrants and refugees. In particular, the Council agreed to implement regional protection pilot projects to protect refugees in their region of origin and therefore avoid the need for mass migration. We also agreed to intensify work on readmission agreements, so that across Europe failed asylum seekers can be more easily returned.</p>
	<p pid="c.542.1/8">&quot;On energy, another of the Hampton Court initiatives, we welcomed and agreed to take forward proposals for an external energy policy, developed jointly by Javier Solana, the EU's High Representative, and the Commission. One of the priorities will be developing strategic partnerships with the main producer and transit countries, including an agreement with Russia.</p>
	<p pid="c.542.1/9">&quot;The Council also agreed declarations on the western Balkans, Iran, Iraq, the Middle East peace process, Africa, Lebanon and Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p pid="c.542.1/10">&quot;Finally, on climate change, the European Council committed itself to pursuing, in all the relevant multilateral organisations, an international goal consistent with the objective of a maximum global temperature increase of two degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels.</p>
	<p pid="c.542.1/11">&quot;This was a European Council which focused on the practical policy-driven agenda which the UK has long advocated. It demonstrated yet again the benefits of positive engagement with Europe. I commend the outcome to the House&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.542.1/12">That concludes the Statement.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-19c.592.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100680" speakername="Baroness Whitaker" colon=":" colnum="592"  time="020:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060619/text/60619-25.htm#60619-25_spnew0">
	<p pid="c.592.0/1">My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, has done a service to the governance of the UK as well as to many African states in calling attention to this excellent report. I declare an interest as a member of the Executive of the Africa All-Party Parliamentary Group, and of the Advisory Council of Transparency International (UK), the anti-corruption charity.</p>
	<p pid="c.592.0/2">The report distinguishes between grand corruption and petty corruption, which states themselves have to grapple with. They are increasingly doing so, as the noble Lord, Lord St. John, said: such as the state-funded Nigerian Government's Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, bravely rooting out fake, often death-dealing, corruptly purchased medicines; and the new Liberian President, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's code for the civil service, aimed, with legal penalties, at rooting out the corruption which she described two weeks ago in London as &quot;pervasive throughout&quot; her society. We can support this with measures such as the Private Member's Bill on reporting and transparency, which I hope to introduce shortly.</p>
	<p pid="c.592.0/3">Grand corruption, of the sort that loots national infrastructure budgets and puts the revenues of national assets into the pockets of powerful individuals, is not a matter of the internal culture of the suffering country alone. Bribery on this scale needs an, invariably foreign, investor/contractor, as well as a local recipient. John Githongo, the distinguished Kenyan former Permanent Secretary of their anti-corruption department, in a very interesting speech on <phrase class="date" code="">8 June</phrase>, described the nourishing of this corrosive evil as,</p>
	<p pid="c.592.0/4" class="indent">&quot;embedded corruption networks engineered mainly during the Cold War&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.592.0/5">when&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="c.592.0/6" class="indent">&quot;the West supported some of the most corrupt and oppressive regimes on the continent&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.592.0/7">It was to deal with this that the main international rules were developed. The UK has signed up to most of them and it has moved positively, after complaints, to improve the Export Credit Guarantee Department's anti-bribery and corruption procedures last March.</p>
	<p pid="c.592.0/8">But there is not a clear message at all about what our anti-corruption legislation consists of. The law is piecemeal and unsatisfactory; the Government's previous attempt to draft a Bill&mdash;the scrutiny committee which I was privileged to sit on&mdash;was, sadly, confusing and missed the point about overseas corruption. I hope the current consultative process will take account of all the points raised. Very many responsible companies know how to keep their house in order ethically. Those of us who read the interesting debate last week about London as a financial centre might have been struck by how crucial the culture of trust and shared values was to the original development of the City and how important it is now, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, emphasised.</p>
	<p pid="c.592.0/9">I do hope that the Government will accept the report's proposed amendment to the Company Law Reform Bill, which all our honourable friends are minded to move to close a significant loophole against money-laundering. But even more, I hope they will take the heaven-sent opportunity of a draft Bill&mdash;which business can understand and operate, and which is stimulated by the scrutiny committee's report&mdash;and which the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, is fortunately to take forward. For while the Government delay, millions suffer and many die, because of corrupt acts carried out by rich companies with impunity, including British ones. Our part of the bargain with the developing states, whose better governance we solicit, must be to reduce substantially corrupt behaviour by UK companies.</p>

	<p pid="c.598.0/1">My Lords, I, too, am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, for securing today's debate and giving us an opportunity to discuss the very fine report from the Africa All-Party Parliamentary Group, <i>The Other Side of the Coin</i>. I am delighted that it has been so well received. In fact, this evening feels rather like a meeting of the AAPPG.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/2">The report of the Commission for Africa began with an Igbo proverb:</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Not to know is bad. Not to wish to know is worse&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/4">In Africa, in international institutions, and certainly in the UK, we know there is a huge global problem relating to corruption. We know that, and my right honourable friend the Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The corrosive effect of corruption undermines all efforts to improve governance and foster development&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/6">Most importantly, this Government accept their responsibility to support African Governments in their battle against corruption. I must refute the allegation made by the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, about the lack of political will. The Government have shown extraordinary political will in their fight for Africa and against corruption in Africa. It is also good to hear reports from the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, that the tide is turning in some countries in Africa. However, I tend to agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, that the situation is extremely depressing.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/7">The UK took a lead in ensuring that addressing poverty in Africa was a priority during its G8 presidency, and that G8 leaders made commitments to address corruption at the Gleneagles summit. As noble Lords have clearly demonstrated, the consequences of international and domestic corruption for poor people in poor countries are devastating. The costs to exchequers are extraordinary, as outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, as are the human costs, but it also creates a blight on investment and public sector development and holds back economic growth. That is why DfID supports a wide range of governance reforms to prevent, detect and take action against corruption. It is why in his speech, &quot;Development Beyond Aid&quot;, at Chatham House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-23">23 February 2006</phrase>, my right honourable colleague the Secretary of State for International Development highlighted global corruption as one of the key themes of the upcoming White Paper on international development.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/8">The recommendations of the AAPPG fall into three broad categories: those where the Government are already working towards implementation; those where action plans are currently being developed and will be announced in the near future; and those where significant further work is required to determine how best to address the issues. The vast majority of the recommendations fall into the first two categories, and we warmly welcome the way in which the report raises awareness and provides an impetus for action.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/9">Sadly, it is not possible in this all-too-short debate to comment on all recommendations in detail, so I will concentrate on the six headline recommendations and answer as many questions as possible. The suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that there should be a longer debate is a matter for the usual channels, but I would support that.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/10">The first recommendation calls on the Government rigorously to enforce existing laws and sanctions against international bribery and money laundering. We have strengthened our enforcement framework and I assure noble Lords that we are firmly committed to enforcing those laws. The Serious Fraud Office now leads on vetting, monitoring and investigating allegations of overseas bribery. The Crown Prosecution Service has been restructured and now includes a fraud unit staffed by specialist prosecutors, which is likely to be in charge of future files involving overseas bribery.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/11">Like the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, we agree that we need to do more, but I stress that currently there are cases moving through the long and complex legal processes. For example, Joshua Dariye, the governor of Plateau State in Nigeria, had his UK-based assets seized in December last year. We are making efforts to return them to Nigeria and his appeal is in progress. Indeed, there are 35 overseas bribery allegations currently being vetted to see if there is sufficient evidence to open a case and there are 13 active investigations in England and Wales and one in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/12">The second headline recommendation is to bring a new anti-corruption Bill before Parliament before the end of this year. The Government agree that the law of bribery is in need of reform. That is why, in December last year, we issued a consultation paper setting out options for reform. Most of the respondents seem to have taken differing views, but shortly we hope to publish a response covering all the comments received.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/13">Bribery is a hard crime to pin down in a way that balances the interests of all stakeholders, as previous attempts to reform the law have shown. The AAPPG's views will be taken fully into account along with the views of other stakeholders, and of course the views expressed by noble Lords this evening. The noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, and my noble friend Lady Whitaker mentioned the Bill recently introduced by my honourable friend Hugh Bayley in another place. Of course, that is being studied closely and it will be taken account of in the Bill to which the Government remain committed. These are complex issues and we have to get them right; we have to ensure that the Bill is workable in the courts, which is why the process is perhaps taking longer than many noble Lords would wish.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/14">I am grateful for the offer, or the suggestion, from the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, that he should table a Private Member's Bill in the Lords. I can assure noble Lords that the Government are committed to introducing a Bill. They are carefully considering a plethora of views that have been presented. We want to continue building a consensus around a new Bill. However, ultimately it will be up to the noble Lord whether he brings forward his own Bill.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/15">The third recommendation calls on the Government to implement the third European Union money laundering directive before December 2007. The Government are confident that we will implement the directive by December 2007, and a consultation document on our proposed implementation will be published shortly. The directive provides for a co-ordinated EU-wide approach to tackling money laundering and terrorist financing, and requires banks to perform enhanced due diligence for non-domestic politically exposed persons. I am pleased to report that UK banks are already taking steps to implement these requirements.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/16">My noble friend Lord Lea spoke of the international framework. As the report made clear, this is a global problem which requires a global response. That is why we are working within the context of the G8 and OECD. The context works. For years, we advocated in the OECD development assistance committee that development agencies must influence their governments, and that is now widely accepted. A couple of weeks ago, in the same committee, we took a strong lead in advocating that all donors try to influence their governments to address supply-side corruption, and we trust that that will work in the same way.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/17">In relation to international tax treaties, the OECD has recently started an initiative on them, and I will seek to find out more information for my noble friend.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/18">The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, suggested that we should work with the African Union so that it can provide assistance and guidance to those African countries that wish to sign up to and implement the African Union Convention Against Corruption and the UN convention. That seems to be a very sensible idea, and I will certainly take it back to the department. However, it might also be something that we should discuss with colleagues in the European Parliament in view of the fact that the AU receives substantial funding from the EU.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/19">The fourth recommendation, to</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/20" class="indent">&quot;Ensure that Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories deal with corruption . . . as robustly as the UK&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/21">is problematic in tone. That is because it does not fully recognise the complexity of the constitutional arrangements between the UK and those territories. The UK overseas territories are aware of the threats posed by money laundering and corruption and the risks they carry for the reputation of their economies. The Government will continue to encourage them to counter those threats and ensure that they have robust legislation in place, in particular on financial regulations, as well as adequate enforcement capacity, and to put relevant international agreements into force. Where possible, we will offer practical help.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/22">The fifth recommendation calls for Government to,</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/23" class="indent">&quot;Report to Parliament annually on international development spending&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/24">As noble Lords will be aware, Tom Clarke's Bill, which I am delighted to say has completed its passage through the other place, will require us to report not only on aid, but also on how other issues affect development. I look forward to the Bill's Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="">29 June</phrase> when it will be introduced by my noble friend Lady Whitaker.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/25">The sixth recommendation calls for the appointment of an anti-corruption champion. We fully agree that there is a need to improve policy coherence between the large number of government departments and agencies whose work is associated with international anti-corruption and money laundering. We further agree that there should be clear responsibility for co-ordinating policy coherence and implementation across Whitehall. The strategy for realising this recommendation is currently being discussed by Ministers, but I am optimistic.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/26">Several noble Lords quite rightly raised the issue of China. China has ratified the UN Convention Against Corruption and that, together with domestic auditing reforms, shows that China is interested in discussing good governance. The Government are committed to joining international partners in a dialogue on corruption.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/27">In relation to the Company Law Reform Bill, I will respond in writing and send a copy of my letter to all noble Lords who have participated in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/28">The matter of Nigeria and the Abacha money was raised by my noble friend Lord Lea. No money has been returned to Nigeria from the UK, although some assets are currently restrained under a civil order. It is unlikely that significant funds remain here. Evidence supports the view that the UK was used as a transit route, rather than as a deposit, for most of the money. The UK stands ready to assist any international partner, including Nigeria, with requests for mutual legal assistance in accordance with our domestic law and in line with our international obligations. There is a UK initiative to provide mutual legal assistance training to Nigerian personnel to assist them in making requests, and the Home Office played a leading role in a recent training seminar in Abuja.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/29">In relation to the case of a solicitor alleged to have carried out a corrupt act in Nigeria, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual cases. The Government's consultation paper of December 2005 made a proposal to enhance the powers of the Serious Fraud Office to assist it in investigating allegations of bribery overseas so that they can be cleared up.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/30">The AAPPG is to be warmly congratulated on the publication of <i>The Other Side of the Coin</i>. It draws attention to the scale of the challenges, makes a set of complex issues accessible and will act as a catalyst for further change.</p>
	<p pid="c.598.0/31">The Government's response to the report will of course be published in the near future. I regret that it has taken some time, but, as the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, acknowledged it is a cross-department responsibility. <i>The Other Side of the Coin</i> has already been influential in shaping the global corruption aspects of the White Paper. I am confident that many of the concerns expressed today will be alleviated when the full extent of the Government's commitment on those issues is made known. Like the AAPPG and noble Lords who have participated today, the Government remain committed to Africa and to tackling corruption, which is a critical obstacle to its development.</p>
