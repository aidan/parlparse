</speech>

	<p pid="a.1925.2/1">My Lords, the Government's priority remains to ensure a successful conclusion to the Doha round of the World Trade Organisation negotiations, which would provide a freer and fairer international trading system that addresses the interests of developing countries. The Government are continuing to work with EU partners, the European Commission and other WTO members to get the WTO negotiations back on track.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-11-19a.1925.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100341" speakername="Lord Judd" colon=":" colnum="1925"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-01.htm#31119-01_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1925.3/1">My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the present situation is grotesque, in which the richest countries, with only 14 per cent of the world's population, enjoy 75 per cent of the world's exports, while the poorest countries, with 40 per cent of the world's population, account for only 3 per cent of world trade? Does he further agree that that provides no basis for world stability and security? Will the Government now ensure that development invariably becomes central to trade policy, that non-reciprocity and differentials favouring poor countries will be promoted, and that the common agricultural policy&mdash;which positively harms agriculture in the poorest countries&mdash;is fundamentally reformed? Above all, can my noble friend assure us that, in future, the Government will treat as a priority the needs of the poorest countries of the world rather than the preoccupations of the rich?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.1925.4/1">My Lords, I agree that the distribution of wealth in the world is greatly distorted and leads to poverty, which is to be deplored. The most important issue in regard to the Doha negotiations is the question of getting rid of agricultural subsidies. That must be a major focus because, more than anything else, their removal would help the poorer countries. Further, right from the start it has been recognised that the needs of the poorest countries are central to the Doha negotiations.</p>

	<p pid="a.1926.0/1">My Lords, what meetings have taken place in the run-up to the senior officials' meeting to be held on 15th December in Geneva&mdash;only three weeks away? Have representatives from the United Kingdom attended those preliminary meetings?</p>

	<p pid="a.1926.1/1">My Lords, the Cancun conference agreed a new deadline of 15th December to resolve those issues which could not be agreed. Negotiations, undertaken in restricted groups, are now continuing in Geneva. The atmosphere in those negotiations is positive, but substantial progress has not yet been made.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-11-19a.1926.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100270" speakername="Lord Hannay of Chiswick" colon=":" colnum="1926"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-01.htm#31119-01_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.1926.2/1">My Lords, does the Minister agree that the highest priority must be to ensure that the European Union should, at a very early stage, resolve any ambiguity in its attitude and make it absolutely clear at the summit to be held in Brussels in December that it favours a resumption of the Doha round to take place as early as possible?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.1926.3/1">My Lords, there is no question of the fact that we believe that the Doha Round should continue. While the collapse of the Cancun conference was disappointing, along with all other countries we are quite clear that it should not be allowed to become a fatal setback and that we need to get the discussions back on track as soon as possible. I do not think that there has ever been any question about that; it is a common position taken by other countries.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-11-19a.1926.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100467" speakername="Baroness Northover" colon=":" colnum="1926"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-01.htm#31119-01_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.1926.4/1">My Lords, can the Minister tell the House whether the Government are using their special relationship with the United States to persuade the Americans to drop not only their own tariffs on steel imports, but also to engage in multilateral talks on trade rather than bilateral talks, which benefit the stronger rather than the weaker countries?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-11-19a.1926.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="1926"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-01.htm#31119-01_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.1926.5/1">My Lords, it is well known that the Government are taking a strong line on the question of the US steel tariffs, which the World Trade Organisation has now rejected, declaring them to be illegal. Of course we are keen to ensure, so far as any country is concerned, that this whole round should not degenerate into any form of bilateral deal as opposed to continuing with multilateral agreements.</p>

	<p pid="a.1926.6/1">My Lords, given that my noble friend on the Front Bench mentioned in his first response the imperative of ensuring agricultural reform, can he tell us with some precision the actions taken by Her Majesty's Government in the recent budget round to reduce the proportion of the European budget spent on agriculture? Further, can he say whether he deems that agricultural reform is anything like approaching satisfaction?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.1927.0/1">My Lords, as part of the run-up to the discussions in Cancun, the European Union agreed to significant reforms of the common agricultural policy that will mean substantial cuts in trade-distorting support and export subsidies which do so much damage to the whole cause of the developing world. That marked an important start in the negotiations, but no doubt there is further room to continue with the work.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-11-19a.1927.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100193" speakername="Lord Elton" colon=":" colnum="1927"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-01.htm#31119-01_spnew10">
	<p pid="a.1927.1/1">My Lords, does the Minister agree that the current imbalance in world trade is unacceptable not only on the grounds of compassion, but also unsafe in terms of ensuring the security of this country in a stable world? Does he further agree that any measures to effect a change to that imbalance would be so big that they will affect our own living standards? Have the Government given any thought to talking to the other parties about an agreed policy so that this issue does not become a casualty of successive election campaigns?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-11-19a.1927.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="1927"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-01.htm#31119-01_spnew11">
	<p pid="a.1927.2/1">My Lords, we are discussing trade. It is clear from all the studies undertaken by the World Bank, the European Union and others that if there could be a substantial reduction of, say, 50 per cent in protectionist measures, that could boost the incomes of developing countries by around 150 billion dollars; that is, by three times the level of current aid flows. However, that would not mean that there would be any adverse effect on the position of the developed world in the sense that one of the benefits of free trade is that by reducing tariff barriers, it is possible to increase the total wealth of the world. That is the basis of free trade and it is the basis on which we are negotiating.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-11-19a.1927.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100180" speakername="Lord Dubs" colon=":" colnum="1927"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-01.htm#31119-01_spnew12">
	<p pid="a.1927.3/1">My Lords, does my noble friend agree that the position of the European Union at Cancun contributed to the breakdown of the talks? Can he give an assurance that the EU now has an agreed position which takes account of the failure of the negotiations at Cancun and which will be a positive basis for the talks to be held during December in Geneva?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-11-19a.1927.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100559" speakername="Lord Sainsbury of Turville" colon=":" colnum="1927"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-01.htm#31119-01_spnew13">
	<p pid="a.1927.4/1">My Lords, while the trigger for the breakdown of the negotiations at Cancun was the question of the &quot;Singapore issues&quot;, a number of other matters were still on the table, the main one being the demands made by the developing world for a further reduction in agricultural tariffs. Obviously we shall be moving forward from the current position. I think that my right honourable friend the Secretary of State made it clear on 17th September in the other place that we would be operating on the basis of the concessions that had already been made, rather than seeking to go back to earlier positions. That means that the WTO agreements on investment and competition are now off the European Union agenda.</p>

	<p pid="a.1928.2/1">My Lords, my officials have had discussions with the Metropolitan Police, the Greater London Authority and the City of Westminster about the displays in Parliament Square. The nature and location of these displays means that there is no immediate action that can be taken. The Procedure Committee in the other place has examined the Sessional Orders and Resolutions, including the Sessional Order designed to keep the access to Parliament open. The committee published its report this morning and we will consider its findings most carefully.</p>

	<p pid="a.1928.3/1">My Lords, we shall be interested to see the result of that consideration. Is the Minister aware that the dirty and untidy encampment has now become a permanent feature of Parliament Square? Most of the time it is left empty for any protester to take over and use as they will. Is not planning permission necessary for camping arrangements in that area? If so, who gave that permission? If planning permission is not required, can any member of the public park their mobile homes, vans or cars there? Does not the Minister agree that tourists come from all the four corners of the earth to see Westminster? Does he not think that this eyesore is defiling the most beautiful parliament building in the world?</p>

I know that it will take a great interest in that. Part of the issue for variable fees is to allow institutions to be able to lower fees as well as increase them, thereby looking at where shortages occur in our economic life and with regard to students entering courses. This may well be an area which the department would consider. I remind noble Lords that that is different from traditional debt. This is about investment in one's future as a student and a graduate. Students will not pay back anything until they are earning a minimum of &pound;15,000, and then they will pay back only what they have borrowed.</p>

	<p pid="a.1934.2/1">My Lords, the Metropolitan Police report that in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks in Istanbul, a senior Metropolitan Police officer met members of the Jewish community. Generally, advice is issued, when appropriate, to regional police chief officers in response to security assessment and in consideration of current events. All forces are encouraged to work closely with community contacts on security issues. Community involvement is a key strand to the police counter-terrorism effort.</p>

	<p pid="a.1934.3/1">My Lords, I thank my noble friend for his Answer. Does he recognise the very great and sad recent change in the nature of racist attacks? They tend no longer to be simply racist or anti-semitic shouts or attacks on individuals. Indeed, in the past week they have included the attacks on the synagogues in Istanbul, to which my noble friend referred, resulting in murders and injuries, as well as the attack on the Jewish school in Paris. There is very great concern among the smaller communities in this country at the growth of this sort of terrorism.</p>
	<p pid="a.1934.3/2">Has my noble friend seen the lead article on the front page of The Times today that a terrorist suspect in custody told detectives of a 15 to 20-strong cell of Algerian supporters of Al'Qaeda, ready to launch a terrorist attack? Their intended targets are understood to be synagogues in London and Manchester. What steps are Her Majesty's Government proposing to take to meet what is regarded as a very serious and growing concern?</p>

	<p pid="a.1934.4/1">My Lords, we recognise that this is a very serious and growing concern. Anti-semitic attacks have, sadly, increased over the last few years. We are aware of the article in The Times. Only yesterday, a special meeting took place involving police officers from the specialist departments, ACPO and Jewish communities to discuss security issues, particularly in the light of recent events. Obviously we will be ever vigilant because of the very real and profound concerns which understandably exist within the Jewish community.</p>

In Iraq, for instance, there are attacks on the soldiers and the citizens, there have been attacks on synagogues, as the noble Lord, Lord Janner, said, especially in Turkey, and there is also the threat that something will be done in this country.</p>

	<p pid="a.1935.2/1">My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Janner, for raising the matter. There is a serious concern among minorities to the extent that religious premises fail to receive adequate police protection. Is the Minister aware that only 10 days ago, in a temple in Ealing Road, two people entered while worship was going on, broke the statue of worship and shouted anti-Indian slogans? If we fail to protect those communities, they will take the law into their own hands, which would damage community relations. Is it not about time that the police provided adequate protection, not only to the temples, gurdwaras and mosques but to any of the places of worship that are so precious to minorities in this country?</p>

	<p pid="a.1935.3/1">My Lords, we are obviously aware of that attack. The police are vigilant in these matters&mdash;they have been exceptionally vigilant. Special meetings take place regularly, and all police services in the United Kingdom are particularly aware of the issues that the noble Lord raises. I dispute the suggestion that the police lack vigilance; clearly, they care greatly and deeply, as we all do, about these matters. I add my congratulations to the general congratulations to the police service on tackling them.</p>

	<p pid="a.1935.4/1">My Lords, given the fight against terrorism, to which we are all committed, and after the penetration of Buckingham Palace by a Daily Mirror reporter, does that not underline the necessity for a biometric national identity card? Members opposite complain about the police not doing their job, but it might help if they supported the police request for such a measure.</p>

	<p pid="a.1936.1/1">My Lords, I am entirely at one with the noble Viscount. There are regular meetings between the various ethnic communities, who experience and feel threats most regularly. There is a general encouragement in the police service to ensure that racist attacks are dealt with and dealt with promptly. It is perhaps worth saying that, over the past couple of years, there has been a big increase in the number of cases brought forward by the police for prosecution with regard to racially motivated crime, and a very welcome increase in the number of defendants prosecuted and brought to justice.</p>

Could extra vigilance be given to those groups who have used the method of suicide bombing in the weekend atrocities in Turkey and other places? It is the most natural thing to see cars pulling up outside schools. Could schools, especially schools with Jewish children, have some special attention in that regard?</p>

Many have been granted to companies that were former employers of members of the administration, including Vice-President Cheney.

For the contracts given by a whole range of bodies, including the Coalition Provisional Authority, US AID and the US Army Corps, the last figures that we have seen are very out of date&mdash;they date back to August.

	<p pid="a.1937.5/1">My Lords, under Department of Defense procurement rules, foreign firms are eligible to bid on prime contracts, although there is a presumption of giving preference to US firms that are able to carry out the work. In practice, most UK companies are either looking to bid on prime contracts in joint ventures with US partners or to bid for sub-contracts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1937.5/2">Iraqi companies are playing a very large part in the process. I mentioned the last figures that we have on the Bechtel situation, which showed that a higher percentage of the contracts were going to Iraqi companies than to American companies.</p>

	<p pid="a.1940.6/1">My Lords, I beg to move that the House do not insist on its Amendment No. 2 to which the Commons have disagreed for their reason numbered 2A. I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 4 and 8, to which the Commons have disagreed for the reasons numbered 4A and 8A. I shall speak first to Amendment No. 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.1940.6/2">The deletion of this clause from the Bill places an unnecessary restriction on a practical and efficient way of overcoming some of the resource and logistical problems of arranging reviews. The clause will maintain the application of these important safeguards but broaden the capacity so that telephone reviews can be used where they are considered the most practical and efficient approach. It will provide the review officer with a straightforward alternative of reviewing in person or by telephone. In so doing, however, he must consider each case individually and decide the most appropriate way to conduct the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1940.6/3">We have made it clear in guidance that specific consideration must be given in the case of vulnerable suspects, including juveniles. The clause follows the recommendation of the joint Home Office and Cabinet Office review of PACE that allowing the use of telephone reviews in a wider set of circumstances would better serve the needs of the police and the rights of suspects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1940.6/4">I shall speak now to Amendment No. 4. At present the law allows the police the discretion to retain the fingerprints and non-intimate samples taken by them during the investigation of an offence of persons suspected of having committed a recordable offence. This amendment as drafted would not only require the police to destroy the fingerprints and samples taken from persons arrested for a recordable offence and not subsequently charged; it would also put the law back to the position prior to the changes made in 2001. That change to the law has proven to be extremely important.</p>
	<p pid="a.1940.6/5">The custodian of the National DNA Database tells us that there are now approximately 103,000 DNA profiles on the database which would have previously been removed under PACE. Of those, approximately 4,600 profiles of individuals have been linked with crime scene stains involving 4,760 offences. Those offences include 26 murders, 15 attempted murders, 27 rapes, 13 sexual offences, 14 aggravated burglaries and six of the supply of controlled drugs. Those are all offences which were committed after the person had been acquitted of an earlier charge. We therefore ask whether we really want to revert to a situation where the police would be denied this type of crucial intelligence in the investigation of crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.1940.6/6">I turn to Amendment No. 8. As originally drafted, this clause provided for the Secretary of State to alter, by order made by statutory instrument, the minimum age at which persons in police detention may be tested for specified class A drugs&mdash;that is, heroin, crack and cocaine. The clause also provided for the order to be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure. This delegation and level of scrutiny was considered to be appropriate by the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform. These provisions are to be introduced in limited areas on a pilot basis initially. We maintain that it is important that the Secretary of State should have the ability to change the minimum age, either up or down. It is our intention that any decision to change the minimum age for drug testing will be made only after full consideration of all the available evidence and will take account of the views of relevant bodies. I therefore urge your Lordships not to insist on your Amendments Nos. 2, 4 and 8.</p>

	<p pid="a.1942.4/1">My Lords, I beg to move that the House do not insist on its Amendment No. 32 to which the Commons have disagreed for their reason numbered 32A.</p>
	<p pid="a.1942.4/2">These amendments deal with the issue of jury trial. I shall come in a moment to the amendments to Clause 42 which the Government made in another place yesterday and which respond to concerns raised by Her Majesty's loyal Opposition and those sitting opposite. First, however, I should like to set the wider context of this provision by explaining why it is in the Bill and why it is important that it stays there.</p>
	<p pid="a.1942.4/3">Fraud is on the increase. Technological advance, the growing sophistication of the market and the proliferation of financial instruments and products have created new opportunities for fraud. Its economic impact is huge. On latest statistics, fraud is costing the country about &pound;14 billion per year, as against &pound;1 billion in 1985. Therefore, I think your Lordships will agree that fraud harms us all. It affects individual savings, pensions, investments and jobs. It also has direct costs that impact ultimately on the whole of society.</p>
	<p pid="a.1942.4/4">Clause 42 addresses a particular problem within the wider fraud arena. It recognises and seeks to deal with a small&mdash;I repeat &quot;small&quot;&mdash;number of fraud and other financial cases where there are clear difficulties in conducting a trial by jury. Those difficulties are not abstract and theoretical but have been encountered in practice. The courts themselves have expressed the gravest concerns about the threat to justice inherent in making these kinds of case manageable for juries. That has long been recognised, as I think even those who oppose Clause 42 would acknowledge. The Roskill report on serious fraud in 1986, the establishment of the Serious Fraud Office and Lord Justice Auld's independent review are all evidence of attempts to respond to these difficulties over the past few decades. The case for change has commanded general support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1942.4/5">Considerable and, for the most part, successful&mdash;I wish to emphasise that&mdash;efforts have been made to try to help the courts in managing the trial process in such cases. The preparatory hearing regimes in the Criminal Justice Act 1987 and the Criminal Procedure and Investigations Act 1996 are working well. However, there continue to be a few exceptional cases&mdash;one must regard them as exceptional&mdash;that are so lengthy and/or complex that they stubbornly resist the best efforts of all involved to reduce the burden on the jury without imperilling justice. The need to meet the imperative of manageability for juries means that these trials are currently being carved up in a way that simply cannot be said to serve the interests of justice. They are divided into separate trials, evidence is pared down and charges reduced. Secondary defendants who should notwithstanding be prosecuted are not brought to justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1942.4/6">Even in the event of a conviction, losses to the public interest and to confidence in the criminal justice system arise from the fact that the jury has been asked to reach a verdict on an artificially truncated version of the facts. The totality of the offending is not exposed; judges are unable to sentence on the basis of the full criminality and the public at large are never told the whole story. So justice, not least justice for victims, is not done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1942.4/7">Serious fraud trials can last for months. They place an excessive and unreasonable burden on the members of the jury. They also make it difficult to ensure a representative jury. Jury service is an important civic duty but there must be proper limits to the imposition that it is right to make on jurors' lives. Clause 42 requires the judge to ensure that all the options that would allow jury trial have been thoroughly tested. The threshold for non-jury trial is a high one, and deliberately so. Where it is necessary in the interests of justice looked at in the round for a case to be conducted without a jury we would ask, what possible case can there be for doing anything else?</p>
	<p pid="a.1942.4/8">A number of comments have been made, first, in relation to whether we are creating a two-tier system of justice. We are not. I remind noble Lords of what was said by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cooke. I refer to his experience in New Zealand where this provision has been in existence for 20 years or so and has had no disadvantageous effect upon the availability of jury trial in normal cases. We believe that these provisions are appropriate.</p>

	<p pid="a.1943.1/1">My Lords, I should like to follow the example of the Minister in seeking to address the debate on the other amendments that deal with jury trials.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943.1/2">As probably several noble Lords did, I listened to the full debate on these Lords amendments in the other place yesterday. I was very concerned that the Home Secretary, Mr Blunkett, did not follow the example of the noble Baroness. He was very critical of this place. First, he said that we had not had a sensible debate. I recall that in July we had a very wide-ranging debate. Hugely important issues were raised and a number of noble Lords clearly expressed deep feelings of anger at any attempt to fetter the right to jury trial. To regard that as not a very sensible debate was not helpful. Indeed, Mr Blunkett said that we had scored a pyrrhic victory. Noble Lords will know that in 279 BC the Greek leader, Pyrrhus, scored a great victory over the Romans. I suppose that the analogy that Mr Blunkett used concerned the great cost of that victory. However, I am afraid that he was badly advised. I consulted the website of The Oxford English Dictionary and of Webster's. Mr Blunkett could hardly have failed to notice&mdash;although this must be another bid by him to appeal to the Left wing of the Labour Party&mdash;or he should have noticed, that there was a press release some weeks ago by the editors of The Oxford English Dictionary stating that the phrase &quot;pyrrhic victory&quot; was to be removed from the dictionary because, rather like this Government, it had outlived its usefulness.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943.1/3">Did Mr Blunkett know that, according to John Smytheton, chief editor of The Oxford English Dictionary, the phrase, &quot;pyrrhic victory&quot; is to be replaced with &quot;Bush victory&quot; in the next edition of The Oxford English Dictionary? Perhaps the Home Secretary was not up to date on that. However, he was also very critical of the fact that we do not have a Speaker or Deputy Speaker and that we have no means of timetabling our debates. In fact, the debate in the other place took one hour 45 minutes, of which Mr Blunkett took over 30 minutes. I counted another 12 speakers who were trying to get in. That is the evil of timetabling. Mr Blunkett said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1943.1/4" class="indent">&quot;There is no procedure in the House of Lords for any sort of timetable or closure mechanism, nor any provision for the operation of the Speaker and Deputy Speaker system . . . Until we have such a system in the Lords, we cannot take anyone's word that that House will be in favour of anything that we propose&quot;.&mdash;[Official Report, Commons, 18/11/03; col. 652.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1943.1/5">I hope that Mr Blunkett will regret those words. Those are the words of a senior Cabinet Minister so at least we know what this Government would have in store for us. However, we shall carry on having our high quality debates without timetabling.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943.1/6">On 15th July your Lordships decided to remove entirely from the Bill what was then Part 7. Now the other place insists that those clauses should be restored. I hope I speak for the majority when I say that we remain opposed to the Government's proposals which would allow a defendant to elect trial by judge alone, and those which would allow judge-only trials in so-called complex cases. We believe that allowing defendants to elect non-jury trial would be divisive and would create an unacceptable two-tier system. Defendants charged with offences attracting serious public opprobrium would opt out of the jury system; others would engage in forum shopping, hoping for a particularly liberal judge. I have to tell the Government that they are wrong. Similarly, we cannot accept the Government's proposals to do away with jury trial in complex and lengthy cases. Juries are perfectly capable of understanding the key issues relevant to guilt or innocence in such cases. It is a simple matter for the jury to decide whether someone is dishonest. That is its task, and it fulfils it extremely well.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943.1/7">There are other avenues whereby fraud trials could be made less complex and lengthy. I have a press release issued on 30th July 2002 by the Law Commission. It had been asked by Mr Straw to look into ways in which the law on fraud could be made more readily comprehensible to juries. That is a very simple task, but one that the Law Commission took some considerable time&mdash;more than four years&mdash;to fulfil. It came forward with a draft fraud Bill, which would certainly simplify the law on fraud. I have asked the Home Office and the Library what has happened to the Law Commission's proposals, why there has been no comment from the Government on the proposals, and why on earth we are suddenly seeking to tamper with the jury system without having properly considered the fraud Bill. I hope that the Minister responds.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943.1/8">The Government propose to do away with juries in any case in which there are complex or lengthy issues of a,</p>
	<p pid="a.1943.1/9" class="indent">&quot;financial or commercial nature or which relate to property&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1943.1/10">so many more cases will be affected than the Government have claimed. The proposal is not related simply to complex fraud trials, but could affect all sorts of cases, from drug dealing to health and safety prosecutions. I hope that the Minister will understand when I say that we cannot accept the Government's proposals on defendant election and complex and lengthy cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943.1/11">This House has come to recognise the force of the arguments made in relation to jury tampering. We on these Benches and the Opposition in another place have reflected long and hard on what was said in this House on 15th July, and on what was said outside Parliament, most notably by Sir John Stevens, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner. I hope that your Lordships will recall that I said on that occasion that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1943.1/12" class="indent">&quot;we have much sympathy with the police if indeed, as the Deputy Commissioner revealed in a letter to The Times today, this problem is growing. Let us look at the details and consider what it is best to do&quot;.&mdash;[Official Report, 15/7/03; col. 773.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1943.1/13">One way forward to attempt to tackle jury tampering was suggested by my honourable friends in another place in May. Intimidation of juries is an evil that has to be stopped, but so does intimidation of the judge, of witnesses and of parties. We all agree that that evil has to be stamped out.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943.1/14">The noble and learned Lord, Lord Donaldson, said in our previous debate&mdash;I will not quote him in full&mdash;that he had been persuaded that there had to be a way forward. We have listened to the arguments and have been persuaded that, where a trial has had to be aborted because of jury tampering, it should be open to the judge to order that any retrial should be before a judge of the Crown Court alone, sitting without a jury. That was the proposal put forward by Mr Letwin in another place on 19th May, and the opposition amendments would preserve the right of everyone charged on indictment in the Crown Court to have a jury trial in the first instance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943.1/15">We do not subscribe to the idea that it would be desirable to dispense with jury trial completely in some cases, which was the original proposal in the Bill. However, we accept that if someone has abused the right to a jury trial by seeking to pervert the jury's verdict, it should be open to the judge to prevent that happening a second time. There would, of course, be an appeal against the judge's decision under our proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943.1/16">The essential principle is that justice must be done. For those who abuse the right to jury trial and seek to pervert the system in their favour, we have been persuaded of the case for change. Having said that, we remain opposed to what the Government seek to do. We remain committed to the fundamental principle of ensuring that every defendant in the Crown Court has the right to a jury trial in first instance. That remains our position, but we accept the force of the arguments made in relation to cases where jury tampering has taken place. However, so far the Government have not come forward with proposals that we could accept.</p>
	<p pid="a.1943.1/17">Moved, as an amendment to the Motion that the House do not insist on its Amendment No. 32 to which the Commons have disagreed for their reason numbered 32A, leave out &quot;not&quot;.&mdash;(Lord Hunt of Wirral.)</p>

	<p pid="a.1946.0/1">My Lords, we on these Benches support Amendment No. 32B. Everything that could be said on this topic has been said in the days in Committee and on Report. The fact that Mr Blunkett made the comments referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, demonstrates that he has as much understanding of this House and the way in which we consider matters as he has of the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1946.0/2">The noble Baroness seemed to think that it should be put on the debit side that the prosecution in a complex case simplify issues and pare them down. I do not regard that as something wrong in any way. It is very important that the public understands what a case is about. When we get to a situation in which there is a private conversation between lawyers in a criminal case&mdash;the prosecution, the defence and the judge&mdash;and when it is only the judge who can understand what is going on and members of the public cannot, it will be a bad day for the criminal justice system of this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1946.0/3">I put that in the context that public confidence in the jury system remains as high as ever. The proposals are not put forward in a climate in which the public is calling for change in the area. The verdict of a jury, whether guilty or not guilty, commands respect and acceptance. The longer that that stays with us the better. I do not intend to weary your Lordships any further with the amendment. We will support it.</p>

	<p pid="a.1947.0/1">My Lords, Clause 43 gives the prosecution the possibility of asking for a judge-only trial, provided that certain conditions are satisfied relating to the burden that there would be on a jury, if it were a jury trial, and to the complexity of the facts. It has been said, particularly by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that if there is any difficulty in the jury comprehending the details of a fraud indictment, the case should be simplified because juries certainly understand the difference between honesty and dishonesty. There are dangers in that, however, as my noble friend pointed out, if the details of the prosecution case are withheld from the jury. If it does not get, receive or hear evidence about the details, the full force and strength of a prosecution case may be diminished.</p>
	<p pid="a.1947.0/2">I shall dare to repeat what may have been mentioned in Committee. The Government's White Paper, Justice for All, stated in 2002 that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1947.0/3" class="indent">&quot;prosecutions often pare down cases to try and make them more manageable and comprehensible to a jury. This means the full criminality of such a fraud is not always exposed&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1947.0/4">Perhaps I may raise a point that has not yet been raised today. Who actually constitutes the jury in these complex cases? Is it really randomly selected? In the Maxwell case, 700 jurors were called and 550 were excused. Juries in these complex cases are likely to be less representative of the general community than in the norm of criminal trials, and they are unlikely to be peers of the people sitting in the dock. I fear that the jurors called who are not excused may be least likely to have experience of accounting or business. People running their own businesses and people with significant positions in industry and the professions are most likely to be excused jury service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1947.0/5">I fear that not enough was said during earlier stages of the Bill about the length and difficulty of some fraud cases. The Maxwell case, to which I referred, began in May 1995 and lasted until January 1996. It resulted in an acquittal to defraud the Maxwell pensioners of &pound;122 million. The jury took 12 days to reach its verdict. It had taken 131 trial days and the cost was reported as being about &pound;20 million.</p>
	<p pid="a.1947.0/6">In November 2002, The Times reported the acquittals of certain businessmen, the chairman of a company and finance directors who had been charged with fraud&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1948.1/1">My Lords, frequently they have and they can certainly understand more readily than many of us what is explained to them. I do not want to lengthen the debate, so perhaps I may put in parenthesis the fact that I would prefer a system whereby the judge sat with assessors who were particularly knowledgeable of finance and so forth. That suggestion is not before us in the Bill. There should be jury trials in every case or, alternatively, the possibility of requesting that it be a judge-only trial. That possibility, subject to conditions and to appeal as provided for in the Bill, deserves the support of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1948.1/2">In conclusion, it is worthwhile drawing attention to an article which appeared in the Financial Times two or three days after our debates in Committee by a former head of the Serious Fraud Office, Miss Rosalind Wright. She suggested what were the advantages, at any rate in some cases, of trial without a jury. She mentioned that the judge,</p>
	<p pid="a.1948.1/3" class="indent">&quot;could read the documents in advance of the trial and cut through the swathes of paper in the courtroom; he could ruthlessly limit cross-examination and speeches; he could give a reasoned judgment at the conclusion of the proceedings&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1948.1/4">juries, of course, never give reasoned judgments&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1948.1/5" class="indent">&quot;which would assist both prosecution and defence in understanding how the verdict was arrived at&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1948.1/6">and no doubt be of assistance as a precedent in later cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1948.1/7">There is a strong case for allowing the Commons view to prevail&mdash;that there should be a possibility of asking for a trial by judge alone&mdash;and I hope that we will not persist in this House in continuing opposition to that.</p>

	<p pid="a.1948.2/1">My Lords, I regret that I was abroad when the House last discussed juries. The House will be cheered that I will not repeat the arguments used on that occasion. The debate has been broadened by the Opposition into some observations which appertain to the next clause and it may be convenient if I deal briefly with both.</p>
	<p pid="a.1948.2/2">First, I am fundamentally opposed to tampering with the right to trial by jury&mdash;either at the instigation of the prosecution or the defence. Secondly, although I cannot go into the Lobby to support the Government, I accept with regret that at this juncture the views of the elected House must prevail.</p>
	<p pid="a.1948.2/3">As a practitioner in criminal law all my working life, save for the 13 years as a Minister and a senior Law Officer of the Crown, I believe that in the overwhelming number of cases the jury system in England and Wales works with young or old jurors, short or long trials, simple or complicated trials. That has been my experience most of my working life.</p>
	<p pid="a.1948.2/4">Since 1972, when the Criminal Law Revision Committee reported, there have been repeated attempts in one direction or the other to limit jury trials. In each case, one or other House of Parliament has resisted such attempts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1948.2/5">The Government have rightly watered down their original proposals in Clause 42. Their original proposals were unsustainable. There remains the only part of reform where I have a real sympathy for such trials which are really burdensome to jurors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1948.2/6">The longest criminal trial in which I was involved began in February and finished in September. All of us felt the burden. But is this enough for a change? I welcome Clause 42(6), respelling the duty of the judge to reduce complexity or length. A more active judicial role is to be welcomed. The Court of Appeal from time to time has dealt with the question of overburdening the indictments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1948.2/7">But before the House embarks on this unhappy part of the legislation, perhaps I may quote what was written a long time ago&mdash;more than two centuries&mdash;by Blackstone in his commentaries. He stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1948.2/8" class="indent">&quot;The truth of every accusation . . . should afterwards be confirmed by the unanimous suffrage of twelve of his equals and neighbours, indifferently chosen, and superior to all suspicion. So that the liberties of England cannot but subsist, so long as this palladium remains sacred and inviolate; not only from all open attacks (which none will be so hardy as to make)&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1948.2/9">he did not reckon with Mr Blunkett&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1948.2/10" class="indent">&quot;but also from the secret machinations, which may sap and undermine it; by introducing new and arbitrary methods of trials by justices of the peace, commissioners of the revenue, and courts of conscience. And however convenient these may appear at first (as doubtless all arbitrary powers, well executed, are the most convenient), yet let it be again remembered, that delays, and little inconveniences in the forms of justice, are the price that all free nations must pay for their liberty in more substantial matters; that these inroads upon this sacred bulwark of the nation are fundamentally opposite to the spirit of our constitution; and that, though begun in trifles, the precedent may gradually increase and spread, to the utter disuse of juries in questions of the most momentous concern.&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1948.2/11">I commend those remarks. If we are to go down this road, I hope that Blackstone's Commentaries will be remembered when we next discuss it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-11-19a.1949.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100058" speakername="Viscount Bledisloe" colon=":" colnum="1949"  time="015:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-07.htm#31119-07_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.1949.0/1">My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, will have very successfully curdled the blood of the House by reciting some of the comments made by Mr Blunkett in another place about your Lordships' House. If Mr Blunkett considers it necessary that we have a Speaker in this House in order that the Government may get their way, I should have thought that he will have fairly conclusively decided for this House how it will feel about that. I am very pleased to see that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, is in his place to hear those views so that he may take them into account in his committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.1949.0/2">The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and others, have made a very powerful case for the right to a jury trial. But surely the amendment currently before the House&mdash;Amendment No. 32&mdash;concerns the question of the defendant's ability to abandon that right. Surely it is a corollary of every right that one is entitled not to exercise it. I have to confess that I find the noble Lord's case on that amendment far weaker than his case on the others, where the right is being taken away from the defendant rather than being voluntarily surrendered by the defendant. If the noble Lord is minded to test the opinion of the House, I wonder whether he will consider it more appropriate to test it on the later amendments, where the right is taken away, rather than on the defendant's right to surrender his right. At present, I cannot understand the objection to that.</p>

	<p pid="a.1950.0/1">My Lords, I support what the noble Viscount has just suggested. In Committee, I mentioned an immensely complicated fraud case which lasted for five weeks. By the time the case had gone on for two or three weeks, the jury, which largely consisted of not very well educated people, did not have a clue what was going on. Therefore, I feel that a degree of flexibility in this matter is necessary. If the defendant wants a jury, he should have it. But if he feels that he is not obtaining justice with the aid of a jury, a jury should no longer be inflicted on the court.</p>

	<p pid="a.1950.1/1">My Lords, I know that it is rather dangerous for someone who has not been directly involved in the judiciary to trespass on this debate. Nevertheless, I sometimes think that those closely involved do not see the wood for the trees.</p>
	<p pid="a.1950.1/2">The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, was very critical of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary in regard to a pyrrhic victory. I am not sure what point was being made, although he referred to the Oxford Dictionary. But I believe that the general understanding is that a pyrrhic victory does not have very much value.</p>
	<p pid="a.1950.1/3">I believe that if we want justice to prevail, our legislation must ensure that that happens. Having considered this matter, the Government found that some fraud cases are rather prolonged, generally organised crime is involved and no one supports the culprit. We want to preserve the protection of the victim. Consequently, the law enforcement associations in this country support what the Home Secretary is putting forward. I do not want us to enter into an academic judicial argument of principle when the practical application should ensure that justice prevails in this country. The British people should be supported by a system which ensures that the guilty are, in fact, convicted. I hope that this House will support what the Home Secretary is doing.</p>

	<p pid="a.1950.2/1">My Lords, I want to make one or two short interventions on this matter. Reference has just been made to the right to surrender the right to a jury in complex cases. If that right is given, why should it not apply to all cases? That, indeed, was one proposal in the Bill. The answer was simply that if there is a right in all cases, when the jury sit in a jury case, in a number of cases they will say, &quot;Why hasn't he chosen a judge alone? This surely means that he is trying to pull the wool over our eyes&quot;. Largely for that reason, the proposal was rejected and, I believe, rightly so. I believe that we should have a trial process which is appropriate throughout.</p>
	<p pid="a.1950.2/2">My second point is that the percentage of success in long fraud cases was quoted as being, I believe, in the region of 80 per cent. I stress that that figure was achieved without the procedure alterations which have been advised and to which the Government have paid no attention at all. There is no reason not to expect that the figure of 80 per cent will increase if the procedures are improved. Therefore, I suggest to your Lordships that the amendment is not appropriate and that we should stick to juries throughout.</p>
	<p pid="a.1950.2/3">Perhaps I may remind your Lordships that jury trial carries the perception of a better class of justice&mdash;certainly with the minorities. That perception will not be brought to an end. It is based in part on sheer prejudice but also in part on the fact that judges subconsciously have a bias pro prosecution. That is understandable. At least 90 per cent of prosecution cases have been thoroughly investigated and proceedings brought as a result. The judge becomes case-hardened and says to himself, consciously or subconsciously, &quot;I have heard all this before&quot;. That is one reason for the perception. But the perception is there; it is very strong; and we ignore it at our peril.</p>

	<p pid="a.1951.0/1">My Lords, I have listened with great care to everything that noble Lords have said. I was a little surprised by the lack of temperance on the part of both the noble Lords, Lord Hunt and Lord Thomas of Gresford. Noble Lords will know that, on occasions too numerous to mention, I have commended your Lordships' House for the dedication and thoroughness with which it has addressed these issues. But perhaps I may say with the utmost gentleness that I do not consider the way that the issues relating to juries were dealt with necessarily have been your Lordships' finest moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1951.0/2">This House has had a tradition of scrutinising Bills thoroughly and well. First, we debate them extensively in Committee. It is our custom to use the Committee stage for that purpose. We discuss Bills clause by clause, often examining the pros and cons of each and every comma and word in the clauses. However, we did not give Part 7 of this Bill our customary care. Your Lordships will know that we had one long, extended and very full debate, after which the whole of this part of the Bill was struck down. We thus deprived ourselves of our usual opportunity for detailed scrutiny. That is something which, speaking entirely for myself, I deeply regretted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1951.0/3">One of the joys of going through a Bill&mdash;a joy it is on occasion, although not always&mdash;is that we are able to debate together with great particularity how we should weigh one element of a Bill against another. After that, on Report, we usually craft something which we can then go on to divide upon where we disagree. Before we congratulate ourselves too much, it is right that we should have the humility to accept that in dealing with Part 7 we did not do that. Some noble Lords will say that thereby we did not do our duty, so I deeply regret the failure of this House to engage in detailed and constructive debate on these provisions.</p>

	<p pid="a.1952.1/1">No, my Lords. It did not suffer from a lack of defenders, but this part of the Bill suffered from a lack of scrutiny. We were entitled to undertake that scrutiny because we believe that it would have advantaged the House to be able to hear the detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.1952.1/2">I turn to the questions raised specifically on Amendment No. 32 to which the Commons have disagreed for their reason numbered 32A. I agree that it is somewhat curious that those who support the right to jury trial&mdash;among others, the noble Lords, Lord Hunt and Lord Thomas of Gresford, did so&mdash;say that they wish to deny the defendant the right not to have a jury trial. That is an odd arrangement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1952.1/3">I appreciate that in my opening I conflated the two amendments. In due course I shall deal with Amendment No. 42 in its proper place by addressing our amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1952.1/4">The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, is right to point to the issues of complexity and length in trials. I respectfully agree with him. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, asked about the special ability that the judge has. The noble Lord knows that, if there is a particular need, it is usual for the Lord Chancellor or the list office to alight upon a judge who may have the type of experience, through practice or through sitting in a certain division&mdash;the Commercial Division judges are not unfamiliar with commercial and other frauds&mdash;that makes him or her more suited to dealing with certain trials. That is an advantage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1952.1/5">I turn to my noble and learned friend Lord Morris of Aberavon. Without reservation I say to him that we too greatly value and respect the jury system. The noble and learned Lord will remember that each time there has been an encroachment on jury trials, there has been an outcry that that will mean the end of the jury. The noble and learned Lord will remember the tears that were shed for the loss of peremptory challenges. No longer would we be able to challenge jurors when choosing a panel. The noble Lord will remember the tears shed in relation to the abandonment of unanimity and the move to majority verdicts. That was supposed to signal the end of jury trials as we know them. Juries are still with us.</p>
	<p pid="a.1952.1/6">The arguments made in relation to this part of the Bill were also made, as I understand from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Cooke, in New Zealand. People in New Zealand thought that such measures would mean the end of the system as they knew it. But the provisions have rarely been used and they have been targeted on those cases that really need them. Further, the judge retains a discretion about whether the provisions should be used.</p>
	<p pid="a.1952.1/7">I am curious and somewhat taken aback by the hostility aimed at Clause 41, because it gives defendants a choice that they do not have at present about the way in which they are tried. We find it puzzling that noble Lords opposite are so vehement in their defence of a defendant's right to choose one context, but should oppose this reasonable right. We shall stand firm on the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1952.1/8">We also intend to stand firm on the other provisions in Part 7 which deal with those who seek to manipulate the system to evade justice. Clauses 43 and 45 provide an effective and a proportionate solution to the increasing problems of jury tampering and Clause 42, to which I have already spoken and to which I turn again briefly, does that too. New Zealand is not alone in benefiting from using these provisions. I am sure noble Lords are aware that they are also used in the United States, Canada and Australia. We do not seek to do anything that is terribly novel.</p>
	<p pid="a.1952.1/9">I have not dealt with the comments made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner. We are not pulling the wool over anyone's eyes. We are being absolutely frank about what is happening. My noble friend Lord Davies of Coity is right to say that we have to be realistic when considering how the provisions will be viewed and that members of the public who will be asked to participate in these trials will be very concerned about the extent of the duty that they will be invited to undertake. I am gratified to hear the acceptance by the noble Lord, Lord Renton, that such fraud trials can be long, very difficult and complex. His experience is that on occasion jurors are not able to deal with them appropriately or at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.1952.1/10">The noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, raised the issue of the Serious Fraud Office and its conviction rate. This matter is not about conviction rates. We do not seek to raise the conviction rates in this regard. These provisions attempt to address real problems in trying to manage certain fraud cases. The conviction rate reflects not the difficulty of rendering such cases manageable for jurors but the damage that is done to the public interest when it is not possible to try defendants on charges that truly represent the extent of their alleged offending. That was a matter underscored by my noble friend Lord Borrie.</p>
	<p pid="a.1952.1/11">Perhaps I can explain the purpose of the government's amendments.</p>

	<p pid="a.1953.1/1">My Lords, your Lordships will remember that the Serious Fraud Office has made it plain that there are cases that it chooses not to bring before the courts because of their complexity, length and difficulty. Already a sifting process is taking place. We wish to see all those cases that should properly be brought to court, brought to court. In speaking to the amendment earlier I said that the Government were concerned about cases in which there were secondary participants against whom proceedings were not taken in order to enable the case to go forward. That is not justice and we should be able to deal with the principal and the subsidiary aiders and abettors.</p>

	<p pid="a.1955.0/1">My Lords, the Government's amendments respond to concerns about the possibility that Clause 42, as currently drafted, risks widening the potential application of the clause to cases which are not akin to fraud. That matter has been raised on a number of occasions. The Government have therefore thought very carefully about how to craft Amendment No. 42. They accept that the danger of cases slipping through which are not akin to fraud is in fact negligible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1955.0/2">The reference to,</p>
	<p pid="a.1955.0/3" class="indent">&quot;of a financial or commercial nature or which relate to property&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1955.0/4">is one element only of a deliberately high and cumulative test. None the less, we have listened and we have amended Clause 42 to restrict its application fairly and squarely to serious fraud trials, which is the main mischief to which the clause was directed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1955.0/5">Let me emphasise that in the light of the comments made in another place, these amendments in no way serve to fetter the discretion of a judge. That is certainly not the intention, nor, I respectfully suggest, is it the effect. The judge will continue to need to satisfy himself that the condition in subsection (4) is met regarding the length and/or complexity of the trial. He will also need to have regard to any step which could be taken to reduce the length and/or complexity of the trial. Your Lordships will find that set out in subsection (6).</p>
	<p pid="a.1955.0/6">I hope that in the light of these amendments the House will be able to reconsider its decision.</p>

	<p pid="a.1955.3/1">My Lords, I start by thanking the Minister for the courtesy with which she has always listened to debate in the House. She has always given way. I intervened only when I thought she had finished. The House pays her every possible respect for the graciousness with which she approaches these debates; it does not mean that we always agree with her.</p>
	<p pid="a.1955.3/2">I do not think that the House would want me to answer all the points made. However, I should like to deal with the point on Clause 41. There was an extensive debate in the other place on that clause. I say to the noble Viscount, Lord Bledisloe, and to my noble friend Lord Renton that I thought that the point was adequately dealt with in that debate. Perhaps I may quote the words of the Labour Member of Parliament, Vera Baird. She went into all the reasons why the opt-out should not be allowed. She then remarked that if her right honourable friend the Home Secretary was concerned about safeguarding the principle of jury trial,</p>
	<p pid="a.1955.3/3" class="indent">&quot;he cannot allow it to become optional. Once it becomes optional, the reasons why the option is exercised will bring the principle into disrepute. That is the slippery slope on which we are starting today with clause 41&quot;.&mdash;[Official Report, Commons, 18/11/03; col. 674.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1955.3/4">I hope he will accept that I thought the noble and learned Lord, Lord Ackner, made a very persuasive series of comments on that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1955.3/5">I should like to spend time dealing with other points, but I think that we are willing to proceed to a decision. All I would say in conclusion is that I believe Mr Blunkett has under-estimated the reasons why we feel so strongly that these clauses should not form part of the Bill. They should in fact have been in another Bill&mdash;a mode of trial Bill. That has always been our case. We then could have had the proper research into the jury system that we should have before we start restricting the principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.1955.3/6">I close by quoting Lord Devlin, who said that trial by jury is,</p>
	<p pid="a.1955.3/7" class="indent">&quot;the lamp that shows freedom lives&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1955.3/8">In this House that means a great deal. I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1962.2/1">My Lords, I beg to move that the House do not insist on its Amendment No. 34 to which the Commons have disagreed and do agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 34A and 34B to the words so restored to the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/2">I come now to Clause 43 which, together with Clause 45, is concerned with the serious and persistent problem of jury tampering. The background to these provisions is the increasingly sophisticated and determined attempts that are made in our courts to interfere with the course of justice by tampering with the jury. When the nature and extent of jury tampering threatens the fairness of the trial, the courts currently have no option other than to discharge the jury and terminate the trial, which clearly does not serve the interests of justice. Nor can we possibly expect members of the public who have given up their time to serve on a jury to undergo the stress and anxiety of actual intimidation, a genuine fear of intimidation or the misery of round-the-clock surveillance over a significant period of time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/3">Clauses 43 and 45 together provide a strong and effective deterrent to those who would seek to wreck trials and subvert due process by tampering with the jury. They send out a clear message that attempts to pervert the course of justice in that way will not be tolerated. Far from undermining the jury, the proposals will protect its integrity. I emphasise that the clauses are intended as a last resort. Jury protection measures will be appropriate and effective in most cases when there is a risk of tampering. I also remind the House that the test for jury exclusion in these circumstances is a high one, and deliberately so: we anticipate that only a handful of cases each year will meet it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/4">Police protection is available when the court considers that there is a substantial risk that the jury may be subject to intimidation. In the most serious cases, 24-hour police protection may be ordered, with officers accompanying jurors to their homes and other places outside the court. Over the past three years, that level of jury protection has been provided in approximately four to five trials per year. The cost to the Metropolitan Police over the past two years for full jury protection has been &pound;9 million. That is equivalent to 26,627 police days a year diverted from mainstream policing in London, or an additional 130 officers on the beat.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/5">Increasingly, however, organised and sophisticated criminals are able to intimidate jurors despite protective measures, including full police protection. Jurors' mail, telephone calls and bank accounts are, quite rightly, not vetted. Nor are members of their family protected. Current protection arrangements cannot prevent approaches by means of telephone calls, letters, bribery or attacks&mdash;or threatened attacks&mdash;upon family members. Clauses 43 and 45 are designed specifically to deal with situations that the existing measures cannot satisfactorily address.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/6">Questions have been asked on a number of occasions, within and without this House, about the extent and seriousness of the problem of jury tampering. As far as seriousness is concerned, I have already referred to the four to five cases each year that require full jury protection. The Association of Chief Police Officers recently reported evidence of an increasing problem of jury tampering. Chris Fox, its president, wrote about this issue on 27th October describing,</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/7" class="indent">&quot;a clear picture of an ominous and growing problem&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/8">which is, moreover, increasingly not confined to London and other big conurbations such as Liverpool, but in evidence throughout the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/9">If serious jury tampering is allowed to continue and allowed to succeed unchecked, the outlook is grim. In a letter to my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor, Ian Blair, Deputy Commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, and John Burbeck, head of criminal justice at ACPO, outlined their fears of the possible consequences in the following way:</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/10" class="indent">&quot;There is a tier of criminals in this country who are prepared to go to any lengths to evade justice. It is a fact that jury intimidation exists as a consequence of those people. If the current system cannot cope with the threat, and if the system is not improved, there will be a group of violent, sophisticated and dangerous criminals who may truly become untouchable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/11">A few recent examples make the point all too vividly. In August 2002, at Liverpool Crown Court, the trial of six defendants for serious drug offences collapsed because of jury tampering. Two jurors were threatened and a third juror was offered &pound;10,000 to return a verdict of not guilty. The trial was in its fifth week and is estimated to have cost in excess of &pound;1 million. In autumn 2001 at Kingston Crown Court, jurors hearing a case had their cars sprayed with paint stripper. The jury was discharged and special protection was given to the retrial jury. During a trial in the west Midlands in July 1999, in which several witnesses were physically assaulted, three members of the jury were threatened on their way home from the court. The jury foreman was approached by a man who gestured that he was going to shoot him. Those are not fanciful cases; they are real, pressing and pernicious.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/12">We have said, throughout the passage of the Bill, that we would welcome constructive suggestions for improving it. It is with great regret that I say that they have not been forthcoming in the way that we would have liked in relation to Part 7. None the less, the Government moved amendments to Clauses 43 and 45 when the Bill was debated yesterday in another place, in the hope of finding a way forward on these important provisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/13">The Government's amendments to Clause 43 put beyond doubt the fact that there must be evidence of a real and present danger of jury tampering before the first condition for a trial to be conducted in the absence of a jury is met. Amendment No. 34B inserts a new subsection at the end of the clause that gives examples of the sort of evidence that may be involved. It states that they are:</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/14" class="indent">&quot;(a) a case where the trial is a retrial and the jury in the previous trial was discharged because jury tampering had taken place,</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/15" class="indent">(b) a case where jury tampering has taken place in previous criminal proceedings involving the defendant or any of the defendants,</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/16" class="indent">(c) a case where there has been intimidation, or attempted intimidation, of any person who is likely to be a witness in the trial&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/17">I hope that the amendments make it abundantly plain, if it was not before, that there is no question of the police and/or prosecution simply whispering in the judge's ear, in order to secure a juryless trial. Firm and substantial evidence of risk will be needed for an application for juryless trial to succeed. Our amendments make that clear and, in doing so, answer the concerns expressed by Her Majesty's loyal Opposition and those voiced in the other place by others who have spoken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/18">Amendments Nos. 36A and 36B, to Clause 45, also attempt to find a way forward. They take on board opposition amendments tabled in Committee and on Report in another place. They make it clear that jury tampering must be the primary cause of the jury discharge and that the judge, having discharged the jury, must make an order for the trial to continue without a jury only if he or she is,</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/19" class="indent">&quot;satisfied that jury tampering has taken place&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/20">Yesterday, in another place, the Opposition tabled amendments to Clauses 43 and 45, with the aim of further limiting the already restricted circumstances in which a juryless trial could take place, where there is tampering or the risk of it. I must confess that I share the puzzlement of my right honourable friend the Home Secretary about those amendments. They are not entirely logical.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/21">The illogicality is apparent in the fact that they set a different test to be satisfied in respect of each clause. During yesterday's debate, Mr Dominic Grieve, the honourable Member for Beaconsfield, explained that that was because the test in respect of the risk of tampering should set a higher threshold than the test in Clause 45 for cases in which tampering has actually occurred. As the Government's amendments to Clause 43, I hope, make clear, evidence of jury tampering in a previous trial is, precisely, an example of the type of evidence that might be presented as evidence of a risk that jury tampering would take place. It also does not make sense to acknowledge the burden on the jury of police protection in one set of circumstances and disregard it in similar circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/22">That condition addresses the question of whether we can reasonably expect members of the public to come forward and undergo the stress and anxiety of actual intimidation or a genuine fear of intimidation and the misery of round-the-clock surveillance over a lengthy period. Clearly, Her Majesty's loyal Opposition and others who sit opposite do not share our deep concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/23">The amendments tabled by the Opposition in another place also ratchet up the interests of justice test in Clauses 43 and 45 to require there to be a &quot;great&quot; or &quot;overwhelming&quot; likelihood that jury tampering would take place notwithstanding any steps that might be taken to prevent it. I understand the concerns that underlie the amendments. It is our belief that the clauses already meet those concerns. If I can paraphrase what was said in the other place, I can assure Mr Grieve that they already require the court to make examinations in minute detail, before ordering that a trial be conducted or continued without a jury. In responding to that point, I invite the House to remember that Clause 43 draws on existing case law on jury protection applications, which requires the judge to order full police protection for the jury only where there is a real and present danger of jury tampering.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/24">We cannot accept the Opposition's amendment to Clause 45, which would remove the judge's power to continue the trial alone, following discharge of the jury because of tampering. The amendment is based on concerns about the impartiality of the judge, who, having heard information that may be prejudicial to the defendant, goes on to sit as fact finder in the trial. However, I remind the House that judges routinely direct themselves to disregard prejudicial evidence. Having detailed knowledge of such information does not necessarily mean that the judge must automatically be considered prejudiced. Rather, the key question must be whether there are any ascertainable facts that would raise legitimate and objectively justified doubts about a judge's impartiality, and we are not convinced that in such cases, in general, there will be. I remind your Lordships that the judge will be able to do justice in such a situation, as he will have a discretion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/25">Of course, a judge who felt unable to take on a case because he or she feared that he or she would not be able to hear it with the requisite impartiality would not be obliged to do so. That established principle is already reflected in the Bill. I am sure that noble Lords will join me in expressing confidence in the ability of the judge to exercise discretion in that way and to discharge himself or herself, if he or she feels that that would be in the interests of justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/26">Several questions were asked about the way in which prosecution applications under Clause 43 would be made in circumstances involving sensitive information. The Government are confident that existing public interest immunity procedures are fair and effective and do not in any way endanger the rights of defendants. We are also confident that they will work equally well when used in the course of an application under Clause 43.</p>
	<p pid="a.1962.2/27">Moved, That the House do not insist on its Amendment No. 34 to which the Commons have disagreed and do agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 34A and 34B to the words so restored to the Bill.&mdash;(Baroness Scotland of Asthal.)</p>

	<p pid="a.1966.1/1">My Lords, I understand that Amendment No. 36C is consequential on Amendment No. 34C.</p>
	<p pid="a.1966.1/2">I want to make the point that, to some extent, we have already covered this subject in the opening debate when we responded to the Minister in covering a range of situations relating to non-jury trial. However, when the Minister read out that portion of her speech which did not seem to come from her, but rather from a written document&mdash;the point at which she remarked that she believed that those opposing this clause did not understand the depth of the Government's concern&mdash;I believe that she made a grave error. During these debates we have constantly declared war on any form of intimidation and we want to join with the Government in ensuring not only that the intimidation of a jury does not take place, but that the intimidation of a judge&mdash;some very serious cases have been reported recently&mdash;of parties or of witnesses also does not take place. At some stage we would welcome a dialogue with the Minister and her colleagues on seeking to increase the sentences for jury tampering, judge or witness tampering, or other intimidation of any of the parties. At the moment the penalties are not sufficiently severe. We declare war on intimidation of any kind.</p>
	<p pid="a.1966.1/3">All I wish to say in addition to my previous comments is that I thought that my honourable friend Mr Grieve went into considerable detail in explaining his amendment. However, it was not tabled yesterday, like the government amendments; it was tabled six months ago. When the Minister takes credit for having come forward with these amendments, it should be noted that the Government produced them only 36 hours ago, but we are talking about a debate that took place in this House on 15th July. Only yesterday morning did we first see the Government's proposed new wording.</p>
	<p pid="a.1966.1/4">Furthermore, there are defects. Members of all parties are nervous about allowing a judge who has just received evidence of jury tampering then to continue to sit on his own. When Mr Marshall-Andrews spoke yesterday from the Labour Back Benches to agree with the points that my honourable friend Mr Grieve was making, that was a most telling intervention. So we ask again: please may we have co-operation from the Government to arrive at a formula that would meet this very serious situation? In effect, I am saying: please may we have some constructive engagement instead of sudden, last-minute amendments which are defective&mdash;those defects were pointed out yesterday in the other place? We need to get this right. I beg to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.1966.1/5">Moved, as an amendment to the Motion that the House do not insist on its Amendment No. 34 and do agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 34A and 34B to the words so restored to the Bill, leave out from &quot;House&quot; to end and insert &quot;do insist on its Amendment No. 34&quot;.&mdash;(Lord Hunt of Wirral.)</p>

	<p pid="a.1967.0/1">My Lords, I thank my noble friend on the Front Bench for her careful explanation of what is intended. As we know, real difficulties can arise in certain cases. Fortunately, as she explained, they are few in number, but the difficulties relate to very serious cases which involve substantial allegations. I have some experience of this, having been for some two-and-a-half years the Attorney-General with responsibility for Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1967.0/2">The purpose of my intervention is to say this: given the background of what we are dealing with, can my noble friend tell us whether she is satisfied that no difficulties would arise from the first sentence of Amendment No. 34B, in seeking to prove,</p>

	<p pid="a.1967.2/1">My Lords, I rise briefly to assist the noble Lord, Lord Monson. We took advice on this from the Clerk at the Table and consulted the Government. We have all received the same advice. That was the reason why my noble friend Lord Hunt referred to Amendment No. 36C being consequential on Amendment No. 34C.</p>

	<p pid="a.1967.3/1">My Lords, intimidation is something that must be attacked and Members on these Benches join with all that has been said by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. Nothing in this clause would do anything about intimidation. It provides that, if there has been intimidation, any subsequent trial would be held without a jury.</p>
	<p pid="a.1967.3/2">The Minister referred to the cost of protecting juries. No doubt there is a considerable cost, but members of a jury come from the community and they disappear back into the community at the end of their term of jury service, whatever that may be. Therefore they would need to be protected for only a short time. Judges involved in terrorist cases in this country are provided with 24-hour protection for seven days a week. The position is the same in Northern Ireland, where heavy protection is provided for judges all the time. One wonders about the cost of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1967.3/3">I say that because in Northern Ireland a judge has been murdered, while in continental systems and in other parts of the world, judges are assassinated from time to time. When we are dealing with serious crime, we must provide full-time protection in those circumstances. So no saving in costs would be made as a result of these provisions. In fact, the costs incurred in protecting juries referred to by the Minister would be rather modest when compared with some of the costs of police protection being incurred today. That is no argument for abolishing the right to trial by jury. We are with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, in opposition to the Government's plans.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-11-19a.1968.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="1968"  time="017:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-12.htm#31119-12_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.1968.0/1">My Lords, first, I should like to emphasise in response to my noble and learned friend Lord Morris of Aberavon that the test now applied to have a jury covered for 24 hours a day is very much the same: it is a &quot;real and present danger&quot;. Taking the four or five cases that I have already mentioned, the judge must already be satisfied in relation to that test before he would authorise 24-hour protection. We do not think that there would be any difficulty about that. It is clear that the judge will have to assess the potential risk of tampering on the basis of the evidence before him. It would need to be clear and cogent evidence, whatever form it takes and whatever its nature.</p>
	<p pid="a.1968.0/2">Our amendment simply gives examples. We do not say that these are the totality of circumstances that the court must take into account. We have given them as an exemplar of the quality of evidence that we think would need to be presented before the court could be satisfied that providing protection would be a proper thing to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1968.0/3">We can draw comfort from the fact that judges dealing with such cases have used the provision of 24-hour protection very sparingly. One of the reasons for that&mdash;one cited on an earlier occasion&mdash;is that if one looks at the conviction rate, it would appear that there is a slightly higher conviction rate for those juries under protection than otherwise. That may be due simply to the weight of the evidence, but there is a significant difference and it is something that we must consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.1968.0/4">I shall take up the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, about the costs incurred in providing protection for judges. I believe that I said earlier in my remarks that it is easier to protect one judge than it is to protect 12 jurors. The nature of the protection is different.</p>
	<p pid="a.1968.0/5">The robustness of our judges is also different. They take on an enormous responsibility on behalf of the public and discharge it with honour. I pay particular credit to the judges in Northern Ireland who have been discharging that duty in Diplock courts with real courage, dedication and fairness for many years. We do not doubt for a second that we have judges of the kind, nature and calibre necessary to discharge this duty, not only in terms of their own personal courage but also in terms of the way in which they will address matters in the interests of justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1968.0/6">I can assure the noble Lord that this is not a cost-cutting exercise. We do not believe that we will save money, but neither do we shy away from addressing the issue. We believe that it is right to take this opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1968.0/7">A very senior judge indeed mentioned to me that he had spent the last three years of his practice conducting one trial. At the first trial, through some happenstance, inappropriate material managed to get in front of the jury in almost the twelfth month. The first jury was discharged. It was genuinely thought that there had been successful interference with the jury&mdash;tampering.</p>
	<p pid="a.1968.0/8">The second trial proceeded for almost a year when one day a juror ran from the jury box in a state of distress, declaring that he could go on no longer knowing that other members of the jury were in receipt of money and had been tampered with. That trial came to an end and the juror was subsequently prosecuted. The third trial again took a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1968.0/9">The point that was made to me was that if those serial criminals had known that the consequence of seeking to tamper with the first jury was likely to be a trial by judge alone, they probably would not have done it in the first place. They may have considered that being tried by 12 good men and women true would be a better option for them. So the fact that there is a backstop of this nature may well act as a deterrent to those who would wrongly seek to undermine the interests of justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1968.0/10">That was told to me by a very senior judge indeed who had, before that three-year experience, been of a view similar to the one expressed in this House on previous occasions. We are dealing with a very different world today than in the past&mdash;a world in which my noble and learned friend Lord Morris was privileged to serve.</p>

	<p pid="a.1975.4/1">My Lords, I beg to move that the House do not insist on its Amendments Nos. 100 and 101 en bloc, to which the Commons have disagreed for their reasons 100A and 101A.</p>
	<p pid="a.1975.4/2">One of the important safeguards provided by the Bill in respect of retrials for serious offences is that the personal consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions will be needed to authorise certain steps being taken by the police to reinvestigate a person previously acquitted of a qualifying offence. As originally drafted, the Bill provided that the Director of Public Prosecutions would not be able to give his consent to reopen an investigation unless he considered that, firstly, there was new evidence, or would be new evidence, as a result of a reinvestigation; and, secondly, that a reinvestigation would be in the public interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.1975.4/3">The amendment would seek to add a further requirement that the DPP should seek the leave of a Crown Court judge before consenting to a reinvestigation. We consider the amendment to be unnecessary. The Director of Public Prosecutions is senior and experienced enough to take a decision on whether to allow the police, in reopening an investigation into an acquitted person, to take the steps set out in subsection (3). He is sufficiently independent of the police to review their request for a reinvestigation. The Government consider that having him take this decision provides the necessary safeguard to ensure that the acquitted person is not being harassed by the police. At the stage of reinvestigation, it is quite proper for the decision to reinvestigate to be taken by the prosecuting authorities rather than the courts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1975.4/4">Involving a Crown Court judge in proceedings at this stage would also make the process more cumbersome. There are many layers of safeguard already built in to the exercise of the powers listed in subsection (3). I do not believe that requiring the DPP to secure the leave of a Crown Court judge is necessary before a reinvestigation can get to the point of the exercise of these powers. The safeguards on reinvestigation need also to be seen in context. Before there can be an application for a retrial, the DPP's consent is required again. He must be satisfied at that stage that there is new and compelling evidence and that it is in the public interest for the application to be made. That application is then determined by the Court of Appeal. We believe that it is at that stage that a judicial decision in required. As such, I invite noble Lords not to insist on this amendment. I beg to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.1975.4/5">Moved, That the House do not insist on its Amendments Nos. 100 and 101 en bloc, to which the Commons have disagreed for their reasons 100A and 101A.&mdash;(Baroness Scotland of Asthal.)</p>

	<p pid="a.1984.0/1">My Lords, I beg to move that the House do not insist on its Amendment No. 114, to which the Commons have disagreed for their reason numbered 114A.</p>
	<p pid="a.1984.0/2">We now come to the part of the Bill dealing with the admissibility of evidence of bad character. There is a wide consensus in support of reform, both across the Floor of this House and throughout the criminal justice system and public. This part of the Bill is intended to provide a new statutory framework for admissibility. Amendments adopted when the Bill was considered on Report in this House would, however, replace the scheme proposed by the Government with, almost exactly, the draft Bill drawn up by the Law Commission that accompanied its 2001 report.</p>
	<p pid="a.1984.0/3">As I said at that time, there is much in the Law Commission scheme with which we agree, and much of the Law Commission's work and recommendations can be seen in the Government's proposals. However, we also consider that it is right to go further in certain respects. In particular, the Law Commission considered that a generally exclusionary regime should apply, that the rules should be based on excluding this sort of evidence and restricting its admission to circumstances where a number of conditions had been met.</p>
	<p pid="a.1984.0/4">However, we do not believe that that goes far enough in rebalancing the system to ensure that the rules promote the admission of relevant evidence, subject to considerations of fairness. Without that sort of rebalancing, courts and juries will continue to have withheld from them important evidence that will give them the full and proper picture of a case. In our view, therefore, a different approach is required&mdash;one of inclusion, which makes it clear that relevant evidence is admissible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1984.0/5">It will, of course, be for the prosecution to demonstrate in the course of proceedings how the evidence relates to the case. However, on the question of admissibility, we believe that it should be clear that relevant evidence is admissible, subject to the defendant applying for its exclusion. We therefore stand behind the inclusionary approach adopted by the Government in our original proposals. We have, however, always said that we would listen to constructive suggestions for change, to ensure that our proposals are cast in the best possible form. I indicated on Report a number of specific areas where we would look at our proposals to see whether improvements could be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1984.0/6">We have done so, and noble Lords will see on the Marshalled List a number of proposals to modify the Government's scheme as originally introduced. They address a number of key concerns raised in this House and in another place. I shall set out their effect. Three of them are amendments proposed in another place, which I shall deal with first. The first proposed amendment relates to the definition of evidence of bad character. The definition that the Government originally proposed was that recommended by the Law Commission. However, concern was expressed that it was too vague and enabled evidence that was too remote to be admitted&mdash;although it will now find its place in the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1984.0/7">It is important to bear in mind that the Bill will set out the future rules and conditions for admitting that sort of evidence. A wide definition is, therefore, important, otherwise potentially prejudicial evidence will fall outside it and thus outside the rules and safeguards in the Bill. However, we recognise that it is important to be as clear and precise as possible. We have therefore redrafted the definition to tighten the wording as far as possible, while maintaining a comprehensive ambit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1984.0/8">The revised wording will define evidence of a person's &quot;bad character&quot; as evidence of, or of a disposition towards, misconduct on his part. &quot;Misconduct&quot; is further defined as the commission of an offence, or other reprehensible behaviour. Our intention is to ensure that a wide range of potentially prejudicial evidence is caught by the definition, so that the rules and safeguards in this part of the Bill apply. However, the wording offers a tighter formulation for doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1984.0/9">The second proposal is to ensure that the defendant has clear notice of the prosecution's intention to rely on evidence of his bad character. That reflects a concern that a more inclusionary approach would lead to the admission of evidence where it was not appropriate or safe for it to be heard.</p>
	<p pid="a.1984.0/10">I make it clear that that is not our intention. We believe that the system needs to be rebalanced to ensure that relevant evidence is admitted unless good reason is shown to exclude it. However, we recognise that there must be a clear opportunity for a defendant to apply to exclude the evidence and for that issue to be decided by the court. That will be facilitated by having a formal requirement of notice. That is achieved by amending the clause dealing with rules of court to make it clear that rules must make provision for the prosecution to give notice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1984.0/11">Thirdly, there is a proposal in relation to the admissibility of juvenile convictions in adult proceedings&mdash;an issue which I know greatly exercised the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, among many others. At present, no mention may be made of these convictions. We think that that approach is too restrictive. Our proposals will lift that absolute prohibition, making such evidence admissible subject to the general scheme of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1984.0/12">Concern has been expressed that that goes too far, that a person's record at that age will not have the relevance of later offending and that particular considerations apply in the context of juvenile offending. We have sympathy that admission here should take place on a more restricted basis and therefore propose that these convictions should be admissible only where the interests of justice specifically require it. We intend this test to exclude a sporadic record for minor offences, while ensuring that continual or persistent offending or convictions for very serious offences are capable of admission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1984.0/13">The Government also propose a fourth amendment which I shall move in this House today relating to the presumption that a conviction for the same or a similar offence should be admitted. We are proposing here a different approach and have now linked it to the category of relevant evidence&mdash;Clause 93(1)(e)&mdash;to make it absolutely clear that we do not intend that presumption to operate to admit irrelevant convictions. It may be helpful if I explain how the presumption will operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1984.0/14">Where propensity to commit an offence is a matter in issue in the case, the presumption will be that convictions for the same or a similar offence may be admitted to establish that propensity. Clause 96(1)(a) sets out where a propensity of this kind will be a matter in issue. This is intended to cover all circumstances where this evidence will assist the courts but not where the propensity makes it no more likely that the defendant committed the offence. Where that is so, convictions for the same or a similar offence will, in principle, be admissible. However, that does not mean that such convictions will inevitably be admitted. Subsection (3) makes it clear that the presumption does not apply if the court is satisfied, by reason of the length of time since the conviction, or for any other reason, that it would be unjust. Furthermore, the defendant will be able to apply for the evidence to be excluded on the basis that the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1984.0/15">In summary, a person's record for committing the same or similar offences will be admissible, to show propensity, provided that, first, the defendant's propensity to commit the offence charged is relevant to the issues in the case; and, secondly, the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1984.0/16">The rules on evidence of bad character are in pressing need of reform. We must ensure that they are restated in a clear and comprehensive form. The Government's proposals have drawn on the existing jurisprudence and the excellent work of the Law Commission. We have responded to the key concerns expressed and believe that our proposals, modified as suggested, represented the clearest and most satisfactory way forward. For that reason, I move that this House does not insist on its amendments, as set out on the Marshalled List, accepts the amendments to the words restored and accepts the amendments in lieu. We have tried in crafting these new amendments to bring even greater clarity to that which we had before so that our intent is the more plain.</p>

	<p pid="a.1988.1/1">My Lords, I am much obliged to the noble Baroness.</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/2">The Government are constantly reminding us of the immense value of the Law Commission, which they themselves established in 1965, and of the high quality of its work. Our Amendment No. 114, except in one minor respect, mirrors precisely the Law Commission's draft Bill. In April 1997, my right honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition, when he was Home Secretary, invited the Law Commission to examine the law of bad character with a view to formulating a comprehensive statutory scheme. After four and a half years' work which, as I said on Report, involved historical analysis, international comparisons and extensive consultation, it produced its proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/3">The Law Commission devoted special attention to the two issues in respect of which we find ourselves at odds with the Government&mdash;the issues of the inclusionary presumption and the issue of propensity. The conclusion that the Law Commission reached was based on extensive research and characterised by mature reflection, as anyone reading its report would conclude. If the Government wish to depart from that report and the draft Bill, therefore, they need, in my submission, to demonstrate why the Law Commission report is either flawed or in other respects inferior to their own draft.</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/4">In another place yesterday afternoon the honourable Member, Mr Heath, spoke as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/5" class="indent">&quot;If we share&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/6">by &quot;we&quot; the honourable Member meant the Government&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/7" class="indent">&quot;the same objective, the Law Commission has provided us with an objective way of achieving it. In that case, why on earth are Ministers holding out for their own interpretation of the best way forward? They can adduce no particular evidence of superiority for that approach, which poses clear dangers as identified by the Law Commission in its evidence&quot;.&mdash;[Official Report, Commons, 18/11/03; col. 715.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/8">I listened very carefully to what the noble Baroness said in her speech. I notice that on the inclusionary presumption there has, in effect, been no movement by the Government. So I turn now to the second issue which is of concern to us, which is the issue of propensity. Here the Government have made one concession; that is, to delete Clause 93(1)(d) from the original Bill. Your Lordships will recall that Clause 93(1)(d) reads as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/9" class="indent">&quot;In criminal proceedings evidence of the defendant's bad character is admissible if, but only if . . .</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/10">(d) it is evidence of the defendant's conviction for an offence of the same description, or of the same category, as the one with which he is charged&quot;. I have to confess that I find it quite extraordinary that the Government ever contemplated including that clause. Clause 93(1)(d) allows evidence of previous convictions to be put in merely because they exist. There is no requirement for relevance whatever.</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/11">In another place yesterday the honourable Member, Vera Baird, asked rhetorically,</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/12" class="indent">&quot;What, therefore, is the purpose of paragraph (d)&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/13">She answers herself by saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/14" class="indent">&quot;It can only be to include [such convictions] even though they are irrelevant and do not prove anything&quot;.&mdash;[Official Report, Commons, 18/11/03; col. 717.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/15">On the equally unacceptable relationship between Clause 93(1)(e) and Clause 96(1)(a), despite painstaking discussions with the noble Baroness, who has been the very acme of courtesy and who has made every effort to assist, we have made, I fear, no progress at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/16">Clause 93(1)(e) states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/17" class="indent">&quot;In criminal proceedings evidence of the defendant's bad character is admissible if, but only if . . .</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/18">(e) it is relevant to an important matter in issue between the defendant and the prosecution&quot;. Clause 96 is headed by the expression, &quot;Matter in issue between the defendant and the prosecution&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/19">Clause 96(1)(a) states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/20" class="indent">&quot;For the purposes of section 93(1)(e) the matters in issue between the defendant and the prosecution include&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/21">(a) the question whether the defendant has a propensity to commit offences of the kind with which he is charged, except where his having such a propensity makes it no more likely that he is guilty of the offence&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/22">First, whatever objectives these provisions seek to achieve, they clearly do not achieve them. If propensity is an issue in the case, following Clause 96(1)(a), all Clause 93(1)(e) is saying is that propensity evidence is relevant to propensity evidence. That is obviously true but it gets us no closer to knowing whether propensity evidence is relevant or not.</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/23">What should your Lordships make of the qualifying word &quot;important&quot; in Clause 93(1)(e)? If the only evidence against the accused is propensity evidence it will certainly be important, but it would be an outrage if an accused could be convicted on propensity evidence alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/24">Finally, what about the expression,</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/25" class="indent">&quot;except where his having such a propensity makes it no more likely that he is guilty of the offence&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/26">The law so far is that propensity evidence is always irrelevant precisely because it makes it no more likely than not that the accused is guilty of the offence. The only circumstances in which past conduct may be led by the prosecution is where it is evidence directly relevant to the issues in the case; that is to say, similar fact evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/27">Is this an attempt by the Government to preserve the similar fact rule in Clause 96(1)(a), or not? We have sought assurances to these questions both across the Dispatch Box and in private. But despite the noble Baroness's best efforts, to which I again pay tribute, our endeavours have been to no avail. That is why we have tabled Amendment No. 114B.</p>
	<p pid="a.1988.1/28">Moved, as an amendment to the Motion that the House do not insist on its Amendment No. 114, to which the Commons have disagreed for their reason numbered 114A, leave out &quot;not&quot;.&mdash;(Lord Kingsland.)</p>

	<p pid="a.1989.0/1">My Lords, I too pay tribute to the very hard work that the noble Baroness has done in connection with this part of the Bill. The removal of paragraph (d) is a step very much in the right direction, which we welcome. However, the criticisms that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has just made about the relationship between Clause 93(1)(e) and Clause 96 are absolutely valid in our opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1989.0/2">I have looked at Clause 96(1)(a) and (b) for some time and considered what they meant. The words,</p>
	<p pid="a.1989.0/3" class="indent">&quot;except where his having such a propensity makes it no more likely that he is guilty of the offence&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1989.0/4">have troubled me in the middle of the night wondering what on earth they are supposed to mean. I have come to the conclusion that whoever drafted the Bill originally had in mind, through Clause 96(1)(a), putting into statutory form the accepted and well known doctrine of similar fact evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1989.0/5">With that in mind, I have attempted today to redraft this section&mdash;I have given notice to the Minister of the way in which I did so&mdash;in order to make absolutely clear the purpose of that clause. My redraft reads as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1989.0/6" class="indent">&quot;(1) For the purposes of Section 93(1)(e) the matters in issue between the defendant and the prosecution include:&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1989.0/7">(a) the question whether the defendant has a propensity to commit offences of the kind with which he is charged, where such a propensity is capable of persuading a reasonable jury of the defendant's guilt on some ground other than his bad character&quot;. That encompasses the concept of similar fact evidence because similar fact evidence is not introduced simply to introduce evidence of bad character that will tend to make the defendant look worse in the eyes of the jury; it is there in order to deal with specific issues. I have tried to set those out. I continue by suggesting, &quot;his propensity may be so capable, where it may assist a jury in determining: whether a crime has been committed; . . . the identity of the offender; . . . whether the acts of the defendant were designed or accidental; . . . whether the defendant was acting under a mistake of fact; . . . the truth or falsity of the defendant's allegations that witnesses are mistaken or lying&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1989.0/8">If the noble Baroness will examine the words with those advising her, she will see that it is absolutely clear that Clause 96(1)(a) refers to similar-fact evidence that assists a jury in determining those issues. I hope that we can have some response to that, or that we can have some discussions about it at a later stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1989.0/9">Paragraph (b) as drafted is about,</p>
	<p pid="a.1989.0/10" class="indent">&quot;the question whether the defendant has a propensity to be untruthful, except where it is not suggested that the defendant's case is untruthful in any respect&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1989.0/11">What does that mean? In virtually every trial, the issue is whether the defendant is telling the truth or not. On the face of it, the paragraph suggests that it would be possible for the prosecution to introduce evidence of propensity simply by challenging the defendant when he gives his evidence by saying, &quot;You're lying, aren't you?&quot;. &quot;No, I am not,&quot; he might reply. The prosecution might then say, &quot;Is that what you say? Then let's look at the list of convictions against you&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1989.0/12">It is not permitted in any circumstances in our current trials for the prosecution to raise an issue in cross-examination of a defendant whereby he may cast aspersions against another witness or the police and then say, &quot;Aha! You have now thrown away your shield and we are going to introduce evidence of propensity&quot;. I cannot believe that those who drafted the Bill and the Minister intend to make it possible for the prosecution to introduce convictions as part of its case simply because it says that the defendant's case is untruthful.</p>
	<p pid="a.1989.0/13">With that in mind, I have tried to redraft paragraph (b) as follows. The matter in issue is,</p>
	<p pid="a.1989.0/14" class="indent">&quot;the question whether the defendant has a propensity to tell lies where such a propensity is capable of persuading a reasonable jury of the defendant's guilt on some ground other than that he has told lies in the course of the investigation and trial of the case before them&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1989.0/15">Defendants have very often told lies in their interviews with the police, and they may very well lie when they give evidence. However, surely a defendant's propensity to tell lies could come into play only when the prosecution sought to establish something other than that he had simply told lies and that his case was untrue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1989.0/16">I am sure that I have said enough for noble Lords to appreciate that we are talking about an extremely difficult and technical part of the law, and that it would be far better to fall back on the Law Commission's Bill, which is incorporated by the original amendment and is the result of very considerable research and reflection by that body. Its provisions were in the Bill until the Commons removed them, and in our view they should prevail unless we can come to some very satisfactory understanding with the Government before the Bill is finally put to rest.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-11-19a.1991.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100667" speakername="Baroness Walmsley" colon=":" colnum="1991"  time="018:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-18.htm#31119-18_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.1991.0/1">My Lords, it may be appropriate at this point for me to speak to my Amendment No. 126B, which is in the group. Noble Lords will recall that, right from the beginning of the passage of the Bill through this House, a cross-party group of Peers interested in youth justice has sought to remove from the Bill the measure that takes away the complete ban on using bad character evidence of convictions committed by the defendant when he or she was a child. Indeed, when I tested the opinion of the House, noble Lords agreed with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1991.0/2">Since then, however, the other place has agreed to an amendment that states that such evidence,</p>
	<p pid="a.1991.0/3" class="indent">&quot;is admissible only if the court is satisfied that the interests of justice so require&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1991.0/4">We do not agree with that amendment. The interests of justice can never be served by using in court evidence of offences committed when the defendant was a child, of immature judgment and at an early stage of his or her development, given that at least seven years will have passed since those offences took place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1991.0/5">Our reasons for feeling that have been rehearsed at great length at early stages of the Bill, so I shall not weary your Lordships with those again at length. I shall simply list them very briefly to remind the House of them. First, there has been inadequate consultation on the effects of the matter. Secondly, there has been no call from expert groups or the public for the complete ban on such evidence about childhood offences. Thirdly, it cannot be relevant to bring such evidence forward in the light of the developmental changes that take place between a child's being 14 and 21, the latter age being when such evidence could be put before the court if the measures in the Bill were passed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1991.0/6">As I think I pointed out at an earlier stage, the introduction of such a measure is also inconsistent in the light of other actions and statements that the Government have made. Our law, which makes children criminals at 10, is out of step with most other civilised and developed countries, and we must not make it worse by allowing such a measure to get through the House. Most children who commit crimes are disadvantaged in some way, and should be given a second chance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1991.0/7">While we are considering the Green Paper recently brought forward by the Government, Every Child Matters, which makes many good suggestions, we should bear in mind the need for a youth justice system that is entirely separate from that of adults. All the youth justice and children's organisations are calling for that. Those are the reasons why I will in due course move Amendment No. 126B.</p>

	<p pid="a.1992.0/1">My Lords, as I understand it, the purpose of the amendment proposed by the noble Baroness to insert the additional provisions at the end of Clause 96 is to clarify the meaning of that clause. I regret to have to say that, although they are obviously there with the best intentions, they do not get away from the fundamental defects in the clause that have been pointed out and developed by the noble Lords, Lord Kingsland and Lord Thomas. I am afraid that I shall be voting with them on the matter.</p>

	<p pid="a.1992.1/1">My Lords, I say straightaway to the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, that I am very sorry indeed to have given him sleepless nights. I had hoped that I had delivered the antidote capable of providing a little balm to his troubled spirit in relation to the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1992.1/2">I have responded to the substance of the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. He posed a number of questions. If I may respectfully say so, that is why, when I opened the debate, I went through with care the way in which we think that the clause will operate. There are three real points. The first is that the Government remain of the view that all relevant evidence should be admissible and capable of going before the jury. However, there should be safeguards which would prevent that relevant evidence going forward if the defendant can establish that it was not relevant; or that it was more prejudicial than probative; or that there was some other cause using the provisions which we have now added. Those safeguards would cause the evidence to be excluded on the basis that the judge would exercise his discretion that it was unjust so to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1992.1/3">We believe that the new safeguards that we have in place cure all the ills about which noble Lords opposite have complained. It is the most powerful antidote that we can provide and we believe that the solution suffices. However, I listened with great care to what both noble Lords said and I do not know whether after our discussions there may be further or other explanations I may be able to make from the Dispatch Box which may put these issues beyond doubt. I believe that they are beyond doubt already, but in your Lordships' House I have come to recognise that my assessment and the clarity and detail which your Lordships sometimes require do not always coincide. I believe that the Government have done enough on these issues and I commend the amendment to the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.2005.2/2">The issue of hearsay evidence has been the subject of constructive discussion in the past few weeks, so I shall deal directly with the government amendment to Clause 107(1)(d), which has been agreed in the Commons as I believe that that will address concerns about the extent to which the courts should have a discretion to admit reliable statements.</p>
	<p pid="a.2005.2/3">The Government remain firmly of the view that this discretion is an important aspect of the scheme. Certainly it was considered necessary by the Law Commission. But we have listened very carefully to the concerns that have been expressed that subsection (1)(d) was insufficiently focused. The proposed amendment would tighten the language used in the discretion to ensure that this evidence can be given only where it is in the interests of justice to do so. That would allow out of court cogent and reliable statements to be used, where the hearsay rule is obscuring or shielding the truth.</p>
	<p pid="a.2005.2/4">Clause 107 represents a key part of the new coherent statutory scheme. It provides a clear context for the operation of the other provisions in this part of the Bill. We have responded to concerns about the exercise of discretion to ensure that it is operated only in appropriate circumstances. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.2005.6/1">My Lords, I beg to move that the House do not insist on its Amendment No. 138 to which the Commons have disagreed for their reason numbered 138A. I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 139, 167, 173 and 235. Those provisions deal with the sentencing issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.2005.6/2">As originally drafted, the Bill did not impose any restrictions on the timing of the increase in magistrates' sentencing powers. This allowed for a flexible approach to implementation. Amendments Nos. 138 and 139 would take away that flexibility by preventing the increase of magistrates' sentencing powers from coming into effect in advance of the custody plus provisions. The effect of that would be that the anticipated benefits of the increased magistrates' sentencing powers in terms of enabling them to retain more cases, thus saving time and money as well as benefiting victims and witnesses, could not be realised prior to the implementation of custody plus which we are aiming for as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.2005.6/3">Turning to Lords Amendment No. 167, as originally drafted the Bill provided for the indeterminate sentence of public protection to be passed if the offender was convicted of a trigger offence carrying a maximum penalty of 10 years or more and the court was of the opinion that there was a significant risk to members of the public of serious harm occasioned by the commission by him of further specified offences.</p>
	<p pid="a.2005.6/4">As we have stated in both Houses, the purpose of the test is to establish whether an offender is dangerous and in making this judgment the court must focus primarily upon the degree of the risk of harm that any future offending may pose. We do not think that the alternative test proposed by your Lordships diverts the attention of the court away from the central consideration&mdash;the harm that the offender may pose to the public. Both tests of course require a risk of reoffending to be present, but we think that the original test incorporates it in a way that better meets the interests of public safety.</p>
	<p pid="a.2005.6/5">On Amendment No. 173, as originally drafted the Bill provided for the automatic release of non-dangerous offenders serving sentences of 12 months or more at the half-way point of their sentence. However, your Lordships decided that where this sentence was of four years or more, automatic release could not occur before the offender had served two-thirds of their sentence in prison. Following the introduction of the new sentences for dangerous offenders, there is no longer any public protection justification for retaining the differential release provisions that currently exist for custodial sentences of over and under four years. Amendment No. 173 would also undermine all the benefits that would accrue from the new simplified structure of custodial sentence of 12 months or more for non-dangerous offenders, such as making the sentencing framework more transparent, increasing public confidence, assisting post-release planning and providing longer supervision periods to reduce re-offending.</p>
	<p pid="a.2005.6/6">Finally, Amendment No. 235 places a duty upon chief officers of each probation area to establish consultation arrangements with local magistrates' courts committees and local communities. We believe that that simply is not necessary. Although the Government agree with the sentiment of this amendment and acknowledge the importance of encouraging joint working, they do not believe that such a statutory duty is necessary in the light of arrangements that are already in place and those that are planned.</p>
	<p pid="a.2005.6/7">The National Probation Directorate has recently agreed with the Magistrates' Association to establish a new national consultative group which will help to give magistrates and other sentencers a clear and strong voice in the development of policy and practice. Discussions are currently taking place with the Magistrates' Association and others about the details, including the terms of reference and wider membership of the group. These are expected to be resolved by the end of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.2005.6/8">Among the first issues to be addressed when the new group meets will be how these national arrangements might be reflected at a more local level and the continuing development of local and locally agreed communication strategies to complement those at a national level. For these reasons, I beg to move that the House do not insist on the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.2005.6/9">Moved, That the House do not insist on its Amendment Nos. 138 to which the Commons have disagreed for their reason numbered 138A.&mdash;(Baroness Scotland of Asthal.)</p>

	<p pid="a.2008.8/1">My Lords, I beg to move that the House do not insist on its Amendment No. 203 to which the Commons have disagreed and do agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 203A and 203B in lieu thereof.</p>
	<p pid="a.2008.8/2">This group of amendments refers to issues regarding juveniles. To allay the concerns which have been expressed about juvenile tariffs we propose to reintroduce juveniles into the system, but we will specifically set in the statute a lower starting point for them, to recognise the special needs of the age group. The juvenile starting point will be 12 years, which reflects recent guidance given by the Lord Chief Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.2008.8/3">As I said previously, the starting point for tariffs under the schedule are not a minimum sentence. Age is still specified as a mitigating factor within these principles and courts will have the discretion to reduce from the starting point to arrive at sentences appropriate to the youth or maturity of younger juvenile offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.2008.8/4">I know that the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, whom I see is in his place, has been particularly concerned about this matter and has asked whether the Government expect the starting point of 12 years to be applied as it is currently. I refer to the Lord Chief Justice's direction that courts should as a rule of thumb reduce the starting point by one year for each year that the juvenile is below the age of majority.</p>
	<p pid="a.2008.8/5">Of course it would be inappropriate for me to limit the discretion of the courts by expecting such a mechanistic determination. The statute maintains the age of the offender as a mitigating factor which the courts may take into account above and beyond the fact that there is already a lower starting point for juveniles. That will enable the courts to move from the starting point as appropriate to set a tariff that is just in all the circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.2008.8/6">We should not forget that juvenile cases are individual. A 14 year-old may be immature, or a 17 year-old mature, so wide flexibility is vital. My right honourable friend made the point that the year-on-year reduction could be regarded as too inflexible in corresponding with the Lord Chief Justice on the practice direction of which we speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.2008.8/7">We hope though that the latitude for the exercise of discretion that we have here in outline will be more than sufficient for the judges who deal with these very complex and difficult cases to exercise appropriate discretion in differentiating between children of differing ages, backgrounds and circumstances particularly referable to the nature of the offence. With that, I hope that noble Lords will not insist on their Amendments Nos. 203 and 431, but do agree Amendments Nos. 230A and 203B in lieu of Amendment No. 203. I beg to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.2008.8/8">Moved, that this House do not insist on its Amendment No. 203 to which the Commons have disagreed and do agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 203A and 203B in lieu thereof.&mdash;(Baroness Scotland of Asthal.)</p>

	<p pid="a.2009.0/1">My Lords, I rise briefly on this important matter. I thank the noble Baroness for giving such a full and careful explanation of the reasons why the Government felt that they could not go further than the arrangement they have achieved by their amendments in lieu today.</p>
	<p pid="a.2009.0/2">I make it clear that we had always understood that there would be discretion in sentencing. Our amendments in no way impinged upon mandatory life sentences. Certainly, I welcome the fact that the Government have thought again on these matters. Noble Lords who voted to remove this provision are somewhat disappointed in a sense that we have gone from 15 to 12. That disappointment must be tempered as the noble Baroness explained, by the fact that the Government have lighted upon the Lord Chief Justice's guideline. I remarked to him this week that on that basis I certainly would not seek to resist the Government in their amendments in lieu. Therefore, I did not table a Motion today.</p>
	<p pid="a.2009.0/3">However, prior to today's debate, I had contact with the Children's Society. It wishes to make it clear that it is disappointed but perfectly understands that it would not be appropriate to press the matter now. We are all aware that there may be a proper time to debate the matter further with the Minister and on the Floor of the House when we reach a review of the youth justice system.</p>

	<p pid="a.2011.10/2">I do not intend to go over the whole case for NHS foundation trusts, other than to reiterate two key points. First, foundation trusts are totally consistent with the founding values of the NHS. They are an integral part of it, and there is absolutely no evidence that they will damage local health economies. Secondly, the governance arrangements involve patients, the public and staff in their local hospitals in a way that has never been achieved before. The argument that nobody supports foundation trusts does not stand up. When people know the advantages, they come forward and want foundation trust status.</p>
	<p pid="a.2011.10/3">As I said in Committee, 25 NHS trusts are consulting on proposals to apply for NHS foundation trust status from next April and a further 30 or so have applied to be considered for coming on-stream in autumn 2004. If all those applications were successful, some 25 per cent of the population in England would have access to NHS foundation trusts by the end of 2004. By their irresponsible actions, the two Opposition Benches have sought to wreck the Bill and thwart those local people from securing the local freedoms that they want.</p>

	<p pid="a.2012.1/1">Noble Lords should hear the rest of it. I acknowledge that there was scope for improving the original Bill. That is why the Government have proposed or accepted more than 200 amendments, 90 of them relating to NHS foundation trusts. That is clear evidence that we have listened and responded to concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.2012.1/2">This House has discharged its scrutiny and review functions. It has asked the other place to think again, and it has done so. It has rejected clearly this House's removal of Clause 1 and Schedule 1, by 303 votes to 286. In that vote, 80 per cent of Labour MPs voted in favour of foundation trusts&mdash;with 19 extra converts since the previous vote on the issue. With two votes, at least, by the Commons on the issue, it is the clear will of the Commons, the elected House, to have Clause 1 and Schedule 1 as amended restored to the Bill. I do not think that it is for this House to resist restoration.</p>
	<p pid="a.2012.1/3">Even at this late stage of the proceedings, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State has shown how much he has listened to the concerns expressed that we need to be in a position to learn from the experience of the first NHS foundation trusts before the rest of the NHS applies for that status. That is why he made it clear earlier in the other place that he was prepared to review how we proceed in the light of our experience and to learn the lessons from the early NHS foundation trusts that start up in 2004.</p>
	<p pid="a.2012.1/4">As he said then, there will be an opportunity to do that in the 12-month period before the end of the first wave of foundation trusts in autumn 2004 and autumn 2005. That is why my right honourable friend told the other place that he would ask the Commission for Healthcare Audit and Inspection&mdash;which will, of course, be accountable to Parliament, not him, under the Bill&mdash;to insist on that review. During the period of that review, the Secretary of State would not pass any new applications for a new NHS foundation trust to the independent regulator.</p>
	<p pid="a.2012.1/5">The Benches opposite have been calling for an independent review; and here is my right honourable friend offering it&mdash;an independent review at that. It will be able to consider the governance issues by which they are still troubled; it will be able to consider the relationship between NHS foundation trusts and others in the local health economy. It will be in the hands of CHAI. The report goes to Parliament, which will of course be able to debate it. What more do noble Lords have to quibble over? I urge the House to agree with the Commons reinstatement of Clause 1 and Schedule 1 as amended.</p>
	<p pid="a.2012.1/6">Before I finish, I should make absolutely clear that no matter how how many times this Bill goes back to the Commons, it will come back with Clause 1 and Schedule 1 reinstated. If that means that this House's action means that the Bill is lost, that will be a consequence of this particular House's action. I want to make absolutely clear that that is the Government's position; it will be in the public arena shortly. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.2013.1/1">My Lords, today's vote in the House of Commons means that this House must once again make a decision about Part 1. It is an important decision for the health service as a whole and for its patients, and I have thought hard about what it is best for us to do. First, we must recognise that, having been asked by your Lordships to think again on foundation trusts, the elected House has reached a decision and has approved the Government's policy for a second time.</p>
	<p pid="a.2013.1/2">However slim the Government's majority in the other place&mdash;it was extremely slim&mdash;we should not lightly dismiss that result. Our second task is to consider the issue. Nothing has changed since the House debated it on Report the week before last. The Government have made no substantive concessions to address the two main concerns voiced by noble Lords about foundation trusts&mdash;the dangers posed for the wider NHS by the creation of an elite tier of hospitals and the threat to effective and good governance of foundation trusts stemming from the Bill's confused and cumbersome governance provisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.2013.1/3">Nothing has changed on those two fronts&mdash;and my mind has certainly not changed. What has changed is the majority in the other place. I do not see how this House can fail to give weight to the fact that a Government with an overall majority of 164 was reduced to a majority of a mere 17 in the vote earlier this evening. That was not simply a majority of only 17; that was a majority achieved only by virtue of the votes of 44 Scottish Labour Members whose constituents have no direct interest in the matter at issue, and whose own health service, being devolved, is one over which the Westminster Parliament has no say.</p>
	<p pid="a.2013.1/4">Those Members of course have a perfect legal right to troop through the Lobby in support of the Government, but the outcome of the vote and its significance for this House is, I suggest, devalued because of the part that they played in it. There is a real sense in which we can say that the House of Commons has not spoken on behalf of the man and woman in the street. I do not know how many noble Lords heard the comments of Mr Frank Field, who said that if the House of Commons had been given a free vote this afternoon, the Government would have lost by at least 50.</p>
	<p pid="a.2013.1/5">Whether we agree with that precise number or not is irrelevant. The point is that the Government did not succeed in winning today's vote by persuasion or on the strength of the argument. They won it by twisting the arms of their own supporters and flying a Minister back from Australia. In contrast, it is sometimes said that this House&mdash;the unelected House&mdash;is better able to reflect the public mind than the other place. I happen to think that we can say that with confidence on the issue of foundation trusts. It is not only Members of the House of Lords who are opposed to the Government, but the BMA, the unions and, indeed, the vast bulk of the general public.</p>
	<p pid="a.2013.1/6">Yesterday, NOP published a poll in which only 4 per cent of respondents said that their top priority was to have their local hospital run by a foundation trust. In contrast, 83 per cent favoured a well run local hospital with shorter waiting times and 84 per cent of people wanted public money aimed at improving all NHS hospitals. Only 7 per cent believed that more money should be given to the hospitals that are currently doing well.</p>
	<p pid="a.2013.1/7">The Government will no doubt wave those results away, but they reflect the anxieties and opinions of real people. That public feeling and the views of those working in the health service were very powerful reasons why this House was justified in returning Clause 1 and Schedule 1 to the Commons two weeks ago. The provisions in the Bill on public consultation have been strengthened, I am glad to say. However, it is a matter of great concern that those patients and members of the public who are served by the first wave of applicant trusts will have been given no say whatever in the decision to apply for foundation status. If we had wanted proof of the Government's stated desire to involve local people in decision making on health, it would have been found in a genuine consultation exercise on the question, &quot;Foundation status&mdash;yes or no?&quot; That was one question that was never asked.</p>
	<p pid="a.2013.1/8">On an earlier occasion, I said that I was genuinely sorry to find myself opposing devolution in the NHS, and I am. However, when the detail of that devolution policy poses such dangers for the health service, I am in no doubt that opposition is necessary. I do not ask the Government to take the proposals away and never bring them back. I ask only that they take them away, refashion them in a manner that addresses the genuine concerns expressed in this House by noble Lords and by Members of another place and bring back their revised ideas in the next Session of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.2013.1/9">To noble Lords who asked why we should resist these proposals the second time, I say this: I do not want to find that, in two or three years' time, the people in my village who are sent for treatment at a local hospital discover that that hospital is less well equipped than the foundation hospital 40 miles away, because it has been unable to invest on the scale that it needs to do because the foundation trust enjoyed easier, privileged access to capital funding. Nor do I wish to find that the foundation hospital serving my 82 year-old father-in-law has decided to skew resources away from services for the elderly, from dedicated stroke units and chronic pain management because its board of governors is working to an agenda dictated by a local and vocal minority of members.</p>
	<p pid="a.2013.1/10">By definition, it is the dispossessed and socially excluded who will lose out in that model of governance. I want no part of such an ill thought out system. This House is well within its rights to reject Clause 1 for a second time. I believe that it has a duty to do so for the sake of the NHS and all those who use it. I therefore beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.2015.0/1">My Lords, I support Amendment No. 1B, and I shall speak to Amendment No. 161CC.</p>
	<p pid="a.2015.0/2">Many of us heard a powerful debate in the other place, whether we were present in the Gallery or saw it on television. It was impressive to see many Labour MPs take a principled stand on the issue. The fact that, despite the concessions, the Government achieved half the majority that they had on an earlier occasion demonstrated that the Government's arguments are becoming thinner by the hour. The speech made by the noble Lord, Lord Warner, today was characteristic of that: it was short, to the point and entirely devoid of reasoned argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.2015.0/3">I heard the Secretary of State on the radio this morning and also in the House. His understanding of history seemed to be completely flawed, and I felt like sending him a reading list. He should brush up on the history of the NHS: William Beveridge was a Liberal and one of the architects of the NHS. Instead of that, we heard that we were tearing down the NHS and that those of us on these Benches were partly responsible, along with all sorts of other villains and miscreants. That is a very partial view of history.</p>
	<p pid="a.2015.0/4">My honourable friend Paul Burstow made it clear during the debate today that Liberal Democrats had no argument with devolution in the NHS. We too wish to see NHS hospitals freed from micro-management and inappropriate targets. However, foundation trusts, in their present form, are not the instrument for that. They were not in the Government's manifesto at the previous election, and they were not in the NHS Plan. There was no consultation on the new system, yet Ministers have been cooking up the proposals and inviting applications since the beginning of last year. The method of selection, via the star rating system, is arbitrary, with the Secretary of State making the final decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.2015.0/5">Local consultation has also been flawed. Whole London boroughs have been excluded from consultation and from the governance arrangements proposed for applicant foundation hospitals. Much of the consultation has assumed the form of a fait accompli. The coverage of foundation trusts will be partial and potentially competitive, yet foundation trusts can and may have a profound effect on the balance of the local health economy and the services that local people need. It is hardly surprising that cancer networks, for example, are fearful of the future. The powers of the regulator are not spelt out and take insufficient heed of that fact.</p>
	<p pid="a.2015.0/6">As I said on Report, the key issue, ultimately, is whether there will be any resulting benefit for patients. The well respected Health Select Committee rightly asked whether such competition between hospitals would benefit patients. The poll referred to by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, demonstrated the ignorance of the public about foundation trusts. Those who know what foundation trusts mean are against them. The doctors, nurses and other staff in the NHS are deeply sceptical about the proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.2015.0/7">As my honourable friend said, in so far as foundation trusts secure freedom to act, it is hard to see how that freedom will not disadvantage the hospitals that are left behind. The rules for borrowing are a key example. Foundation trusts will have an advantage over other NHS trusts; they will have easier access to capital. The Treasury has ensured that there will be a zero-sum game, as we have pointed out relentlessly through the passage of the Bill. The NHS capital pot is fixed in size. If foundation trusts can dip into that pot more easily, it will be at the expense of the rest of the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.2015.0/8">My honourable friend also pointed out the short-term nature of the requirement for foundation trusts to adhere to Agenda for Change. There is nothing in the Bill to prevent foundation trusts, over time, varying their pay and conditions, in order to be better placed to expand. Foundation trusts will soon be able to compete on pay and conditions, at the expense of patients treated anywhere else in the NHS. So much for the assurances that the Minister gave about the duty of co-operation with other parts of the NHS that foundation trusts will have.</p>
	<p pid="a.2015.0/9">Our amendment deals, in particular, with the governance arrangements set out in Schedule 1. Schedule 1 amounts to the ramshackle and expensive construction of sham democracy, with self-selected members, powerless governing bodies and massively expensive servicing requirements. My honourable friend who, most unusually, reads Hansard for this House, noted that the most powerful speeches in regard to foundation hospitals and governance were those of the noble Lords, Lord Lipsey and Lord Harris.</p>
	<p pid="a.2015.0/10">Finally, as Members on these Benches pointed out on Report, foundation trusts start at the wrong point. It is in commissioning where we need to give local control: to those who commission healthcare and who need to be responsive to local needs. The commissioners&mdash;the primary care trusts&mdash;should be democratically accountable. That is what Members on these Benches in both Houses have argued for. It remains a mystery why the Government did not accept that from the outset. Instead, new governance arrangements simply re-emphasise the dominance of acute hospitals at the expense of primary care, preventive health strategies designed to improve public health and reduce health inequalities, along with the integration of health and social care.</p>
	<p pid="a.2015.0/11">The Government have retreated to a great extent on this Bill. Now we have last-minute concessions that amend the Bill so that it will affect a shrinking number of applicants, now down to some 50 or so. The Government should make this retreat complete and drop Part 1. If the Bill as a whole is lost, then let us be quite clear: this has been an accident waiting to happen right from the outset&mdash;as a result of the Government's own actions, which are entirely self-inflicted. The Government should accept the verdict of this House and of NHS staff.</p>

	<p pid="a.2017.0/1">My Lords, I hope that the House will support my noble friend and reject the Motion proposed by the noble Earl, Lord Howe. We have debated the issue of foundation trusts through the many stages of this Bill. Although noble Lords have expressed some concerns and issues have been raised at each stage, the fact is that this House has asked the other place to think again, the other place has done so and, by a majority of 17 votes, it has decided to support the implementation of the policy to introduce foundation trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.2017.0/2">Surely the role of this House, as a revising Chamber, has now been fulfilled. It has asked the House of Commons to think again, which it has done. We could argue about the size of the majority, but a majority is a majority and, for me, a majority vote of 17 is sufficient for the decision to have been made.</p>
	<p pid="a.2017.0/3">The role of this House is to question, to challenge and to revise. Were any objective commentator to look at the process of this Bill, he would conclude that the Government have listened. My noble friend has accepted a number of amendments proposed by myself and other noble Lords. In fact, a considerable number of amendments have been voted on and accepted by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.2017.0/4">Today, the Government have accepted a suggestion that the first wave of foundation trusts should go forward and then should be subject to review by an independent body before other NHS trusts are allowed to become foundation trusts. What could be fairer than that in terms of listening to, thinking about and accepting the views and concerns of noble Lords in this House? The Government have said that they will review the position. They will ask an independent body to look at what progress has been made before any further NHS trusts can become foundation trusts. Is not that the purpose of this House? Noble Lords have asked the Government to look again at their proposals and the Government have done so. They have modified their plans to accommodate a review of how the first tranche of foundation trusts goes forward before others are allowed to follow. On what possible basis can this House now say that it will reject the views of the elected Chamber?</p>
	<p pid="a.2017.0/5">What is the purpose of the creation of foundation trusts? Surely it is this: it is to ensure that, over the next few years, the NHS is governed and run in the most effective way possible. After the way in which the NHS has so far been run&mdash;through micro-management, central diktat and a central accountability to Parliament which inhibits and gets in the way of innovation and local implementation of national policies&mdash;does anyone suggest that we ought not to move on to a more devolved system of administration? That is what foundation trusts will do. Surely we should put our trust in local people to elect their fellow citizens to take part in the governance of the NHS in the future. That is what foundation trusts will do.</p>
	<p pid="a.2017.0/6">The Government have listened. They have revised their proposals and, ultimately, the other place has decided, through a democratic vote, the way in which it wishes to go. For the sake of the NHS, surely we should now allow these measures to go through.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-11-19a.2018.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100213" speakername="Baroness Finlay of Llandaff" colon=":" colnum="2018"  time="022:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-25.htm#31119-25_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.2018.0/1">My Lords, at this late stage of the Bill I hesitate to return to the core issue, but I should like to do so. The devolved administrations of Wales and Scotland do not wish to head towards foundation trust status and yet people in central administration in those bodies are extremely close to the populations they serve. That is not in any way to swipe at Parliament as it stands, but it is worth noting.</p>
	<p pid="a.2018.0/2">It is also worth noting that the BMA wrote to MPs prior to the vote today and reiterated its arguments. It has been following closely the debates in this House and there is concern in the profession that this marks a return to the internal market of the early 1990s and that the establishment of foundation trusts will prove divisive and exacerbate the inequalities in the NHS&mdash;and no one denies that there are inequalities in the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.2018.0/3">The encouragement of competition could fly in the face of the fantastically good work that has been done with the establishment of collaborative clinical networks, particularly the cancer networks, that have been driving up improvements in clinical care.</p>
	<p pid="a.2018.0/4">Not all hospitals are of an equally high standard and we should aim to level up standards of care. There is a real concern that those in the first wave will have an advantage. What will happen if foundation trusts concentrate on the areas of service provision that are profitable and easy to manage, as seen within the private sector? Prior to coming into the Chamber today, I phoned a consultant in ITU to check that I had my facts right. Patients eligible for NHS treatment but treated in private hospitals are indeed transferred to NHS ITUs when resources are not available in the private sector. That is because the NHS as it stands is able to provide comprehensive care for the very sickest people in our population. But it is not profitable care and I cannot see how a foundation trust will want to indulge in the most unprofitable parts of care provision, particularly with the targets set as they are at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.2018.0/5">The primary care trusts' commissioning powers could potentially be undercut by these new providers within the hinterland of their governing body. I listened to the debate in another place and the Minister did indeed refer to a review after the first year. But, of the questions that were posed, two were not answered. First, what happens if these foundation trusts are failing? Will they revert to the NHS as they were before? The second question that was not answered was whether the review would address the impact of a foundation trust on the total health economy of the population being served. Unless a review addresses that, we will simply be putting blinkers on those conducting it regarding the way in which a total health economy could be affected by these changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.2018.0/6">It has been said that there is no evidence that foundation trusts will damage local health economies, but is there any evidence that they will improve care and the local health economies? I have pleaded on many occasions for evidence-based management in the NHS, and I make that plea again. We are looking at an idea driven by any political mantra that one might choose. I speak as a Cross-Bencher and not a party member, but I work in the NHS and I find myself in a bizarre position because of that. I see the burgeoning pressures on the service as it is now, the imbalance between capacity and demand. How do we put the patients' needs back at the heart of all aspects of healthcare?</p>
	<p pid="a.2018.0/7">Currently, the priority seems subtly and inexorably to have shifted from the patient to the paperwork and the management response to targets. I am not sure whether evidence as such&mdash;scientifically evaluated evidence&mdash;is really driving this debate or whether it is political ideas and headlines.</p>
	<p pid="a.2018.0/8">Perhaps the whole NHS needs a very simple message, and it may be completely obvious. First, every healthcare professional at every level should make sure that the patient is comfortable in body, mind and spirit, however that needs to be done. Secondly, they should ensure that the relatives are calm and understand what is happening. Thirdly&mdash;and this should be done only after the first two tasks have been completed&mdash;they should fill out the paperwork and see whether the management targets have been met. Perhaps we could prioritise patients again by going over to a mantra of &quot;123&quot;, rather like &quot;ABC&quot; for resuscitation. I am not convinced that management changes at the top will achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="a.2018.0/9">The way in which the patient is made comfortable must be evidence-based. Similarly, management changes must be evidence-based. I ask the House to look at whether there really is evidence that these management changes will bring about the outcomes that are hoped for in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.2018.0/10">I do not want to comment on the way in which votes have been cast in one way or another. It feels uncomfortable to be speaking with a time limit of the end of this Session of Parliament. I sincerely believe that if we had had more time to look through these proposals, more might have been achieved.</p>

	<p pid="a.2020.0/1">My Lords, I should like to take up one point made by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, whose views on these matters the House respects greatly. He rested his case on the need for greater devolution in respect of hospitals. I think he would accept that these Benches need no lessons on the virtues of devolution. It is an article of faith for us that government has been far too centrally administered by this and previous Administrations, and that the more devolution we have, broadly speaking, the better for this country. The issue, however, as was well stated by my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones, is whether the means and extent of devolution which these proposals would entail might be discriminatory and unequal in their impact.</p>
	<p pid="a.2020.0/2">If we are to have devolution&mdash;and, in principle, these Benches are wholly in favour of it&mdash;let us have devolution for all. Let us avoid some of the discriminatory effects that will flow from the Government's proposals and the bureaucratic and governmental flaws that we believe are part of the proposed system.</p>

	<p pid="a.2020.1/1">My Lords, my noble friend Lord Howe has already eloquently set out the views of these Benches on why we continue to believe that the foundation hospital proposals are misguided in this Bill and why they are harmful to the NHS overall. We are quite used to the Minister not listening to the views of these Benches&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.2020.3/1">Yes, my Lords, it is indeed&mdash;it is a further contribution from the Front Bench. We believe that these matters to be so important that we should outline why we believe that the Bill should be sent back to another place.</p>
	<p pid="a.2020.3/2">I was about to say that we expect the Minister not to take account of those on these Benches. However, I am surprised that the well expressed views of the noble Baroness, Lady Finlay&mdash;who represents the views of so many in the clinical professions involved in the NHS&mdash;have not been listened to. We believe there to be very serious flaws in the concept of foundation trusts, and it is because of that that we oppose the Bill and believe that it should be sent back to another place and considered again.</p>
	<p pid="a.2020.3/3">I shall cover some areas that we believe to be particularly important, to show why we believe the concept to be so flawed. Noble Lords opposite may not want to listen, but we believe it to be important that the other place hears why we do not believe that the Bill should pass and that we believe that it has flaws that should be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.2020.3/4">I should like to address first the issue of how the finances will work. When the idea of foundation trusts was first launched, it was supposed to give flexibility to NHS trusts, to give them more access to finance. In practice, those freedoms have not been available. NHS trusts seriously wanted those freedoms because they are shackled by the double whammy of Department of Health bureaucracy and the financial constraints of the Treasury. They had no real freedoms, and they were desperate for freedoms so that they could start to borrow to develop their own delivery of healthcare for their local areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.2020.3/5">The idea of foundation trusts sounded almost too good to be true&mdash;and of course it was too good to be true, because the Chancellor of the Exchequer invented the zero-sum games to which the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, referred. The zero-sum game means that for every pound that NHS foundation trusts borrow, the money available to the rest of the NHS will be reduced. The Chancellor will in effect be pulling the strings of the NHS in all ways, including all foundation trusts.</p>
	<p pid="a.2020.3/6">We believed that foundation trusts would be able to access new sources of finance in the commercial sector, but that, too, is an illusion. We learned only yesterday about the fact that they will be fully borrowed, with virtually no capacity to borrow extra from the private sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.2020.3/7">There is a sketchy borrowing code in the Bill, and borrowing limits that seem not to have any meaning whatever. Others have already touched on governance structures, which are deeply flawed, and do not make clear the respective roles of the board of governors and board of directors.</p>
	<p pid="a.2020.3/8">There are other issues in the Bill that are simply not worked out properly. The Minister constantly told us about flexibility, but flexibility really means that the Government do not know the answers. For those reasons&mdash;that they have not delivered on financial freedoms, that the government structures are weak and ill thought-out, and because there is so much detail lacking&mdash;we believe that the Bill should be sent back to the other place.</p>

	<p pid="a.2021.0/1">My Lords, I was not intending to speak again but, having listened to some of the contributions from the Benches opposite, I cannot resist it.</p>
	<p pid="a.2021.0/2">The debate is taking place as though we had not spent nine days considering the Bill, and as though there had not been 200 amendments that the Government have moved or accepted, 90 of which were on foundation trusts. Those on the Opposition Front Bench seem to operate on the basis that they can rake up all the things that they have discussed over those nine days. They have not moved amendments on them; if they are so keen to get the Bill right, why have they not moved amendments on those matters and carried them through the House? We have actually accepted a lot of the things that they have moved, and they have withdrawn their amendments, but they continue to talk about those things as though the Government had not listened. They simply have not had the nerve to move those amendments and to put them to a vote if that is what they wanted to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.2021.0/3">We have had the same old story from the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, about the zero-sum game. The Benches opposite simply do not accept the billion pounds more that have been put into the NHS in both capital and revenue. There was a zero-sum game under the administration of the Benches opposite, when people did have to queue for money. However, we are talking about a hugely enlarged pot. It has always been the case that, ultimately, both under their administration and under this Government, the pot is finite. However, this is a much bigger pot in which everyone in the NHS is sharing.</p>
	<p pid="a.2021.0/4">We had the dreary old story of the Scottish MPs. As I understand our constitution, all MPs in the House of Commons are equal. Perhaps the Conservative Front Bench is a bit short of Scottish MPs and that is part of its problem. We also had the same old story from the Liberal Democrats about the first foundation trust applicants being chosen on the basis of star ratings. That is simply not true. If noble Lords go back to Hansard they will see that I have said that that is not true. The Secretary of State will judge those applications on a much wider basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.2021.0/5">I could go on, but the brute fact is that the House of Commons has voted to reinstate Clause 1 and Schedule 1. The Benches opposite do not like it because there was a clear majority. They did their best to ensure that that majority was not sufficient. However, it is a clear majority. It is the will of the House of Commons that Clause 1 and Schedule 1 should be restored to the Bill. I urge noble Lords to let the will of the Commons prevail in this area, to reject Amendment No. 1B and not to insist on Amendment No. 1.</p>

	<p pid="a.2022.0/1">My Lords, I want to be fair to the Government this evening. The Minister conveyed the Secretary of State's offer to conduct a review of the Government's arrangements after a period of time; that offer is certainly not to be dismissed and I do not dismiss it. I understand the offer to me that the review would precede the approval of further applications for foundation status. If that is right, then I think we ought to recognise the downside of the offer. It will serve to entrench the two-tier system for even longer than will currently be the case. If only the Government had taken the trouble to listen to people before embarking on this policy, if only they had taken their time to get the detail of it right, we would not be having this debate this evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.2022.0/2">Nothing the Minister has said persuades me that this House is wrong in opposing once again these deeply flawed proposals. That is why I now ask the House to accept my amendment.</p>

The vote may have been as it was in the Commons after all the excitement of votes on Clause 1 and Schedule 1. However, there remains a concern about the impact of foundation trusts on the local health economy and that is precisely why the Government achieved the low majority in the other place. It is also why this House remains concerned and why the previous vote went the way that it did. However, in these circumstances, I shall not move my amendment.</p>

At that time it would be wise for the House to give time to reflect on the amendments that have been made to the Criminal Justice Bill and are in dispute between the two Houses. I shall therefore seek at 11.15 to move the adjournment of the House for today, so that we might resume discussion of the Criminal Justice Bill and any other outstanding business on the morrow.</p>

	<p pid="a.2035.5/1">My Lords, if we wait for that message until 11.45 p.m. it means that we shall not be able to start discussion of the Criminal Justice Bill until one o'clock or, probably, later. By the time that we have completed discussion of it and it has gone back it will obviously be three o'clock&mdash;or something like that&mdash;in the morning. That is particularly late&mdash;especially by the standards of the House of Commons these days. We should of course think about the wellbeing of our colleagues at the other end of the Corridor, as well as our own.</p>
	<p pid="a.2035.5/2">More seriously, as far as I can detect, the various parties seem to have moved close to one another on the Bill on the various outstanding issues. We should, as a House, attempt to facilitate the ability of the Government, Opposition and other parties to come to an agreement about the future and settle it on a Bill about which there has been much controversy.</p>
	<p pid="a.2035.5/3">I therefore think that it is much better if we adjourn the House today at this point and resume our discussion in the morning. The message is now due between now and 11.45, but it can perfectly well be received if the House is not sitting&mdash;it does not require the House to be sitting for the Clerks to do their necessary work on it&mdash;so that when we return tomorrow morning at eleven o'clock for Questions, we could then proceed to discuss it in a proper manner.</p>
	<p pid="a.2035.5/4">Meanwhile, the parties will have had a better opportunity to discuss and reach agreement on the outstanding issues. If not, they could, in my view, be settled quickly by votes tomorrow and the Bill would proceed, or not, by virtue of the decisions of both Houses. So I think that it is better if the House adjourns until tomorrow&mdash;in the interests of the Commons, good government and arriving at sensible legislation; which we all want. I am not sure whether I need to move an amendment that we should adjourn now for the evening, as opposed to adjourning until 11.45 p.m.</p>
	<p pid="a.2035.5/5">Moved, as an amendment to the Motion, leave out from &quot;House&quot; to end and insert, &quot;do now adjourn&quot;.&mdash;(Lord Cope of Berkeley.)</p>

	<p pid="a.2036.0/1">My Lords, I very much hope that the House will not now adjourn. Everything has a precedent and I hope that the current situation has occurred during the past 100 years or so. I have not been here for all that time, but I am somewhat puzzled that the noble Lord, Lord Cope, with his troops here and with his troops in the other place who all predicted tonight going well into the night and into the morning, should find what I can only believe is a political reason for choosing not to proceed as we have before. The puzzle is that Members on the Opposition Benches and these Benches were told, not only that it would be a very late night, but that the sitting would run well into the morning, so we are here to do our business. We know the score and the arithmetic of what would happen: the wholly unelected House, the House of Lords, would be dictating to the elected House. We do not intend that that should last much longer, but it is the current situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.2036.2/1">My Lords, I very much hope that that was taken as a threat, as it is the reality. It is a nonsense that the elected House, in trying to do its business, should find that its will is thwarted time and again by a wholly unelected House. I am here to transact the business that the House was told would be dealt with. I see no reason why we should not proceed along the lines that the Government Deputy Chief Whip has suggested.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-11-19a.2036.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100550" speakername="Lord Roper" colon=":" colnum="2036"  time="022:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-30.htm#31119-30_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.2036.3/1">My Lords, it would not be useful to prolong the debate, but, in view of the remarks made by the noble Lord, Lord Graham, I must make two points. The noble Lord, Lord Cope, and I have made it clear to the Government Chief Whip throughout the week that it would not be sensible to continue serious business of this House after midnight tonight. We have secured on the Order Paper provision for the House to meet tomorrow, as has the House of Commons. Given that we will have no further business until 1 a.m., it would be appropriate for us to adjourn now.</p>
	<p pid="a.2036.3/2">The late Leader of the House Lord Williams of Mostyn repeatedly said how foolish it was for this House to carry out business after midnight. At such a time, when we are trying to resolve very difficult political issues, we will get better and more sensible answers if we have time to sleep, to discuss and come back tomorrow with sensible decisions. I hope, therefore, that we can proceed to a vote on the Motion of the noble Lord, Lord Cope.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-11-19a.2037.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100112" speakername="Lord Carter" colon=":" colnum="2037"  time="022:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-30.htm#31119-30_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.2037.0/1">My Lords, we should be clear what we are doing. As the noble Lord, Lord Cope, knows well, it is a longstanding convention that the Government adjourn the House. In my five years as Chief Whip, there has been one exception: during the debate on House of Lords reform, which was a special case. That is certainly not the case tonight. During 10 years on the Opposition Front Bench, I cannot remember trying to adjourn the House against the wishes of the Government. Clearly, the Opposition will win tonight, as they have their troops and the Liberal Democrats. But we are pushing our conventions to the limit. It is a clear convention that it is the Government who adjourn the House; they should not be forced to do so by the Opposition.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-11-19a.2037.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="2037"  time="022:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-30.htm#31119-30_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.2037.1/1">My Lords, the debate is so important that I wish that the Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms, the Chief Whip, were present. Unfortunately, he cannot be here, as he is at Buckingham Palace, at the command of Her Majesty. I wish that he were here, and I might even say that I wish that I were there at this moment. During this short debate, I have had the supreme advantage of hearing contributions from two former Chief Whips on this side of the House, who have spoken with great authority and sense.</p>
	<p pid="a.2037.1/2">It would be unprecedented if the House adjourned at this stage. We sometimes devalue the issues that occur at this time of the year between this House and the other place by referring to the process as &quot;ping-pong&quot;, as if it were a game. By analogy, ping-pong requires two players, and one player at the other end continues to play. Are we, as the unelected House, taking our bat and going home, when the House that represents the people of this country is waiting on our deliberations and decisions?</p>
	<p pid="a.2037.1/3">I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Cope, for drawing attention to the sitting hours of the House of Commons. However, I wish that he had drawn attention to their elected base rather than the conditions under which they work, because it is their elected position that counts at this time. We are the revising body. They are the body required to pass legislation on which they have a mandate. Therefore, let me put it to the House again: if we adjourn, we will be carrying out an unprecedented act. We will have ended ping-pong unilaterally for the first time. It is an unprecedented situation. If the House can act unilaterally in this way, it will cause great concern outside this House and set a most unfortunate precedent for the way in which this House considers its important role of revising legislation. I suggest that we reject the amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-11-19a.2038.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100143" speakername="Lord Cope of Berkeley" colon=":" colnum="2038"  time="022:57:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031119/text/31119-30.htm#31119-30_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.2038.0/1">My Lords, the Captain of the Yeomen of the Guard drew attention to the absence of the Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms, but I made absolutely no complaint about the absence of the Government Chief Whip. On the contrary, if the state banquet were not proceeding, perhaps the Leader of my party would be standing at this Dispatch Box rather than myself because he is at the same function. I make no complaint about that, but it draws attention to the difficulties of conducting negotiations on this legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.2038.0/2">I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Graham, did not take me at my word when I said earlier that my desire was to facilitate negotiations between the various parties to try to get the best legislation. I do not think that we would achieve that by dragging things on between the Houses until two, three or four o'clock in the morning. As the Deputy Chief Whip said, we sometimes devalue this process by calling it ping-pong. However, it is a very serious process and it concerns serious issues. The issues on the Criminal Justice Bill are, after all, to do with liberties, such as a fair trial and so forth. Those issues deserve consideration and I hope that we can make more progress before we finally decide the matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.2038.0/3">I do not think that it is such a great thing to postpone further deliberations until tomorrow. As the noble Lord, Lord Roper, said, all sides have always envisaged that. Business was predicated on the basis that we might sit tomorrow and that we might have business to deal with tomorrow. That is a sensible time to do it. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.2038.1/1">My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down, I have listened to the comments made by the noble Lords, Lord Carter and Lord Graham, who said that this situation is unprecedented. I also heard it said that only the Government have the opportunity to adjourn. Do the Opposition have the constitutional right to move an adjournment in the circumstances?</p>

	<p pid="a.2038.2/1">My Lords, we have the absolute right under the rules of the House to move the adjournment. We do not decide the adjournment. The Government do not decide the adjournment. The House decides the adjournment. That is how things work every day. Of course, on most days I am glad to say that we succeed in reaching agreement through the usual channels and I am grateful for the co-operation. Occasionally however, that is not possible. This situation is not unprecedented as the noble Lord, Lord Graham, suggested, and it is certainly within the rules. The House will decide as it ordinarily does. I am sorry that it has not been possible to reach agreement between the usual channels on these matters, but when great issues are at stake and we are in a difficult situation&mdash;which is not an everyday situation as far as your Lordships are concerned&mdash;the House must decide what to do.</p>
