<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-07-19a.375.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100460" speakername="Baroness Noakes" colon=":" colnum="375"  time="011:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70719-0002.htm#07071993000109">
	<p pid="a.375.0/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister for introducing the Motion. The other place continues to assert that the rules for pre-release are more appropriately made by Ministers. It has been the consistent position of your Lordships' House that the independent Statistics Board, created by this Bill, should set the rules.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/2">When we last debated the issue, the Minister said that the board would be consulted on the draft statutory instrument containing the rules, but he resisted the notion that consultation should be placed on the face of the Bill. We did not understand that then and we are not surprised that the Government climbed down on that in another place. Amendment No. 15F places consultation with the board in the Bill. It is not even as much as half a loaf, but we accept it none the less.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/3">The Minister has also made much of the Prime Minister's announcement that pre-release would be reduced to 24 hours. The Government have resisted here and in another place putting that maximum in the Bill. The Minister explained that very succinctly on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-09">9 July</phrase> when he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/4" class="indent">&quot;We do not want to put the length of time for pre-release access in primary legislation as we want flexibility&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 9/7/07; col. 1237.]</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/5">That can mean only one thing: that the Prime Minister's announcement of the 24-hour limit is not a maximum; it is a minimum to be varied upwards without statutory constraint. The Prime Minister's 24-hour commitment, therefore, lacks substance. However, neither of these commitments, to consultation and to 24 hours, really addresses the core issue&mdash;that the Government should not be setting the limits at all; it should be done by the independent Statistics Board.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/6">We have thought carefully about whether we should ask the other House to think about this again. We thought especially carefully about it in the light of the views expressed by Sir Michael Scholar, the Government's nominated chairman of the Statistics Board, when he appeared before the Treasury Select Committee in another place yesterday afternoon. Sir Michael's very clear view was that it would be preferable for the Statistics Board to set the rules. He also expressed the view that less than 24 hours would be desirable. I should say at this point that we welcome Sir Michael Scholar as chairman. He is known to many of us in your Lordships' House as a man of exceptional integrity and ability. If the Government think that they have selected someone who will be a pushover, they had better think again.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/7">The Minister in another place tried to argue that, because the Government had conceded a number of points in amendments to the Bill, that was a reason not to give in on pre-release. The Minister set out those changes again today though he did not go as far as claiming that that meant he did change have to change anything more. When the Bill was first presented it was not a good Bill, and it is now a much better Bill; but the fact that the Government accept that they got it wrong on several issues does not entitle them to remain in the wrong on the issue of pre-release. All of that led me to believe that we should fight on for the principle of pre-release not being in the hands of the Government. But we recognise that the other place has clearly expressed the opposite view. We have therefore reluctantly come to the view that your Lordships' House should accept the judgment of the elected House on the issue of pre-release.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/8">The Government continue to toy with ideas of elections to this House, and we shall perhaps hear more of that later today. They should be very clear that if this House were wholly or mainly elected it is very likely that we would not give way on issues of principle such as this. So we cede this point today to the elected House. In so doing we express the strong hope and desire that the Statistics Board will act independently and forthrightly in relation to all its functions but in particular to pre-release. We want the board to speak out openly and fearlessly against the Government when necessary. The consultation on the draft statutory instrument creating the pre-release rules will give the new board an early opportunity to show us what it is made of. We shall be watching the board's words and deeds with great interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.375.0/9">That leads me to my last point: who will be watching the Statistics Board once it is up and running? The case was made during our deliberations most forcefully by my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding&mdash;who is not able to be in his place today&mdash;that there should be a Standing Committee of both Houses set up to oversee the work of the Statistics Board. That reflected our view that the board's work is so important that it transcends departmental boundaries and should involve the expertise of both Houses. I hope that the Minister can today give the House an indication of the Government's views on this. We accept that it is a matter for the authorities of both Houses, but we all know that reality is that the views of the Government of the day are influential. I hope that the Minister will be able to conclude our proceedings on the Bill by giving some positive news on that front.</p>

	<p pid="a.389.5/1">My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall repeat a Statement made by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Justice in another place. The Statement is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.389.5/2">&quot;With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to make a Statement on the way forward on reform of the House of Lords. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-07">7 March 2007</phrase>, after the free votes in both Houses, I said I would make arrangements to reconvene the cross-party working group, and after discussions with that group I would return to this House to make a Statement outlining the Government's plans.&quot;The free votes marked the fulfilment of the specific terms of one of our manifesto commitments on House of Lords reform. While this was an important milestone in the history of Lords reform over the past 100 years, we must not now lose the opportunity to make further and more fundamental reform happen.&quot;In March, this House voted overwhelmingly, by a majority of 113, for a wholly elected House of Lords. It backed by a margin of 38 a substantially elected House based on 80 per cent elected and 20 per cent appointed. It also voted by a majority of 280 to remove the remaining hereditary Peers. As part of a comprehensive package of reforms, the Government are committed to removing this anomaly of the remaining hereditary Peers, in line with the will of this House. As this House will be aware, at the same time the other place voted for a wholly appointed House by a majority of 240.&quot;My right honourable friend the Prime Minister in his Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-03">3 July</phrase> set out the Government's view that we should proceed in line with the wishes of this House, which all accept is the primary Chamber. This approach was underlined in the Green Paper on constitutional reform, <I>The Governance of Britain</I>, published on the same day. The Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties are also committed by their 2005 manifestos to a substantially elected House of Lords. &quot;Tomorrow in the other place, the Private Member's Bill of the noble Lord, Lord Steel, on Lords reform will have its Second Reading. My noble friend Lord Hunt of Kings Heath will expand on our response when he comes to speak in this debate, but suffice it now to say that this Bill does not contain the comprehensive reform which is the clear will of this House.&quot;The cross-party talks before the free votes were successful in building up a significant degree of consensus on a wide range of issues, as reflected in the White Paper,<I> House of Lords Reform, </I>published in February. I believe this is the best way of proceeding. I shall continue to lead the cross-party talks, and since the free votes we have held two further meetings.&quot;As all three main parties are committed by their manifestos to further reform of the House of Lords, it is right that the group should consist of Front-Bench representatives of those parties, as well as representatives of the Cross Benches and Lords spiritual. But of course we want the widest possible consensus and I intend to make arrangements so that we can take proper account of the views of all parliamentarians, including non-party independent members, as well as interest groups and the public.&quot;The White Paper I published in February this year was adumbrated on the view that consensus lay on a 'hybrid' House for a 50 per cent elected and 50 per cent appointed House of Lords. Since this option was rejected in both Houses, we have to proceed with remodelling our work based on an 80 per cent or 100 per cent elected House of Lords. While there is agreement on some of the areas outlined in the White Paper, there is still some way to go on others. So the group will be discussing the outstanding elements of the reform package, including powers, electoral systems, financial packages, balance and size of the House, including diversity and gender issues. We will also need to discuss the transition towards a reformed House in detail, including the position of existing life Peers and the need for action to avoid gratuitously cutting Conservative Party representation in the Lords when and if the remaining hereditary Peers are removed. &quot;Let me now turn to the powers of a reformed House. The Government have always said that the balance of powers between the two Houses described by the excellent and recent Cunningham report should apply to a reformed House. These powers are currently underpinned by some statutory provisions, standing orders and conventions. We undertook to look further at whether the current conventions were adequate to ensure the desired relationship with a reformed House after the free votes. Over the coming months, we will be looking at how best to deliver a substantially or wholly elected House, based on the principle that this House is the primary Chamber and that an elected House of Lords should complement the Commons and not be a rival to it. As part of that programme of work it is vital that the relative powers of a reformed House are made clear. We will therefore be looking at ways to enshrine in a constitutional settlement the current balance of powers and the different roles of the two Houses. &quot;The Government are determined to proceed with this programme of reform with a view to its completion. In dealing with such a central element of the constitution, it is right that there is as much all-party agreement as possible. I accept that there may well not be total agreement, but the constitution does not belong to any one party and it should not be used as a partisan tool. The immediate next steps are that I hope to be able to publish a further White Paper around the turn of the year setting out where we have got to by then in the cross-party talks, possibly accompanied with draft clauses.&quot;Our intention through the work of the cross-party group is to formulate a comprehensive reform package which we would put to the electorate as a manifesto commitment at the next general election, and which we hope the other main parties will include in their manifestos. There may of course be areas upon which each party takes a different view, but I believe that there is the potential to reach a degree of cross-party consensus which could lead to the completion of Lords reform. The free votes in the Commons in March gave us a clear direction of travel on an issue which has dogged the country for decades. We now have a chance finally to finish the job&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.389.5/3">My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-07-19a.393.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100846" speakername="Lord Tyler" colon=":" colnum="393"  time="013:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70719-0005.htm#07071993000195">
	<p pid="a.393.0/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister on behalf of my noble friends, and we welcome him to his post. The Prime Minister, in his Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-03">3 July</phrase>, said that he intended to press ahead with reform. It is fair to say that if this is pressing ahead, it is a snail-like process. Hearing the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, apparently wanting to slow down that process after 95 years reminds me that the Duke of York at least marched his troops up to the top of the hill; the noble Lord seems to be more energy-efficient in that respect, and is not even bothering to march them up to the top.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/2">In Cornwall, we have the word &quot;dreckly&quot;. It is much used by plumbers and others in the sense that the Spanish use the word &quot;ma&ntilde;ana&quot;, but with less urgency. After 95 years, it is fair to say that today's Statement does not take us one step further. It fulfils the promise made by the Prime Minister that there would be a Statement, but scarcely takes us further than that.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/3">The Statement accepts the facts of political life, however. The House of Commons has voted decisively. The leaderships of all three parties are committed to reform&mdash;even, I think, the Front Benches in this House. The new Prime Minister and Government have reiterated the former commitments. I hope the Statement gives the so-called &quot;refuseniks&quot; in both Houses the opportunity to recognise that from now on our job as parliamentarians is to try constructively to contribute to the process, rather than to slow it down or filibuster to make it impossible to make reasonable progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/4">I seek some assurances on behalf of my noble friends. If there is to be no Bill as such in the coming Session, why would it not be possible now to give us a promise of a draft Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny? The Statement refers to draft clauses, but surely it would be better still to have a full draft Bill in front of a Joint Committee of both Houses so that we could have a comprehensive view of this and not exclusively seek solutions at one end of the building that may exclude those from the other end.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/5">I accept that the Minister has a personal interest, but can he give us an assurance that the so-called Hunt report is dead and buried and will not be exhumed? There has been unanimous rejection of various attempts to clip the wings of the present House of Lords, which was killed off effectively by the Cunningham committee and by the unanimous decision of both Houses that the existing powers and responsibilities of your Lordships' House should stand as now. The Statement is ambiguous on that point. On one hand, it says that the Cunningham committee recommendations are effectively the baseline for our discussions, but then it talks about reopening the whole question of powers. Will the Minister give us an explicit assurance that that will not be the case until reform takes place?</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/6">We also seek an assurance&mdash;and this is relevant to the debate in your Lordships' House tomorrow&mdash;that the decision on the hereditary Peers' by-elections, whatever that may be, will not be allowed to slow up progress on the comprehensive reform that the Government are clearly determined upon.</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/7">Will the Minister assure us that the Government will steadfastly stand by the primacy of the Commons, referred to in the Statement, even if that means that in the last resort, and possible after manifesto commitments have been made, the Parliament Acts can be employed to secure reform?</p>
	<p pid="a.393.0/8">Your Lordships will have noticed that Liberal Democrats in both Houses have voted for reform by substantial majorities, and indeed in line with their party policy&mdash;unlike the other parties. My party will review its commitment to democratic reform of this House at its autumn conference, but I am confident that we will reiterate our commitment. I am sure that if we do not get legislation before the general election, we will fulfil the hopes of the Lord Chancellor that we will recommit ourselves in our manifesto. I hope that in the mean time the other parties will do the same.</p>

	<p pid="a.402.1/1" pwmotiontext="asked">rose to ask the Chairman of Committees whether the Committee for Privileges has rejected a recommendation from the Sub-Committee on Lords' Interests that members in receipt of pensions from the European Union should as a matter of course declare such pensions as a financial interest when taking part in debates, statements and questions on European Union matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/2">My Lords, I am afraid that the unfortunate answer to the Question before us is yes. My purpose in holding this debate is to persuade the Committee for Privileges to change its mind and agree with its Sub-Committee on Lords' Interests. After all, that sub-committee is chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, the former Lord Chief Justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/3">I am encouraged in this endeavour by our code of conduct, which was adopted by a resolution of the whole House in 2001. That resolution requires that Members of this House must comply with the code,</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/4" class="indent">&quot;to provide the openness and accountability necessary to reinforce public confidence in the way in which Members of the House of Lords perform their parliamentary ... duties&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/5">Paragraph 6 of the code states:</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/6" class="indent">&quot;In the conduct of their parliamentary duties, Members of the House shall resolve any conflict between their personal interest and the public interest in favour of the public interest&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/7">Paragraph 8 requires that Members must,</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/8" class="indent">&quot;declare when speaking in the House... any interest which is a relevant interest in the context of... the matter under discussion. This is necessary in order that their audience may form a balanced judgment of their arguments&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/9">Paragraphs 9 to 11 helpfully define a relevant interest thus:</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The test of relevant interest is whether the interest might reasonably be thought by the public to affect the way in which a Member of the House... discharges his... parliamentary duties... The test of relevant interest is therefore not whether a Member's actions in Parliament will be influenced by the interest, but whether the public might reasonably think that this might be the case... Relevant interests include both financial and non-financial interests&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/11">It is this last point which, I understand, requires me to declare in debates touching on learning disabilities that I am the father of a child with severe lifelong intellectual impairment. It helps the listeners and those who read <I>Hansard</I> to appreciate where one is coming from. By the same token, I should have thought that it was also incumbent on former EU Commissioners and employees at least to mention their former incarnation in debates about the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/12">The code is more prescriptive on financial interests&mdash;and here I come to the heart of my argument. EU pensions are unusual and perhaps unique in that holders can lose them if, in the sole opinion of the Luxembourg court, they indulge in any action incompatible with their former duties. The rules governing former Commissioners are set out in Article 213 of the Treaty Establishing the European Community, which states that Members of the Commission,</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/13" class="indent">&quot;shall refrain from any action incompatible with their duties. When entering upon those duties they shall give a solemn undertaking that, both during and after their term of office, they will respect the obligations arising therefrom ... In the event of any breach of those obligations, the Court of Justice may rule that the Member concerned be deprived of his right to a pension&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/14">The solemn undertaking includes the promise to,</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/15" class="indent">&quot;perform my duties in the general interests of the Communities&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/16">and,</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/17" class="indent">&quot;to refrain from any action incompatible with my duties&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/18">The undertaking goes on:</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/19" class="indent">&quot;I further undertake to respect, both during and after my term of office, the obligations arising therefrom&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/20">The rules covering former staff are covered in Section 3 of the staff regulations entitled, &quot;Disciplinary Measures&quot;. Article 9 of those states:</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/21" class="indent">&quot;Where the official is in receipt of a retirement pension ... the appointing authority may decide to withhold an amount from the pension&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/22">So it seems clear that both former Commissioners and EU staff can lose all or part of their pension if, in the judgment of the Luxembourg court, they behave sufficiently badly. I shall return to what that behaviour might be at the end.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/23">That was accepted by the Government in a Written Answer of <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-06">6 October 2003</phrase>, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/24" class="indent">&quot;Former members of the European Commission and their officials are bound to respect certain obligations arising from the office that they held. In the event of any breach of these obligations, the EU institutions are able to rule, according to the circumstances, that that person should be liable to a reduction or withdrawal of pension rights&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/10/03; col. <I>WA 31</I>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/25">However, that correct interpretation of EU law was, at first, not accepted by your Lordships' Sub-Committee on Lords' Interests which reports to the Committee for Privileges. When the sub-committee was chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, it could not reach agreement on the matter. So the noble and learned Lord then went through a most unusual legal manoeuvre. He wrote an opinion to himself as chairman of the sub-committee. That contained a number of misunderstandings, and I do not have time to deal with them all now. An important error was to find that an EU pension can be removed only if the pensioner accepts unsuitable employment after leaving office. That possibility is indeed emphasised in the treaty, but its scope is much wider, as I have quoted. Indeed, it is open-ended and entirely at the discretion of the court. More generally, the noble and learned Lord appears to have misunderstood the most obvious need to declare an interest when he said,</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/26" class="indent">&quot;in general it is not necessary to declare an interest on a matter of parliamentary business affecting an employer ... just because a Member of the House of Lords is in receipt of emoluments ... from that employer&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/27">What interest could be more declarable than the fact that one is speaking about one's employer?</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/28">Not surprisingly, a number of us were not satisfied with the noble and learned Lord's opinion, which was accepted by his sub-committee and by the Committee for Privileges, so we asked the sub-committee to think again. It duly did so, this time chaired, as I have said, by no less a personage than the former Lord Chief Justice, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf. Its report is available from the Printed Paper Office as Priv. 2006-07/1. It comes down unambiguously in favour of declaration and recommends that Members of the House in receipt of pensions from the European Union should as a matter of course declare such pensions as a financial interest when taking part in debates, Statements and questions on European Union matters. However, when the full Committee for Privileges met on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-05">5 June</phrase>, I regret to say that it did not accept its sub-committee's view. I believe a copy of the minutes can be obtained from the Clerk to the committee, but no reasoned report has been published. The minutes are far from clear or satisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/29">I know that I am regarded by the Europhile majority in your Lordships' House as the naughtiest boy behind the bicycle sheds, but it is quite wrong to say that the matter was reopened only because of pressure from me, which is what the minutes say. The noble Lords, Lord Tebbit and Lord Vinson, both wrote to the noble and learned Lords, Lord Browne-Wilkinson and Lord Woolf, and the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, and the noble Lord, Lord Vinson, went together to see the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, in person. Many other noble Lords have expressed concern, as one would expect. I do not believe I need to trouble your Lordships with their names; of course, they are the other usual culprits. I am most grateful that the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, is to speak later.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/30">The minutes also suggest that the crime we have in mind is merely criticising the Commission in debate. We agree that there is nothing to stop the court deciding that that is indeed sufficient pretext to remove or to reduce a pension. But there are other more serious things that pensioners could say in debate which would almost certainly result in financial penalty. They could reveal some hitherto unpublished scandal, which would bring the EU into even further disrepute; they could support a referendum on the next EU treaty and they could speak against that treaty in debate; and they could even have a Damascene conversion, in common with a large and growing majority of the British people, who have come to believe that this country would be much better off outside the political construct of the EU, while keeping our friendship and free trade with the other member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/31">Of course, I agree that all that is unlikely, but it is not impossible. One thing is certain: that the prospect of jeopardising one's pension prevents any such views, scandals or criticism being uttered in debate in your Lordships' House. Therefore, it is a declarable financial interest. We are not talking small beer. I am advised that one former Commissioner in your Lordships' House is looking forward to a pension of some &pound;73,000 per annum, at present exchange rates.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/32">My noble friends and I maintain that this failure to declare former EU employment and pensions prevents public understanding of our debates on EU matters. For example, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-14">14 June</phrase>, we had an important debate in the name of the noble Lord, Lord McNally, to extol the advantages of our EU membership. Of the 22 speakers before the gap, 10 were former EU employees of one kind or another, yet only one declared that as an interest. The public could not possibly know from where the other nine noble Lords were coming.</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/33">I have only one question for the noble Lord the Chairman of Committees. Was the decision on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-05">5 June</phrase> reached by a vote, or did he judge the mood of the meeting, which may have been distorted by exaggerated claims of my personal involvement? If so, could he try again?</p>
	<p pid="a.402.1/34">The quality of your Lordships' House debates is a highly prized national asset, something of which we are all proud. I trust that this debate may help to maintain that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-07-19a.405.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100689" speakername="Lord Williamson of Horton" colon=":" colnum="405"  time="013:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70719-0006.htm#07071993000258">
	<p pid="a.405.0/1">My Lords, as this short debate concerns specifically European Union pensions, it is certainly appropriate to declare that I have a pension from the European Commission and I do so now. I wish to make a few brief points which run in the opposite direction to those put forward by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson. Over the past seven years, I have spent much time trying not to quarrel with him and I shall continue on that path.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/2">First, the matter was looked at very carefully in 2004 by the Committee for Privileges on the basis of a report from the Sub-Committee on Lords' Interests and a very full legal opinion by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, to which the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, referred. The report of the Committee for Privileges was published by the authority of the House&mdash;HL Paper 69 of <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-05">5 April 2004</phrase>. I do not see what has changed in relation to EU pensions&mdash;I am well aware that some Members have queried the situation&mdash;since the declaration of interest was examined only three years ago by the Committee for Privileges. As is well known, the sub-committee recommended that:</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Members of the House in receipt of pensions from the European Union do not normally need to declare such pensions as a financial interest when taking part in debates on European matters&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/4">The Committee for Privileges endorsed that recommendation, and that is set out in paragraphs 4 and 5 of HL Paper 69.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/5">Secondly, it is very important to distinguish between former European Commissioners and former staff of the Commission. The duties of Commissioners are covered by a specific treaty article&mdash;Article 213, which has been quoted already and will probably be quoted later&mdash;which is in the consolidated treaty, and they are not covered by the staff regulations. Article 213 is primarily directed to ensuring the independence of the Commission. Members of the Commission have to be totally independent in the performance of their duties and they shall neither seek nor take instructions from any Government or any other body and shall refrain from any action incompatible with their duties. During their term of office, they may not engage in any other occupation. Evidently, those provisions about the independence of Commissioners from governments and other bodies apply to them when in office in the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/6">It is true that, when taking up their duties, Commissioners give an undertaking that,</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/7" class="indent">&quot;during and after their term of office, they will respect the obligations arising therefrom and in particular their duty to behave with integrity and discretion as regards the acceptance, after they have ceased to hold office, of certain appointments or benefits&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/8">A breach could lead to compulsory retirement on the one hand, or to a loss of pension by a decision of the Court of Justice on the other. It seems to me evident that the noble and learned Lord, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, was right to conclude that the only possible breach occurring after the end of a Commissioner's period of office is a failure,</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/9" class="indent">&quot;to behave with integrity and discretion as regards the acceptance, after they have ceased to hold office, of certain appointments or benefits&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/10">Taking part in parliamentary duties at the present time cannot amount to a breach of that provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/11">When speaking in the gap in the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-14">14 June</phrase>, the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, stated that holders of EU pensions,</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/12" class="indent">&quot;can lose them if, in the opinion of the Commission and the Luxembourg court they&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/13">and I note that this appears in <I>Hansard</I> within inverted commas&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/14" class="indent">&quot;'fail to uphold the interests of the European Communities'&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/6/07; col. 1837.]</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/15">He said that few people know that. I am not at all surprised since I cannot find these words anywhere either in Article 213, although they are quoted within inverted commas, or in the staff regulations. The sense may be there but the words are not.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/16">So, that is the position of the ex-Commissioners. Those who have worked on the staff of the European Commission are not covered by Article 213. They are, during their term of office, covered by the staff regulations. I do not know whether I am the only person in this House who has carried with him through life a copy of the staff regulations, but I actually do have the regulations and I have read them rather a lot of times. The staff regulations are those that apply to officials while they are engaged in employment in the Commission. In this debate, the obligations and duties of officials when they were employed by the Commission do not seem to me to be relevant&mdash;that is the past and that's that. The question is which obligations, if any, apply to them after they have left the service of the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/17">Articles 11 and 12 of the staff regulations, oft quoted in these various discussions, apply to the rights and obligations of officials with no reference whatever to former officials. Staff regulations clearly distinguish which articles apply to which type of person, and they do not apply to former officials. The obligations on former officials in title II of the staff regulations relate to them possibly accepting appointments and benefits after leaving office and the improper disclosure of information obtained in the course of official work; there is nothing which says that a former official cannot express his opinions freely on EU matters, and if he does so there is no effect whatever on his pension. In no other way, apart from those specific points, does an ex-employee owe continuing duties to the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/18">I believe that I am the only former official of the Commission to whom this debate applies who is in the Chamber. Indeed, I am rather honoured to have a personal debate of this kind applied to me by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch&mdash;I never expected to have that. I should also say that I am personally quite indifferent to whether I declare my pension or not, because I am going to say what I wish to say in this House in any event. But my pension is in the register of interests, though for me its declaration is a matter of indifference.</p>
	<p pid="a.405.0/19">I do not believe, however, that anyone has shown that the position taken by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, in his statement, the position taken by the Sub-Committee on Lords' Interests and the Committee for Privileges in 2004, or the unanimous decision of the current Committee for Privileges to reject the recent sub-committee report and to maintain the view of 2004, is not correct. I think that the decisions taken in 2004 correspond to the text of the treaty and to the text of the staff regulations. I therefore think that they should be maintained, as did the Committee for Privileges. Again, it is not a matter of any substance for me at all, but I believe that that is the correct position.</p>

	<p pid="a.414.0/1">My Lords, before the noble Lord sits down and as, according to the Clock, we have a few minutes left, perhaps I may put something to him. Like the royal prerogative, parliamentary privilege is subservient to European law. I do not have time now but I can show him lots of examples where the Commission has threatened to remove people's pensions. There was a headline in the <I>Telegraph</I> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-12">12 July</phrase> last year, for example, concerning Madame Cresson, and so on. Could it be that if this power has not been much used, it is precisely because people do not break the rules when they know that they can end up without a pension?</p>

	<p pid="a.415.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful to noble Lords who have spoken in the debate today, and I am glad to have this opportunity to explain to the House the background to the issue raised by the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch. We have had a very lively debate and I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, that it has been worth giving up one's lunch break for. I apologise in advance that in my remarks I shall probably duplicate some things that have already been said.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/2">The short answer to the noble Lord's Question is yes. The Sub-Committee on Lords' Interests recently presented to the Committee for Privileges a recommendation on the lines described in the noble Lord's Question, and the committee decided not to make that recommendation to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/3">Because the committee's decision involved no change of practice, it decided not to make a report to the House on this matter. That is quite normal. Committees usually make a report only when they make a recommendation to the House but, as no change was involved here, there was no need for a report to be made. However, the sub-committee's report and the minutes of the committee's meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-05">5 June</phrase>, when the report was discussed, have been made available on the intranet and in the Library and the Printed Paper Office. I do not think that anyone who is in the least bit interested in this matter will have had any difficulty in finding them.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/4">The Committee for Privileges first considered the position of noble Lords in receipt of pensions from the European Union in 2004 as a result of a request from the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch. In its First Report of Session 2003&mdash;04, the committee endorsed a recommendation by the Sub-Committee on Lords' Interests that:</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Members of the House in receipt of pensions from the European Union do not normally need to declare such pensions as a financial interest when taking part in debates on European Union matters&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/6">That recommendation was based on the opinion of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Browne-Wilkinson, who was its chairman at the time.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/7">Recently the sub-committee, with three new members and now chaired by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, has revisited the issue in response to,</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/8" class="indent">&quot;a request from a number of members of the House to re-examine the matter&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/9">This time the sub-committee reached the opposite conclusion; namely,</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/10" class="indent">&quot;that members of the House in receipt of pensions from the European Union should as a matter of course declare such pensions as a financial interest when taking part in debates, statements and questions on European Union matters&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/11">This new recommendation was considered by the Committee for Privileges on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-05">5 June</phrase>, when there was general agreement that the committee should not reverse the decision that it made in 2004. The noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, asked me whether there had been a vote in the committee. There was no need for one. I do not like taking votes in committees unless it is clearly necessary to do so, but I can tell the noble Lord that at least half a dozen members of the committee all spoke in the same way and they all agreed that they did not wish to reverse the decision made in 2004. At that stage, I began to get a sense of the feeling of the committee. I asked whether anyone dissented from that view and answer came there none. Therefore, it was not necessary to take a vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/12">Obviously, different members may have had different reasons for reaching that conclusion, so I cannot give definitive reasons on behalf of the committee, but it may be helpful if I briefly mention the two main arguments brought forward during the discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/13">The first argument concerns the scope of the obligations on those receiving EU pensions. The sub-committee's report says:</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/14" class="indent">&quot;Pensions are not usually conditional on the good behaviour of the pension holder. EU pensions therefore are unusual in the conditions that are attached to them. Moreover, the impression is given that these conditions impose an obligation on pension holders to continue to uphold the interests of the EU&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/15">For the reasons given by the noble Lord, Lord Williamson of Horton, the main committee was not persuaded that there is such an obligation.</p>
	<p pid="a.415.0/16">The rules for former Commissioners are slightly different from those for former members of the staff of EU institutions. The duties of Commissioners and former Commissioners are governed by Article 213 of the Treaty of Rome and those of staff and former staff by the European Union's staff regulations. However, in both cases, the obligations are mainly on serving Commissioners and staff, and the restrictions on those no longer holding office are confined to the acceptance of certain appointments or benefits. That point was clearly made&mdash;</p>
