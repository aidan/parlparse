It is absolutely vital that that mission does not fail, and that we do not stand by while another genocide occurs in Africa. Given that the Prime Minister announced yesterday that more Sea King, Merlin and Chinook helicopters were being made available for Afghanistan, could the Government not spare one helicopter to make peace instead of war?</p>

I am assured that all British helicopters are fully committed to operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and that no others are available supplementary to our own homeland security needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.327.2/2">There are other NATO helicopters. However, they suffer from needing upgrades and logistics support. We are looking at both those helicopters and others from elsewhere in the world to see if we can facilitate their availability. That matter has been raised in recent days by both the Prime Minister, in conversations with other leaders, and the Foreign Secretary with Mr Ban Ki-Moon since his letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase>. I have also had a number of intense conversations with the peacekeeping department about it.</p>

	<p pid="a.342.1/1">My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Alton, on introducing this topical debate. He spoke a bit about Zimbabwe. My noble friend Lady Park also made some useful points about that country, and I congratulate her too. I also want to congratulate our colleague the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York who must have brought home for the first time to millions of people the fact that there is a Mugabe problem when he cut up his white collar on television and said that he will not wear it again until Mugabe has gone.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.1/2">Mugabe claims that he is fighting against Britain, but he is not; he is fighting against his own people. Our role was to end the war of independence and to arrange the elections that put Mugabe into power. He makes two allegations against us: neo-colonialism and that our sanctions have caused the appalling economic condition of Zimbabwe. Both charges are ridiculous. The &quot;sanctions&quot; are not sanctions, but targeted measures, and it is not likely that they have caused the inflation in Zimbabwe which, according to the latest report that I saw today, has now reached a rate of 14,840 per cent. So good is Mugabe's spin that it seems he has convinced a majority of the leaders of the SADC countries of what he is saying. The three principal African treaties have been breached by Mugabe, but the SADC leaders appear to be unaware of that&mdash;at least they do not refer to it. The effects of the economic situation in Zimbabwe are horrifying. One-third of the population has fled, especially the best qualified people and young people who were born after 1980, when Mugabe came to power.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.1/3">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-11">11 March</phrase>, a prayer meeting in Harare was violently broken up by the police and the military. That shocked even the leaders of SADC and led them to give a mandate to President Mbeki of South Africa to facilitate negotiations between the opposition and Mugabe. That was accompanied by a police warning to the MDC opposition, who are entirely peaceful, not to cause any trouble. No such warning was given to Mugabe, who has been causing turmoil among the opposition by the beatings and the intimidation of all sorts that he was conducting before that event and which have continued until now. Mugabe is preparing for elections with the usual measures that he has used in the past. The latest one&mdash;which is new, so far as I know&mdash;is that 4 trillion Zimbabwe dollars have been set aside as a fund available to Mugabe in preparation for the elections. We can imagine that it will be used to persuade voters&mdash;so far as they need persuading, given the violence that has been going on&mdash;to vote for Mugabe.</p>
	<p pid="a.342.1/4">Is there any ray of light on the horizon? Four representatives of the European Union recently made speeches in Lisbon that criticised Mugabe. I do not remember other members of the European Union often criticising him, so that is a step forward. In a few days there will be an election for the next president of the ANC in South Africa. It could be quite important if it leads to the election of Zuma, who is a robust character compared to President Mbeki. His history is not entirely without blemish, but it is possible that he will be much more active in pursuing peace in Zimbabwe than President Mbeki has been. Kofi Annan recently made an important speech&mdash;the Nelson Mandela lecture&mdash;in which he cited Zimbabwe as one of the crises in the world that the United Nations should pay attention to. He said that Africa is particularly crying out for resolute action by fellow Africans. That was with particular reference to Zimbabwe, so one or two straws are beginning to blow in a light wind. However, we cannot regard the end of Mugabe as being likely soon. We have to bear in mind also that his mother lived to 100, and he is only 84. An end could be put to the problem if the SADC leaders got together with a powerful president of SADC in the form of Zuma, if he wins.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-13a.345.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100959" speakername="Baroness Cox" colon=":" colnum="345"  time="012:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71213-0004.htm#07121360000176">
	<p pid="a.345.0/1">My Lords, I also thank my noble friend Lord Alton for securing this timely debate and for introducing it, characteristically, in a comprehensive and informative way. Like the right reverend Prelate, I shall focus on Sudan, the site of Africa's longest-running conflict.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.0/2">The comprehensive peace agreement&mdash;the CPA&mdash;of 2005 has brought some welcome relief from the war waged by the National Islamic Front regime against the peoples of southern Sudan and marginalised areas such as the Nuba mountains, Abyei and Southern Blue Nile&mdash;but not before 2 million people perished and 4 million were displaced. As my noble friend Lord Alton reminded us, this toll of human suffering was inflicted before the horrors of Darfur began to unfold, culminating in a continuing genocide in which at least 200,000 have been killed and a further 2 million displaced.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.0/3">The current situation is acutely disturbing in at least three ways: the possibility of eruption of further war in the south; the recent disintegration of the Government of National Unity; and the continuing lack of co-operation by Khartoum, preventing effective intervention by the international community in Darfur. Therefore we must welcome the initiative this week to bring the CPA back on track, with the two sides reaching agreement on all issues except Abyei. This may, indeed, be a ray of hope on the dark horizon, although everyone must be well aware that Sudan's President al-Bashir and his National Congress Party&mdash;the NCP&mdash;have reneged on every agreement to date.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.0/4">Therefore, while we welcome this development, we must do so on the basis of the principle, &quot;Trust but verify&quot;. It is essential that there is effective supervision and monitoring of every aspect of the agreement. Therefore I ask the Minister whether Her Majesty's Government will use their influence to ensure that such monitoring is implemented and to indicate that failure to honour this agreement by either side will trigger powerful sanctions. This is particularly important given the continued deployment of large numbers of troops in strategic locations, where the scene is set for a potential imminent resumption of war. Indeed, the last time I was in southern Sudan, the talk was, very reluctantly, not about if war would start again, but when. This is entirely understandable.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.0/5">Khartoum has also reneged on its obligations to supply resources to the south so that urgent, essential reconstruction and rehabilitation have been impeded and the condition of the people is, in many places, little better under the new Administration than it was previously. It is widely believed that this restriction of resources is a ploy by Khartoum to create such disaffection in the south that, when the referendum for self-determination comes, the people will have no incentive to vote for independence.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.0/6">Like other noble Lords, I have seen the plight of the people. There is obvious relief that the peace agreement has brought a cessation of fighting, including the incessant aerial bombardment by Khartoum, with Antonovs dropping their bombs, often targeted at health centres, feeding centres and schools, and terrifying attacks by low-flying helicopter gunships. These were diverted to Darfur and have since been inflicting their terror and carnage there.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.0/7">But we have also seen in the south how people are still suffering and dying from diseases for which treatment should now be available. In Equatoria, in rural areas, we have seen preventable, treatable diseases such as meningitis, measles and malaria killing people on a huge scale. In eastern Upper Nile earlier this year, we found leprosy, possibly of pandemic proportions.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.0/8">These problems help to explain why the leadership and the people in the south are feeling so desperate. There are also indications of the lack of good faith on the part of the northern leadership, with regard to not only the CPA but Darfur. President Omar al-Bashir, whose Government are widely believed to be instigating atrocities in Darfur, has consistently refused to allow a sufficient number of peacekeepers or military assets to protect civilians. But without an effectively equipped peacekeeping force, the assaults on human dignity&mdash;the executions, rapes and ethnic cleansing&mdash;will continue, as the noble Baroness, Lady Park, has emphasised.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.0/9">What efforts are being made by Her Majesty's Government to support the United Nations in the provision of all resources essential for an effective peacekeeping force for Darfur, and what representations are they making to Khartoum to ensure effective compliance with the requirements of the UN for deployment of the peacekeeping forces?</p>
	<p pid="a.345.0/10">The debacle over the teacher and the teddy bear is a further indication of the bankruptcy of British policy vis-&agrave;-vis the Islamist regime in Khartoum. A leader in the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-04">4 December</phrase> summarised the situation:</p>
	<p pid="a.345.0/11" class="indent">&quot;For Sudan to be able defiantly to humiliate a major democratic nation from which it receives large amounts of aid by holding one of its citizens to ransom speaks of the impunity with which it believes it can operate in the world ... Mr Bashir, who has been responsible for some of the worst atrocities in post-war history, has successfully blocked the deployment of peacekeeping forces that would protect Darfur citizens. It is that failure of international resolve which encourages him to believe that he can flout moral and diplomatic conventions. As we argued last week, we should recall our ambassador and consider sanctions against the regime&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.0/12">Indeed, many of us have long been urging Her Majesty's Government to do just this. I therefore ask precisely what representations were made to Khartoum over the totally inappropriate treatment of the British schoolteacher.</p>
	<p pid="a.345.0/13">The issues of Darfur&mdash;particularly Khartoum's intransigence and continued aggression&mdash;and the growing tension in the south are connected. There is a fear among experts that al-Bashir will exploit the weakness and indecision of the international community regarding Darfur to deliver a decisive defeat to the south as soon as possible. Strong voices in the uppermost circles of Khartoum now recommend this line of action to solve all the other outstanding problems by &quot;resolving&quot; the unfinished campaign in the south. The enduring instability in the vital Abyei area can provide Khartoum with many excuses for violating the recent agreement to revive the CPA. It is therefore very important to signal to Khartoum that the outside world is most interested in the sustenance and completion of the CPA. I hope that the Minister will give reassurances that Her Majesty's Government will adopt appropriately robust responses to any deviation by Khartoum from the CPA, or to any failure to provide full co-operation for peacekeeping initiatives in Darfur. I also hope that the Minister will give some assurance of adequate succour for the victims of Sudan's longest-running conflict. They will be deeply interested in the Minister's reply, and I hope that it will bring them some comfort.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-13a.362.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100828" speakername="Baroness Royall of Blaisdon" colon=":" colnum="362"  time="013:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71213-0007.htm#07121360000262">
	<p pid="a.362.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Alton, for securing this debate and for drawing our attention to this vital issue. I am grateful also for the characteristically well informed contributions from all noble Lords who have participated in this powerful debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/2">Conflict has sadly been a regular feature in Africa in recent decades, although we should be careful not to fall into generalisations&mdash;a large majority of Africans continue to live in peace. The end of the Cold War had a dramatic impact in Africa. Governments often lost the economic and military props they had previously enjoyed and political change was suddenly on the agenda. Conflict in Africa since the early 1990s has been largely internal, with government forces pitted against rebel groups often representing regional or ethnic interests. Cross-border groups acting as proxies for neighbouring regimes have been common. The number of conflicts rose dramatically, reaching a peak in 1999, which saw 17 significant conflicts.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/3">Every conflict in Africa has its own complex story, its own specific triggers and drivers, but there are some clear trends, of which climate change, cited by the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, is clearly one. The noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings was right to mention poverty as an underlying cause of conflict. The noble Lord, Lord Sheikh, spoke of governance: economically developed democratic countries rarely fall into conflict, which is often a product of poor governance and lack of development, and which then reinforces them. Many post-colonial African states have been vulnerable to conflict because they lacked the ability to act like a state, to provide a secure environment for their citizens and improve their quality of life. In many cases, the state is next to non-existent in remote rural parts of Africa. It is no surprise that many armed conflicts arise in such areas. Too many African Governments in the past have been non-inclusive, favouring one or more regional, ethnic or social groups at the expense of others. That has left other groups excluded, with no channels to express their grievances and often no access to scarce resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/4">If those basic problems of governance and exclusion have lit the flames of conflict, they have been fanned by many other drivers, including impunity and arms. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, rightly drew attention to the pernicious impact of irresponsible arms trading in Africa, in particular in small arms. In some African countries, a few hundred men with small arms can have a huge and terrible impact. There may be major barriers to trade within Africa, but the Kalashnikov is an exception. The noble Lord powerfully pointed out that weapons represent power and pride; they fuel the conflicts that sap human life and economics.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/5">Many noble Lords mentioned the arms trade treaty. The UK was the first major arms exporter to throw its weight behind the campaign for an arms trade treaty. We want a treaty with teeth, which will make a real difference to those who are suffering as a result of armed conflict in Africa. UK engagement has been instrumental in galvanising international support, and we will not lose our resolve on this matter. To my noble friend Lord Judd, I say that we will continue to engage with the US on this issue and to encourage it to participate as work progresses, with the aim of securing its support for an eventual treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/6">Violence begets violence. Too many African Governments have used their security forces not to defend their people, but to oppress them. This often creates a bad neighbourhood, encouraging others to use proxies. We saw the impact of Charles Taylor's appalling regime throughout the Mano river sub-region, and events in Darfur have exacerbated instability in Chad and the Central African Republic. Perhaps we should pay more heed to the example of Costa Rica, as cited by the noble Lord, Lord McColl.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/7">We know only too well the devastating consequences of conflict in Africa. First, as always, should come the human impact. Figures are unreliable, especially so given the nature and location of many African conflicts. Battle deaths probably reached some 100,000 per year in the late 1990s, but have now declined significantly. The number of total deaths was much higher, from disease&mdash;including HIV&mdash;displacement, malnutrition and the like. The numbers of those suffering physical and mental injuries, from the trauma of experiencing extreme violence, the appalling phenomenon of child soldiers and the terrible incidence of sexual violence in eastern DRC, are enormous and sometimes forgotten. We must not forget the terrible hardship and impact of internal and external displacement, with the brightest and best often fleeing their homelands for ever. It is only the amazing fortitude of many people in Africa, and their willingness to forgive, that prevents the human impact being larger. I shall return to child soldiers.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/8">The recent report by three NGOs that was cited by many noble Lords gives us a dramatic sense of the economic costs of conflict. It is a powerful and sobering report, and we have no reason to take a radically different view from that expressed in it. Similar conclusions were drawn last year by the International Development Select Committee. What is undeniable is that conflict undermines development. In 2005, it was estimated that of the 34 countries furthest from achieving the MDGs, 22 were in conflict or emerging from it. In Sierra Leone's conflict, for example, rice production fell to 20 per cent of its pre-war levels. I am delighted that the noble Lord, Lord Jones, and Cheltenham hospital are having such a tangible impact in a country that is still suffering from conflict. The noble Baroness, Lady Verma, asked about progress on the MDGs. Despite the fact that UN Millennium Development Goals report 2007 noted that efforts to meet them are being undermined by insecurity and instability, progress is being made. According to the UN, poverty in sub-Saharan Africa has fallen by nearly six percentage points since 2000. We are contributing &pound;417 million to the African Development Fund over the next three years, which is double the amount of previous support.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/9">On child soldiers, the UK has been active in supporting activity that addresses the terrible effects on the children involved, including innovative work in Sierra Leone and northern Uganda. I entirely agree with the noble Baroness that putting resources in the hands of women and involving civil society in conflict issues is terribly important. That is integral to DfID's work. The noble Lord, Lord Parekh, spoke about conflict resolution and the important part that women can play in that.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/10">Conflict is not just a tragedy for Africa, but a very serious issue for the wider world and this country. It brings direct costs to the international community: lost trade and investment, spending on emergency and post-conflict aid, and international intervention. Perhaps more significantly, conflict can fuel uncontrolled migration and create ungoverned spaces, which criminal networks and extremists can exploit.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/11">This sounds like a very bleak picture, but there is real cause for optimism; things are improving. The number of conflicts in Africa has reduced dramatically in recent years, from 17 significant conflicts in 1999 to five in 2005, but of course those conflicts are dreadful. This is not by chance. African countries and the international community are taking a more active approach and greater responsibility for preventing conflicts before they begin, ending them when they start and providing the means to recover from them.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/12">The formation of the African Union in 2002 enshrined a new commitment to democracy and sound economic management. The picture remains uneven, of course, but two-thirds of African countries now have multi-party elections and the successful military coup has almost ended as a way of changing governments. The AU no longer recognises regimes that have come to power by force. It has distanced itself from the former Organisation of African Unity's mantra of non-interference in internal affairs and has committed itself to a policy of non-indifference. The AU has acted on this, sending peacekeeping missions to Burundi, Darfur and Somalia, leading peace negotiations and preventing conflict through mediation. We should continue to encourage and support this trend. The AU has also developed a long-term vision of an African peace and security architecture, covering early warning, mediation, peacekeeping and post-conflict work. This Government is one of the AU's major supporters in this. We have trained more than 11,000 African peacekeepers since 2004 and provided capacity-building support to the AU and African regional organisations such as ECOWAS.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/13">At the UN, 60 per cent of the Security Council's time is spent on African issues. Many of the largest UN peacekeeping missions in the world are in Africa&mdash;in DRC, Liberia, southern Sudan and, soon, in Darfur in partnership with the African Union. Peacekeeping is a vital and effective tool. UN, AU and EU missions contribute to a more secure environment in Africa. The UN world summit in 2005 saw a clear recognition of the links between conflict and development. One of the outcomes was the peacebuilding commission, which aims to highlight the critical gaps between peacekeeping and post-conflict development, and better to co-ordinate international donors to ensure that funds are used more strategically. The first two countries to be addressed are Sierra Leone and Burundi. The UK has contributed some &pound;30 million to the peacebuilding fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/14">On conflict resources, the Kimberley process, involving governments, industry and civil society, has made remarkable progress. In the 1990s some 15 per cent of all diamonds traded internationally were conflict diamonds. Now, some 99.8 per cent are traded legitimately through a system of inspections, certificates and warranties. We do not have to be impotent; sometimes we can make things work.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/15">The UK has been instrumental in ensuring that those who perpetrate genocide and crimes against humanity are held to account. We are strong supporters of the International Criminal Court and the international tribunals in Rwanda and Sierra Leone. We stand by to imprison Charles Taylor if he is convicted by the special court in Sierra Leone. The British Government take a comprehensive approach to conflict in Arica, bringing together diplomatic development and defence expertise from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, the Department for International Development and the Ministry of Defence to work on African conflict-prevention programmes, totalling more than &pound;350 million since 2001. We also aim to ensure that all our development work is sensitive to conflict. This is essential. Rwanda, just before the genocide, seemed to be making social and economic progress, but foreign assistance was not addressing the fundamental divisions within that society.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/16">Of course, there is absolutely no room for complacency. The crisis in Darfur continues; the Government of Sudan continue to put obstacles in the way of the UN/AU mission. The prompt deployment of effective force is essential. We are doing all we can to ensure that the UN can generate the necessary force and that the Government of Sudan and the rebel movements deliver on their commitments. We are working hard to encourage a solution to the differences between north and south Sudan in implementing the comprehensive peace agreement. This is indivisible from the solution to the Darfur crisis. The right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Salisbury, the noble Baroness, Lady Cox, and the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, spoke powerfully about the needs of the people of southern Sudan. We welcome the SPLM's announcement that it will rejoin the Government of National Unity.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/17">Two parties have made detailed plans for redeployment of forces in three phases, with 100 per cent deployment by <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-09">9 January</phrase>. Abyei will be protected by joint integrated units and will be monitored by UNMIS. We welcome this. We have supported the capacity building for the JIUs. The UK is supporting the work of the Darfur Assessment and Evaluation Commission, an independent body, whose remit is to monitor and report on the implementation of the CPA. The UK also supports a high-level international meeting to push for more rapid CPA implementation. Of course, free and fair national elections in 2009 are crucial for the whole of Sudan. On peacekeeping in Darfur, we call on the Government to co-operate fully with the DPKO/AU force on composition and deployment. The question of helicopters was very well dealt with at Question Time. Clearly, the Government hope to bring this to the EU heads of government at the earliest opportunity. We are very frustrated by the lack of helicopters.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/18">The situations in Somalia and eastern DRC remain real causes for concern. In eastern DRC the situation is fast-moving and we are aware of Nkunda's counteroffensive. The real concern is that the current situation is creating more humanitarian misery. It is essential that we focus on the underlying problems, action against both Nkunda and the FDLR in parallel, and that we continue to focus on the political end-game.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/19">The noble Baroness, Lady Park of Monmouth, and the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, quite rightly and properly drew our attention to the appalling situation in Zimbabwe. The tragedy is unfolding daily before our eyes and continues to endanger stability in the whole area. Like them, I pay tribute to the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of York for his persistence where Zimbabwe is concerned. Like the noble Lord, Lord Luce, the Government believe that the solution to Zimbabwe's current crisis has, ultimately, to be an African one, supported by the international community. We support President Mbeke in leading efforts to resolve Zimbabwe's problems and President Wade of Senegal's recent comments on the need for the whole of Africa to solve the problem. We want to see positive outcomes on the ground. That is the only real test of any initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/20">Zimbabwe's crisis is not only a regional or African problem, although it requires strong African leadership that is willing to condemn atrocities and recognise injustice. I cannot quite remember the very excellent quotation of the noble Lord, Lord Blaker, but I entirely agree with him about resolute actions. At the last meeting in August, SADC's leaders did not blame the EU or the West for Zimbabwe's problems. It was a very small step forward, but perhaps we should take some small comfort from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/21">I listened carefully to the experiences and wise words of the noble Lord, Lord Luce. I very much like his idea of an EU/AU plan to mobilise members of the diaspora who have skills that can be used in peacebuilding. Having had discussions with various diasporas in the past, I am sure that they would warm to such a suggestion. The noble Lord, Lord Crisp, and others drew our attention to the impact of conflict on health, that basic human need. Yes, the Government strongly support partnerships such as the one he cited between King's College Hospital and Somaliland. I will come back to him on the issue of funding. I greatly respect the noble Lord, Lord McColl, for his extraordinary work on mercy ships and, of course, the organisation itself. His words were chilling, but the work that he does brings warmth to our hearts and we are very proud of him.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/22">In respect of the border dispute between Eritrea and Ethiopia, the Government's policy is based on three principles: avoiding a return to war, which would be unacceptable; demarcating the border; and finding a way for the parties to normalise relations. In November we set out this policy very forcefully when the Foreign Secretary met the Ethiopian foreign minister, when the noble Baroness, Lady Vadera, and the British ambassador to Ethiopia met the Ethiopian Prime Minister. The noble Lord, Lord Malloch-Brown also conveyed these points to the Eritrean foreign minister. We recognise the seriousness of that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/23">The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, asked about pooled funding. The UK in southern Sudan uses the pooled mechanism with six other donors and works to assist the Government of southern Sudan to use the World Bank-managed multi-donor trust fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/24">There are important future challenges for the UK and the wider international community. First, there is the question of progress on agreeing an arms trade treaty at the UN. We need a treaty that will stop the irresponsible trade in weapons that are used to fuel conflict, repression and human rights abuses. Secondly, we should ensure that the concept of responsibility to protect, endorsed by 191 world leaders at the UN world summit in 2005, is operationalised so we can help states to improve their capacity to prevent the most egregious crimes. Where they are not upholding their responsibilities we pressurise them to do so, and as a last resort we step in when they fail. That is part and parcel of the Government's approach to hard-headed internationalism. Thirdly, new approaches should be developed to new challenges such as the potential impact on Africa's security of climate change as water, land and other resources become scarcer in some areas. Finally, we should put into action the key linkages highlighted recently by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister to ensure that all future peacekeeping missions have plans for post-conflict recovery at their heart.</p>
	<p pid="a.362.0/25">The Government are fully committed to addressing both the fundamental causes of conflict in Africa and its consequences. We will continue to put that at the heart of our broader agenda for Africa's development and to use our influence within the wider international community.</p>

	<p pid="a.368.1/1">My Lords, with the leave of the House, I will now repeat a Statement made in another place earlier this afternoon by my right honourable friend the Home Secretary.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.1/2">&quot;Following my Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-13">13 November</phrase>, I would like to update the House on the actions that we are taking to address Security Industry Authority licensing checks and the issue of entitlement to work in the United Kingdom.&quot;An SIA licence demonstrates that the holder has undergone training and that identity and criminality checks have been completed. An SIA licence has never constituted evidence of entitlement to work in this country and it is the responsibility of employers to ensure that the people whom they employ are entitled to work.&quot;Before my previous Statement, steps were already being taken to prevent illegal working in the security industry. From <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July 2007</phrase>, the SIA introduced immigration status checks with the Border and Immigration Agency on all non-EEA applicants as part of the security industry licensing process. This is not a substitute for employers meeting their clear obligations, but the SIA checks provide a double lock on illegal working in this area.&quot;Alongside these immigration status checks, my department took steps to determine how many people who were granted licences prior to <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase> did not have the right to work. Plans were put in place for the BIA to check all the 39,885 non-EEA nationals licensed by the SIA before <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase>. Manual checks had started at the rate of 1,000 cases per week.&quot;I wanted the process to be speeded up without compromising accuracy. I therefore ordered automatic matching between the SIA list of non-EEA nationals and databases operated by the BIA and UKvisas. The BIA and the SIA have now completed these checks on the 39,885 non-EEA nationals licensed by the SIA before <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase>. On the basis of these checks, I am advised that the BIA is fully satisfied that 28,737 have the right to work in this country. It believes that 6,653 do not have the right to work in this country. In 4,447 other cases, the BIA is not satisfied that the individual has proved the right to work. The balance of 48 represents duplicate records. &quot;The following steps are being taken to revoke the licences of those found not to be entitled to work in this country. The SIA has written to all companies on its database to remind them of the need to check regularly on the SIA's website the registers of licence holders and of revoked licences, to ensure that all their staff have the right to work. The registers are currently receiving over 1,000 hits a day.&quot;Apart from a small number of cases where the SIA licence is close to expiry, the SIA has written to all those individuals&mdash;more than 10,500&mdash;where checks indicate no right to work or where the BIA is not satisfied that the individual has the right to work. These letters advise the licence holder that the SIA is minded to revoke their licence. The SIA gives the recipients 21 days in which to respond with further information and it expects that many will do so. If evidence is not forthcoming, the SIA will move for revocation. The law then allows the individual a further 21 days in which to appeal to the magistrates' or sheriff courts.&quot;Once the SIA has completed this process, it will be in a position to determine the number of individuals not entitled to work but who obtained SIA licences prior to the new double-lock checking regime now in place. The SIA expects that a significant proportion may yet establish that they have a right to work in this country. I am advised that, of the new applications for licences initially considered for refusal by the SIA on the basis of checks with the BIA following <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase>, over 30 per cent have since shown that they have the right to work. The SIA will publish the final numbers of the pre-<phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase> group on its website when they are complete. &quot;I repeat that it is important that all employers fulfil their obligations by carrying out all the proper checks before taking anyone on. We are also taking further steps to protect the public from those individuals who we suspect have breached our immigration laws by working here illegally. First, all the cases where minded-to-revoke action is now being taken against individuals have been passed to BIA enforcement intelligence units to be assessed for further action. The BIA is screening these individuals against the police national computer and other databases so that we can target any individuals who may pose a risk to the public.&quot;Secondly, these cases are being analysed for evidence of employers who appear to have a track record of employing people who do not have a right to work. BIA tells me that a third of its illegal-working operation is currently being deployed on this employment sector. Visits to specific individuals and employers have already begun and swift action has been taken in those cases that merit it. A series of targeted enforcement operations will take place in the coming months, with a view to prosecuting employers and removing or prosecuting individuals in the worst cases.&quot;Thirdly, in line with our enforcement strategy, we will continue to target illegal working on the basis of the risk of harm to the public. New powers that come into force in February mean that we can more easily fine employers who break the rules. Now that we have identified a significant problem in the security industry, we will maintain a focus on its employers and staff.&quot;We are taking other steps to further guard against illegal working in the security industry. First, the BIA has passed to the SIA the right-to-work expiry dates of all existing licence holders and recent new applicants. The SIA has agreed that in future it will send minded-to-revoke letters to all these licence holders shortly before their right to work status expires. Secondly, I have asked the BIA to work with the SIA to provide specialist advice to enhance its ability to spot fraudulent documentation. Thirdly, at present, the SIA's licence application form does not specifically ask applicants to state that they have the right to work in the United Kingdom. I have therefore asked the SIA to review the application form to ensure that it contains all the information that both the SIA and the BIA may need with a view to making changes as soon as possible. Fourthly, in January, the SIA will run a joint seminar with the British Security Industry Association to underline the importance of employers meeting their responsibilities in this area. Fifthly, the task force that I set up to resolve this issue in September, chaired by my honourable friend the Member for Gedling, will continue to oversee action.&quot;I believe that the update that I have provided today demonstrates my and the Government's determination to put in place effective systems and procedures to further protect the public&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.368.1/3">My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>

	<p pid="a.371.0/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement and updating the House on what has happened since the Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-13">13 November</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/2">Two issues on the table continue to cloud the clear thinking in this area. The SIA is licensing individuals but the industry groups employers. Individuals are being licensed, but employers have the legal responsibility for checking. That issue has contributed to the present position. Since the original Act was drawn up in 2001, it has become apparent that the security industry has expanded considerably. The Government's intention to farm more work out to it in all sorts of areas means that, in the long run, besides the questions raised by the Statement today, we should be looking for the Act to be updated.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/3">I have talked with people from the industry, who describe the Act as a starting point. Perhaps if they were generous they would describe it as the 11-plus compared with university entrance. It may have served a purpose before there was anything else in place, but it needs an overhaul now.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/4">I have some questions for the Minister. He mentioned that cases were being analysed for evidence of employers who appeared to have a track record of employing people who do not have the right to work here. The BIA said that a third of its illegal-working operation is concentrating on that. I wonder how many people constitute a third of that operation. Are we talking about five people, 15 people or 50 people? That will be relevant to how fast the case load can be got through.</p>
	<p pid="a.371.0/5">Secondly, according to the Security Industry Authority, of the 114 contractors currently licensed there have been four withdrawals of licences, from the employers' side, I imagine, although it is not clear to me. Perhaps the Minister would explain exactly what happens where an employer is found still to be operating even though it has a large number of individuals whose individual licences have been withdrawn. Lastly, will the Minister tell me the current position of all this in Scotland?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-13a.372.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100956" speakername="Lord West of Spithead" colon=":" colnum="372"  time="014:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71213-0008.htm#07121360000305">
	<p pid="a.372.0/1">My Lords, thank you for those points. The noble Baroness, Lady Neville-Jones, raised the chronology of how various decisions were made and referred to the timings of when things were known and my right honourable friend the Home Secretary's response. Effectively the SIA, although it was under no obligation to do so, started checks in 2006 to identify whether any of the people who were being cleared on the basis of their CRB and competence were not entitled to work in the United Kingdom. They did some checks with a small sample and found that there were a number. That made them think that they should check in a little more detail and a larger sample was chosen. In April this year that highlighted that this was a problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.0/2">That shows how important the matter is and what a good thing it was that we established the SIA back in 2003, because there was nothing in existence before that to look at these things. My right honourable friend Liam Byrne became aware of the issue in April this year. The full scale of the problem became apparent in about August, but before that on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase>, as I said in the Statement, every applicant identified as a non-EEA national by the SIA had their right to work in the UK checked by the BIA. That was done off its own bat before Ministers had looked at this. In August we had a couple of meetings on the issue. The Home Secretary was made aware of the problem and she understandably said that she wanted to know the full scale, the full implications and the actions to be carried out. That she wanted to check the figures was shown clearly by the fact that the numbers have changed regularly, as was pointed out by the noble Baroness. Initially we thought that it might be about 5,000, but now we have bottomed that out and come to the latest figure. That shows that it was essential that she looked at those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.0/3">A point was raised about the number of people protecting sensitive ministries and so on. All the people who work at the Home Office in this context have SIA checks anyway. There is not an issue. In August the Cabinet Office wrote to all HR directors of various departments to establish the fact that they had to use the directive that points out the baseline personal security standard for all their people. That has been done. We have looked across the board and there are no areas where we are concerned about that risk to government departments, agencies, the military, the police and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.0/4">Since the <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-02">2 July</phrase> cases we have passed 338 cases to enforcement teams. We have produced 328 intelligence packages, where they try to identify the full detail. We have made 101 enforcement visits, 44 encounters and so far arrested 15 people, but these are early days and there is a 42-day period for people to respond.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.0/5">I was asked about what happened with the immediate suspension of a licence. The SIA can suspend a licence immediately if it is reasonably satisfied that there will be a clear threat to public safety. Having looked through the relatively high proportion that we have and the number of successful challenges, we believe that this is not an appropriate course of action at the moment for the ones that we are dealing with.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.0/6">It was said that the SIA website says that it will conduct right-to-work checks. That is not correct. It says that it may conduct right-to-work checks. As I said before, it was set up on the basis of checking competency and CRB, not that right-to-work check. However, the double lock system now means that that is done and will be covered.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.0/7">The noble Baroness thought that the SIA had functioned badly. I go back to what I said before, which shows me that we are lucky that we established an SIA, that it was doing its job thinking of other aspects and that it did the right things. It has been brought to our attention and now a raft of measures are being implemented to find out the exact position and to take action to make sure that we get this right. Therefore I do not think that it functioned badly at all. It functioned well and spotted something that was going wrong, bearing in mind that it was established in 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.0/8">The noble Baroness, Lady Miller, mentioned the licence of individuals and employees and rightly raised the fact that Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act 1996 does not fulfil what is required of it. That has been recognised. Later today in this House, for example, we will be discussing the Immigration (Employment of Adults Subject to Immigration Control) (Maximum Penalty) Order 2007. That is part of a series of measures to replace Section 8 of the Asylum and Immigration Act with something a little more practical that we will be able to use properly to prosecute the firms that the noble Baroness was talking about who are clearly breaking those rules. It has been difficult and clumsy to do it in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.0/9">The BIA has over 30 enforcement officers across the UK, so one-third of that must be 10. Perhaps I may come back to your Lordships with this in writing, because I am not sure myself, to give a precise figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.372.0/10">I do not know the position for Scotland and I will come back in writing on that. If I have not answered any questions from the noble Baroness I will be happy to talk afterwards or to come back in writing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-13a.403.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="403"  time="016:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71213-0012.htm#07121360000459">
	<p pid="a.403.0/1">My Lords, I congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Livsey of Talgarth, on securing the debate. On behalf of the Government, I thank him very much for initiating a debate on this important subject. The expertise and local knowledge demonstrated this afternoon mean that this debate will be widely read and, one hopes, widely considered. There is a huge degree of expertise in this House on this subject, not least because two speakers were distinguished Members of Parliament&mdash; for Northavon in one case and Weston-super-Mare in the other. They had a direct constituency interest in the problems that this proposal raises. We have had expertise from others, too. The noble Baronesses, Lady Young of Old Scone and Lady Miller, and many others, are acknowledged experts on the environment and the issues of this case.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/2">This is an important subject and the debate shows, if anyone ever thought that the big decisions on climate change would somehow make themselves, or would be easy decisions, how wrong they would be. There are conflicting interests all over the place. The difficulty for Government and Parliament is to work their way through these conflicting interests to try to find what is best for our generation and above all, as the noble Earl has just said, for future generations.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/3">I think it is appropriate to begin by setting today's debate in the context of this country's wider energy policy. The energy White Paper, published earlier this year, set out our strategy to address the two major long-term energy challenges we face. The first is tackling climate change by reducing carbon emissions, both within the UK and abroad. The second is ensuring secure, clean and affordable energy as we become increasingly dependent on imported fuel. To meet these challenges, the Government have set four long-term goals: first, to put ourselves on a path to cut our CO2 emissions by some 60 per cent by about 2050, with real and substantial progress by 2020; secondly, to maintain the reliability of energy supplies; thirdly, to promote competitive markets here and abroad, helping to raise the rate of sustainable economic growth and to improve our productivity; and, lastly, to ensure, of course, that every home is adequately and affordably heated. Achieving those goals, which are easy to set out, will require a series of changes, developments and decisions over decades to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/4">So we need a framework that delivers the necessary changes, and we think that that framework for action is set out in the White Paper. It is based on the principles of competitive energy markets, energy efficiency and a diverse energy mix, with more low-carbon sources of energy. In the gracious Speech on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-06">6 November</phrase> last, Her Majesty gave notice of the Government's intention to take forward policies that will help us meet our energy challenges. Bills covering energy, planning and climate change will provide a package of measures to implement the measures in the energy White Paper, strengthening the framework for investment in low-carbon sources of energy and energy infrastructure; ensure that planning supports sustainable development and measures to tackle climate change through an efficient and fair planning process; and set legally binding emission-reduction targets, requiring government to set five-year targets.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/5">As the urgency of tackling climate change and achieving energy security increase, the case for more renewable energy has become more and more compelling. That is why the UK supports the agreement of EU leaders that, by 2020, one-fifth of all Europe's energy should come from renewables, a near threefold increase. We are completely committed to meeting our share. We do not know yet what that share will be but it is clear that, over the next decade and beyond, we will need to increase very significantly the proportion of our energy from renewable sources. The Prime Minister announced last month the launch of a consultation next year inviting a national debate about how we achieve our renewable energy targets. I venture to think that our debate today may have been the start of that national debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/6">I hope that our commitment to renewable energy such as wind, wave, biomass and tidal power, is clear. On Monday, as was referred to by the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform set out new proposals that could see up to 25 gigawatts of offshore wind operating in UK waters by 2020, with the potential to generate enough power for up to 25 million homes, the equivalent of all UK homes. That followed the announcement last month of consent for a 350-megawatt wood-fuelled electricity generation plant in south Wales in Port Talbot. We understand that, when completed, that will be the largest biomass plant in the world. As well as having some of the best wind resources in the world, we are blessed with some of the best tidal resources in the world too. Estimates suggest that tidal energy could provide more than 10 per cent of the UK's electricity demand. So it must make sense for us to explore the potential for harnessing that resource.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/7">That brings me to what we are discussing in detail today. Over the past year the Sustainable Development Commission has conducted a study of the potential for tidal power in the UK. It published its report on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October</phrase>, setting out its position and advice to the Government on tidal power. I should like to make clear how grateful we are to the commission for the work it has done. The noble Lords, Lord Livsey and Lord Moran, the noble Baroness, Lady Young, and the noble Earl, Lord Liverpool, were among those who referred to the commission and what it said. Its comments are subject to praise and to criticism too, but it is an important contribution to this debate. I shall come in a moment or two to some of the remarks in its conclusion. The report is wide-ranging and considers the potential for different tidal technologies, including tidal barrages, tidal lagoons and the emerging tidal stream technologies. It has stimulated much discussion and perhaps even this debate, but its position on the Severn barrage has attracted the most interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/8">Two of the report's key conclusions were that, first, the commission believes that there is a strong case to be made for a sustainable Severn barrage; and, secondly, that such a development may provide an environmental opportunity by linking a compensatory habitats package to climate change adaptation. Of course, the commission set a number of conditions that would need to be met for a barrage to be considered sustainable. Those require any consideration of a barrage to be within a framework that places,</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/9" class="indent">&quot;high value on the long-term public interest and on maintaining the overall integrity of internationally recognised habitats and species&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/10">We welcome the commission's key message that tidal power can be generated in the Severn estuary within sustainable development principles. We are looking at the report and its conclusions with great care.</p>
	<p pid="a.403.0/11">The scheme with which most will be familiar and the one on which most of the discussion today has centred is known as the Cardiff-Weston barrage. It was studied in some depth during the 1980s&mdash;we are grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Rowe-Beddoe, for that information&mdash;but discussed earlier than that. The possibilities of it using what the noble Lord, Lord Cope, described as awesome natural power are clear. It is important that this scheme does not preclude other schemes, as the noble Lord, Lord Rowe-Beddoe, reminded us. As proposed, it would have a capacity of 8,600 megawatts and an output of 17 terawatt hours a year, providing around 5 per cent of current UK electricity demand from a renewable source and saving some 6 million tonnes of CO2 a year over its 120-year lifetime. On that basis we have to consider it seriously, just as the House has this afternoon. It has been estimated to cost around &pound;15 million&mdash;I take on board the point made by the noble Earl in his speech from the Opposition Front Bench; it will be one of the largest civil engineering projects in the world and by far the largest single renewable energy generation scheme in the UK.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-13a.416.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100029" speakername="Lord Avebury" colon=":" colnum="416"  time="017:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71213-0014.htm#07121360000529">
	<p pid="a.416.0/1">My Lords, I think that the answer to the noble Baroness's question is that the power to impose these charges is in Section 51 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act 2006. No doubt the Minister will correct me it that is not right.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/2">The Merits Committee has drawn this order to the special attention of the House on the grounds that it gives rise to issues of public policy likely to be of interest, and I was rather hoping that the chairman of that committee, the noble Lord, Lord Filkin, would have been present to spell out exactly what those issues are. The only one that is implicit in committee's report is that the Government have not provided enough information about the points-based system and the sponsorship proposals to which the fees are to relate. But the order covers the power to charge fees not only for services provided to sponsors for the issue of a licence to a sponsor, who is either an employer or an educational establishment, but to further classes of individuals who are applicants for entry clearance, transit visas, BIDs, and certificates of entitlement for the right of abode. The Explanatory Memorandum states that no regulatory impact assessment has been produced for this order, because that will be done before the further order, mentioned by the noble Baroness, setting the level of fees to be charged for the applications and processes specified here is made.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/3">It would be useful to know whether the Merits Committee looked at the debates we had on the previous orders made under the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act&mdash;the Immigration and Nationality (Fees) Order and the regulations that followed, and whether some of the committee's concerns were similar to those expressed on the previous occasions, which I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, will recall. As now, your Lordships were asked to give the Government carte blanche to set the fees at any level they pleased in the first order, and by the time we came to the regulations, it was too late for us to have any influence on the amounts that were being charged. The process of determining fees that are in excess of the cost of providing the service had already been decided by Section 51 of the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act, but I am pretty sure that at that time, Parliament did not fully appreciate that we were relinquishing all control over the amounts that were to be charged. There might not be any objection, if there were some guarantee that,</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/4" class="indent">&quot;those who benefit most from the immigration system should pay proportionately more towards the end to end costs of the system&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/5">but the unfettered discretion given to the Secretary of State means that departures from the principle are not subject to any democratic control. When they imposed huge increases in the fees charged to spouses, who do not necessarily get any economic benefit from coming to the UK to join their partners, our complaints to the Government fell on deaf ears.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/6">In the debate on that fees order, we did at least have details of the amounts that were to be charged under the regulations, but this time round we have no information about the amounts proposed to be charged. It may be considered that the employers' organisations and Universities UK are capable of looking after their own interests, and perhaps they are. But it would be rash to assume that because UK institutions of higher education have been attractive to overseas students in the past, they will continue to receive the same numbers of applicants if the amounts they have to charge to cover these new arrangements need to be increased sharply. The cost of the licences will have to be recovered, and so will the cost of the certificates of sponsorship issued to each individual prospective student; and since the certificate itself is not a guarantee that the applicant will be granted an entry certificate, the amount the university will need to add to the standard overseas student fee will be more than the cost of the certificate plus an allocated proportion of the licence fee.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/7">I have spoken to Universities UK, which has been pressing for information about the new points-based system and its costs, and would welcome fuller disclosure. The first point Universities UK made was that the BIA should obtain a list of subscribers directly from the Quality Assurance Agency rather than requiring every individual higher education institution provide evidence of their subscription.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/8">Secondly, it draws attention to the level of fees that are likely to be paid by a typical higher education institution, which has to cover three tiers of the new system: tier two for skilled workers with a job offer, replacing the present work permits; tier four for students; and tier five, which it says would apply to academic visitors and sponsored researchers. The sponsor registration fee is &pound;1,000; the tier-two employee certificate fee is &pound;200, and if there are 90 staff subject to immigration control, then by the calculations of Universities UK&mdash;which are not definitive because the actual amounts have not yet been divulged&mdash;the total amount payable would be &pound;18,000. That is based on having 90 staff subject to immigration control. The tier-five visiting staff certificate fee is estimated at &pound;50, so for an enrolment of &pound;400, that would come to another &pound;20,000, making a grand total in the first year of the scheme for that particular institution of &pound;39,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/9">In the second year, with tier four in operation, and if there are 2,500 international students at &pound;20 each, that would come to &pound;50,000. To save time I will not go through the rest of the calculations. If the Minister would like to have a look at the memorandum that I had from Universities UK, I should be glad to pass it over to him, but perhaps his department will already have heard from it and will know that its anxieties on this score remain to be satisfied.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/10">As I said, these are not insignificant costs but of course they also involve an extra administrative burden. The universities are already undertaking much of the work that the BIA would otherwise have to undertake itself in the Student Batch Scheme, under which they check the credentials of students who apply for extensions of leave to remain. At the same time, they are being encouraged to take on more international work&mdash;for example, through the Prime Minister's Initiative on International Education and the UK-India Education and Research Initiative&mdash;and indeed they have to do so to earn the fees to make up for cuts in government funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/11">We are anxious that all these activities, and the substantial contribution that higher education institutions make to our overseas earnings, should not be jeopardised by a hard-nosed approach to recovering all the costs of the points-based system from users, and the universities in particular. That would be to ignore the intangible benefits that we get from overseas students coming to the UK. They pay indirect taxes, which surely must amount to far more than the fees, and they bring cultural and human value to the higher education institutions to which they belong and to the British students who interact with them. There does not seem to be proper recognition and acknowledgement of these benefits in the arithmetic; nor do the Government take account of the enormous problems that will be imposed on HEIs, which have to set their budgets for several years ahead but still face wide uncertainties around the introduction of the new system and the costs that they will incur.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/12">I am not certain whether Universities UK was sent the letter which described itself as a &quot;short, targeted stakeholder consultation&quot;. It was notified to the recipients by e-mail on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-24">24 October</phrase> and had a response date less than three weeks later. I should be grateful if the Minister would enlighten us on that matter. If it did, the BIA should have explained that this was the only exercise of its kind that it was conducting, because the term &quot;consultation&quot; is a term of art which technically means a process that lasts for 16 weeks and is open to responses from the general public and not simply from the targeted addressees. In fact, it would be useful if the Minister could inform your Lordships who received this communication and how they were selected.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/13">I mentioned the Chinese community in the previous debate and I should interpolate a note on them here. I had a telephone message from them this afternoon saying that they were not in receipt of this consultation from the BIA, in spite of the fact that they were assured all the way through the proceedings on the Immigration, Asylum and Nationality Act that they would be fully consulted before any of these changes were introduced. I ask the Minister how on earth the department came to leave out Christine Lee of the Chinese Community Association, or how the BIA managed to do it on his behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/14">The BIA says that licence fees for sponsors of tiers four and five will be set at or below cost-recovery level. That is welcome as far as it goes, but it threatens to make the charges for certificates higher to achieve a balance so that overall, presumably, the total cost is recovered. One way or another, institutions of higher education and others will have to raise their charges to overseas students. I should be grateful if the Minister could say whether it is the policy intention that universities should be allowed to increase their charges to cover the amounts that they have to pay under this order.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/15">Turning for a moment to the individuals covered by the order, they have no powerful advocates to represent their interests and, as we have seen, it is the people who are not going to make a loud noise who are likely to be picked on for overcharging under the 2006 Act regime. In the previous round, the total charges imposed on a spouse were more than doubled to more than &pound;2,000 by the time that he or she obtained citizenship. The fear is that similarly excessive amounts will be charged under this order, particularly for BIDs, that every migrant staying in the UK for six months or more will have to pay whether that person is a student, a worker or a relative coming for settlement. That will be on top of whatever the migrant has already paid to get into the country, and there are no exemptions, or even discounts, for a person coming from a poor family in a third-world country.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/16">In its November report on the results of the consultation on the prevention of illegal migrant working in the UK, the BIA said that it will be consulting shortly on the rollout of BIDs. Does that refer to the letter that I have already mentioned? As far as I am aware, no such consultation has been launched, and I would like to know what the target date would be. Is the consultation going to cover the charges, bearing in mind that in the previous consultation on the charging regime for immigration and nationality fees, no mention was made of BIDs? These documents are not being issued in order to endow the holder with any rights or privileges he did not already possess but in order to enable the authorities more readily to apprehend and remove those who are not entitled to be here. It is also avowedly being used as a trial run for national identity cards, as the Home Office's regulatory impact assessment on the UK Borders Act openly stated. It is surely unreasonable to load the start-up costs on to migrants who are less able to afford them than the settled population. In fairness, the initial capital expenditure should be apportioned over the total adult population.</p>
	<p pid="a.416.0/17">It is unfortunate that these orders are being slipped past us by the Home Office when we have only part of the picture, as it did with the previous set of charges in March. We understand why it is doing that; it is to minimise the criticism and to ensure that when the charges are specified in a subsequent order it will be too late for Parliament to have any influence on the charging regime. We say, as we did then, that the manner in which this is being done&mdash;minimising the area of debate once we do get firm proposals on the timing and amounts&mdash;is not transparent and is not consensual governance.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-13a.421.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="421"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71213-0015.htm#07121360000550">
	<p pid="a.421.1/1">My Lords, I accept the point that Parliament is guided by the procedure. Before we get to that point, of course, we endeavour to consult. The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, made a strong pitch on the consultation issue. The consultation with stakeholders ran from <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-23">23 October</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-09">9 November</phrase>. A consultation document was sent to more than 493 people and stakeholder groups, including Universities UK, and I am more than happy to set out the details of that in correspondence. We received 132 written responses; 92 educational establishments, 17 employers and 23 arts and entertainments responses were received. We received a further 31 responses after the official closing date for the consultation. We took the pragmatic view and accepted those responses even though they were late.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/2">We also held a number of consultation events which were attended by representatives of the education, employment and arts and entertainments sectors. We are particularly mindful of the arts and entertainments sector because we have been advised in the past of the difficulties which festivals in particular can experience when putting together their programme with foreign performers coming to this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/3">I cannot accept the allegation made by the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that our visa regime and the cost-of-entry clearance put off genuine students, or that that regime damages our international competitiveness. The Home Office and UKvisas have done a great deal to support educational exports. Our visa provides working entitlements far more generous than those of competing study destinations such as Canada, Australia and the United States. The points-based system will continue to support the Prime Minister's initiative by making the system simpler for applicants, with its online assessment process and clear entry criteria putting sponsors at the heart of the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/4">I am grateful to the noble Lord for drawing to my attention the Universities UK calculations on impact. We are working with key stakeholders, including Universities UK, to develop fees that are fair and proportionate. We shall continue that work, obviously to the point at which we bring forward our order.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/5">The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, asked whether there would be any changes to the visitor category requirements or other consequences for sponsorship for visitors. We will shortly publish a public consultation on visitors. That consultation will examine visitor routes in general, because that is something that the points-based system does not cover. It will include provisions relating to family visitors. Visitors will always need to satisfy the entry clearance officer of their intentions and their compliance with immigration laws at point of entry. We aim to keep migrant fees at broadly the same level as their comparative existing fees&mdash;that is our policy. The aim is that people moving from the current system to the new points-based system should not ultimately see too big a change.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/6">The noble Lord also said that we had carte blanche to charge whatever we wished: I do not agree. Those fees are set out in regulations. Where they are above cost recovery, they must be debated fully in both Houses, so there is ample opportunity to challenge our approach. He also asked for some response to the Merits Committee and its desire to see more information on sponsorship. We have published a statement of intent on sponsorship with more detail, and copies are available in the Library and on the BIA website. The noble Lord made further points about consultation. I think that I should provide the noble Lord with more details, in particular on the consultation on bids and its implementation. I will set those out in correspondence to the noble Lord and provide them also to the noble Baroness, Lady Hanham.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/7">The noble Lord also asked whether it was intended that universities should be able to increase their fees to cover sponsorship. Ultimately, it is a decision for the universities, particularly those that are mindful of their competitive position. They will decide how to set fees and whether to pass on costs. As I see it, the fees for students will be kept at a modest and moderate level&mdash;that is certainly our intention.</p>
	<p pid="a.421.1/8">Some of the other, more complex issues that the noble Lord raised I will deal with through correspondence, because I am not confident that I have all the answers with me.</p>
