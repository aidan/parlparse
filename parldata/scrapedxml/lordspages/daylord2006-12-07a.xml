	<p pid="a.1248.7/1" pwmotiontext="asked">rose to call attention to the current situation in the National Health Service; and to move for Papers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/2">My Lords, my noble friend Lady Sharples provided an excellent curtain-raiser to our debate today. I look forward to hearing everyone's contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/3">Despite the benefit of increased funding and some real improvements, the NHS, which employs more than 1 million people and sees 48 million patients every year, is not well. All over the country, doctors are seriously worried by the continual and rapid introduction of new reforms, fragmentation of services, the lack of evaluation of new policy measures, overemphasis of the role of the independent sector and a lack of vision on the direction of travel. Continual change and reorganisation is having a detrimental effect on the morale of health service staff.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/4">Essential healthcare professionals are losing their jobs and the NHS now forecasts a gross deficit at this stage of the year of almost &pound;1.2 billion, already very close to the figure of &pound;1.3 billion for the whole of last year. The organisational changes&mdash;from regional offices in 1997, via directorates, different numbers of strategic health authorities, and the change from health authorities to 303 primary care trusts, now merged to 130&mdash;are hard to understand. One has to ask whether this is good management.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/5">It is the Government's mismanagement that has put the NHS in this financial mess. Despite all their assurances and promises, and despite the &pound;155 million spent on consultants in 2005-06 and a further &pound;22 million spent on employing &quot;turnaround teams&quot; to support NHS organisations in financial difficulty, they are failingto solve the NHS cash crisis. Last week, a survey of29 accident and emergency departments under threat of closure revealed that 75 per cent of the NHS organisations which manage them were deep in the red in the last financial year. It is of great concern that these closures appear to be taking place for financial reasons rather than on clinical grounds. Just as the Government claim to be bringing care closer to people, they are planning to take local A&amp;E and maternity departments further away. People do not feel safe with this. I hope that the Minister will be able to confirm that any savings made by closing some A&amp;Es will be devoted to building others into specialised centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/6">With more than 20,000 posts being lost, the total cost of NHS compulsory redundancies could rise to &pound;70 million, and with cuts to front-line patient services being made up and down the country, itis becoming very difficult to trust the Labour Government with our NHS. Doctors report on cancelled clinics, empty operating theatres and patient referrals diverted to referral management centres, where patients are often redirected to another consultant's list. The British Medical Association is dismayed by the incoherence of current government policies and the damage they cause to the NHS and the delivery of patient care. Any NHS reform to deliver integrated care must be based on the values of co-operation, strategic planning and equity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/7">The recent restructuring of SHAs and PCTs has resulted in a commensurate reduction in the number of directors of public health. It is a concern that, as the timing coincides with NHS deficit recovery plans, PCTs will seek to reduce the number of specialist consultant public health posts. I hope that the Minister can reassure me that this important group of clinicians will be retained so that PCTs can deliver their vital public health functions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/8">It has taken a year for the Government to produce their proposals for NHS regulation. But those proposals will fail to ensure value for taxpayers' money and to safeguard the quality of care provided to patients. They do not even address important questions such as what support the majority of NHS organisations can expect if they are in danger of going bust. Under the proposals in the policy document on the future regulation of health and social care in England, the same organisations that have been responsible for presiding over the NHS's descent into financial chaos will have the same responsibilities in future. The same systems that have plunged the NHS into the red today will remain in place tomorrow.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/9">The review of regulation represents a missed opportunity on a massive scale. It will not give the NHS independence. The NHS tariff will not be set independently, as clearly it should. The competition regime is not to be maintained by an independent regulator; it is a blueprint for continued financial failure in our NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/10">NHS commissioning that is led by clinicians working together across primary and secondary care will ensure that decisions on health services best meet the needs of patients. GPs should be given back the power to control their own budgets and negotiate contracts with health services, which the Labour Government stripped them of with their abolition of GP fund-holding in 1999. The proposal to introduce a &quot;practice-based commissioning&quot; does not go far enough, since primary care trusts will still be the ultimate statutory budget holders. Government plans to change how NHS services are commissioned could provide a real opportunity to improve the rangeand quality of health service available to patients, but that will succeed only if there is a proper clinical engagement in both primary and secondary care and a meaningful dialogue with patients. The opportunity for every NHS trust to become an NHS foundation trust should be accelerated, and foundation trusts should be given greater freedoms to borrow to invest against their assets. Only this will deliver the flexibility that the NHS needs to finance its future capital investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/11">There is no single cause of the NHS's current financial difficulties but a multitude of local and national factors. Constant reform and political interference have taken their toll, as have difficulties in managing deficits and strategic planning failures. The impact of NHS deficits in England has been wide-ranging for both patients and NHS staff. A BMA survey in 2005 revealed that one in three NHS trusts planned to reduce services because of deficits. Of the 171 NHS trusts that replied, one-third reported that their trust intended to reduce patient services. The Audit Commission's recent report on financial failure in the NHS found that organisations in financial difficulty routinely failed to engage senior clinicians in management decisions. This came as no surprise to doctors' leaders who have consistently called for greater clinical engagement in policy development and implementation. A criticism of engagement is that it comes too late in the process of developing policies or solutions to problems. All too often, Ministers will come up with a policy and then consult stakeholders about how to implement it. Doctors and other healthcare professionals should be engaged constantly in policy development to jointly analyse problems and co-produce solutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/12">One major concern that health service staff have with the involvement of the private sector in the NHS and particularly independent sector treatment centres is the impact on local health economies. In some cases ISTCs have been imposed on local areas where their capacity was not needed or wanted. Health managers diverted resources for certain operations which had a negative impact on the existing local NHS services which were already performing these operations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/13">The concern is not that ISTCs exist, but that they exist in isolation from the NHS. There is a concern that the involvement of the independent sector has been implemented without provision for co-operation with existing NHS services, with preferential arrangements. This has the potential to threaten core NHS services. Medical centres operated by private health companies are treating as few as a quarter of the NHS patients whom they have been paid to handle. However, under contracts worth &pound;1.7 billion given to companies to operate 18 centres since 2004, the money is paid whether targets are met or not, resulting in millions of pounds of taxpayers' money being wasted. I understand that the Department of Health has just signed new contracts worth &pound;200 million with 14 private healthcare companies, which are to provide an additional 750,000 medical procedures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/14">Local financial difficulties have been compounded by national policies. The Government's commitment to commercial sector involvement in the NHS and the strain this puts on NHS finances is a key example. The preferential contracts awarded to commercial companies to carry out NHS work have meant that NHS hospitals lose out on essential funding. ISTCs are using NHS millions when spare capacity in the NHS goes unfunded and unused. PFI projects and the use of expensive management consultants are similarly draining vital funds from the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/15">I am in favour of using the private sector, but the Government have clearly involved the independent sector without delivering value for money. Centres are not working to their optimum capacity and cost significantly more than the same service provided by the NHS. With the NHS in England recording a net deficit of &pound;547 million in 2005-06, the suggestion that the NHS has had its best year ever must be disputed. This year has seen vital healthcare professionals losing their jobs, cuts in training budgets and doctors reporting cancelled clinics, ward closures and delayed operations. The Government have invested unprecedented funds in the NHS, and profound changes are taking place with virtually no debate in Parliament and without full and proper consultation with staff, their representative organisations, patients and the public.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/16">With the current financial instability in the NHS, medical education and training in England are increasingly coming under threat, and this may affect patient care. Budget cuts to fund NHS deficits are draining vital resources from training and education for medical and dental students and threatening academic jobs. Continued cuts to training and education will threaten numbers of medical school places, worsen shortages of clinical academic staff and could result in the closure of some schools. Targets for the cuts include funding for junior doctors' study leave, which allows them to attend courses required for their training. These cuts are increasingly regarded as the soft option for trusts facing financial pressures, especially as they are no longer ring-fenced.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/17">The NHS has a shortfall of doctors relative to demand. By 2008, the UK will need about 25,000 more doctors than it did in 1997. It is essential that the budgets, held by special health authorities, are protected. I should be grateful if the Minister could say what steps are being taken to ensure that clinical academic posts are not affected by NHS financial deficits and the non-ring-fencing of the multi-professional and education training levy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/18">I could not initiate a debate on the NHS without mentioning my own profession of dentistry. The reforms to NHS dentistry have not improved access for patients, and the Government have accepted that2 million people who wanted to see an NHS dentist prior to <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year are still unable to do so after the implementation of the new contract. About90 per cent of dentists signed the new contract, but about 1,700 who previously had an NHS commitment did not. Many contracts were signed in dispute and the latest figures show that about 1,130 of these are still unresolved. I made some comments about the current dental situation in the debate on the Queen's Speech and it is not my intention to repeat the issues that I raised. I must, however, try to clarify the situation regarding my assertion that the drill and fill treadmill has been replaced with a new treadmill, one driven by targets which are not patient-centred.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/19">When this came up in Questions in your Lordships' House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-21">21 November</phrase>, the noble Lord, Lord Warner, was positive that this treadmill has been removed, but he must agree that the system does nothing to encourage dentists to take on new patients. Those patients, who may not have seen a dentist for several years, are much more likely to need more dental treatment than the patients who attend regularly and can benefit from advice on the maintenance of good oral health. Where is the incentive to take on new patients when the examination, scaling and perhaps one filling in one patient and the same examination, scaling and need for multiple fillings in another attract the same number of units of dental activity?</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/20">I am aware of dentists who have to see between35 and 50 patients per day to meet their contractual targets. The meeting of the British Dental Association parliamentary panel last week was informed of one dentist who had to see up to 90 patients per day to meet her UDA target. Under the piloted personal dental service scheme, dentists had the freedom to commission services to meet local need. It was possible to ring-fence time for emergencies, meaning that patients with an emergency could have the full treatment on the first visit, rather than having to arrange another time some weeks ahead. Once an NHS dentist has met their target, they will not receive funding for any further treatment they perform that year. It is of great concern that some dentists may meet their target early and then be unable to provide patients with the NHS treatment that they need and which the dentist has capacity to deliver. I suggested that the Government regard the first year of the new contract as a test year. I believe that the figures for the first year will not be available until June and thatthe Government are committed to producing a report on the first 12 months based on the work of the implementation review group. This will enable a thorough review of the effects of the new contract. That opportunity must be grasped.</p>
	<p pid="a.1248.7/21">Any changes that improve patient care should be supported, but the Government should do more to recognise the progress made by their extra money and the hard work of NHS staff, and should make sure that change and reform involve support from the staff who have to deliver it. The NHS has repeatedly demonstrated its ability to foster innovation and is a proven mechanism that can deliver, and has delivered, reform. Reform must be based on the values of co-operation, strategic planning and equity and should deliver integrated care and an environment in which teaching, training and research can flourish. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-12-07a.1254.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100545" speakername="Lord Rodgers of Quarry Bank" colon=":" colnum="1254"  time="011:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61207-0002.htm#06120758000098">
	<p pid="a.1254.0/1">My Lords, I welcome the initiative of the noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, in raising today's debate. Shortly before the most recent general election, I recall another debate in the House to which I listened but in which I did not participate. Almost all noble Lords who spoke had been professionally involved in the health service and were well disposed to the NHS, saying that so many things were getting better. After the bleak Thatcher era and Gordon Brown's four lean years of public expenditure, there was now a perceptible improvement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254.0/2">On the occasion of today's debate, the moodmay be a little different. Last year, I did not quarrel with the apparent consensus. My knowledge and experience arose entirely from me and my family, and we were glad that the NHS was recovering. However, I thought that the debate was rather too full of self-congratulation and provided too little recognition of the gap between the much-improved NHS and the so-called world class to which the Government had chosen to aspire. The glass of success was half full, but it was still half empty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254.0/3">As an example, I had applied at that time for my NHS hearing aids. In the House, Ministers proudly told us of the new digital appliances&mdash;the result of a successful deal between the public and private sectors. But I then discovered that fitting my hearing aids would take a full year, and elsewhere the delay was often very much longer. For those who had hearing problems, the glass was certainly still half empty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254.0/4">I want to deal mainly with another current issue&mdash;the future of stroke care&mdash;and, again, I shall draw from personal experience. Today, I am not pursuing the subject of the highly controversial accident and emergency proposals spelt out by the Prime Minister this week, although I am not yet persuaded of their virtues. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-23">23 May</phrase>, in a short debate, I had the opportunity to raise the National Audit Office report of November 2005, <I>Reducing Brain Damage: Faster Access to Better Stroke Care</I>. I explained that five years ago, I had been taken to the Royal Free Hospital, London, and then to the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery in Queen Square. A stroke had been diagnosed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254.0/5">The National Audit Office report, the Houseof Commons Public Accounts Committee report which then followed, and the Government's recent response&mdash;the 52nd report, Cm 6924&mdash;have this in common: they agree that stroke is the single biggest cause of death after heart disease and cancer and that three times as many women die of a stroke as die of breast cancer. Nor does the department dissent from the PAC's conclusion that stroke costs the economy &pound;7 billion a year, including &pound;2.8 billion in direct care costs to the NHS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254.0/6">I shall not set out further the large measure of agreement between the three reports on matters of fact. I concede that there have been significant improvements in the past five or six years and that stroke is now accepted as a medical sub-specialty, but I am unhappy about the tone of the 52nd report, which is bland, the lack of urgency on the part of the Department of Health and the apparent absence of additional resources sufficient to implement good intentions. In particular, I am greatly concerned about the arrangements necessary for scanning stroke victims.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254.0/7">The summary of the National Audit Office report said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1254.0/8" class="indent">&quot;There are barriers that prevent stroke patients from receiving rapid and responsive emergency care&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254.0/9">It continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.1254.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Large numbers of acute stroke patients don't get a scan within the critical time period&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254.0/11">Among the conclusions and recommendations in its report, the PAC said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1254.0/12" class="indent">&quot;All suspected stroke patients should be scanned as soon as possible after arrival at the acute hospital, ideally with three hours, and none should wait more than 24 hours&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254.0/13">The Department of Health agrees with the recommendations, and that is fine, but there is too little evidence in the report that serious progress is being made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254.0/14">In my speech on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-23">23 May</phrase>, I drew attention to my interest in the Royal Free Hospital&mdash;one of my local hospitals. So, a couple of months later, I asked the Royal Free whether patients were scanned within three hours and whether they could be scanned 24 hours a day, seven days a week. In his reply on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-22">22 August</phrase>, the chief executive of the trust said that the hospital had the facility to scan patients 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and its aim was to scan within 24 hours of admission. But the hospital could not routinely scan patients within three hours and, in the last audit period, 10 out of 33 acute stroke patients were not scanned within 24 hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254.0/15">I am not making a target of the hospital. On the contrary, the chief executive gave a straightforward answer to my questions. But my guess is that the Royal Free is typical, plus or minus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254.0/16">I am not asking the Minister to give an authoritative view this afternoon&mdash;that would be unreasonable&mdash;but I will table a Written Question to him to give me a complete picture, hospital by acute hospital, in answer to my two simple questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1254.0/17">On access to stroke care, I am ready to concede that the glass is now half full, but I hope that in turn the Minister will concede that it is still half empty.</p>

	<p pid="a.1280.2/1">My Lords, that was a very salutary speech. Like other speakers, I am most grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Colwyn, for instigating this debate today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1280.2/2">I propose to restrict my speech to two subjects, both of which are described by their detractors as figments of patients' imaginations, so I hope that noble Lords will bear with me. As a result they suffer a lack of establishment support and a serious paucity of funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.1280.2/3">It is only very recently that we have debated the subject of homeopathy. I am raising the subject again today because our homeopathic hospitals are endangered. I do not intend to return to the pros and cons of homeopathy itself. There are five NHS homeopathic hospitals in the UK: in Bristol, Liverpool, London, Tunbridge Wells and Glasgow. All have been part of the NHS since its inception in 1948, though several have existed for over a century.</p>
	<p pid="a.1280.2/4">These consultant-led services are staffed by fully qualified doctors, nurses and other professionals who have additional training in homeopathy and other complementary therapies such as acupuncture. As is usual in the NHS, patients are referred by their GP or specialist. Homeopathic hospitals are a unique asset to the NHS for several reasons: they offer patients genuine choice of treatment by providing evidence-based, highly professional complementary medicine; although small, they are highly innovative&mdash;for instance, acupuncture for pain and complementary cancer care, both now widely available in the NHS, were pioneered by the homeopathic hospitals&mdash;and they have made important research contributions, such as researching &quot;effectiveness gaps&quot;, conditions for which GPs lack effective treatments, and the outcome and cost-effectiveness of complementary medicine.</p>
	<p pid="a.1280.2/5">The NHS homeopathic hospitals help many patients who have been failed by other parts of the NHS, including those suffering from &quot;effectiveness gap&quot; conditions, complex chronic problems, or conditions difficult to label and for whom conventional medicine has proved ineffective or has associated serious side effects. The treatments they offer are complementary to, and integrated with, conventional medicine. Their practitioners are qualified health professionals working within the NHS and communicating with NHS colleagues. Surveys consistently show that 70 to 80 per cent of patients report benefit and around 90 per cent are satisfied with their treatment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1280.2/6">In the past, Governments have reaffirmed their commitment to homeopathy in the NHS, a commitment made originally by Aneurin Bevan. Now, local NHS commissioning and the financial crisis currently affecting the NHS have placed these unique assets at risk. Decisions to refuse funding, which affect patients' ability to choose their treatments, are being made to satisfy short-term financial needs by NHS commissioners with little understanding of the value the hospitals provide. There is concern that commissioners are encouraged in this by a series of high-profile, hostile leaks to the media. These include a leak of a draft of the Smallwood report by the distinguished economist Christopher Smallwood, who highlighted the potential for complementary therapies to provide cost-effective NHS treatment options, which was commissionedby the Prince's Foundation for Integrated Health.The leak appeared on the front page of the <I>Times</I> on <phrase class="date" code="2005-08-25">25 August 2005</phrase>. There was also a letter attacking complementary medicine, which was sent to chief executives of all primary care trusts and leaked on<phrase class="date" code="2006-05-23">23 May 2006</phrase>&mdash;again, on the front page of the <I>Times</I>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1280.2/7">While the long-term impact will be the irreversible loss of patient choice, which will leave many patients stranded&mdash;in particular, those whom conventional medicine has failed&mdash;the amounts of money involved are tiny. West Kent Primary Care Trust wishes to cancel its contract of &pound;160,000 a year with the homeopathic hospital in Tunbridge Wells. This contract accounts for 50 per cent of the patients seen at Tunbridge Wells and its loss would make the service unviable. Local reaction has been very strong: patients have already delivered a 3,000-signature petition to the primary care trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.1280.2/8">Other homeopathic hospitals are facing similar decisions by PCTs seeking to reduce costs. This is being done in the absence of a cost-benefit analysis. Have the additional costs that will be incurred treating patients elsewhere in the NHS been calculated? Because of the fragmented nature of NHS commissioning arrangements, no one body has oversight of this or of the potential consequences of the irreversible loss of these small, unique units that punch far above their weight in terms of patient care, innovation and research.</p>
	<p pid="a.1280.2/9">I ask the Minister whether Her Majesty's Government are still as committed to the continued success of all four hospitals in England, and, if they are, what measures Ministers propose to protect them. Additionally, I seek an assurance from the Minister, already given to the House by two of his recent predecessors, that patients who have started a course of treatment paid for by the NHS, and which is clinically effective, will not have their funding withdrawn by reason of cost alone.</p>
	<p pid="a.1280.2/10">I hope that the Minister has received a copy of the report, published at the end of last month, entitled <I>Inquiry into the Status of CFS/ME and</I><I>Research into Causes and</I><I>Treatment</I>. A group of MPs and Peers, of whom I am one, led by the Minister's honourable friend Dr Ian Gibson MP, read and heard a great deal of evidence from patients, carers, medical practitioners, researchers and others. We found that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1280.2/11" class="indent">&quot;there exists a serious disease, which causes much suffering for patients, which may be severe and incapacitating and which causes a multitude of symptoms&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1280.2/12">We were concerned at the lack of interest shown in the UK in the very large number of peer-reviewed and published papers by researchers from other countries which demonstrated the organic nature of the illness. Instead, there has been a consistent bias towards the psychosocial/behavioural model of the illness promoted by Professor Simon Wessely and his colleagues. We noted that, while more than &pound;11 million had been spent on psychosocial research in recent years, no funding at all had been awarded to at least 10 proposals for biomedical research. The recommendations of the Chief Medical Officer in his report on this illness published three years ago seem to have been totally ignored by the MRC. As well as calling for much more research into the biomedical aspects of the illness, we recommended,</p>
	<p pid="a.1280.2/13" class="indent">&quot;that this condition be recognised as one which requires an approach as important as heart disease or cancer&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1280.2/14">My main reason for adding this section to my speech today is to draw the Minister's attention to our core findings, but I must also express my concern about a series of documents published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-04">4 October</phrase> this year under the heading <I>Occupational Aspects of the Management of CFS: A National Guideline</I>. The details in these documents are truly worrying. In essence, they pre-empt the NICE guidelines, currently being finalised. They emphasise the psychosocial model and appear to imply that patients or employees should not be allowed to lie in bed at home or to avoid activity and should be persuaded to undertake a programme of graded exercise (GET) and cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT). There seems to be no differentiation between individuals who have symptoms of chronic fatigue associated with clinical depression&mdash;the noble Lord, Lord Layard, mentioned that&mdash;for whom these may be a solution, and those who have CFS/ME as described by the World Health Organisation's ICD-10, G93.3, which the Minister will recognise.</p>
	<p pid="a.1280.2/15">I know that at least four individuals whose writ appears to run through the Department for Work and Pensions and the MoD as well as the Department of Health, and who seem to have a consistent interest in preventing the acceptance of anything but the &quot;it's all in your mind&quot; model, have been involved in the production of the publications. May I ask the Minister how many doctors or other advisers who accept CFS/ME as a biomedical illness were involved, how much did the exercise cost, and what will be the standing of the documents once the NICE guidelines have been published?</p>

	<p pid="a.1325.4/1">My Lords, these regulations will among other things significantly extend the scope of the financial assistance scheme announced in May's White Paper, <I>Security in Retirement: Towards a New Pensions System</I>. This increases the Government's commitment to the FAS to &pound;2.3 billion, and means that the FAS will now help about 40,000 people who have lost significant amounts of occupational pension.</p>
	<p pid="a.1325.4/2">The regulations extend eligibility for the FAS to members of qualifying pension schemes who were within 15 years of their scheme's normal retirement age on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-14">14 May 2004</phrase>. Instead of helping only those who were within three years of normal retirement age, as before, the FAS will now top up to about 80 per cent the pensions of those who were within seven years of normal retirement age on <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-14">14 May 2004</phrase>. Those between seven and 15 years from normal retirement age, who can more reasonably be expected to supplement their retirement income for the rest of their working lives, will be considered for a top-up to about 65 per cent of their expected core pension, and 50 per cent if they are between 12 and 15 years from their normal retirement age.</p>
	<p pid="a.1325.4/3">Much criticism of the FAS has focused on the number of people whom we are currently paying. However, one reason for this is that the FAS payments normally begin at 65, so the vast majority of potentially eligible members have yet to attain this milestone. However, some people can join the FAS before 65, and they are expected to be among the first to benefit from the extended scheme. The terminally ill and survivors of those who would have been eligible under the extended scheme can be paid regardless of their age, and I expect that some widows will become eligible for consideration as soon as these regulations come into force. All being well, I expect we will begin to make payments to widows under these regulations before Christmas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1325.4/4">The amendments we are proposing also bring additional schemes into the FAS. We have been made aware of some pension schemes that are currently excluded from the FAS because their employer has not had a formal UK insolvency event but that are, to all intents and purposes, insolvent. We are determined to ensure that schemes that meet all the rest of the FAS scheme's qualifying criteria are not excluded on a technicality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1325.4/5">This is why these regulations will allow a scheme to qualify for the FAS where an overseas insolvency event substantially corresponds to one that the FAS already accepts in the UK for the purposes of qualification, or where the employer associated with a scheme has liabilities that exceed its assets and cannot pay its debts as they fall, or have fallen, due. In both cases, the scheme manager will need to be satisfied that the relevant employer is unlikely to continue as a going concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.1325.4/6">These amendments demonstrate our desire to define insolvency as widely as possible in order to bring schemes and their members into the FAS. They do not affect our oft-stated belief that ongoing solvent employers remain responsible for making good their pension promises to members. As already touched on, the regulations also introduce a number of amendments linked to the calculation of FAS payments and additional review and appeal rights linked to the determination of terminal illness for FAS purposes. These regulations ensure that the FAS continues to operate effectively and provides assistance to more of those scheme members who face the most significant losses. In my view these regulations are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. I beg to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.1325.4/7">Moved, That the draft regulations laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-15">15 November</phrase> be approved [<I>First Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee</I>].&mdash;(<I>Lord Hunt of Kings Heath</I>.)</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-12-07a.1327.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100597" speakername="Lord Skelmersdale" colon=":" colnum="1327"  time="016:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61207-0012.htm#06120764000164">
	<p pid="a.1327.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for explaining the regulations, which are beneficial to some&mdash;but only some&mdash;of the 125,000 people who, through no fault of their own, had no or little defined benefit occupational pension because their employers' scheme was underfunded when the latter became insolvent or no longer existed over the seven years before the Pension Protection Fund was set up.</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/2">Noble Lords will remember that the financial assistance scheme was not originally in the 2004 Pensions Bill. I must confess that neither I nor the Minister led on that legislation although I did play a minor part. The Bill set up the Pension Protection Fund, but, after intense pressure from the Opposition and their own Back-Benchers, the Government gave in and created a very limited scheme which was to cost &pound;400 million over 20 years. The trustees of the schemes were given a very limited time to apply; namely, between <phrase class="date" code="2005-09-01">1 September 2005</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-28">28 February 2006</phrase>. Beneficiaries were to get financial assistance only if they were within three years of their normal retirement date. We described that as inadequate at the time and it seems that now the Government have finally agreed with us.</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/3">To be fair, and I try to be fair on these occasions, the Government said at the time that they would review the scheme after three years. However, the scheme began operations&mdash;badly, as I shall explain&mdash;only in September last year. My first question is therefore: what brought on the earlier review, resulting in the regulations? Was it the Parliamentary Ombudsman's report on occupational pensions of March 2006, when she criticised the scheme? If so,the regulations are a very partial response. The Government still refuse to do anything about the real substance of her report, which was on the overzealous encouragement that the Government gave to pension schemes. She determined that it amounted to mis-selling.</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/4">In July this year, the scheme faced further criticism for its inadequacy by the PAC, even though a month before, the noble Lord's colleague, the Minister for Pensions, had commissioned a review of the scheme. Almost at the same time as the PAC's report, the Minister revealed the findings of his administrative review, which cited a number of problems and recommended that it be governed from within the Pension Service. The Government have always said that it should operate separately from the Pension Protection Fund. So can the Minister say how and by whom it is administered? Or perhaps the question should be, &quot;will be administered&quot;, especially as under the current scenario &pound;7 million has already been wasted in setting it up, &pound;1.25 million of which was on administrative staff. Some, too, has been given to the 550 successful claimants, but how much? The last figure I have obtained, which I find very difficult to believe, is just under &pound;2 million, which seems far too high for so few recipients. Even if that figure is correct, what was the other &pound;3.75 million spent on? Was it on yet another IT failure?</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/5">As I said, about 125,000 people have lost some or part of their pension. However, as the Minister has just said, even this newly extended scheme is expected to benefit only 45,000 people, and even for them the prognosis is not good. So far, a mere 550 qualifying members have received any money, although under the current scheme about 7,800 people are or will be eligible to receive payments, as the Minister for Pensions explained in another place only a few months ago. In June, he expected that by now 5,000 people would have at least some money. Have they? I am sure that the Minister will be able to elucidate on that when he winds up.</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/6">To sum up, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-22">22 October</phrase>, an article in the <I>Sunday Telegraph</I> stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/7" class="indent">&quot;The Financial Assistance Scheme is a shameful example of political spin. It is based on false figures and has offered the tens of thousands of people who have lost their final-salary pensions little more than false promises and false hopes&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/8">The situation gets worse. In their response to the ombudsman's report, the Government said of the financial assistance scheme:</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/9" class="indent">&quot;Eligibility has now been extended to people within fifteen years of their scheme pension age&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/10">At that point, surely it had not. That is what these regulations do. The response continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/11" class="indent">&quot;This involves tapers from 80 per cent of expected&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/12">I highlight &quot;expected&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/13" class="indent">&quot;pension for those within seven years of their pension age, 65 per cent if between seven and eleven years, and fifty per cent for those between twelve and fifteen years&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/14">as, indeed, the Minister has just told us.</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/15">At the same time, the Government appear to have invented a new concept in pensions&mdash;that of a &quot;core pension&quot;, referred to in paragraph 7.11 of the Explanatory Notes. What is this? Is it higher or lower than expected pension benefits? To make all this even more complicated, the maximum any recipient can expect is 80 per cent of what they thought they would get&mdash;and even that is capped at &pound;12,000. It is so complicated that, at this late hour, I would not be able to take in a verbal explanation. The Minister is probably relieved at my saying that but I would be grateful if he would provide me with a written explanation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/16">However, as I said, these regulations are beneficial to some of the 125,000 unfortunate people involved in this mess&mdash;which has hardly been helped by the Government taking &pound;5 billion a year out of the stock market over the past 10 years. Be that as it may, we welcome several things about these regulations. The first is the fact that an employer's overseas insolvency event should potentially be a qualifying insolvency. Secondly, we welcome the extension of the survivor's eligibility rules. It is certainly right that if a person's dependants were entitled to a pension under his employer's scheme when he died, that should be allowed under the FAS as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/17">I have already mentioned the complications around the extension of liability. Although I agree with the policy, I eagerly await the Minister's response to my dilemma. Interim pensions, too, must be the correct approach.</p>
	<p pid="a.1327.0/18">Finally, I observed that in introducing these regulations in another place yesterday, the Minister began his remarks by wanting to express &quot;yet again&quot; his sympathy for all those who have lost out on their pensions through no fault of their own. What I have never heard from any Minister anywhere is any hint of apology for their part in the worsening situation of pensions in this country. In 10 years under this Government we have moved from the very top of the international league to the bottom, making defined benefit schemes rarer than hens' teeth. It is not a record to be proud of.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-12-07a.1331.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100199" speakername="Lord Evans of Temple Guiting" colon=":" colnum="1331"  time="016:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61207-0012.htm#06120770000067">
	<p pid="a.1331.5/1">My Lords, the Government wish to present the modifications to the definitionof a British film contained in Schedule 1 to the Films Act 1985 made by this draft order. These modifications have come as a result of discussions with the European Commission, and it is essential that they are made to ensure that aid given to film through the new tax reliefs is compatible with European law on state aid. That is the purpose of the order.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.5/2">As we stated in March of this year when the House approved the original cultural test, it remains our aim to promote the sustainable production of culturally British films, ensuring that films continue to playan important role in British life, representing and reflecting British culture in its most diverse sense. To do this, the Chancellor confirmed in yesterday's Pre-Budget Report a generous new tax relief, available to those films certified as British by the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, against the criteria I will outline today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.5/3">The original cultural test, introduced in April 2006, contained three categories for assessing the cultural benefit of a film: the cultural content, hubs and practitioners&mdash;in other words, what the film is about, what facilities were used in making it and the personnel who made it. The revised test we are debating adds a fourth category of cultural contribution. This category ensures that films which contribute to British culture in its widest sense will be able to be awarded points under the test. The revised test also shifts the weighting of the sections towards cultural content, rather than focusing on film-making elements. These modifications will ensure that the aid given is compatible with the rules on state aid. The revised test will not impose any extra burden on the film industry or the Civil Service. In fact, it should be less time-consuming and burdensome for film-makers to complete.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.5/4">The department carried out a full 12-week consultation on the existing cultural test in 2005, and developed and published the guidance on it in response to views expressed in that exercise. In drafting this order to implement the revised cultural test, we consulted with HM Treasury, HM Revenue and Customs and the UK Film Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.5/5">To pass the revised cultural test, a film will require 16 points out of a possible 31. There are four sections to the test. The first section assesses whether the content of the film is British against the following criteria. Up to four points will be awarded depending on how much of the film is set in the UK, or a representation of the UK. Up to four points will be awarded depending on the number of lead characters who are British. Four points will be awarded if the subject matter or the underlying material is British. Finally, up to four points will be awarded depending on how much of the film is in English, or in a recognised regional or minority language.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.5/6">In the second section, up to four points may be awarded in respect of the contribution to British culture made by the film. This section was introduced to give the test flexibility to reward contributions that a film may make by reflecting or representing British culture in its widest sense. This section will assess films under the following three headings: creativity, cultural heritage and cultural diversity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.5/7">Up to three points will be awarded in the third section, cultural hubs, depending on the amount of film-making work that takes place in the UK. Finally, up to eight points will be awarded in the fourth section&mdash;cultural practitioners&mdash;depending on whether the personnel involved in making the film are British nationals or residents, or nationals or residents of the member states of the European Economic Area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.5/8">There is one exception to the 16-point pass mark. Where a film scores all four points for being in English, and all available points in the cultural hubs and cultural practitioners sections&mdash;that is a total of 15 points&mdash;it must then score at least two points in one of the remaining parts of the cultural content section. This exception arose to address the European Commission's concern that a film that achieved these 15 points, which do not reflect the purely cultural content aspects of film-making, could qualify with a minimal amount of British cultural content.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.5/9">Noble Lords will be interested to learn whether some of the most iconic films would have passed such a test. A whole raft of undeniably British films such as the &quot;Charlie and the Chocolate Factory&quot; and &quot;The Constant Gardener&quot; would do so because of their relevance to British culture.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.5/10">We will offer a system of interim approval for films applying under the test. The film industry is particularly keen on this, because it will offer more certainty to film-makers and help them to secure financing for their films. DCMS officials will also offer advice and assistance to film-makers when filling out the application form.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.5/11">The revised test will come into force on <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2007</phrase>. All films which commence principal photography after this date will be required to pass the test to be eligible for new film tax relief. In addition, the Treasury will make regulations under the Finance Act 2006 to provide that any film which commences principal photography before <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January</phrase> and is completed after this date, and passes the revised cultural test, will also be eligible for the new tax relief. I commend the order to the House. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.1333.0/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister for his speedy introduction to the order. I welcome the confirmation in yesterday's Pre-Budget Report of the commencement of the film tax credit on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January</phrase>. I am sure that that will be welcomed by the film industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/2">It has not been an altogether happy situation during the past few years, with one tax relief being terminated two years ago and a new one only now being put into place. We have had considerable uncertainty during that period, partly as a result of delay in agreeing the new culture test with the European Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/3">We know that the test which was originally put forward earlier this year was not acceptable. One of the real issues is defining British culture. I suppose that that has required energy and time. The Minister set out the various categories of the British culture test.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/4">One key concern is the considerable switch that has been made from a number of economic tests towards a more cultural test. The key to the tax credit being proposed by the Government must surely be to ensure a viable, vibrant and creative UK film industry, with facilities being provided in this country. A huge number of companies are affected, as the RIA states, and there is a question whether we may not have swung the balance too far towards a pure cultural test and away from the benefits gained by the previous test.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/5">The impact of the new test is interesting. The cultural content is considerably increased, but the cultural hubs have been reduced to three points in this new system. The location of principal photography, editing and so on has become much less importantin the new test. The weight placed on cultural practitioners&mdash;that is, on the personnel making the film&mdash;is less. Then there is the whole issue of the new cultural contribution, which is included. I am exercised by the fact that the noble Lord, Lord Davies of Oldham, when he introduced the previous order which had the previous British film test in it, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/6" class="indent">&quot;The fact that 15 of the points are allocated to where the film is made is a response to the overwhelming view from consultation respondees that greater weight should be given to this section than to the others, so as to incentivise the use of UK talent and facilities and to build a sustainable British infrastructure for film making. Visual effects, in particular, are eligible for more points, as this is the biggest below-the-line spend for large budget feature films, and the UK's facilities are world leading and need to be incentivised to meet increasing competition from overseas&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 30/3/06;cols. 925-26.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/7">I do not necessarily have the answers to this, but that was a clear statement by the Minister on the benefits of the previous test, which are not included in this test, which is the one that the Government have effectively negotiated with the European Commission. Are we potentially undermining our film industry by giving too much emphasis to the current system&mdash;the current culture points&mdash;and too little to where the film is made? There is also the question of how the new system interacts with the expenditure test and how it will work when the culture test is administered by the DCMS and the expenditure test is carried out by the Treasury. The Explanatory Memorandum tries to reassure us that it will be a seamless process, but could the Minister give some indication as to how it would work?</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/8">Many of those in the industry have welcomed the pre-certification arrangements, which is very helpful, and the post-implementation review will also be welcome. Who will carry that out when the time comes in two years from <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2007</phrase>?</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/9">We are always reasonable when dealing with Brussels and, no doubt, these negotiations have been fairly tough but amicable, but how do our incentives actually compare to those in other EU countries? Did the Government actually undertake a comparative study? The acid test is whether our film industry will be incentivised and supported by the new credits. The Minister mentioned a couple of films that would still go ahead, and it is helpful to get that sort of indication; but in practice it is important to see whether certain films fall into those categories. Will &quot;Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire&quot; or &quot;The English Patient&quot; fall within the culture test? The answer is probably, in the first case and perhaps, in the second case. What about &quot;Death in Venice&quot;? Looking back, the answer to whether that would be included is probably not. This will boil down to what happens in practice, but I very much hope that the Government will carry out their post-implementation review rigorously. I also hope that it is carried out in co-ordination with the film industry, which has a great deal at stake with regard to the new order. These Benches wish it well.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-12-07a.1336.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100848" speakername="Lord Howarth of Newport" colon="" colnum="1336"  time="017:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61207-0013.htm#06120776000003">
	<p pid="a.1336.3/1" pwmotiontext="asked">asked Her Majesty's Government what plans they have to increase support for the conservation of historic places of worship.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/2">The noble Lord said : My Lords:</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/3" class="indent">&quot;Still they stand, the churches of England, their towers grey above billowing globes of elm trees, the red cross of St George flying over their battlements, the duplex envelope system employed for collections, school mistress at the organ, tortoise stove slowly consuming its ration, as the familiar seventeenth century phrases come echoing down arcades of ancient stone&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/4">John Betjeman wrote those words in the introduction to the <I>Collins Guide to the Parish Churches of England and Wales</I> in 1958. In the half-century since then, the elms have gone, and the cross of St George has become more readily associated with the new national religion of football. My right reverend informant tells me that the duplex system has fallen into desuetude. The flat prose of the late 20th century has replaced 17th-century cadences. While the churches of England mainly still stand, between 1970 and 2004 the Church of England closed some 1,630, and 85 listed churches were actually demolished. The churches that continue to stand defy financial gravity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/5">In a predominantly secular age, when innovation is our public watchword, why should it matter to us that our heritage of historic places of worship of all faiths should be conserved? It is a question of respect; another of our watchwords. As Simon Jenkins, the latter-day laureate of churches, wrote in <I>England's Thousand Best Churches</I>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/6" class="indent">&quot;Into these churches Englishmen and women have for centuries poured their faith, joy, sorrow, labour and love ... The church marked each event in life's calendar ... It was a patron of community ceremonial [and] a gallery of vernacular art&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/7">The physical manifestation of the church, more often a cumulative creation than a single expression of architecture and design, with its carving in wood and stone, wall paintings and altarpieces, stained glass, brass and iron work, tiles, embroidery, books, language, its music and bells, its whole ritual and life for centuries has met profound human needs, which we no longer know very well how to meet in communal life. These places remain however, for unbelievers too, landmarks and centres and symbols of communal identity. In 2003, 86 per cent of the population visited a church. Some 24 per cent of city dwellers said that they went into a church to find a place in which to be quiet.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/8">The beauty of this holiness is recorded and exhibited not only in Simon Jenkins's book but in two wonderful volumes published this year. One is <I>A Glimpse of Heaven</I>, with a learned text by Christopher Martin and glorious photographs by Alex Ramsay, which displays a heritage of Roman Catholic churches that has been too little appreciated, not least, as English Heritage acknowledges, in the statutory listing system. In <I>Jewish Heritage in England: An Architectural Guide</I>, Doctor Sharman Kadish documents historic synagogues and Jewish cemeteries. The former Spitalfields Great Synagogue was originally a Huguenot, then a Wesleyan place of worship. It is now the London Jamia mosque. As Doctor Kadish says, it encapsulates on a single site the immigrant history of east London.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/9">There are 16,151 Church of England parish churches in England&mdash;more churches than there are petrol stations, as has been noted by Mr Trevor Cooper, chairman of the council of the Ecclesiological Society. Some 13,000 are listed; 4,000 in grade 1 and another 4,000 in grade 2*. Some 45 per cent of all grade 1 listed buildings are Church of England parish churches. In England, there are 3,465 Catholic parish churches, other churches and chapels, and 625 are listed. There are 5,312 Methodist chapels, of which 541 are listed. There are 1,115 United Reformed churches, of which 290 are listed, and 1,809 Baptist churches, with 283 listed. There are 30 listed synagogues. One purpose-built mosque has been listed. A number of others are in historic buildings already listed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/10">Some &pound;70 million of funding for major repairs to historic places of worship is raised by local congregations. There are 31 county historic churches trusts. The noble Lord, Lord Lloyd-Webber, I hope, will tell us about the Open Churches Trust, which he has founded. A great deal of private generosity and intelligent self-help goes on. For instance, central Norwich, where I live, contains 32 medieval parish churches, which is the largest surviving group in northern Europe. The Norwich Historic Churches Trust, which my noble and special friend Lady Hollis of Heigham was instrumental in establishing, has found innovative uses for 18 redundant churches, including the puppet theatre housed in St James, Whitefriars, and a martial arts centre in St Peter, Parmentergate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/11">Since 2004, the Norwich Heritage Economic and Regeneration Trust, HEART, which has just invited me to serve on its board, has sought to bring together all the churches to explore the advantages of caring for them as a group. Working groups have been set up to bring together the clergy, trusts, the council and others. Funding from the East of England Development Agency has made possible a major study of how the whole set of churches can be made financially sustainable, play their part in the local economy, be educationally inspiring and be fully available to the community and visitors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/12">There are large uncertainties over the future of some churches that are among the most important in the heritage. Of churches illustrated in <I>A Glimpse of Heaven,</I> St Walburge, Preston, a grade 1 listed building and a vast 19th-century church with the tallest spire of any parish church in Britain, is stranded in an area of urban deprivation, while the diocese is having to consider closing churches. The Government have recognised such difficulties and have done much to help. In their response in October to the Select Committee report <I>Protecting and Preserving our Heritage</I>, they stated in terms:</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/13" class="indent">&quot;The Government is committed to keeping the country's historic churches in a good state of repair&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/14">DCMS Ministers need no persuading of the importance of the heritage of historic places of worship. That was made clear in Mr David Lammy's response to the debate in another place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-17">17 May</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/15">Funding from government and lottery sources will total around &pound;60 million this year. The Listed Places Of Worship Grant Scheme, which returns the VAT paid on repairs to listed places of worship, provides an average of &pound;1 million a month. The Chancellor announced in the Budget that the scheme would continue until 2011 and would be extended to cover professional fees and repairs to clocks, pews, bells and organs. The joint repair scheme for places of worship, run by English Heritage and the Heritage Lottery Fund together, has paid more than &pound;90 million since it began. This week, Dame Liz Forgan has announced that the HLF has agreed a dedicated funding programme for places of worship costing some&pound;20 million a year from 2008 to 2013&mdash;a difficult period for the fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/16">Support for appropriate new uses for the redundant places of worship in their care is an important element in the work of the Churches Conservation Trust and the Historic Chapels Trust. The CCT, which receives half of its funds from the DCMS and a quarter from the Church of England, now cares for 338 historic churches of distinction. Five more churches, all listed in grade 1, have been added to the CCT's portfolio in the past year, although the DCMS grant to the trust has remained fixed in cash terms since 2001. Some 206 visits to CCT churches were made in 2005-06 by schools and adult education groups. The Historic Chapels Trust, which has a smaller portfolio of non-conformist chapels, Roman Catholic churches, synagogues and private Anglican chapels, redundant as places of worship but of architectural distinction, received 70 per cent of its funding from English Heritage&mdash;and I look forward to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Shutt of Greetland, who is a trustee of the Historic Chapels Trust.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/17">Many historic places of worship are in good condition, but the burden of repairs on many other churches is heavy. With the need to support the stipends and pensions of the clergy, there is always a temptation for congregations to defer maintenance work and thus store up expensive future trouble. English Heritage considers that many of England's historic places of worship are approaching a critical time in their lives. Current annual spending from all sources on major repairs to historic places of worship stood at around &pound;115 million in 2004, with a further &pound;19 million spent on Church of England cathedrals, where much has been achieved in recent years. But that is not enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/18">The joint English Heritage-Heritage Lottery Fund repair grant scheme receives applications for twice as much as it is able to disburse. English Heritage's fabric needs survey indicates that the cost of the repairsthat ought to be done in the next five years would be &pound;925 million, or &pound;185 million a year. The gap between that &pound;185 million and the total funds raised by congregations and contributed from the lottery and public sources is approximately &pound;82 million. So what is to be done?</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/19">As noble Lords know well, English Heritage has issued call to arms, <I>Inspired!</I>&mdash;a call not only to government but to the denominations and the general public. It is a call to all of us to think afresh about respective responsibilities, ranging from the person of modest means who sweeps the church in the true spirit of George Herbert, to the millionaire who resides in the Old Rectory, who might be a generous donor, but, equally, might assume that the parish church is just part of some eternal dispensation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/20">English Heritage has proposed a fivefold strategy, to be funded by a package of government support costing &pound;8.84 million a year for three years. A one-off sum of &pound;2.52 million would enable English Heritage to rewrite outdated list descriptions for all grade 1 listed places of worship as part of the current reform of heritage protection. The purpose here is to help congregations to understand the value and significance of the historic fabric in their care and so to make better decisions. A sum of &pound;2 million a year for three years would help to build congregations' capacity to manage their repair and adaptation projects. The main element here would be the creation of 15 full-time historic places of worship support officer posts. A sum of &pound;4 million for three years would fund a new maintenance grant programme to help struggling congregations to reduce their major repair bills in the longer term. English Heritage wants to place alongside the English Heritage/HLF grant scheme for major repairs a new small-grant scheme. An extra &pound;4 million for three years would double the number of repair projects supported over the next three years. Finally, English Heritage is asking the Government for some increase in funding for the Churches Conservation Trust and the Historic Chapels Trust as important safety nets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/21">English Heritage is not asking the Government to shoulder all the responsibility and pay for everything. The proposition is that the very modest additional expenditure by the Government of &pound;26.52 million over three years would enable us to move intelligently and decisively in the right direction. This strategy seems to me to be modest but realistic and incontrovertibly worth while.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/22">As Dr Simon Thurley, chief executive of English Heritage, has said,</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/23" class="indent">&quot;the key to long-term security for historic places of worship will be about understanding the nature of the problem properly, tackling it rationally and methodically, yes partly through more money, but also by helping people on the ground to help themselves by offering support and expertise where it is most needed&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/24">As David Lammy said on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-17">17 May</phrase>,</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/25" class="indent">&quot;we need an effective partnership between government, church denominations, heritage specialists and the public&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 17/5/06; col. 301WH.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1336.3/26">I look forward to the Minister explaining to us what the Government consider that should mean.</p>
