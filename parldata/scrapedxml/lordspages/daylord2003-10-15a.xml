	<p pid="a.931.4/1">My Lords, the UN, EU and other donors have made it clear to the Zimbabwean Government that they will not tolerate political interference in the distribution of food aid. The World Food Programme and others distributing international food aid all have monitoring systems in place. Humanitarian support is entering its third year and we remain confident that the systems are in place to ensure that no humanitarian relief provided by the UK and our donor partners can come under ZANU-PF control.</p>

	<p pid="a.931.5/1">My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for that reply, but I confess that I am not entirely reassured. The United Nations estimates that by January of next year, as many as 5.5 million Zimbabweans will be dependent on food distribution. That gives Mr Mugabe and ZANU-PF the opportunity quite literally to hold the nation by its throat. What assurance can the Minister really give us that, compared with the ineffectiveness of sanctions and actions taken to date, real pressure will be brought to bear by Her Majesty's Government and by the international community on Mr Mugabe and his regime?</p>

	<p pid="a.931.6/1">My Lords, there are two parts to the question of the noble Lord. With regard to the second half of the question, which is about wider political pressure, the noble Lord will know that we continue to work within the EU and the Commonwealth and with our partners in the UN and southern Africa to try to bring a resolution to the situation. Some discussions have been ongoing between the Zimbabwean and the South African Governments. I know that there is a great deal of impatience in this House that nothing appears to have been delivered, but we are continuing to make strenuous efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.931.6/2">In response to the noble Lord's first point, perhaps I may try to reassure him that we do have monitoring mechanisms in place. It took the World Food Programme a long time to sign an MoU with the Government of Zimbabwe because they were seeking to take control of food aid and we will continue to be very robust on that.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.932.0/1">My Lords, is my noble friend aware that in July the United Nations launched an appeal for 530 million dollars of humanitarian aid for six southern African countries, much of it for 4 million hungry Zimbabweans? Is she aware that the results so far have been most disappointing and that only about one-fifth of the money has been forthcoming? While I appreciate that Britain has been very generous in feeding Zimbabweans, will her Majesty's Government do their very best to encourage other friendly governments to give money to that UN appeal, thereby averting yet further Zimbabwean tragedy?</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.932.1/1">My Lords, my noble friend is quite right. There is a gap in food aid resources. The WFP pipeline is only 31 per cent resourced. We will be making an additional &pound;5 million available to the WFP next week. Regarding my noble friend's point about putting pressure on other donors, we will continue to work with other donors, but the fact that the Government of Zimbabwe tried to put in place mechanisms that would see them control food aid has meant that other donors are somewhat sceptical.</p>

	<p pid="a.932.2/1">My Lords, the noble Baroness is quite right. There is a great deal of impatience, both in this House and outside. Would she agree that no news from Zimbabwe is not good news and that we are still seeing the unending violations of human rights and the crushing of liberties? The economy is in tatters and people are now living on roots and berries. It has been called &quot;the land of the empty plate&quot;, which is what it has become.</p>
	<p pid="a.932.2/2">Does she recall the Foreign Affairs Select Committee report from another place in May? It made a string of positive recommendations&mdash;there were eight of them&mdash;which sought direct government action of a practical kind now, including the production of a dossier on human rights abuses and a wider examination of the whole food relief distribution system. When will the Government implement any of those eight proposals and possibly relieve some of understandable impatience that we all feel that not enough is being done?</p>

	<p pid="a.932.3/1">My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Howell, is quite right. The situation has not improved and, in some cases, it is getting worse. We have seen the closure of the Daily News and I learnt this morning that the inflation rate has now reached some 450 per cent. The country has run out not just of foreign currency, but also of local currency. One can imagine what effect that is having on the population in Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.932.3/2">On the Foreign Affairs Select Committee report, I gave evidence to that committee myself. I remember the recommendation of a dossier on human rights abuses. I pointed out to the committee that a number of NGOs and other organisations are compiling that information. We should be cautious about who owns that information. The noble Lord will know that the British Government's relationship to the Zimbabwean Government is such that what we say is very often not taken seriously, but the underlying point of making sure that that information is publicly available is absolutely right.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.933.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100029" speakername="Lord Avebury" colon=":" colnum="933"  time="014:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-01.htm#31015-01_spnew6">
	<p pid="a.933.0/1">My Lords, I welcome the contribution from the United Kingdom, announced by the noble Baroness, and the 6 million dollars granted by SIDA, the Swedish agency. Will she agree that the 70 per cent shortfall in the World Food Programme's appeal, which she mentioned, is due to donors' fears that despite the memorandum of understanding, when it comes to the crunch ZANU-PF will find means of diverting aid from the people who need it most? How can assurances be given to donors, other than from the MoU?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.933.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="933"  time="014:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-01.htm#31015-01_spnew7">
	<p pid="a.933.1/1">My Lords, I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that that is exactly the concern of donors. They are also concerned that as there has been no shift in the political situation, the position will not improve. The monitoring mechanisms that the World Food Programme and donors have put in place are robust and we need to persuade our donor colleagues of that.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.933.2/1">My Lords, is it not the case that while the situation in Zimbabwe deteriorates daily, it is important that Members in this House and people elsewhere make it clear that we abhor entirely what ZANU-PF and President Mugabe are doing? Will she undertake to continue the pressure, advice and dialogue especially with President Mbeki of South Africa who still believes that the softly, softly approach will work? Will she tell him that many of us believe that it will not work and that the southern African countries need to be much stronger in their dealings with Zimbabwe?</p>

	<p pid="a.933.3/1">My Lords, I agree with my noble friend that we need to put at the centre of our concerns relieving the suffering of the people of Zimbabwe and that has always driven our policy. With respect to our work with our southern African partners, there have been disagreements about tactics and the best way of taking the position forward. But, ultimately, Zimbabwe's neighbours will make a real difference. I have been assured on many occasions that the conversations that they have in private are most robust.</p>

	<p pid="a.934.2/1">My Lords, the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister has recently commissioned research to evaluate the impact of the changes to Part M of the building regulations, which concerns the accessibility of all new homes and was introduced in 1999. The work is expected to begin before Christmas and to report in about two years' time.</p>

	<p pid="a.934.3/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer and for the positive confirmation that a review of the regulations will be taking place. Will he ensure that in the review consideration is given to the problem of some house builders failing to comply with the regulations, which now stipulate, for example, that all new homes must have level front entrances for the benefit of disabled or elderly people? Will he also in that review look to the future and add a few more measures to those regulations in order to make more homes fully accessible to people with any kind of disability, continuing the good work that was done with their earlier revision?</p>

	<p pid="a.934.4/1">My Lords, we will look further. The review is being undertaken in order to see what has happened to Part M. It concerned only the provision for people to visit new dwelling houses and to use the principal storey. That is not the same as designing a building for lifetime experience. It is true that some of the builders are ignoring it. The public end up subsidising the building industry by way of the disabled facilities grant which last year was &pound;175 million. That is the overall effect. If we can install facilities when homes are built in the first place, we will not only save money but improve people's quality of life.</p>
</speech>

	<p pid="a.934.5/1">My Lords, is the Minister aware of the enormous hidden costs caused by the scarcity of accessible housing? I have in mind the huge additional burdens on care services and the costs in unemployment and loss of employment. Is he aware that that affects not only people who are permanently disabled, but those who are temporarily so&mdash;such as from breaking a leg? I declare an interest on both counts. Have the Government made an assessment of the potential savings of ensuring that lifetime home standards are adhered to in all new housing developments?</p>

	<p pid="a.934.6/1">My Lords, no, not in the way the noble Baroness puts it, but it will be covered by part of our review. The regulations have been in place for four years. There is a cost and there will be others. I am not saying that the &pound;175 million disabled facilities grant will be wiped out completely, but there is a large hidden cost in failing to ensure that our homes are designed properly. Furthermore, there is a good deal of ignorance among house builders about the needs of disabled people.</p>

	<p pid="a.935.0/1">My Lords, will the Minister reassure us on another point? He will know that there is a perception among some builders of a conflict between planning policy guideline 3, which tries to increase density, and Part M of the regulations? Density is also increased in the sustainable communities plan. Will the Minister reassure us that the Government will look seriously at that issue so that many of the homes built under the sustainable communities plan will not ultimately be inaccessible?</p>

	<p pid="a.935.1/1">My Lords, I absolutely refute that building to a higher density means building to a lower quality. That includes the facilities for people with disabilities and Part M.

	<p pid="a.935.2/1">My Lords, how can the Government encourage more flexible lifetime housing, which he mentioned; for example, the kind of houses that are being constructed in The Netherlands? In those, only the outer shell of the house is fixed and the inner walls are easy to move around so that as one goes through the life the house will adapt to suit one's needs rather than the other way around.</p>

	<p pid="a.935.3/1">My Lords, yes, I have heard about some of the work that is going on in The Netherlands. As I say, we will seriously review the regulations because there is a good case for designing properties for lifetime use. That means flexibility. That still means that we are dealing only with new buildings while there are 25 million existing dwellings in the country to deal with. We must not ignore the fact that we shall still have a large programme of adaptations.</p>

	<p pid="a.935.4/1">My Lords, although the Government are to be commended on commencing a review of the regulations in relation to residential housing, the fact is that they have just completed a review of non-residential buildings. I may have a peculiar sense of priorities: while access to non-residential buildings for disabled people is very important, access to residential buildings is absolutely essential, fundamental and vital. Can the Minister explain how the Government managed to get their priorities the wrong way round?</p>

	<p pid="a.935.5/1">My Lords, I do not believe that we did get them the wrong way round. Where practical, all buildings, whether old or new, should be available for use by all citizens, particularly if they are public buildings where access is required by the public. It does not matter what they are for. We have already brought in Part M of the building regulations to deal with that matter. I accept that that happened only in 1999 and that therefore they have been in place for only four years. There is a good deal of ignorance about the regulations, even among some builders and, I regret to say, probably among some architects. I pay tribute to the work of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation in that respect&mdash;it is very important. However, I do not accept what the noble Lord said about our priorities. We are operating on both fronts&mdash;in relation to both domestic dwellings and commercial public buildings.</p>

Is he aware that I am going to dinner tonight in Westminster Gardens and that my block of flats, on one side of the building, is accessible because I live there? However, I am going to dinner on the other side, where there is a four-inch step. It is so easy to install ramps in those buildings. Will he encourage the use of such aids?</p>

He is, indeed, being robust, energetic and vigorous in pursuing these discussions. The noble Lord asked about a process to distinguish between the two cases that he cited. The position regarding the detainees at Guantanamo Bay is virtually unprecedented and very difficult, apart from the obvious parameters of international law and what amounts to a fair trial in international law.</p>
	<p pid="a.937.4/2">The noble Lord goes back to questions raised in your Lordships' House on previous occasions about defining a &quot;terrorist&quot;. I believe we can all readily acknowledge that the types of issue being discussed in relation to the detainees&mdash;not only the British detainees but also all detainees at Guantanamo Bay&mdash;are enormously serious. They relate not only to terrorism but to the activities associated with terrorism. Those issues must be taken seriously, but that point in no way undermines the fundamental point about securing a fair trial.</p>

	<p pid="a.938.5/1">My Lords, the noble Lord was very kind to try to help the House with his examples. But, of course, it was because of those examples and others that I answered the Question of the noble Baroness, his Leader, in the way that I did by saying that the United Kingdom Government do not consider that the current plans will permit fair trials. That is why my noble and learned friend has spent so much time trying to negotiate to a point where a fair trial might be possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.938.5/2">I say to the noble Lord that there is an ambiguity in the noble Baroness's Question because it relates to current plans for judicial procedures. Those current plans might have referred to the initial proposals for the trial but, to a certain extent, they have been superseded by the statement that my noble and learned friend issued on 22nd July, which indicated that he had already made progress in eight important respects. That is not sufficient and therefore my answer to the fundamental point would still have been &quot;no&quot;, otherwise my noble and learned friend would not be pursuing the discussions so vigorously.</p>

	<p pid="a.939.2/1">My Lords, is not the right answer to my noble friend Lord Campbell of Alloway that the American officials have given a new status or label to the prisoners at Guantanamo; namely, that they are not prisoners of war or suspected criminals but illegal combatants? That is the label they thought up to reflect the new nature of the war on terrorism which, as the noble Baroness rightly said, is an &quot;unprecedented&quot; situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.939.2/2">Is not the message that we should be giving to our American friends that this status should be given official form and speedily? While we all accept that lawyers in every country tend to move very slowly, is it not the two years in limbo in which these people have been left which really is intolerable, as the noble Baroness, Lady Williams, said? That must now be ended and the new status defined if we are in a new situation.</p>

	<p pid="a.939.3/1">Yes, my Lords; I have a great deal of sympathy with that view. The question of the legal limbo in which all these detainees have been left was pinpointed by the International Red Cross in its criticisms. The noble Lord talks of a new status. Moving towards an internationally recognised new status would be enormously helped if there were an internationally recognised fair trial that went with such status. It is rather difficult to argue for one without the other.</p>

They are performing well in tackling the targets on crimes of burglary, vehicle crime and robbery. Crucially, we are seeing increased public satisfaction with those forces. We believe we are on the right track and applaud those police officers who are working hard to deliver high quality policing to the people they serve.</p>

	<p pid="a.942.0/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister for that long list of initiatives. Is he aware that only last week Ofsted issued reports on Excellence in Cities, education action zones and the City Learning Centres and found that for all the good they were doing, nevertheless they were not consistently focused on their main objective of improving achievement?</p>
	<p pid="a.942.0/2">Given that the average spend per pupil at a school such as Lillian Bayliss in Lambeth of &pound;4,674 per annum in the past financial year is still only half that of an independent school such as some people think appropriate for their children, does he not consider that there is room for future initiatives?</p>

	<p pid="a.942.1/1">My Lords, the Ofsted report contained some criticism and stated how these programmes could be made more effective. The Government have taken that to heart. However, it also reported on the excellent work that was being done. The noble Baroness referred to the Lillian Bayliss School, which has been in the news in the past few days. She is right; there is an enormous gap between the amount of resources available to the Lillian Bayliss School compared to many schools in the private sector. However, before reference is made to the problems of such a school it should be recognised that in terms of value-added and of improving the educational level of children who come to that school, the school is substantially improving. In all fairness, that should have been recognised.</p>

	<p pid="a.942.2/1">My Lords, does my noble friend not agree that the biggest single factor which would improve conditions in disadvantaged areas is much smaller class sizes? To do that there would need to be more teachers. Can he confirm, as was reported in the Guardian today, that there are thousands fewer teachers now than a year or two ago? As regards the main Question, surely the Government should make financial provision to the appropriate LEAs to employ many more teachers in such areas.</p>

	<p pid="a.942.3/1">My Lords, that is an issue of resources invested in teachers. Let me emphasise that last year the Government put &pound;2.7 million extra into education, and that we have a vastly greater number of teachers&mdash;40,000&mdash;in the state system than we had when we came to office. I might also add that part of the problem schools found last year with regard to funding was because there has been a substantial enhancement of teachers' pay scales, investment in teachers and the quality of teachers. That surely is exactly the right priority to adopt.</p>

Secondly, most of the government amendments moved yesterday were indeed accepted by the whole House, but they had little to do with responding to points made by opposition Members of the Committee. They were mostly additions to the Bill. In response to my noble friend Lord Elton, many of them related to clauses that had received no discussion whatever in another place.</p>

	<p pid="a.946.2/1">My Lords, I fear that if we start comparing the procedural methods of the two Houses, we shall rapidly lose our audience. The noble Baroness well knows that when it is discussing timetabling arrangements, the other place does so with the full involvement of the opposition parties. There are often arguments about the length of time that should be available, but it is then up to the Opposition to decide how they should time their contributions&mdash;frequently to have key debates taking place at key times in the proceedings. But, honestly, we shall become a House of anoraks if we start comparing procedural devices and methods in the two Houses to try to decide which is the best.</p>

In Committee, the Minister, who frequently has to respond to extremely difficult questions, has the advantage, among other things, of having Civil Service support right alongside. If we could avoid the system whereby difficult questions are responded to by people running up and down carrying notes, that would be to the advantage of all of us.</p>

	<p pid="a.948.0/1">Yes, my Lords, it is clearly in everyone's interest that any Bill should be in as good a shape as possible when it is introduced to the House. I do not detract from that for a minute, but any legislative system ought also to be able to deal with issues as and when they arise during what can be a lengthy passage between being introduced to one House and concluded in the other. It is a duty of governments to respond to public need and issues that arise, even when that is during the course of a Bill's passage.</p>
	<p pid="a.948.0/2">Even if it sounds a little immodest, a government who managed in 1997 to be elected with a majority of more than 150 and who managed to repeat that operation in 2001 cannot be entirely out of tune in legislating in a way that is acceptable to the public.</p>

	<p pid="a.948.5/1">I have never had the privilege of moving an amendment twice in one day, but today is the day. I moved the amendment at 1.30 this morning. It is an unusual position. Those who have already caught up with Hansard have given me the benefit of the doubt and told me that they thought I pulled a marvellous coup this morning, and that I carried out some sort of ambush to count the Government out. Would that it were so. I was one of the Front-Bench Members who agreed that we should continue until the amendment had been completed. It had not occurred to me that there were not sufficient Peers in the Committee to see the business through. I thought, therefore, that I had disposed of it in the proper manner last night. I have spoken to the Government this morning, and we hope very briefly to dispose of the matter in very much the proper manner today.</p>
	<p pid="a.948.5/2">The amendment was tabled after we received representation from the Magistrates' Association. It was debated in full earlier this morning, so I will not go into detail, nor will I invite any other Members of the Committee to respond. All that could be said was said earlier today. The clause would quite simply re-establish local consultation between the probation service and magistrates. That statutory consultation was killed off following the introduction of the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2000. The Magistrates' Association made the point that, despite the well-meaning attempts of the Government to provide alternative means of ensuring that there was liaison, that has not worked in its eyes. It wants the re-establishment of statutory provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.948.5/3">In that case, I seek to repeat the same process, but perhaps with a rather different result at this stage. I beg to move.</p>

My honourable friend the Minister responsible for prisons and probation, Paul Goggins, has discussed those issues with the association already.

	<p pid="a.951.1/1">I discovered some time ago on a visit to Northern Ireland that the police there had no powers to arrest disqualified drivers. I found that a most surprising and disturbing bit of information, because there is a high accident rate in Northern Ireland. There are relatively more road deaths in Northern Ireland than here on the mainland. The police in England, Wales and Scotland do have those powers. My amendment would give the police in Northern Ireland the powers to arrest disqualified motorists.</p>
	<p pid="a.951.1/2">From the soundings that I have taken, my proposition is well supported. Indeed, I understand that the police in Northern Ireland would welcome a change in the law giving them more powers. The Government are very sympathetic, as are the opposition parties. The only possible opponents are the disqualified drivers themselves. If ever there were an amendment to the Bill that would command universal assent, I have produced it here and now. The only issue is whether this amendment has been appropriately worded&mdash;I understand the argument about amendments being technically defective.</p>
	<p pid="a.951.1/3">Perhaps the more important argument is whether this Bill is the right vehicle for such an amendment. If there is a different solution I am sure that my noble friend on the Front Bench will indicate what it is. I hope that she will give the proposition and the wish to give the police these powers her full support. It would then be just a matter of whether this Bill or another one is the best place for the provision and how quickly the matter can be resolved. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.952.0/1">I rise to commend the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, on having identified this loophole. He will know from my noble friend Lord Glentoran that we strongly support him and now look to the Government to deal with this problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.952.1/1">I hope that I will be able to give a modicum of pleasure to my noble friend Lord Dubs, and I would like to thank him for bringing the anomaly before the House. The Government are aware of concerns on this matter and fully agree with my noble friend that the police service in Northern Ireland should be provided with the power of arrest without warrant for the offence of driving while disqualified, notwithstanding the displeasure that that will cause disqualified drivers.</p>
	<p pid="a.952.1/2">As my noble friend has already acknowledged, however, the amendment is technically defective. Although the Government agree in principle that this is an oversight in the law of Northern Ireland that must be corrected, we do not believe that the Criminal Justice Bill is the most appropriate vehicle in which to correct it.</p>
	<p pid="a.952.1/3">My right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland is committed to introducing, at the next available legislative opportunity, a provision to give the police the necessary power. With that assurance, I hope that my noble friend will feel content.</p>

	<p pid="a.953.0/1">I thank my noble friend. Of course, I would rather my noble friend had accepted the amendment or said that she would introduce one on Report, but I think that we have the next best thing. I welcome the commitment and hope that it will not be too long before she is successful in seeing such legislation through the House. I am grateful to her for her support and beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.953.3/1">We now turn to terrorism provisions and to the period of time during which the police are able to hold terrorist suspects without charge. Initially, the period that was thought proper for such detention to take place was 48 hours, with a possible extension of two days, following a report for which the noble Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, was responsible. We debated the matter during proceedings for the Terrorism Act 2000, when it was decided that the time could be extended to seven days from four days. Now, only two or three years later, we are told that that is inadequate and that the Government seek to detain suspected terrorists for periods of up to 14 days without charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.953.3/2">In any event, last year, suspects were held for the full seven days on only 16 occasions. We on these Benches would like to know what evidence there is for the necessity to gain further evidence within a matter of days so that such people could be charged. Did the authorities investigating the offences think that seven, eight, nine or 10 days was necessary? Absolutely no evidence has been produced to justify that. It is said that investigations these days must take into account devices of mass destruction&mdash;nuclear, biological and chemical devices&mdash;and that the investigation of computer hard disks takes time. Such things could be part of an investigation that would justify holding people without charge.</p>
	<p pid="a.953.3/3">We should be very wary about holding people for any length of time at all without charging them with a criminal offence. We are prepared to concede that the seven days could be extended to 10 days, but we require justification for the further extension to 14 days. I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.953.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100379" speakername="Lord Lloyd of Berwick" colon=":" colnum="953"  time="015:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-07.htm#31015-07_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.953.4/1">I am glad to follow my former pupil&mdash;a status of which I often remind him. I agree with everything that he said, except that I would go further and say that the clause should not stand part of the Bill. The suggested increase from seven to 10 days suffers from the same vice as the Government's proposal.</p>
	<p pid="a.953.4/2">As the noble Lord said, Clause 284 will extend from seven to 14 days the period during which a terrorist can be held without charge. I will start by thanking the Minister for her great courtesy in writing to me, when she saw the point that I sought to make, and for letting me see the evidence on which the clause was based.</p>
	<p pid="a.953.4/3">The obligation on the police to charge or release a suspect is one of the cornerstones of the liberty of the subject. I hope that that does not sound too pompous. The length of detention has always, necessarily, been a matter of compromise between, on the one hand, the understandable need of the police to gather as much evidence as they can before charging the suspect and, on the other hand, the insistent demands of human rights. I remind the Committee, as I have often done before, that human rights were not invented at the time of the passage of the Human Rights Act 1998; judges have enforced human rights since the beginning of the common law.</p>
	<p pid="a.953.4/4">In 1984, when the Police and Criminal Evidence Act was passed, there was an intense debate in Parliament about the appropriate period of detention. It was eventually settled that the suspect could be detained for 36 hours, with a further extension, if authorised by a magistrate, not exceeding four days in all. That is the maximum currently allowed for even the most serious crimes such as conspiracy to import class A drugs, for example. That crime often involves difficult and detailed inquiries here and abroad.</p>
	<p pid="a.953.4/5">When I wrote my terrorism report in 1996, I received much evidence from the Metropolitan Police, backed up by case studies and detailed figures, that, in terrorist cases, four days were not long enough. The facts and figures that were put before me are set out in paragraph 9.10 of my report. I was persuaded that, in terrorist cases, the existing limit of seven days was justified, even though a period of seven days greatly exceeded the period allowed under the Police and Criminal Evidence Act and, more importantly, the four days allowed under Article 5.3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, as indicated in the case of Brogan. The fact that the period went beyond what was permissible under the convention did not matter. We had already derogated from the convention on the ground that, in Northern Ireland, we were, so it was said, facing a crisis that threatened the life of the nation.</p>
	<p pid="a.953.4/6">When the Terrorism Act 2000 was passed, Parliament accepted that seven days was the correct compromise and ought to be sufficient to enable the police to carry out their inquiries. Now, scarcely three years later, we are asked to double the limit. We should do so only if the Government can make a very good case for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.953.4/7">The extension is justified on three grounds. The first is that police inquiries may involve analysis of chemical substances and that the analysis of such substances takes time. The second is that there is a need to extract information from computers. The third relates to the problem of translation from foreign languages. Those are the three grounds specifically relied on by the Minister in her letter to me dated 23rd July, 2003.</p>
	<p pid="a.953.4/8">There is nothing new in any of those grounds. They all existed in 2000, and they all existed when I wrote my report in 1996. Moreover, there is nothing unique about terrorism in respect of those three grounds. The grounds are common to other crimes and, in particular, to the importation of class A drugs, which, as I said, frequently involves international aspects, including the translation of documents, and the extraction of information from computers. On their own, the three grounds do not justify the increase that we are asked to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.953.4/9">Then, it is said that terrorism is different from other serious crimes. It is, it is said, a &quot;uniquely serious&quot; crime, words that became familiar to us yesterday when we discussed earlier parts of the Bill. I question whether terrorism is, in any real sense, uniquely serious. The harm so far done by terrorism in this country, at any rate, is far less than the harm done by, for example, the spread of class A drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.953.4/10">Will the Minister remind us when the last serious terrorist incident occurred in this country? She will say that terrorist incidents in this country have been so few because of the success of the anti-terrorist squad. I am glad to concede that point, and I have nothing but admiration for David Veness, who helped me greatly when I wrote my report, and for the anti-terrorist squad in general. However, if the Minister says that, so far, the system has worked, she will undermine her main point: if a seven-day limit has been sufficient to keep us safe, why do we suddenly need more time now?</p>
	<p pid="a.953.4/11">The police will always ask for more time. I do not criticise them for that, but they are not the only judges of what is acceptable in a free society. Our job, in Parliament, is to make sure that they are not asking for too much. I have seen the evidence that the police put before the Minister to justify the increase. Obviously, I cannot comment on the extent or detail of the evidence, but I can say that there is nothing new in it and nothing that begins to justify an increase from seven to 14 days or the more modest increase for which the Liberal Democrats ask. I am not persuaded that 10 days is right, and I am even less satisfied by the proposal by the main opposition party that the matter could be resolved by having a sunset clause. Although we are all rightly concerned by the threat of terrorism&mdash;none more so than I&mdash;the liberty of the subject still counts for something.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.955.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100316" speakername="Lord Hunt of Wirral" colon=":" colnum="955"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-07.htm#31015-07_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.955.0/1">I shall speak to Amendment No. 252BA. I share the concerns raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford. I agree with the noble and learned Lord that the number of attacks, fortunately, has been comparatively few. I, too, join the tribute to the outstanding police officer, David Veness. On looking back over terrorist attacks, one must take into account not only the number of attacks but also their severity and their impact. Otherwise, I am very much in agreement with the points raised by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, who rightly referred to this amendment as being the sunset clause.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.0/2">We share the Government's resolve to deal with the threat of terrorism. That is why we do not completely oppose the clause, but it appears to be overtly draconian. I hope that the Minister may give additional information along the lines requested by the noble and learned Lord. It is well recognised that we face a serious terrorist threat. Presumably, that is why the Government are suggesting such an unprecedented period of detention&mdash;namely, keeping a person for 14 days without charge. As has been pointed out, that is a very serious matter indeed.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.0/3">However, as requested by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, the Government should provide examples from past investigations where the police thought that the seven-day rule was not sufficient and that a longer period of detention was necessary to secure evidence and to carry out chemical or biological tests. I believe that the request was made in the other place. As yet, no such information has been forthcoming, but I hope that it will be introduced by the noble Baroness in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.0/4">As we understand it, the statistics in the 10th Annual Report of the Independent Commissioner for Northern Ireland, published in 2003, show that out of a total of 236 suspected terrorists in Northern Ireland, only two were detained for more than five days. That does not demonstrate an urgent need for doubling the detention period without charge from seven to 14 days.</p>
	<p pid="a.955.0/5">Another point is the anxiety that the noble and learned Lord mentioned about evidence and the Human Rights Act. The longer a person is detained, surely, the more worrying the weight and reliability of any evidence obtained from that person. For example, if a confession were to be obtained on the thirteenth day of being held without charge, would that evidence risk being excluded as unsafe? That is why we have proposed a sunset amendment to Clause 284, to which I now speak, which would give the Government three years' grace. That period could be utilised to monitor how effective the power is and whether it is necessary. On that basis, I shall move the amendment at the appropriate time.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.956.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100107" speakername="Lord Carlile of Berriew" colon=":" colnum="956"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-08.htm#31015-08_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.956.0/1">I declare an interest in this matter as the statutory independent reviewer of the Terrorism Act 2000. I believe that it is right never to vote on issues relating to the Terrorism Act and the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001, Part 4. However, before this amendment was laid in another place, I was asked to consider what was proposed and I have spent considerable time doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.0/2">It may be helpful if I give Members of the Committee an insight from my viewpoint as independent reviewer which may inform the debate. Like everyone here who has met him, I, too, have great admiration for Commander David Veness. However, most of the information that I obtained about this has come from others. Although I have spoken to Mr Veness, most of my information has come from officers in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.0/3">I acknowledge the eminence of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, in relation to legislation on terrorism, particularly as, with great respect, I am about to disagree with him. His report of 1996 provided the template&mdash;indeed, most of the detail&mdash;upon which the Terrorism Act 2000 was founded. As the independent reviewer of the Terrorism Act 2000, I have to provide reports on the operation of the Act as a whole. I do so by travelling the country, by reading material that is provided and by speaking to various interest and pressure groups, political parties in Northern Ireland and the police, notably Special Branch. As regards the operation of the whole of the Terrorism Act 2000, my next report will be published around the turn of the year.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.0/4">As my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford, the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, and others said, it is extremely rare for detention without charge of as much as seven days to take place. There are controls upon the exercise of detention for longer periods permitted under existing legislation. I have reviewed those controls. For what it is worth, in my opinion, those controls are exercised very carefully by those in charge of them. Certainly, in the period that I have been the reviewer, I have not received complaints that those controls are being exercised in anything other than a proper way.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.0/5">Therefore, are seven days sufficient for the purpose of the legislation? Is the seven-day period fit for the purpose, having regard to what has been happening in recent times? I say to the noble and learned Lord that there is room for argument. It is justified to say that there has been a change in the character of terrorism. Certainly, there has been a change in the character of the terrorism upon which investigation is strongly focused during the past three years.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.0/6">In summary, the police are involved now in the investigation of terrorism in which the suspects, as compared with the suspects from the island of Ireland, are people about whom we know far less and who are far more difficult to investigate over a short period. There are very few cases in which the seven-day period may not be sufficient. If there are any such cases, they are at the extremely serious end of the spectrum. They are likely to be the most serious cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.0/7">Perhaps I may give the reasons, which are slightly more in number than those described by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, following his review of evidence provided by the Minister and by the Home Office. First&mdash;this is derived from the experience of an operation that was founded in Scotland recently&mdash;it can be the case that a substantial number of suspects have to be interviewed during the course of their detention. If the operation requires very tight security&mdash;many of these operations depend upon intelligence material provided by the intelligence services to the police&mdash;it is absolutely necessary that the loop of knowledge is very small. As a result, it is not possible to have a very large squad of officers involved in arrests and interviewing in such cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.956.0/8">Secondly, in order to identify suspects who have been arrested, it is important to know who they are, where they have come from and what they have been doing recently. If the suspect has lived in the United Kingdom or in the Republic of Ireland, we are bound to know a great deal about that person at the time of their arrest. However, the real experience of the police in relation to recent events is that they have on occasion arrested people about whom they know nothing, not even their names. In some cases, these people entered the United Kingdom illegally and have never come into official contact with any kind of authority. They may have arrived in the back of a lorry, or by some other secret means, and have been dispersed into the community. They first become known at all to the authorities, let alone the police, on their arrest. So it can be a tortuous process involving inquiry across Europe and the rest of the world to find out who they are.</p>

	<p pid="a.958.0/1">Will the noble Lord give way? Would it not be more satisfactory if this matter were reviewed by a judge so that he could give leave for an extended period?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.958.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100107" speakername="Lord Carlile of Berriew" colon=":" colnum="958"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-08.htm#31015-08_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.958.1/1">There are controls of a judicial kind and that does take place. Further, a dedicated group of district judges (criminal) does exactly that. Some months ago I spoke to the district judge in charge of that operation and I am certainly satisfied that they are very rigorous about it. I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, can be reassured on that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.1/2">I turn to the next important issue. An operation was carried out in Scotland called Operation Scotia, which crossed the Border. However, it is a matter of which substantial parts are still sub judice, so it is difficult to talk about it in any detail. The operation resulted in the forensic science procedure in certain premises taking three days&mdash;just the search process, not the analysis. In any case where, for example, the presence of poisonous material is suspected, the police have no option but to exercise the most extreme and&mdash;using the word literally&mdash;minute care in&mdash;I hope that I will be forgiven for the use of a rather ugly word now in common use&mdash;forensicating the premises. Sometimes it is not realistic to interview suspects who were on those premises unless the process of forensication has been completed and without some kind of report being made, even if it is only preliminary, about what has been found.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.1/3">I turn to the question of interpretation facilities. The police have had difficulties with interpretation in some parts of the country&mdash;not by any means are all terrorist suspects found in London. In certain areas it can be extremely difficult to locate enough interpreters with the skill and the time to play their full part in the interview process, bearing in mind that the defence lawyers also need to use interpreters. Those people must be drawn from a small pool and great skill is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.1/4">We have already heard mention of computer hard drives. Anyone involved in criminal cases concerning matters such as fraud, for example, knows how difficult it is to find experts who are not already fully occupied to analyse computer hard drives. It can take a long time.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.1/5">Time must be made available for legal advice. In many of these cases, it so happens that a very small number of legal firms advise most of the suspects. Those lawyers have to be given time to do so, including making an allowance for interpretation as already mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.1/6">There are the personal needs of the suspects to consider. Many of those arrested recently are Muslims. Their prayer rights and wishes have to be and are respected, as are their meal arrangements. They must also be allowed sufficient visits by their families as well as their lawyers. All this takes a considerable amount of time.</p>

	<p pid="a.959.0/1">I am most grateful to the noble Lord for giving way. He has listed a number of points, all of which would apply equally to other forms of crime, in particular to the importation of serious drugs.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.959.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100107" speakername="Lord Carlile of Berriew" colon=":" colnum="959"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-08.htm#31015-08_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.959.1/1">With great respect to the noble and learned Lord, cases involving the importation of class A drugs very rarely involve people of the kind I have described; that is, those who have never been identified, who have extreme language difficulties of the kind already mentioned and with the forensication requirements which may involve public safety issues of an immediate kind.</p>
	<p pid="a.959.1/2">Where the noble and learned Lord and I would probably have to disagree about this matter is that I would say that there are special features here. I do not refer only to the trauma of a potential terrorist act, but to the special features of the arrest situation which mark out serious suspected terrorist offences from other forms of crime, including international dealing in class A drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.959.1/3">The final matter I wish to mention&mdash;it is the eighth point&mdash;is one which leads me to the conclusion that this proposed measure ought to be available. We hope that the police would carry out very carefully collated and thought-out interviews in cases of this kind. They will be given only one chance and it is in the interests of both the public and the defendants, if they become defendants, that the interviews should be well researched and conducted in a proper way, without undue prolixity. Having spoken to many police officers about this, my view is that there will be cases where the issue of interviews, taken in conjunction with the other points I have mentioned, means that&mdash;only occasionally, but in very important cases&mdash;seven days may not provide enough time.</p>
	<p pid="a.959.1/4">Reluctantly, therefore, and on balance, on the grounds that the protections which are already in place do work to protect the interests of suspects, the advice I would give in this debate is that this power is appropriate, although it will probably be used only on extremely rare occasions.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.960.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100131" speakername="Lord Clinton-Davis" colon=":" colnum="960"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-09.htm#31015-09_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.960.0/1">I come back to the point which I raised in my intervention. It is highly dangerous for the extension to 14 days to be exercised without judicial approval, which would have to be very specific. I noticed that, in the course of his remarks, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, did not refer to this.</p>
	<p pid="a.960.0/2">I pay tribute to the noble Lord's work and I think that it is invaluable. However, we have to be conscious of the rights of ordinary people&mdash;which includes terrorists. We may not like them, but so far as the law is concerned, they are entitled to protection. I think, therefore, that the burden of proof for which this extension is being sought should rest firmly on my noble friend. There can be no equivocation about that; it is a very serious matter indeed. For all I know, my noble friend may be able to convince the Committee that an extension of this kind is required, but I would be surprised if she were able to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.960.0/3">The noble Lord also said something about a change in the character of terrorism. He may be right about that, but in my view we should be very slow to dismiss altogether the claims of those who purport to present a view about civil rights, which is most important. All I ask is that this issue should be considered impartially&mdash;perhaps in secret, I do not know&mdash;by a judge. The trouble I see ahead is that, slowly but surely, a rule will develop to the effect that prospective defendants on this kind of charge will be held for 14 days willy-nilly, and it will not matter whether it is justified; that will be the case. Have defending lawyers and defendants asked for a change of this kind to be made?</p>
	<p pid="a.960.0/4">In my view&mdash;I may be wrong&mdash;the burden of proof cannot be properly discharged in such circumstances. The gravamen of the noble Lord's intervention is that the change foreseen in this proposal is justified, but nothing that he said in his powerful speech would enable the Committee to come to that conclusion.</p>

	<p pid="a.960.1/1">Like the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, perhaps I may express my concerns. I support what the noble and learned Lord said about the obligation to charge or release being the cornerstone of the liberty of the subject, although he said it with some hesitation and apologised that it might sound pompous. Let me say immediately that there is absolutely nothing pompous or wrong in reminding the Chamber, and the nation, of the importance of liberty and how easy it is to cede its precious principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.960.1/2">In saying that, I am not suggesting for a moment that we roll over in the face of terrorism. The work carried out by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, in relation to this subject was crucial and he has incredible experience of the balancing that has to take place. The problem with the trade-off between civil liberties and security, which we all entertain when referring to terrorism, is that we always imagine that it is not us who will be making the trade. We always believe that someone else's liberty will be affected when in fact liberty cannot be separated out in that way. In the end, the &quot;them&quot; always means us. It is our liberty inside our system that is affected. It is important that we hold on to that idea because it is those precious principles of our democracy that terrorism assaults. So let there be no apologies for explaining why this matters and why this subject is so important.</p>
	<p pid="a.960.1/3">I am concerned, however, that this seems very much like an administrative convenience. When investigating crime, it is always difficult to get things done within the set parameters. So you always think that if you were given more time, that would be the answer to the problem. It is in that way that a kind of &quot;creep&quot; takes place which erodes liberty.</p>
	<p pid="a.960.1/4">I should say to my friend and colleague at the Bar, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, that when you spend too much time with people on the investigative side you hear only about the problems they feel they are facing&mdash;how they would like more time; how they would like to have interpreters at the ready; how they would like more computer experts, and so on. But, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, said, none of these problems are new. They are not very different from what they were three years ago when the Terrorism Act 2000 was enacted, and they are not very different from those experienced in the many terrorism cases in which I have been involved, which now run into double figures. Not all of them were to do with Ireland. Many cases involved people who had language difficulties&mdash;they were from the Middle East and from the Indian sub-continent&mdash;and they needed interpreters, and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.960.1/5">By enlarging the amount of time in which people are kept in custody&mdash;people who are in fear; people who know the seriousness of what is being alleged against them&mdash;we run the risk that people may end up making confessions against their own interests and which may lead to miscarriages of justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.960.1/6">This brings me back to the principle that liberty matters. We do not want people kept in custody without good reason. They should be brought before the courts and charged at the earliest possible opportunity. Fourteen days is too long. Nothing has changed to justify such an extension.</p>
	<p pid="a.960.1/7">My noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis inquired whether anyone had spoken about this to anyone on the defence side. I can assure him that the answer will be in the negative because, if anyone had inquired, they would have been told that this is an outrage. We should remind ourselves of why protecting liberty is so important. We need better justification for this incredible change than we have heard so far.</p>

	<p pid="a.961.0/1">I agree with my noble friend Lady Kennedy of The Shaws and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, that liberty is the cornerstone of our democracy&mdash;but liberty for all, not only for those who wish to perpetrate crimes of terror against us. It is a question of balance. We have to balance the liberty of those being investigated with the liberty of those who will be the subject of terror. It is a difficult balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.961.0/2">I part company with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, when he says that there is no distinction between terrorism and drug trafficking; that there is nothing unique about it. I do not share his view for the following reasons. I absolutely accept that trafficking in class A drugs is pernicious; I absolutely accept that it visits terror of a long and enduring nature upon those who take and abuse drugs. But there is a significant difference. Those who take drugs have an element of choice. Sometimes they are vulnerable and pressured, but they can choose to take the drug or to say no. There is no element of choice when it comes to terror. Terror is visited upon us whether we like it or not. There is no consent; there is no agreement; and there is nothing that those who are subjected to terror can do to avoid it. No one asks our permission; no one asks for our consent. So while I accept what the noble and learned Lord says in relation to investigation, we should be frank in accepting the nature of terror.</p>
	<p pid="a.961.0/3">We also need to accept that things have changed. We may not like the fact that things have changed, but they really have changed. Why? Because in the past those involved in nefarious practices&mdash;if I may speak colloquially&mdash;usually had form. What happens now? More and more of the people who engage in terror appear to have no record of involvement in crime, as the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, said.</p>
	<p pid="a.961.0/4">Tragically, there is a new feature: those who perpetrate terror have no feeling of self, and dying is not an issue for many of them. That is a tragedy because previously we could rely on the fact that most bombers who perpetrated offences&mdash;I refer to the terror visited on us by the Real IRA and others in the terrible bombings to which we were subjected&mdash;wished to escape; they did not wish to be subject to the death they visited on others. Tragically for us, that situation has changed and we are living in a new environment where the risks to our people are more acute than ever before.</p>
	<p pid="a.961.0/5">How do we respond? I take up the point made by my noble friend Lord Clinton-Davis in relation to the courts. What will be the courts involvement? Let me put it into context, although I know that not all Members of the Committee are totally familiar with the provisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.961.0/6">Clause 284 amends Part 3 of Schedule 8 to the Terrorism Act 2000 which governs the detention of persons detained under Section 41 of that Act. Section 41 gives a constable the power to arrest a person without a warrant whom he reasonably suspects to be a terrorist. An individual detained under Section 41 may only be held by the police for a maximum of 48 hours unless an application has been made asking a court to issue or extend a warrant of further detention. I echo what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew&mdash;the judges who are tasked with performing this function are rigorous in the way in which they apply it.</p>
	<p pid="a.961.0/7">Under Schedule 8 as it stands, a court may extend the period of detention for up to seven days if the conditions set out in the legislation are met. Clause 284 will allow such detention to be incrementally extended by the court for up to 14 days. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, who said that this will be used sparingly and not frequently. But there appears to be a need to use it.</p>
	<p pid="a.961.0/8">These provisions come to us from the police and are considered to be essential to them. I add my voice to those of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, the noble Lords, Lord Hunt and Lord Carlisle, and others who have rightly complimented Commander David Veness on his work and the work done by all those officers who have been so successful in trying to keep us safe in recent days. I add my voice because the police are simply asking for unmerited extensions&mdash;they have persuaded us that these extensions count.</p>

	<p pid="a.963.0/1">The Committee will be very grateful to the Minister for explaining the way in which this works.

	<p pid="a.963.1/1">I can certainly undertake to write to noble Lords about that matter. The pressure that the seven days has caused on certain of the more sensitive operations has been understood by the judiciary who have had to deal with these matters. On the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, I do not think we have ever had any dissociation from their understanding about how difficult this is and the benefits that there may be from extensions. If we have had any formal consultation with them, I will certainly write to the noble and learned Lord to indicate that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.963.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="963"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-10.htm#31015-10_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.963.5/1">It is difficult for me to answer because I believe that there may already have been such a dialogue. The noble Lord will know that a very limited number of judges deal with these matters; they are intensely involved in the way in which we develop these issues. I am quite confident that if the judiciary, seized of this matter, felt that it was unnecessary and we were quite happily dealing with matters within the ambit of that which we had, they would have told us about that very forcefully. But I am very happy to check it and to have some confirmation, and I am sure that if the officials in the Box have such information, I will probably have it by the time I sit down because I have a feeling I will be here for a while. Well, I am told that they have not had specific conversations but they will certainly do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.963.5/2">It follows that for some limited and very specific circumstances under which the current seven days may be insufficient to enable the police fully to investigate the offences in respect of which the individuals have been detained, the proportion of cases to which this applies is small but significant. I obviously cannot go into individual cases or give any information that might be useful to those to whom the legislation might apply, but I am able to say that of the 212 persons detained from 1st January 2002 to 31st March 2003, 16 cases went into the sixth day as a result of extensions.</p>
	<p pid="a.963.5/3">I will also give examples of the types of circumstances which might lead the police to need more time. While I cannot refer to actual operations, the examples I am about to give are not hypothetical but are extrapolated from actual occurrences. I hope that noble Lords will understand that I cannot identify them more specifically than that.</p>
	<p pid="a.963.5/4">Increasingly frequently, there may be occasions when it is necessary to examine substances that are thought to be dangerous&mdash;all the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, bite on these matters&mdash;which are found on or with the detained individuals, to establish whether they are chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear materials. Such substances have to be retrieved in accordance with forensic procedures. Moreover, very detailed health and safety provisions exist to protect the experts doing that work. This is a time-consuming process which needs to be carried out with painstaking attention to clinical procedures and often in stages, with one stage needing to be complete before the subsequent stage can be started. In one significant case, it has even been necessary to bring equipment from the United States to perform the analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.963.5/5">A further layer of complexity that technological development has added is that investigations increasingly involve the requisition and analysis of hard drives of PCs and the subsequent search of suspects' work or home premises after an arrest has been made. It is therefore a matter of days, not hours, before any material from a hard drive is available to be used in the questioning of a suspect. This can be further exacerbated when the hard drives or PCs obtained from a number of individuals have to be cross-referenced to each other to establish patterns of communication and even movement.</p>
	<p pid="a.963.5/6">There is another difficulty in investigating terrorism. When one is undertaking a sting, if I may call it that, in relation to drugs operations, usually it is possible to do much of the preparatory investigative work before one goes in to arrest. Quite often in terrorism cases, one simply does not have that luxury. So the level of preparation on cases can vary because things can turn very quickly. You find yourself having to investigate an issue earlier than you would otherwise have preferred. I regret to tell noble Lords that terrorists are not very compliant with one's timetabling.</p>
	<p pid="a.963.5/7">A similar situation arises with mobile phone use and the swapping techniques of whole phones and phone parts, such as SIM cards, designed to make it more difficult for the police to track the owner and the pattern of use. Establishment of identity, as the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, mentioned, is increasingly a feature of re-questioning and pre-questioning activity with the police, often having to work through the use of false identities or multiple false identities. The unravelling of the false identities involves extensive national and frequently international inquiries and cross-checking. It would be unusual to reach a successful outcome easily and speedily. The same applies to bank accounts, for which up to five individuals have used the same identity to access and move funds. For the analysis of documents and possibly video material found on premises, and in the questioning of suspects, translators and interpreters frequently need to be used, possibly for rather remote languages. Those persons have to be used for interviews at all stages during the period of detention.</p>
	<p pid="a.963.5/8">Moreover, and I believe significantly, it is unusual for there to be only one set of the above or similar circumstances contributing to delay in the investigation. More frequently, there is a combination of factors, each of which involve detailed and time-consuming but vital research, which impacts on the time available to the police for questioning.</p>
	<p pid="a.963.5/9">The modus operandi available to terrorists is clearly growing in sophistication and breadth. In such combined cases as I have mentioned, the police investigation will need to be correspondingly more sophisticated in order to analyse and cross-reference the available evidence. That is what creates a different investigative playing field and justifies the need for allowing the police an extended period to put the information together.</p>
	<p pid="a.963.5/10">However, I hope that the Committee understands that it is not proposed that the court be given a power to issue a warrant authorising 14 days' detention on the first occasion that a warrant for detention is sought. On the contrary, there is a significant number of safeguards within Schedule 8 that will continue to apply, and we have built further safeguard provisions into the amendment. Thus a court will be able to extend the period in the warrant for more than seven days only if the warrant already authorises detention for the maximum seven days currently permitted.</p>
	<p pid="a.963.5/11">The provision will be incremental, and it is perfectly possible for the court to say, &quot;I will give you 48 hours, but on this investigation I am not going to give you any further extension&quot;. So the court will have the control that it needs to supervise and incentivise&mdash;a horrible word that is used more and more&mdash;the people undertaking the investigation to go as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.963.5/12">I wish to emphasise the fact that there is a real imperative in undertaking such investigations to work as speedily as possible. Once the perpetrators are aware that one of their number has been identified, the evidence will evaporate quickly. The important thing is to have the scope; everyone knows that time is absolutely the essence in such cases. I know that there are those who will say, &quot;You don't need it&quot;, but the tragedy is that we do. There are cases in which, even if we work as fast as we can, we may not be able, tragically, to stop them. We have had examples of that in our history.</p>
	<p pid="a.963.5/13">Schedule 8 has a brake, which can be applied by the court. The court will be able to extend the period in the warrant for more than seven days only if the warrant has already been authorised. The police can detain for 48 hours; if the conditions of the investigation meet the criteria stipulated in the Act, the police may apply to a court for an extension of that 48 hours. The maximum that the court could allow at that point is five days, in theory. Usual practice is for the court to grant smaller extensions of 24 hours or 48 hours and for the police to have to return to the court to request and justify further extensions. Only if the police had already obtained a warrant extending detention to the full seven days would they be able to make a further request under the provisions in the amendment to go into the post-seven-day period.</p>
	<p pid="a.963.5/14">The application and use of the power in Clause 284 will be subject to annual review by the independent reviewer of the Terrorism Act 2000; that is, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile of Berriew, who has spoken in the debate and has been fully briefed on the formulation of the amendment and the reasons for it. I am grateful to him for having participated.</p>
	<p pid="a.963.5/15">Noble Lords will have to make a balanced judgment. Detaining people, whatever they are suspected of, is, as my noble friend Lady Kennedy of The Shaws and the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd, said, a very serious matter for any democracy. It is right that such a measure should receive very careful scrutiny. However, it is for noble Lords to judge whether on balance the limitation of liberty being proposed is proportionate and justified in a very small number of cases, in relation to the potential damage that the actions of suspected terrorists would have on society.</p>
	<p pid="a.963.5/16">The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, asked about the most recent incidents&mdash;the terrorist attacks by the Real IRA, which are well known to us all and which caused a huge amount of mayhem, disruption and distress in our country. We can rejoice that the same officers who seek a greater extension have been able to keep us safe so far. However, it would be foolish for me not to emphasise to the Chamber how difficult that has been. There have been occasions when, had there been more opportunity to investigate matters, we might have been able to do that which we eventually did more quickly, limiting the risk to which we put our nation. It will be no comfort, if we have a slip between cup and lip, to be told that the consequences of that slip could be justified to the people subjected to it by virtue of the fact that there is no difference between terror and drug trafficking.</p>

	<p pid="a.967.0/1">Our amendment, Amendment No. 230B, which aimed at a compromise period for the length of a detention, is clearly weak and inadequate. In the light of the debate that we have heard this afternoon with my friends and colleagues, not to mention tutors, it is clear to me that there is no basis in principle for the compromise that our amendment contains. Therefore, I do not propose to press it.</p>
	<p pid="a.967.0/2">The noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, pointed to the clash between civil liberties and the security and safety of the state. If a defendant is kept without charge for an undue time, civil liberties are clearly violated. I admire the statements of principle made by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Lloyd of Berwick, and the noble Baroness. On the other hand, a lengthy investigation and interrogation before charge, about which my noble friend Lord Carlile of Berriew spoke, may be necessary for security. How does one achieve the balance?</p>
	<p pid="a.967.0/3">The noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis, pointed us in the right direction when he emphasised the necessity to consider the degree of judicial control. It is in the intensity of judicial control where an investigation takes place over a lengthy period. It is in that where we may ultimately find a solution and safeguard. Because of the noble Lord's intervention, I was delighted to hear from the Minister that she proposes to have a formal consultation with the district judges, who exercise that control at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.967.0/4">By Report stage&mdash;the matter will certainly be returned to on Report&mdash;I should like to have light thrown on the problem from that quarter. I should like to know how often the suspect is seen. Is there only an application made to a judge, who takes no further interest in the welfare of the person detained after that application has been made? To what degree are the suspect's physical and psychological health supervised? What reports are brought back to the judicial authority on the progress of the investigation?</p>
	<p pid="a.967.0/5">I do not accept some of the justifications for the Government's position. In my experience&mdash;in the cases that I have dealt with&mdash;it is quite impossible to analyse a hard disk within 14 days of seizure. I do not think that a period of seven, 14 or 21 days would make much difference at all in that regard.</p>
	<p pid="a.967.0/6">However, I take heart from the statistics that the noble Baroness gave; namely, that in the past 15 months or so for which figures are available, only 16 out of 212 suspects were held into the sixth day. Therefore, it does not appear at the moment to be a huge problem which is preventing the proper investigation of these cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.967.0/7">I have already thrown a huge amount of cold water on my own amendment and the Committee will not be surprised if I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.969.0/1">The amendment is widely welcomed but remarkably late. It might assist the Committee if the noble Baroness explained why it has taken so long to bring forward this amendment and its accompanying consequentials. I have in mind particularly the exchange that occurred in the other place on 20th May when Mr Blunkett appeared to be unaware that an undertaking had been given to amend the Bill in the way described by the noble Baroness. An undertaking had been sought in particular by my honourable friends in the other place, including the Member for Faversham and Mid Kent. He agreed to withdraw his Private Member's Bill in return for an undertaking that was given by the Minister for Rural Affairs and Urban Quality of Life on 21st March. On 20th May the Home Secretary appeared to be unaware of that undertaking, but promised that effect would be given to it as quickly as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.969.0/2">I do not seek to make much of that except to say that there have been a number of other instances where Ministers have made promises to bring forward amendments and changes to this Bill but, in some cases, we still await those amendments and changes. I hope that the noble Baroness will be able to secure a system within the Home Office whereby every pledge and every promise that is made by a Minister, in particular by the Home Secretary, is carefully recorded and implemented as soon as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.969.0/3">I suppose that I take rather an old-fashioned view of Report stage in that I believe that it is the stage when a Bill is reported to this place with or without amendments. It is not the stage at which completely new amendments should be introduced. I very much hope that the noble Baroness agrees with me. In the circumstance that we still await certain amendments, I have a distinct foreboding that we shall see a number of government amendments on Report and, indeed, at Third Reading. That would echo the very effective intervention of the noble Countess, Lady Mar, earlier today when she said that Bills must receive greater scrutiny before they are introduced and that pledges and commitments that are given should be very carefully thought through and introduced at a much earlier stage. But having said all that, I warmly welcome the introduction of these measures.</p>

	<p pid="a.969.1/1">Although I support what my noble friend Lord Hunt said, I feel bound to add that it seems to me very extraordinary that we should have the proposed new clause at all. Subsection (1) of Clause 306 points out very clearly:</p>
	<p pid="a.969.1/2" class="indent">&quot;Subject to the following provisions of this section, this Act extends to England and Wales only&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.969.1/3">The Bill is concerned with criminal justice in a broad sense. However, for us to add the rare application of some &quot;regulations implementing Community legislation&quot; simply on endangered species seems to me to be right outside the themes of this Bill. One could imagine other occasions when the measure might be implemented. Indeed, it would not surprise me if it were technically feasible to do so by regulation instead of by amending the statute. The Bill is so lengthy anyway. I wonder whether the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, would be so good as to consider whether it would be better not to add this minor addition to the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.970.0/1">As the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, said, the amendment is widely welcomed. It was brought forward by the Government in response to an amendment tabled in the other place. The Government gave an undertaking to do that as swiftly as possible. The Committee will be aware of the arrangements in the other place in relation to tabling amendments. The amendments were not tabled in the other place because some key policy provisions, such as sentencing principles for murder, were brought into the Bill on Report in the Commons. The Government said then that they would table these amendments in the Lords. They have been tabled as quickly as was reasonably practicable.</p>
	<p pid="a.970.0/2">I know that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, would wish the Government to continue to consider very carefully each and every suggestion made by Her Majesty's loyal Opposition together with the other parties before considering the final position at which they rest. We have done that and we have responded. I had hoped in moving the amendment to give the Committee a little pleasure and respite. I apologise if that is not the case. I reassure the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that there is indeed a system in the Home Office whereby commitments made by Ministers are monitored. In each and every Bill to which I have been party we have without exception tried to honour those matters.</p>

	<p pid="a.970.3/1">The amendment is tabled in my name and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker. It calls for joint liability for harming children. It is a very important amendment to which I hope the Government will respond favourably.</p>
	<p pid="a.970.3/2">Proposed new subsection (1) defines the problem and proposes that there be joint liability when more than one person might be involved in an offence of failing to protect a child. It also imposes a maximum sentence of 14 years. Proposed new subsection (2) defines serious harm. Proposed new subsection (3) identifies a positive defence, and proposed new subsection (4) clarifies that a judge should not take any decision, whether or not there is a case for the defendant to answer, before the end of the defence case.</p>
	<p pid="a.970.3/3">I move the amendment with some trepidation as a layperson and having had nothing to do with the law in the past. However, I am concerned that there should be a change to our criminal proceedings, to ensure that those who harm children cannot use a loophole in the law that prevents them being prosecuted. I appreciate that the amendment deals with an extremely complex and difficult aspect of the law, which is presumably why action has not already been taken. It is purely a probing amendment at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.970.3/4">During the debate in the other place, my right honourable friend Hilary Benn identified that:</p>
	<p pid="a.970.3/5" class="indent">&quot;It is wholly wrong that those who abuse children, and particularly those implicated in their killing, should be able to play the system and get away with such crimes simply because it cannot be established beyond reasonable doubt which part each individual played&quot;.&mdash;[Official Report, Commons Standing Committee B, 4/3/03; col. 1268].</p>
	<p pid="a.970.3/6">I am very pleased that the Law Commission's report last month said exactly the same thing&mdash;that there was a need to change the law. It said that it was time to stop parents who killed children getting away with murder.</p>
	<p pid="a.970.3/7">That report arose from a joint working group with the NSPCC chaired by Judge Isobel Plumstead. I make no apology for going into some detail on the findings of that working group, because they need to be placed on record.</p>
	<p pid="a.970.3/8">Research evidence from 43 police forces throughout England and Wales showed that, during the three years covered by the survey, no fewer than three children a week under 10 years old were killed or suffered serious injury by suffocation or violence. Of those children, a little more than half were under six months old, and 83 per cent were under two years old. Shockingly, 61 per cent of investigations that reached a conclusion resulted in no prosecution. Of the 27 per cent of cases that resulted in a conviction, only a small proportion led to conviction for either homicide or causing grievous bodily harm.</p>
	<p pid="a.970.3/9">Of 366 cases of death or serious injury to children analysed by the NSPCC, 99 cases resulted in a conviction, 21 in acquittal and 21 in the case being dismissed. No further action was taken in 225 cases. They were not even brought to court. That only slightly more than a quarter of those terrible cases resulted in a successful prosecution is a real indictment of our legal system.</p>
	<p pid="a.970.3/10">The report of the working group identifies the present difficulties in getting a prosecution&mdash;that the fatal injury may have been suffered when the child is in the care of both his or her parents, one parent and a new partner, relatives, foster carers or adoptive parents. The child is unable to tell. Even when an assault is not fatal, an infant or very young child is unable to say who caused the harm. Nor are the carers compelled to account for the period when the injury was inflicted. When interviewed by the police, they can make no reply, not say who did something or blame each other. Article 6(1) of the European Convention on Human Rights has strengthened the common law privilege against self-incrimination.</p>
	<p pid="a.970.3/11">The position is further exacerbated by the 1987 Lane v Lane case, when the Court of Appeal ruled that in the absence of evidence that indicated which of the two parents had inflicted the assault that led to the child's death, or of evidence that they had acted in concert to assault the child, neither parent could be convicted of murder or manslaughter. In some circumstances, however, there might be a conviction for cruelty or neglect to a child. The consequence is that the Crown can show only that the child was seriously injured or killed when A and B were present. It cannot show that A and B acted together. It cannot determine who was responsible. At the same time, it has to ensure that the person who was not responsible is acquitted. As a result, no conviction follows.</p>
	<p pid="a.970.3/12">Many cases illustrate the effect of the Lane v Lane judgment, and I shall briefly cite three. In Aston v Mason in 1991, both carers were prosecuted for the murder of a 16 month-old child. There was a conviction for manslaughter at trial, but that was quashed because there was no clear evidence of which parent was present when the fatal injury was inflicted. Applying Lane v Lane, that meant that there was no case to answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.970.3/13">In Strudwick v Merry in 1994, both parents were convicted of manslaughter but the convictions were quashed. However, the Court of Appeal upheld convictions in that case for long-term cruelty based on other evidence, but the parents evaded conviction on the more serious offence. More recently, in S v C an 18 month-old child suffered a series of assaults over three months and a number of serious and horrifying injuries during a period of 19 hours. Convictions at trial for grievous bodily harm and child cruelty were quashed by applying Lane v Lane. Those cases clearly establish that a conviction for murder, manslaughter, wounding or assault is currently impossible if the prosecution cannot establish which of the child's parents was present when the injuries were inflicted.</p>
	<p pid="a.970.3/14">It might be argued that a higher sentence, as in the amendment, will not act as a deterrent. That is an imponderable. However, it is important for society to send the message that people who commit such crimes must be detected and will face severe penalty if convicted.</p>

	<p pid="a.973.1/1">Actually, I do not. Part of the reason is that I am not certain whether I have the wording of the amendment absolutely correct. I am really trying to establish the principle behind what change is necessary. If there is advice that the wording is not correct, I am happy to take it.</p>
	<p pid="a.973.1/2">My final point is about the clear cross-reference between domestic violence and violence against children. A review of 105 children in 1996 by Brandon and Lewis showed that domestic violence had taken place in almost half the families. When the proposals on the consultation paper on domestic violence are made into law, as I hope they will be, I hope that there will be a further opportunity to press for the change.</p>
	<p pid="a.973.1/3">The public need to know that the penalty for such horrific cases involving serious injury or death to a child will be treated with the greatest gravity. All the evidence shows that our criminal justice system is failing one of the most vulnerable and defenceless groups in our society. Children suffer serious injury or die in the care of adults who should protect them, yet the number of convictions is minimal. The crimes go unpunished and the offenders remain at liberty, perhaps to offend again. As the Law Commission says, we must improve the law. I hope to hear from my noble friend that urgent action will be taken in line with the recommendations of the Law Commission. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.973.2/1">I would very much like to give my general support to the noble Baroness. I shall not try to support every word of the amendment, but she is dealing with a very real problem that is thought by many people to be a real injustice in our law. To many people it seems odd and unjust that, if a person must have died at the hands of one of two people but the evidence does not point unambiguously to one rather than the other having committed the crime, in the absence of evidence of a joint enterprise neither can be convicted. That is the inevitable consequence of it being up to the prosecution to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt.</p>
	<p pid="a.973.2/2">That does not mean that there may not be a case for creating new offences which catch those who ought to be convicted of some offence. That is what the noble Baroness, with great ingenuity, is seeking to do. If one were to direct one's attention to that problem, one would find, not only in the case of maltreatment of children but also in other areas of law, that one could create new offences which would prevent obviously guilty people getting away with not being convicted of any offence whatever.</p>
	<p pid="a.973.2/3">There is nothing unjust in condemning someone who has the opportunity to protect a child from ill treatment and has failed to take it. There is nothing unjust in making that person guilty of an offence and subjecting them to punishment. I therefore hope that the Minister will take the matter away and think carefully about how we might deal with an area of law that has always worried me and many others.</p>

	<p pid="a.974.0/1">I, too, support my noble friend Lady Gould, but I am rather worried about subsection (4) in her new clause. Frankly, it does not make a lot of sense. However, since she has said that she would be prepared to consider the issue, I recognise that what both she and the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, have said makes a lot of sense. Rather than weary the Committee, I shall merely offer her my support.</p>

	<p pid="a.974.1/1">I am full of admiration for my noble friend Lord Waddington and I have great respect for the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis. I fully understand what is behind the noble Baroness's intentions in proposing the new clause. However, I come to a different conclusion from that of my noble friend Lord Waddington or of the noble Lord, Lord Clinton-Davis. I hope that the Government will make it clear that to introduce a new offence of that kind is not a serious, practical proposition.</p>
	<p pid="a.974.1/2">One realises and understands, as the noble Baroness has said, the distress and anger that greets one when one hears that a child has been injured or killed, but that since the prosecution is unable to say which of two people have committed the offence, neither of them can be convicted and both are acquitted. One understands that position, but as I understand the clause, it provides that anyone who is responsible for that child or is one of those people with the child when the child is killed, although that person may be in no way responsible for its death, he shall nevertheless be guilty of an offence of failing to protect the child.</p>
	<p pid="a.974.1/3">What does that mean? If a father, stepfather&mdash;as is often the case&mdash;or a stranger kills a child by shaking him or her to death, is one really to say that his or her mother, who may have had nothing to do with his or her death, is nevertheless in some way guilty of an offence, deserving of 14 years' imprisonment? That surely cannot be right.</p>
	<p pid="a.974.1/4">Although one is then left with the challenge of looking at the evidence to try to prove which individual caused the death of the child, it is not a solution to say that someone else who happened to be present must be assumed, by virtue merely of their presence, to be guilty of an offence in failing to protect the child.</p>

	<p pid="a.975.0/1">Surely, if a person is present at the time when a child is killed, it is reasonable to assume, until the contrary is shown, that that person, as he or she was present, could have taken some steps to try and prevent the child being killed. If, therefore, the person were charged with failing to protect the child, it would then be open to that person, having entered the witness box, to show that he or she had no opportunity to protect the child. In those circumstances, that person would not be guilty of an offence, but at least the matter would be resolved, because the person would have had to have shown what actually happened.</p>

	<p pid="a.975.1/1">I do not accept my noble friend's argument. I am not sure what the phrase &quot;whilst it is with two or more people&quot; means. Does it mean that those people have to be present? How does one show that they were present at the moment when the act was committed? In those tragic cases where children are shaken&mdash;that is what normally happens&mdash;in order to cause injury or death, the act is usually carried out by one person, with nobody else in the room or in the presence of the child. To reverse the burden of proof and say to the other parent, &quot;You must prove that you did everything to protect the child&quot; is not the answer to the problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.975.2/1">I support the amendment for all the reasons that my noble friend Lady Gould so eloquently gave, but in addition, I should like to say that when I sat regularly as a magistrate, which I did for more than 15 years, it became increasingly clear to me that what people expected of the justice system was, first and foremost, the full attribution of responsibility for criminal and illegal acts, and after that, of course, the right sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.975.2/2">The attribution of responsibility for crimes seems to me to be at the heart of justice. It is what marks the transition of a society from primitive theories of the causation of evil acts to a system based on reason and the rule of law.</p>
	<p pid="a.975.2/3">Yet in one of the most heinous crimes of all&mdash;injuries to or even the murder of children&mdash;our law, in its present state, prevents the attribution of responsibility through the trial process when there are two or more adults who must have been involved in the assault, but when it cannot be established beyond reasonable doubt who did what. Those are adults who are in a unique position to safeguard the child or to account for any injuries, but they cannot be brought to book. The law remains impotent in the face of a clearly acknowledged, most serious crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.975.2/4">The amendment seeks to right that injustice. It does it through modest extensions of the criminal law which were first proposed by the Law Commission and have been endorsed, as my noble friend said, in its most recent report on the subject last month. To adopt this amendment would show real compliance with the spirit of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and it would ensure that we had brought justice closer to the important sphere of brutal violence within the family.</p>

	<p pid="a.976.0/1">While for various reasons I need not go into I cannot accept the working of the amendment, I see that it undoubtedly addresses a problem. The one-off attack on a child when there are two people living in the house is not too difficult to solve. It is usually obvious which of the two people committed the offence. However, the trouble is that in case after case of this type there is a long history of a child being battered and of non-accidental injury. In case after case that is brought before the court, there are the hospital records, the doctors' records and the social services records from which one can follow and trace the various injuries as they occur. In the usual position, it is difficult to attribute blame precisely to one or the other if the process of battering ends in death.</p>
	<p pid="a.976.0/2">There is a considerable danger&mdash;and I speak from experience&mdash;of the wrong party being convicted and the person who carried out the final fatal attack not being charged. Again, speaking from experience, there is a considerable danger that a jury faced with the history of a battered child will convict both people. I have read and heard about people being acquitted because the jury cannot decide who carried out the act, although I have no experience of that. But far more often, the jury convicts both partners in the house. There are considerable dangers in the judicial process and in trying to identify who did it.</p>
	<p pid="a.976.0/3">Therefore, such a provision carries a great deal of merit. Perhaps not in this Bill but in a future Bill, the matter should be truly addressed and dealt with.</p>

	<p pid="a.976.1/1">The Committee is grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Gould of Potternewton, for moving the amendment and to the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, for having reminded us of the need to ensure that we answer the concerns raised outside the House and her wish to see the full attribution of responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.976.1/2">I benefited greatly from the contributions of my two noble friends Lord Waddington and Lord Carlisle of Bucklow. I agree with them both. It may seem curious that I am in agreement with them when they disagree with each other, but here we have a serious problem. The noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, identified that and I agree with the context in which he put it.</p>
	<p pid="a.976.1/3">Some high profile cases are crying out for a solution. However, as my noble friend Lord Carlisle said, there are some serious problems. I have seen cases in which one person stands by and does nothing while an abuser is committing criminal acts which can amount to murder and manslaughter. There is sometimes a reason for that. In cases I have seen, the partner of a defendant is often abused and is frequently powerless to stop what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.976.1/4">The clause offers such people a defence, but the burden is put on them to show that they were suffering from abuse at the time. I know from my own practice that many battered women do not admit, even in open court, that they are so treated. Therefore, there is the danger that they will be punished twice.</p>
	<p pid="a.976.1/5">Furthermore, as I am sure my noble friend had in mind, there have been circumstances in which the partner did not suffer abuse but simply was completely unaware that the abuse was taking place. A whole range of situations must be carefully considered, which is why the matter has received such excellent scrutiny from the Law Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.976.1/6">I return to my support for my noble friend Lord Waddington. He rightly says that there is nothing unjust in penalising someone who is just standing by when the crime is committed. That is why I agree with both my noble friends and now look to the Government, with all their resources, to do what Mr Hilary Benn said would be done: to find a solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.976.1/7">I warmly congratulate the noble Baronesses on providing the Committee with this important debate and I now look forward to hearing the Minister's response.</p>

	<p pid="a.977.0/1">I, too, congratulate my noble friend on moving the amendment. I totally take into account the fact that she does not propose to pursue it or to suggest that it has anything other than a number of fundamental flaws. She has moved the amendment to enable us to have a debate and I thank her for doing so.</p>
	<p pid="a.977.0/2">Any death of a child is obviously a sad and terrible matter, as the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, made plain. We are all concerned to ensure that prosecution in cases of non-accidental death is not hampered by the perceived loophole in the present law. It is not acceptable that those guilty of killing a child in their family should escape because the law cannot determine who struck the fatal blow. A number of agencies have examined the problem, most recently the NSPCC and, very helpfully, the Law Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.977.0/3">I regret to tell the Committee that I have experienced cases in which the jury could not decide which person committed the act. Mainly, those were cases in which neither defendant gave evidence. One of the problems we have is that it is difficult in that situation for the court&mdash;for the jury&mdash;to make a determination as to guilt. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt, is right in saying that in many such cases often the woman, regrettably, has been brutalised and subjugated to such an extent that not only has she not been able to protect her child but she has become unwilling or unable to give evidence against her partner and as a result justice cannot be done. I understand all those problems and they are difficult to solve&mdash;not least because if they were easy to solve, governments in the past 100 years would have done so.</p>
	<p pid="a.977.0/4">But we believe that we may be edging our way towards a solution. We have previously made clear our determination to act. We are wholly committed to legislation in order to resolve this problem. But we need to get this right and to legislate on a complete set of measures to achieve our goal. There are some tricky issues for us to balance. I do not believe that the amendment gets it right, but I entirely understand the thrust of what my noble friend is seeking to achieve. We therefore had, and continue to have, detailed discussions with the Law Commission and others on their proposals in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.977.0/5">We have also been working on our own measures in discussion with other government departments, the police, the NSPCC, the working group and other professional people. We have a duty to secure an effective investigation and adjudicative process to protect the rights of children and, indeed, of other vulnerable people. It has been my pleasure to expend a not inconsiderable amount of my time trying to help craft the solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.977.0/6">We believe that part of the solution lies in changes in procedure and part lies in the creation of a new offence, to which the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, made reference. However, the two need to work together to provide the answer that we need. The amendment before us acknowledges that. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that there is much merit in what the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, said in relation to caution, and there is much in the passionately expressed opinion of the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, that we must get on and try to do something.</p>
	<p pid="a.977.0/7">As I said, the two need to work together, but the present Bill is not the right vehicle for a new offence. We believe that, although the Law Commission has taken this whole issue much further than has previously been the case, there may be a little further to go before we are sure that we have the right answer. It must be compatible with the ECHR, the Human Rights Act and all the other matters with which we shall have to deal.</p>
	<p pid="a.977.0/8">I want to commend my noble friend Lady Gould, who tabled the amendment. It is right to keep this issue in the public eye and, if I may respectfully say so, to keep up the pressure up on the Government, which I feel. The voice of others has been very helpful in ensuring that that happens. I particularly commend my noble friend Lady Whitaker for her ceaseless efforts in this regard. We intend to see that the desire expressed in Committee today is fulfilled. Children have every right to place their trust in their carers and not to discover, to their cost, that it is sadly misplaced and that justice is thwarted. We need to ensure that their killers are brought to justice and that those who stand idly by are also brought to account where that is justified.</p>
	<p pid="a.977.0/9">With that reassurance, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel content. We shall continue to pursue this issue with a great deal of energy and we hope to find an early opportunity to return to the House when we have an appropriate legislative slot.</p>

	<p pid="a.979.0/1">I thank my noble friend very much for her remarks. I also thank everyone who has spoken in what I believe has been a very important and interesting debate. I said at the start that I have no legal training, and therefore I tabled the amendment with some trepidation. It was a probing amendment because I felt sure that the wording would not be as it should. I accept that without a doubt. However, I am very pleased that many noble Lords have spoken in support of the principle of the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.979.0/2">I am pleased, in particular, that my noble friend said that the solution is under serious consideration and discussion. Like the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, I look to the Government to arrive at a solution and to bring before the House another Bill that will stop this appalling situation. It has gone on long enough, and those who commit such terrible crimes must be brought to justice. However, at present, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.979.3/1">The Government's proposed new clause in Amendment No. 232AA amends the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 to allow the Court of Appeal to direct the commission to investigate a report on any matter on an application for leave to appeal against conviction, as well as on an appeal against conviction. The proposed new clause in government Amendment No. 232AB makes equivalent provisions for Northern Ireland. There are related minor and consequential amendments to Schedule 30 and Clause 306. Unless noble Lords wish me to do so, I do not propose to go into greater detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.979.3/2">The Court of Appeal has expressed concern that, on occasions, its consideration of an application for leave to appeal against conviction has been fettered by the lack of a power to have certain issues investigated by the Criminal Cases Review Commission and that it has therefore been unable to consider whether leave should be granted. In the amendments we have sought to address the concerns properly raised with us by the judiciary, and I commend them to the House. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.980.0/1">I welcome these new clauses. If I recall correctly, it was not only the judiciary that expressed some concern. Sir Robin Auld&mdash;the Minister nods&mdash;also criticised the inability of the Court of Appeal to direct the commission to investigate and report to it on any matter in an application for leave to appeal, as distinct from an appeal itself. I recall the noble Baroness explaining in a letter that there may, indeed, be instances where the court might require the assistance of the commission at the application stage and, without it, it might even be forced or obliged to deny leave. Therefore, the amendments are welcome and I support them from these Benches.</p>

	<p pid="a.981.1/1">These amendments concern appellants referred to the Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. At present, an appellant of this kind can add additional grounds of appeal, whether or not they are related to any reason given by the commission for making the reference. An unlimited number of grounds may be added in this way.</p>
	<p pid="a.981.1/2">During the passage of the Courts Bill earlier this year we discussed this issue&mdash;I see that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, is smiling and nodding. I was unpersuaded then but I know that I am about to give him considerable satisfaction. I see him beaming that satisfaction at me across the Dispatch Box. We were unable to agree the change on that occasion but have since had the opportunity to consider matters more thoroughly and are now persuaded of the merits of the change.</p>
	<p pid="a.981.1/3">I am afraid that, not for the first time, the decisive factor is the evidence of the extent to which some appellants are abusing the present regime. Any time wasted by the Court of Appeal in considering manifestly unmeritorious grounds of appeal can serve only to delay other meritorious appeals that anxiously need a determination. I should stress that, in making the change, we are mindful of the special nature of appellants referred to the Court of Appeal by the CCRC. We are well aware that these are potential miscarriage-of-justice cases and would obviously not propose any change that might raise the possibility of a miscarriage of justice going uncorrected.</p>
	<p pid="a.981.1/4">We are satisfied, however, that the proposals contain the necessary safeguards. We are not limiting appeals in these cases to grounds identified by the CCRC. Under the amendments, appellants will still be able to add further grounds, unrelated to the commission's reasons for making the reference, provided they have the leave of the Court of Appeal to do so. I beg to move.</p>

On that occasion, the noble Baroness criticised me for having gone on at too great a length in seeking to explain the amendment. Indeed, she said that I had entertained the House&mdash;here she used a very rude phrase&mdash;to an exhaustive exposition, which can be translated as my having been exceedingly boring.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.982.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="982"  time="017:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-14.htm#31015-14_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.982.1/1">This is another amendment which has been designed to rectify a gap in the criminal appeals legislation. Where the Court of Appeal is hearing an appeal against conviction, after a finding by the jury where the appellant did not plead guilty, it has the power to substitute a conviction of an alternative offence if it is satisfied that the facts established by the jury's finding would also make up the alternative offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.982.1/2">However, there is no equivalent power in the Criminal Appeal Act 1968 for the Court of Appeal to substitute an alternative conviction following a guilty plea. As I hope noble Lords will understand, an appeal against conviction after a guilty plea is rather unusual. It is perhaps for that reason that the situation is not covered in the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.982.1/3">However, there have been two recent cases in which the gap has caused difficulty; namely, the cases of Horsman and Duggan, to which I referred in my letter to Her Majesty's loyal Opposition Front Bench anticipating these amendments. In both cases the court was dealing with a conviction following a guilty plea and in both cases the court might have substituted an alternative conviction had it had the power we are introducing here.</p>
	<p pid="a.982.1/4">One might imagine that the power will be generally used under circumstances where the appellant consents to the substitution and, indeed, may even have requested it. However, the amendments allow the Court of Appeal the discretion to impose an alternative conviction on the same facts, even where an appellant does not consent. There may be the occasional case, therefore, for example, where an appellant seeks to withdraw a guilty plea on conviction but the court considered that there is no good reason for him to do so, especially as the appellant will have already admitted to the relevant facts.</p>
	<p pid="a.982.1/5">That is subject to safeguards, as any conviction imposed in the exercise of this discretion will of course have to accord with the court's obligations under the Human Rights Act. Moreover, I hope that it will be noted that this is only a power to substitute in relation to an equal or less than severe sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.982.1/6">Finally, in cases where the court is unsure of the facts, which have been admitted, it will be able to order a re-trial. The amendments are designed to give the Court of Appeal as much flexibility as possible and will fill an unjustifiable gap in the law identified by the court. I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.984.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="984"  time="017:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-15.htm#31015-15_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.984.2/1">This group of amendments will simplify the operation of Section 10 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1968. Section 10 grants a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal against a sentence of the Crown Court where the defendant has been committed by the magistrates' court to the Crown Court for sentence, and under certain other circumstances where the defendant is dealt with in the Crown Court, having previously been dealt with in a magistrates' court.</p>
	<p pid="a.984.2/2">Generally speaking, the right of appeal is only attracted where a defendant is sentenced on committal to six months' imprisonment, or more. Where the defendant is sentenced to less than six months, there is no right of appeal against the Crown Court's sentence. It would appear that the reason for the limitation is that the magistrates' court has power to impose a sentence of up to six months' imprisonment. Therefore, the thinking seems to be that if the magistrates' court committed the defendant for sentence, it must have thought that a sentence of more than six months was desirable. Accordingly, if the Crown Court imposes a sentence of less than six months, the Crown Court's sentencing decision has acted as a kind of de facto appeal, and the defendant has received a sentence lower than the magistrates' court originally intended. Therefore, the reasoning seems to be that no right of appeal against the Crown Court's sentence is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.984.2/3">As I pointed out in my letter to Her Majesty's loyal Opposition Front Bench, however, the limitation gives rise to the anomaly that if a defendant is convicted on indictment and sentenced by the Crown Court to less than six months' imprisonment, an appeal against sentence lies to the Court of Appeal. If the defendant is convicted in the magistrates' court, committed to the Crown Court for sentence and receives the identical sentence, there is no right of appeal to the Court of Appeal. That cannot be right.</p>
	<p pid="a.984.2/4">The operation of Section 10 is subject to a further complication. Where the Crown Court imposes any of the sentences listed in Section 10(3)(c) or (cc) of the 1968 Act, a right of appeal lies to the Court of Appeal, regardless of the length of any prison term imposed, and even if no term of imprisonment is imposed at all. Section 10(3)(c) currently includes, for example, orders banning a person from holding or obtaining a driving licence, and football restriction orders.</p>
	<p pid="a.984.2/5">These exceptions to the general rule under Section 10 give rise to further anomalies. The senior judiciary are of the opinion, and we agree, that the section is in need of simplification. Under our amendments a right of appeal to the Court of Appeal will be available, subject to the usual leave requirement in any case to which Section 10(2) of the 1968 Act applies. I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.985.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100316" speakername="Lord Hunt of Wirral" colon=":" colnum="985"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-15.htm#31015-15_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.985.1/1">We now move to Schedule 27, which sets out a number of provisions on jury service. We welcome the contents of Schedule 27. However, I seek clarification from the Minister as to the effect of some of the provisions. First, I stress that we warmly welcome the change to an inclusionary approach to juries as currently there are some 4 million people who are excluded, which is an unacceptable figure.</p>
	<p pid="a.985.1/2">In order for juries to be effective and representative, they must be drawn from society at large and at random. For that reason we are also pleased to note that the abolition of an easy opt out is being tackled in this schedule. For too long people have said that they are too important, too busy or cannot be spared from their jobs to serve on a jury. But I must point out that it seems ironic that the Bill seeks to include in the jury those who are closely involved with the administration of justice. I should like to explore that aspect with the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.985.1/3">Certainly, under the present provisions there is a risk that particular individuals, such as a retired judge or a serving police officer, could well be called to jury service. There is a danger that they would disproportionately influence that jury. It is a danger about which I am sure the Minister will reassure us. That is the purpose of these amendments. There is a concern that a jury would naturally tend to defer to such an individual's view as that person would be seen as having the most experience in the field of justice. In many cases such people might well assert their views as experts and could even persuade the jury to support their decision on the case. Even if they did not identify themselves as connected with the administration of justice, it might be obvious from the way in which they discuss the evidence and talk about the case during deliberations that they know more than most and even through inadvertence could affect the outcome of the trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.985.1/4">It would be hard to hide one's identity from the rest of the jurors were the juror in question to be the Lord Chief Justice or a member of the high-profile judiciary. Those closely connected with the administration of criminal justice will also know the reasons why juries are sometimes excluded from the court room while a judge makes a ruling on a piece of evidence, a confession, an allegation of bad character, or whatever. It will be hard for those with that kind of knowledge to put it completely from their mind and to try the case on the evidence before them when they will suspect, or indeed may even know from signs that they would understand, that there is more evidence of a controversial nature.</p>
	<p pid="a.985.1/5">On a more practical note, the schedule seems to have been ill thought through in one or two other respects. I take, for example, the situation of a district judge called to serve on a jury. It would be reasonable to assume that he would not be asked to travel a large distance to carry out his duty and so would probably report to his local court&mdash;most likely his own. There he would know the court staff and might even know a few of the defendants.</p>
	<p pid="a.985.1/6">While such a person, male or female, is listening to the case, they might ask many questions. That is an absolute right of a member of the jury, but that kind of questioning might well disrupt the trial and distract the other jury members. In summing-up or in advising the jury on the law, the trial judge may make a mistake that the judge serving on the jury notices. I wonder what would happen in those circumstances. Would the individual be allowed to point out the error or would the trial be allowed to carry on until there is an appeal?</p>
	<p pid="a.985.1/7">The solution to these problems is to be found in this group of amendments. They would not grant a blanket exemption for those connected with the administration of justice; rather they would exempt them if, in the opinion of the appropriate officer, other jurors might give their views undue weight. The amendments would insert a new subsection into the 1974 Act to ensure that a person who wished to challenge the appropriate officer's decision either way could have the issue resolved by the Crown Court. They would also enable the appropriate officer to obtain the court's guidance, where necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.985.1/8">I hope I have explained my reason for moving the amendment. I need some reassurance. It might well be helpful to the Committee if the Minister were to explain how she sees this particular side of jury service developing. I stress again how warmly I welcome the Government's extension to an inclusive system. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.987.0/1">This point needs a certain amount of consideration. It is not so much the issues upon which a judge has to decide as a matter of discretion&mdash;for instance, those under Section 78 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act&mdash;because those matters will not be left to the jury. I have in mind, particularly in relation to Amendment No. 232E, the situation where there is a question of inferences from silence.</p>
	<p pid="a.987.0/2">I cannot believe that juries are not surprised that on occasion a defendant says nothing about a particular matter. I remember one case&mdash;and I am sure many other noble Lords with experience of this issue will remember similar things&mdash;in which one defendant out of a group did not give evidence because he had a bad record and consequently would be cross-examined by one of his co-defendants. One then has the problem of what to say to a jury about inferences from his failure to give any evidence. I can readily see that that someone on a jury who knew about these things would carry an undue influence. I believe that the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, could help us greatly in describing how she sees this kind of situation being resolved.</p>
	<p pid="a.987.0/3">The issue would have to be resolved at the selection stage of a jury. These things do not necessarily arise at an early stage in a trial; they turn up as it goes along. One does not want to have a jury member, who has obviously been acquainted with the other members of the jury in the course of the proceedings, suddenly being discharged because something arises about which he or she is bound to know more than would be good for anyone to be told about during a jury's deliberations. There are great practical difficulties on this issue. I shall be very interested to hear what the noble Baroness has to say about it.</p>

	<p pid="a.987.1/1">I should declare an interest because I am in the unusual position of having actually served on a jury. I concluded my degree aged 20, but did not join the Middle Temple until shortly after my 21st birthday. In the interim I was called to jury service. I must confess that to your Lordships because I did not disclose my knowledge to the jury. So, I was perfectly aware that the defendant had convictions when they were not put in; I was also perfectly aware that the basis upon which the judge retired was to hear something on the voir dire; and I understood perfectly the issue. I must say that I hope it did not impinge on my ability to do justice, but I did not tell anyone who I was.</p>
	<p pid="a.987.1/2">So I understand the anxiety about the issues raised by the noble Viscount, Lord Colville of Culross, and the noble Lord, Lord Hunt. We believe&mdash;and I welcome the warmth given to these provisions by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt&mdash;that widening the ambit of people who can give assistance as jury members is very important and that we need to have that inclusion clearly faced.</p>
	<p pid="a.987.1/3">The proposal will take two stages. There will undoubtedly be circumstances in which it would not be appropriate for, say, a police officer, a judge, or a lawyer to serve on a jury. A number of safeguards exist to ensure that people whose presence on a jury might threaten, or even appear to threaten, the fairness of a trial will not so serve. These will be adequately covered in the new arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.987.1/4">The screening process is to have two stages. At the first stage, the jury summoning form, which will need to be amended to reflect the new arrangements, invites anyone who thinks they have a &quot;good reason&quot; to defer or be excused from jury service to state that reason. One such reason would be that it is very likely that the person will know, or be known to, someone involved in the conduct of the trial. The guidance to be issued by my noble and learned friend the Lord Chancellor will also make this clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.987.1/5">A number of noble Lords know about the situations of which I speak. There are members of the judiciary who have been in an area for a very long time. There will be no one in that locality who does not recognise either their face, their name or sometimes, just as importantly, their voice. There will be police officers who have worked in an area for a very long time.

	<p pid="a.990.1/1">The amendment stands in my name and in that of the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen. Unfortunately, the noble Baroness has been detained from your Lordships' House this afternoon through other responsibilities, but she supports the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/2">The purpose of the new clause is to establish a clear legal framework for the youth justice system to be guided by child-centred principles that meet the UK's obligations under international and domestic law and to ensure that all those working in the youth justice system, including the Prison Service, courts and youth offending teams are guided by those principles.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/3">I shall make a few general comments before I move to the three principles in the amendment. We feel that the new clause is necessary because the Bill contains proposals that will significantly reform the criminal justice system in the UK. In attempting such a broad revision of the system, the Government fail to give adequate attention to the particular need to protect children and young people from the full force of the criminal law and to ensure that their welfare and best interests are at the forefront, in line with our domestic law and international obligations. A group of children's charities and justice organisations is urging the Government to amend the Bill to ensure that the welfare and best interests of children are at the heart of the youth justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/4">I shall now outline the specific reasons why we feel the need for a statement of principles in the Bill. That is because the youth justice system has been the subject of criticism from the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child and successive reports from Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons. The recent report from the chief inspector, Safeguarding Children, found that:</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/5" class="indent">&quot;the welfare needs of children and young people who commit offences were not being addressed adequately by those responsible for their welfare&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/6">The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has also expressed serious concerns about the UK's treatment of children in trouble with the law&mdash;in particular, our failure to establish a system of juvenile justice that fully integrates the convention. The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child commits the UK to separating the system for children in trouble with the law from that for adults&mdash;in Article 40&mdash;to ensuring that the best interest of the child are a primary consideration in all decisions about them&mdash;in Article 3&mdash;and to ensuring that custody is used only as a measure of last resort&mdash;in Article 37.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/7">The amendment sets out clearly a framework for the youth justice system that would meet all those obligations and requirements and clarify the necessary safeguards for children while&mdash;this is crucial&mdash;retaining the primary overall aim of the youth justice system as set out in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, which is the prevention of reoffending. That Act contains no statement of principles to guide those working in the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/8">The other relevant provision is Section 44 of the Children and Young Persons Act 1933, which requires all courts to have regard to the child's welfare. Although important and valuable, that provision is often neglected and is in need of clarification and strengthening. It applies only to courts, not to the whole of the youth justice system. That is why we feel that the amendment is necessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/9">It would also bring the legislation in England and Wales in line with that in Northern Ireland, where the Justice (Northern Ireland) Act 2002 sets out a framework for the youth justice system there that establishes that all persons and bodies exercising functions relating to youth justice must have regard to the welfare of children.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/10">First, I address the new clause's provision for the welfare of the child. The Children Act 1989 states that in all matters relating to the upbringing of a child the court must have the child's welfare as its paramount consideration. That is generally regarded as setting the marker and standard for the treatment of children and young people in England and Wales. However, the welfare principle contained in the Act is not clearly applied to proceedings other than family proceedings. There are signs that the welfare of the child is not being given adequate consideration in the youth justice system, where greater emphasis is placed on punishment delivered by strictly offending-related assessments and programmes of intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/11">The recent joint report of Her Majesty's Chief Inspectors, Safeguarding Children, found that the welfare needs of young people who commit offences were not being adequately addressed by those services responsible for their welfare. In particular, the work of the youth offending teams was found to be focused exclusively on the offending behaviour of young people and there was little evidence of welfare needs being addressed or considered. The report further found that the YOTs were detached from other services and not fully addressing children's needs for protection and safeguarding.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/12">Although, as the Howard League judgment of November 2002 by Mr Justice Munby in the High Court, established, the Children Act 1989 applies to children in prison, it does not apply to the Prison Service, which means that, unlike authorities, it does not have a clear statutory duty to safeguard the welfare of children. In the light of that judgment, the Joint Committee on Human Rights recently recommended that an amendment to the Children Act 1989 be sought at the earliest opportunity to place a statutory duty to safeguard the welfare of children on the Prison Service and local authorities. The amendment would go a long way towards achieving that aim.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/13">The second point of principle is custody as a last resort. The current population of the juvenile secure estate in England and Wales is more than 3,000, which is significantly high, when compared to the majority of western Europe. Recent Home Office figures confirm that the UK now has the highest overall prison population rate among countries of the European Union. Since the early 1990s, successive legislation has increased the availability of custodial measures for remand and sentence for children as young as 12. That has reversed the trend established in the 1980s away from custody. It has resulted in year-on-year increases in the numbers of children in custody. That is another reason why we need the statement of principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/14">In October 2002, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child published its response to the UK Government's implementation of the UNCRC. The committee was extremely critical of the UK Government with respect to the youth justice system in England and Wales. It expressed particular concern about the increase in use of custody for children, especially young children, and their treatment in custody. Article 37 of the UN convention states that the imprisonment of a child shall be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest possible time. The UN committee states:</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/15" class="indent">&quot;It is the concern of the committee that deprivation of liberty is not being used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time, in violation of article 37(b) of the [convention]&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/16">It is a very clear direction regarding the use of custody, to which the Government should pay attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/17">In particular, the committee expresses concern that the detention and training order has been introduced, allowing children aged 12 to 14 to be deprived of their liberty. Implementation of Section 130 of the Criminal Justice and Police Act 2001, which relaxed the criteria for making court-ordered secure remands, has also increased the numbers of children in custody. The Youth Justice Board has stated that the piloting of Section 130 has had a &quot;significant impact&quot; on the size of the juvenile custodial remand population. The noble Lord, Lord Warner, chairman of the Youth Justice Board, has described the measures as &quot;unsensible&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/18">The third principle is the best interests of the child. In its 2002 report, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child made its most comprehensive and severe criticism of the UK's administration of juvenile justice. In particular, the committee recommended,</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/19" class="indent">&quot;that the State party establish throughout the State party the best interests of the child as a paramount consideration in all legislation and policy affecting children, notably within the juvenile justice system&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/20">Although the Children Act 1989 establishes that decisions taken by the court must be taken in the child's best interests through the establishment of the welfare checklist and the need for the court to take all matters into account, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 has eroded that principle in dealing with children who offend by stressing the primary aim of preventing offending above all other considerations. That is another reason why we feel that a restatement of the principle of best interests is needed in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/21">I am aware that the Green Paper Every Child Matters and the Next Steps document that accompanies it set out some possible changes to the youth justice system, some of which are very welcome. However, the document covers only sentencing issues. It fails to address the problems across the whole youth justice system and the difficulties caused by a system that is not fully separate from the adult criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.990.1/22">I hope that the Minister will be inclined favourably towards our amendment since it would retain the Government's overall aim for the youth justice system&mdash;the prevention of offending by children&mdash;while reinforcing and clarifying the necessary safeguards for children and better complying with the UK's children's rights obligations. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.993.0/1">My noble friend Lady Massey could not be present, but I wish to take the opportunity to support the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley. I pay tribute to the noble Baroness for the wonderful way in which she champions in this House the rights of children. I support the amendment. I wish to reinforce the three principles to which the noble Baroness has spoken.</p>
	<p pid="a.993.0/2">I was involved in the launch, in July 2003, of Scope, an umbrella group of most of the children's charities, including the National Children's Bureau, Barnardo's, the NSPCC and others. The real concern of those organisations in coming together was to address the very issues that the amendment highlights. The concern is that we are not living up to our international obligations. We are talking about the human rights of children. We should see the distinction between children and adults. I would have thought that it was very much in keeping with the Government's thinking.</p>
	<p pid="a.993.0/3">The Green Paper published recently is a very positive document welcomed by many of us concerned with children's rights. Clearly, it still has some way to go, but that such work is being done on so many fronts is a welcome innovation. I hope that the Government will listen to the principles in the amendment, that they will take the amendment to heart and include it in the Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.993.1/1">The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, has made a very powerful case in setting out the amendment. It forces us to think about the numbers and the position of children under 18 who are still held in adult prisons. That has been the subject of at least one report by the Howard League, chaired by, I believe, my noble friend Lady Masham of Ilton. It has been discussed in your Lordships' House on several occasions. I ask the noble Lord, Lord Bassam, how many children under 18 are held in adult prisons? If they are still there, are they at least held in wings separate from adult prisoners? It is regrettable that relatively little progress has been made on the issue. I hope that the noble Lord will have some good news for us today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.994.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="994"  time="018:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-17.htm#31015-17_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.994.0/1">I am extremely grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, for moving this very constructive amendment. I suspect that, ultimately, there is not much difference between our objectives and views. I am sure that the noble Baroness will wish to join me in paying tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Warner, for his important work as chair of the Youth Justice Board before he moved on to his current ministerial responsibilities. The work of the Youth Justice Board has enabled us to make progress in how children and young people are treated and regarded in the criminal justice process. It has perhaps broadened perspectives on how the criminal justice process works in the interests, and supervises the interests, of children and young people caught up in the criminal justice system.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.0/2">I echo the tribute that the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, paid to the important work carried out by the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, in that field. I recognise the vigour with which the noble Baronesses have argued and advanced their case.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.0/3">We established in the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 that the principal aim of the youth justice system is to prevent offending by children and young people. That has proved to be of great value, acting as a focus for previously disparate agencies and services and enabling us to face up in a pragmatic, non-judgmental way to the problems that crime causes to society. By focusing on offending behaviour by children and young people, we are acting in their interests because we are trying to get behind the issues relating to that pattern of offending.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.0/4">The welfare of young offenders has long been a very important issue in the criminal justice system and has a long history. The noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, referred to legislation going back to 1933&mdash;the Children and Young Person's Act 1933&mdash;which obliged those involved in government and the provision of services to have regard to the welfare of juveniles when sentencing them. Welfare considerations are therefore firmly rooted in legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.0/5">Let us also be clear, however, that child welfare is not the only consideration in the justice system and cannot be the main consideration. The justice system exists to tackle crime; welfare issues arise as a consequence of the need to tackle crime. We must also have proper regard to the needs and interests of victims and the wider community. We have a duty to ensure that justice is delivered and that the needs and interests of victims are not lost in the process. It is also our view that preventing offending is, as I said earlier, in the best interest of the child or young person and does not undermine the interests of the victim and the wider public.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.0/6">Praise has already been heaped on the Green Paper, Youth Justice&mdash;The Next Steps and the main children Green Paper Every Child Matters, both of which were published on 8th September. In those documents we propose a single main sentencing purpose of preventing offending. Currently, the sentencing of young people is subject to several different statutory aims and principles&mdash;a point that was underlined by the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, in her contribution to the debate. As such, the relationship between and the relative strength of preventing offending, taking account of welfare and ensuring just desserts is not entirely clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.0/7">We propose a single main sentencing purpose of preventing offending to put the main priority beyond doubt. We propose that that main purpose would be supported by requirements for sentencers to take into account the extent to which punishment is needed; whether, and if so how, there needs to be public protection because of the seriousness or persistence of the offending; the individual's age and vulnerability; whether there should be a restorative or reparative approach or obligations on the young person; and what particular interventions have been tried if the person has been sentenced before and what would be appropriate now or in the future. It is a holistic approach that takes on board many of the concerns raised in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.0/8">With regard to welfare, what we are proposing through this formula is a more up-to-date, pragmatic equivalent of age and vulnerability, which is less value-ridden and focuses on the actual issues that can require special protection for a young person. It is selective and highlights the practical points. We propose that other sentencing considerations, along with their cost and evidence of their effectiveness, will be set out by the Sentencing Guidelines Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.0/9">We should welcome views on this proposal, and, indeed, on all the other proposals outlined in the consultation document. Those views should be forwarded by 1st December. We do not consider it sensible to make changes in law to the principles of juvenile sentencing in advance of that consultation process. That would be approaching it from the wrong end. That brings me to the remaining part of the noble Baroness's amendment to this Bill&mdash;minimising deprivation of liberty. Such a measure should, of course, be used only as a last resort in respect of all individuals and should not be taken lightly. It is particularly important that children and young people do not get sent to custody or other secure accommodation by the courts if there is a more appropriate alternative sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.0/10">In Youth Justice&mdash;The Next Steps, we have put forward proposals on introducing more intensive sentences as the main response to the serious and persistent offending of juveniles. Intensive supervision and surveillance&mdash;a highly supervised community programme involving close attention from supervising officers, full-time daytime programmes and electronic monitoring&mdash;is currently being expanded to 4,200 places in England and Wales by January 2004, three-quarters for sentenced juveniles and a quarter for bailees. However, custody would still need to be available when the offence or offences are so serious that only a physical restriction of liberty can be justified. It is finally for the courts, and rightly so, to use their judgment when choosing the most appropriate sentence for an individual young offender.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.0/11">We are happy to undertake to look seriously at building the thinking behind this remaining element into future strategic sentencing purposes for youth justice. However, it is not our intention to tinker now. We have fallen into that trap too often in the past. We want to stimulate and hear a full debate on the proposed general purposes and put together a properly integrated formula for new legislation. Our minds are therefore open on the issue and we are delighted to have stimulated debate on it, of which this discussion is an important part. Tinkering with the process of sentencing at this stage, however, would be wrong and inappropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.0/12">The noble Lord, Lord Hylton, asked about the numbers of juveniles in custody in adult institutions. My figures suggest that, at the end of August 2003, there were 2,760 juveniles held in secure facilities of which 2,270 were held by the Prison Service. Only around 100 of those juveniles mix with over-18s when there are genuine reasons and in strictly controlled conditions. I am sure the noble Lord will be aware that the Prison Service has a distinct estate for 15 to 17 year-old boys. They are in 13 juvenile-only establishments on their own sites or on sites shared with, but separate from, young offender institutions for 18 to 20 year-olds. I hope that that provides some context.</p>
	<p pid="a.994.0/13">We are beginning to witness a reduction in the number of young people held in custody. The numbers peaked in October 2002 at some 3,175. Since then, they have fallen back to 2,760 in August this year. That is a decrease of just over 13 per cent. I am sure that that reduction after a period of increase will be welcomed by all. I hope that that answers the statistical point raised by the noble Lord earlier. Following my comments, I hope that the noble Baroness will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.996.0/1">My noble friend Lady Walmsley made an important point about the judgment given a year ago on an application for judicial review by the Howard League to which the Minister failed to reply. My noble friend mentioned the distinction between what the court decided about the welfare of the child and the responsibility of the agency to provide that welfare. This amendment misses that particular obligation. Nowhere in the Minister's explanations does he give any indication whether the judgment was considered by the Home Office and whether there is likely to be any appropriate legislation in the near future. If there is not, is it not right in this day and age that we have legislation that covers the duty and obligation of the agency, not just the welfare of the child?</p>

	<p pid="a.996.1/1">I apologise if I missed that point. I thought that I was making the general point throughout my reply. Of course, the welfare of the child is extremely important. It is at the core of our thinking and forms a part of the consultation documents that were published recently. I cannot comment specifically on whether the Home Office directly reflected its thinking on the particular case mentioned by the noble Lord when constructing the consultation documents, although I am sure that it will have done because that case clearly has an important bearing on the way in which these policy issues will develop in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.996.1/2">If there are particular points that I have missed, I would be happy to follow them up, perhaps in correspondence, which I would be happy to share with other noble Lords who have taken part in this debate and related debates.</p>

	<p pid="a.997.0/1">I thank the Minister for that response. I also thank the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, and my noble friend Lord Dholakia for their report. I am delighted to see that the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, is in her place and that her other responsibilities have allowed her to be present for the Minister's response. I add my warm compliments to the noble Lord, Lord Warner, who is now a health Minister in your Lordships' House, on the sterling work that he did when he was chairman of the Youth Justice Board. It was at that time that he made the comments that I quoted.</p>
	<p pid="a.997.0/2">The Minister said that he felt that we had the same objectives: I agree. However, he said the objective was to prevent offending and reoffending by children. He said that that should be the primary objective of the youth justice system, not the welfare of the child. Offending behaviour often occurs because the child's welfare has been compromised. Addressing the child's welfare would help to meet the Government's objectives for the youth justice system. I pointed out the shortcomings of existing law in that regard. I am not satisfied that the Minister has given an explanation that covers the reasons why we feel that the new clause is required.</p>
	<p pid="a.997.0/3">I add my praise to that for the Green Paper Every Child Matters. It has the potential to make many improvements to the life chances of children in this country. I look forward to giving my response to it in the fulness of time. However, as I said, its weakness is that it covers only the sentencing system, not the whole system. With due respect, I do not believe that the Minister covered that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.997.0/4">I was delighted to hear the Minister's restatement of the principle that custody should be the last resort for young people and for all offenders. However, the fact remains that numbers in custody are rising. Nobody is suggesting that custody should never be available for those who need to be taken away from the public because they are a danger. The fact that the number of young people in custody is rising must be recognised, and something must be done about it. I welcome the indication that the Minister gave that the principle is likely to be built into future legislation more clearly than it is at the moment. I look forward to seeing the Bill&mdash;I presume that that is what the Minister meant&mdash;that will follow the Green Paper in the fulness of time during the next Session of Parliament. We will have many conversations on the subject in the next 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.997.0/5">I shall read with great care what the Minister said. On behalf of the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, and myself, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.998.1/1">One area of concern that was repeatedly reflected in the House, particularly at Second Reading and in several amendments, is the substantial increase in the prison population that will result from the Bill. We have an unacceptably high prison population. In many cases, it exceeds the CNA&mdash;the certified normal level of accommodation. Almost all disturbances in prisons are a direct result of overcrowding. In almost all cases of treatment or rehabilitation, we fail because of the unacceptably high prison population. Over 60 per cent of people reoffend within two years of discharge because the size of the prison population is not conducive to a rehabilitation or resettlement programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.998.1/2">I do not wish to sound alarmist, but it is clear that there is a serious danger that control and discipline in our penal institutions will be a matter of serious concern, if we do not control the prison population. The purpose of our amendment is to prevent overcrowding in prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.998.1/3">Custodial sentencing is carried out with no regard to the facilities available to accommodate prisoners. It leads to the overcrowding of facilities, with serious consequences for the ability of the Prison Service to provide regimes of a sufficient standard. It also means that the activities of prisoners are reduced and that it becomes less possible to accommodate prisoners safely and humanely. In turn, those factors limit the capacity of the prison system to reduce the risk that prisoners will reoffend on release.</p>
	<p pid="a.998.1/4">By legislating to prevent capacity in prisons being exceeded without parliamentary oversight and to allow it only when the Prison Service deems it to be safe, we will help to focus attention on the need to reduce unnecessary custodial sentencing. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.998.2/1">The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, has raised an important matter, but it is not a new one. We must go back many years&mdash;to 1940. During World War II, no more prisons were built, and the Home Secretary&mdash;a Labour Home Secretary, I think&mdash;gave a ruling to those responsible for looking after the prisons that there should be three prisoners to a cell, not two, if more than one prisoner were admitted. That was a sound principle. It prevented homosexuality and has worked pretty smoothly.</p>
	<p pid="a.998.2/2">In the years since, more prisons, especially open prisons, have been built, and the prison population has remained high. If the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, were made and the principle behind it put strictly into operation, some problem or other might arise. However, the noble Lord has made it easy for the matter to be dealt with by asking merely that Parliament should be informed. It is a matter that we should have in mind, and the Government should welcome the requirement to inform Parliament as a moderate solution to the problem.</p>

	<p pid="a.999.0/1">I support my noble friend Lord Renton and the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia. My noble friend is right to say that it is an important matter. He speaks from the position of having had a distinguished career as a Minister, particularly at the Home Office. The noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, speaks with the authority of the chairman of the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders. He has served on the councils for nearly 20 years and has been chairman since 1998. We have had an important discussion about a pressing issue, and I shall add my own concerns about the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.999.0/2">The Prison Reform Trust study, which was based on the Prison Service's data for England and Wales, was published recently&mdash;in July, I think. It showed that a serious situation was developing. For instance, the rate of positive drug tests rose to 11.7 per cent last year. The trust made it clear that that was happening in a range of areas as the system struggles to cope against a background of overcrowded gaols, leading to poor performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.999.0/3">In 2002&ndash;03, we saw the highest number of suicides on record, with 105 gaol inmates taking their lives. Prisons in England and Wales also failed to meet their overcrowding target, with 20.4 per cent of the average population doubling up in single cells, against a Prison Service target of 18 per cent. In Shrewsbury, the most overcrowded gaol in England and Wales, there was an average of 91.1 per cent of prisoners doubling up. That situation cannot be allowed to continue, nor can it be allowed to deteriorate.</p>
	<p pid="a.999.0/4">The report reveals a Prison Service in which performance is very seriously hampered by a record prison population. Far too many prisons are overcrowded, provide inadequate levels of purposeful activity and experience high levels of recorded drug use. The only way to improve the situation is to reduce the prison population and to extend facilities immediately. The noble Lord cleverly highlighted the problem by proposing that if a prison must be overcrowded, Parliament should be informed. We must have a safe environment in our prisons. I support my honourable friend and the noble Lord.</p>

	<p pid="a.999.1/1">I, too, heap praise upon the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, for his selfless work in relation to NACRO, over many years. I know that this is an issue dear to his heart, and rightly so. The new clause, after Clause 294, requires the Secretary of State to inform both Houses of Parliament whenever&mdash;that is the issue&mdash;a prison is to hold more prisoners than its certified normal accommodation, which is the uncrowded capacity, and that a responsible authority had considered it safe to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.999.1/2">I understand the import of what the noble Lord seeks to do, but it is unnecessary. It is important, but existing procedures already ensure that the conditions under which prisoners are held are humane and decent and that a responsible authority exists to ensure that prisoners are held safely.</p>
	<p pid="a.999.1/3">As noble Lords will concede, certified normal accommodation is a measure of the uncrowded capacity. It represents the good, decent standard of accommodation that it is aspired to provide to all prisoners. The degree by which an establishment can exceed its CNA is known as the &quot;operational capacity&quot;, which is determined by operational managers on the basis of their operational judgment and experience, taking into account control, security and the proper operation of the planned regime. Notwithstanding these considerations, all accommodation must be certified in accordance with Section 14 of the Prison Act 1952 and Rule 26 of the Prison Rules 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.999.1/4">Details of changes to individual prison capacity are already made available on a monthly basis. Any requirement to inform Parliament before a change occurs would be difficult to deliver practically. Every week, several prisons may adjust their capacity for operational reasons&mdash;such as, refurbishment or opening new capacity&mdash;sometimes outside parliamentary business hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.999.1/5">I hear what noble Lords have said about overcrowding and pressure in prisons. To reinforce what we said earlier, we wish prison to be the port of last resort. We have invested greatly in this area. The Government are already investing &pound;1.3 billion in extra capacity in 2005&ndash;06. The Prison Service will increase capacity by nearly 3,500 places in existing prisons by 2006. A further 1,290 places will be provided through the new prisons currently under construction at Ashford, near Heathrow, and at Peterborough. The Prison Service continues to investigate options for providing further increases in capacity over the coming years.</p>
	<p pid="a.999.1/6">Longer-term planning is being taken forward within the correctional services review, which is looking at the future direction of correctional services as a whole. Noble Lords know all that we are doing in respect of home detention curfew, intermediate sentences, conditions and reformation and the way in which we are able to take advantage of opportunities to release people safely into the community slightly earlier than we would otherwise. We take on board the noble Lord's concerns. I assure him that we are addressing them. The procedures are there to ensure that there is proper accountability.</p>

	<p pid="a.1001.0/1">I am grateful to the noble Baroness for her reply. In the light of what she said, I shall look at the amendment again. However, I suspect that I shall continue to support what both noble Lords said. There is very serious concern about our prison population. No amount of tinkering or building more prisons will help because, put simply, they will be filled up.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.0/2">My approach is simple. Ultimately, if Parliament is not informed about exceeding normal capacity, the only alternative is to raise repeated debate on the subject, which we have done in the past. It will be helpful to examine what the Minister said and perhaps return to the matter on Report. In the mean time, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1001.3/1">Amendments Nos. 234 to 239 are necessary because of amendments made in the Anti-social Behaviour Bill to the Crime and Disorder Act 1998&mdash;the legislation dealing with parenting orders. The changes made in the Anti-social Behaviour Bill allow greater flexibility in the delivery of parenting programmes. They allow a programme to consist of, or to include, a residential course, provided that the court is satisfied that this is likely to be more effective than a non-residential course and that any interference with family life is proportionate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/2">The amendments deal with changes to the numbering of the Crime and Disorder Act and also ensure that, where a parenting order is imposed following a parent's failure to attend a youth offending panel meeting, the parenting order can include a requirement to attend a residential course in the same way as other parenting orders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/3">Residential parenting support will be appropriate only in exceptional cases for families in serious crisis, where the court is satisfied that this is likely to be more effective than a non-residential programme. The residential approach would enable parents to be taken out of their home to a setting that is structured so that more sustained counselling and guidance work can be carried out. Proper arrangements for the care of children will be crucial. Courses would be tailored to meet specific circumstances. Therefore, children might attend residential courses on a voluntary basis, thus enabling work to take place involving the family.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/4">Intensive work involving the whole family can be very effective. It can be carried out at a residential centre to supplement work being carried out with parents and their children separately. In some other circumstances, a short period away from their children is exactly what parents need in order to concentrate and benefit from structured counselling and guidance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.3/5">I have sought to outline these amendments more fully because I know that a number of noble Lords not present in the Chamber today are anxious about such provisions. I thought it right to put them on record. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.1002.2/1">Amendments Nos. 238 and 239 respond to an undertaking made by the Government in Committee in the Commons to consider, in light of a proposed amendment, whether to include local education authorities in the list of agencies on whom a duty to co-operate with the police, probation and prison services&mdash;the &quot;responsible authority&quot;&mdash;in the establishment of arrangements to assess and manage the risks posed by sexual and violent offenders will be placed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002.2/2">These arrangements, commonly referred to as the multi-agency public protection arrangements, the MAPPA, were originally introduced by the Criminal Justice and Court Services Act 2001. The Criminal Justice Bill strengthens them by requiring other agencies to co-operate with the responsible authority in each area to the extent compatible with their existing statutory responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002.2/3">In practical terms, including local education authorities in the &quot;duty to co-operate&quot; provisions will help the responsible authority to take fuller consideration of any risks that a particular offender may pose to children for whom the LEA has a statutory duty. It will also enable LEAs to draw to the attention of the responsible authority, and to the other duty to co-operate bodies, concerns that they may have about the vulnerability of a particular child to the risks posed by an offender.</p>
	<p pid="a.1002.2/4">Such a strengthening of the MAPPA will therefore improve inter-agency liaison and joint working to which the report of the noble Lord, Lord Laming, into the tragic death of Victoria Climbie drew attention.

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.1003.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100634" speakername="Lord Thomas of Gresford" colon=":" colnum="1003"  time="018:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-20.htm#31015-20_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.1003.1/1">Although this clause consists of only one line and looks rather inoffensive, it conceals what is an absolute scandal in relation to the Criminal Records Bureau.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003.1/2">In June of this year the Criminal Records Bureau was in a dire state when figures on its performance were published. The bureau had set a target for 95 per cent of standard checks to be completed in one week. By March 2003 only 19.4 per cent of those cases met the target. The target for enhanced checks was 90 per cent to be completed within three weeks. In practice, the target was achieved in only 52.4 per cent of cases. On valid applications a target of 98 per cent was set to be achieved by March 2003, but it was achieved by only 6.5 per cent. So the bureau was in a complete mess, under-resourced and a bureaucratic nightmare.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003.1/3">The solution opted for by the bureau was to double the criminal record check fees on 1st July of this year from &pound;12 to &pound;24. Even after that was done, the bureau's books will not be balanced until 2007, losing &pound;12 on every check carried out.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003.1/4">The record checks in question are those carried out for people in sensitive occupations, and it is against that background that Clause 298 has been introduced into the Bill, together with Schedule 29. That schedule contains clauses introduced as amendments by the Home Secretary, seeking powers to allow the staff of private companies to have access to the police and criminal records of applicants to positions in teaching and social and voluntary work. Such information is extremely sensitive, but it is to be made available to a private company. It will be accessed by staff who are not properly vetted and not aware of data protection issues and confidentiality. This is a short-term solution to address the total failure of the Criminal Records Bureau to process the volume of work it receives accurately and in a speedy fashion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1003.1/5">Instead of tackling directly the problems faced by the Criminal Records Bureau, this proposal is a short-term effort to bring in private companies to carry out functions which should properly be confidential and controlled by government. We oppose the clause and we shall oppose the schedule when it is put forward.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.1004.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100235" speakername="Baroness Gibson of Market Rasen" colon=":" colnum="1004"  time="018:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-20.htm#31015-20_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.1004.0/1">I rise to speak to Amendment No. 239A. This amendment has been tabled following anxieties expressed to me by the Civil Service unions, in particular by the PCS, the Public and Commercial Services union. I seek the removal of paragraph 10 of Schedule 29 because I could not think of any other way of raising the questions that I want to put to my noble friend on the Front Bench.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004.0/2">This new addition to Part 5 of the Police Act 1997 allows the Secretary of State to delegate what are described as, &quot;relevant functions&quot; to,</p>
	<p pid="a.1004.0/3" class="indent">&quot;such parties as he may determine&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004.0/4">It is that wording which worries both myself and the PCS union. To say the least, the wording is very loose. As the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, has already pointed out, it refers to an area which concerns sensitive information and where the need for confidentiality is paramount. What are the &quot;relevant functions&quot; and who are the persons to be determined by the Secretary of State? Surely these should be spelt out in the schedule.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004.0/5">The paragraph raises a number of other issues. First, I understand that the idea for this proposal came from an independent review team, chaired by Patrick Carter, which reported almost a year ago, in December 2002. The PCS believes that things have moved on and that the proposals may no longer be needed. Perhaps my noble friend could comment on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004.0/6">Secondly, if the proposals are needed, the PCS believes that they could blur the line between the public and private sectors and those who work in them&mdash;a danger already indicated by the noble Lord. In terms of the public services, obviously the PCS is keen to ensure that public sector responsibilities are adhered to and that confidentiality in centres of information is protected and preserved.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004.0/7">Thirdly, I understand that some areas of Home Office work are already being outsourced by the Capita group to India. It would be extremely worrying if this area was likely to be outsourced. I believe that measures are needed to ensure that this important work is carefully protected, preferably by writing into the schedule the appropriate safeguards.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004.0/8">Finally, I refer to the implementation of this part of the schedule. Would its enactment be subjected to the affirmative resolution procedure; that is, will any proposals for enactment be presented to Parliament before they are put into effect? If not, that would leave the Secretary of State with a great deal of power in a very delicate area. I hope that my noble friend can set my mind at rest on these issues.</p>

	<p pid="a.1005.3/1">That is how I understood the position. I am responding to the clause stand part debate, which is not an amendment but a discussion on the clause itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/2">In doing so, as the Committee would expect, I do not intend to claim for a second that the establishment of the Criminal Records Bureau has been one of the Government's finest processes of implementation. It has been bedevilled by problems and it has been a very difficult challenge to get it right.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/3">Having said that, let me explain why these measures will be a part of the continuing process of improvement to ensure that the Criminal Records Bureau is able to fulfil its extremely important function of ensuring that no one is employed by public or other bodies in situations where, because of their past records, they might put the vulnerable public at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/4">Clause 298 and Schedule 29 make a number of amendments to Part 5 of the Police Act 1997, which sets out the statutory framework under which the Criminal Records Bureau operates. The Committee will be aware of the difficulties faced by the CRB in its first few months. As a result of these difficulties, my right honourable friend the Home Secretary, as pointed out by the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson of Market Rasen, appointed an independent review team, led by Patrick Carter, to take a fundamental look at the operations of the CRB. The provisions in Schedule 29 flow directly from the review team's recommendations. Their aim is to further improve the performance of the CRB so that it is well placed to meet future challenges as demand for disclosure services continues to grow.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/5">The recommendations should be viewed against the backdrop of a sustained improvement in the CRB's performance since last autumn. The bureau is now issuing on average 40,000 disclosures a week compared with 24,500 in August 2002. It is also now meeting its service standards for turnaround times, with more than 90 per cent of standard and enhanced disclosures being issued within two and four weeks respectively. However, the Home Office is not complacent. We need to build on these improvements in performance and ensure that the CRB has the necessary capacity to meet all the demands for its services, particularly in relation to higher level disclosures.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/6">This is where the review team's recommendations and these amendments to the Police Act come in. The CRB is a vital element of the Government's programme to improve the protection of children and vulnerable adults from those who might wish to harm them. To meet this objective, the CRB must be placed on a sounder footing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/7">The amendments to the 1997 Act give effect to four of the review team's recommendations. First, they recognise and upgrade the critical role of registered bodies. The CRB is too remote from an applicant for a disclosure to carry out the identity validation process effectively. This role ought properly to fall to the registered body which countersigns the application, but with scope to delegate the function to the employer or other agent in appropriate cases. To ensure that registered bodies discharge their responsibilities effectively, the amendments enable the CRB to attach conditions to a registration and to suspend or cancel a registration where such conditions are breached.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/8">The second issue addressed by the amendments concerns the electronic submission of applications. Recent consultation carried out by the Home Office with registered bodies suggests that there is strong support for an electronic channel. Many registered bodies will wish to adopt such a channel as their preferred means of submitting disclosure applications. The migration to the electronic route will not happen overnight, but there may come a point where there will be a diminishing case on efficiency grounds for maintaining the existing telephone and paper channels. A facility to mandate the electronic channel could therefore in the future be useful, although at this point in time there is no intention to move to that forthwith.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/9">The third area covered by the amendments is the criteria for determining who qualifies for a standard disclosure and who should get an enhanced disclosure. A standard disclosure simply includes details of any criminal convictions. An enhanced disclosure also includes any relevant local police intelligence. Because applications for enhanced disclosures need to be referred to local police forces, they are necessarily more costly and time consuming. It is important therefore that we do not tie up resources producing enhanced disclosures in situations where they are not appropriate. To this end, the amendments establish a flexible mechanism to set the criteria for determining who qualifies for an enhanced disclosure and then provide the CRB with the means to ensure that such criteria are properly observed. The CRB will want to rely on education and support for registered bodies in the first instance and will exercise this new power only as a last resort.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/10">Finally, the amendments to the 1997 Act will facilitate the more flexible deployment of Civil Service and private sector staff working together under the umbrella of the CRB. I should emphasise that the power to delegate functions is discretionary. There have been some concerns about the possibility that non-civil servants will be given access to conviction information on the police national computer. No decision has been taken to delegate the PNC matching function but, were we to decide to do so, I can assure the Committee that the delegation will be subject to all appropriate safeguards, which I will spell out in more detail later.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/11">Having set out the purpose of the amendments to Part 5, let me explain the effect of removing Schedule 29 from the Bill. First, we would lose the ability to set and enforce performance standards for registered bodies. This would mean the continuation of a lack of rigour exercised by a minority of registered bodies in confirming the identity of a disclosure applicant&mdash;it is of course fundamental to the system working that you verify the identity of the person about whom the check is being made&mdash;which could open up the possibility that a known paedophile might gain access to children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/12">There would also be a continuation of the high error rate in applications forms. Some one in four forms have to be returned to registered bodies for the correction of errors or for the supply of missing information. We would also lose our ability to better define the criteria for eligibility for enhanced disclosures, as I indicated previously.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/13">There would also be no power to mandate the use of an electronic application channel&mdash;which is most likely to come on stream at some point in the future, if not immediately&mdash;and, finally, there would continue to be artificial barriers between the functions that can be carried out by civil servants and those that can be carried out by the CRB.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/14">Let me turn to the issues raised by the amendment of the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson. She asked, first, whether these powers are still necessary. The answer is yes, they are. Following the conclusions of the high level review carried out by Patrick Carter, with the active involvement of the Permanent Secretary of the Home Office, senior civil servants in the department are firmly of the view that these powers are needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/15">As I indicated, the intention behind the provision is to facilitate more effective business processes&mdash;a ghastly term&mdash;from beginning to end to ensure that the relationship between the CRB and Capita, which carries out many of the operational functions, is effectively integrated, albeit subject to appropriate checks. In other words, it is to optimise the efficiency of the CRB by rationalising management responsibilities and the respective roles in an end-to-end chain of the CRB and Capita. The current system creates artificial barriers in the way of efficient end-to-end processes. However, I emphasise that this power is discretionary. In the event that we decide to go down this route, the delegation will be subject to appropriate safeguards to protect sensitive information.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/16">I shall list those safeguards because they go to the heart of the question of whether there is risk involved in this. I apologise for speaking at length but there are concerns about these issues. The safeguards are as follows. All staff with access to the PNC would be vetted to a level equivalent to an enhanced disclosure. Paragraph 11 of Schedule 29 to the Bill contains a specific new offence of unauthorised disclosure of information obtained in connection with a delegated function which would apply if a member of Capita's staff passed on, without proper authority, information obtained from the PNC.</p>
	<p pid="a.1005.3/17">Next, all bodies gaining access to the PNC for the first time are checked by the Police Information Technology Organisation&mdash;PITO&mdash;which is responsible for managing the PNC and sets strict security safeguards. All users have unique ID and a password system operates. They are required to operate in accordance with security operating procedures&mdash;I will not go into detail. Access to the PNC is auditable by the CRB itself, by PITO and by the police.</p>

	<p pid="a.1009.3/1">The short answer is no. After someone has won a competition on very large procurements&mdash;I am speaking in generalities&mdash;there is usually a fairly complex negotiation to go from the competition into a final contract. When that contract is let, its terms apply for the period of the contract as it runs. There are always, in such cases, processes for revision and alteration to the contract.</p>

	<p pid="a.1009.3/3">I was asked if the delegation of power is subject to any parliamentary procedure. The straight answer is no: the power to delegate the Secretary of State's functions under Part 5 of the Police Act 1997 is not subject to parliamentary procedure. No objection to this was raised by the Select Committee on Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.1009.3/4">In response to an implied question by the noble Earl, Lord Russell, the contract was for 10 years, after which time it will be retendered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1009.3/5">In short&mdash;perhaps in long&mdash;those are the main issues to which I have sought to respond. I have sought to explain why these powers are necessary and why we believe they will help to improve the service to the bodies that require it, therefore improving public protection, which is, of course, what this is all about.</p>

	<p pid="a.1009.4/1">I had not intended to intervene, but I am driven to do so by having considered the debate in the other place. I recall an earlier exchange in this House in which my noble friend Lady Blatch pointed out the problems that this House has when clauses and schedules are not debated properly in the other place. I was enjoying listening to the Minister when he was reading out his speaking note, because it followed, almost exactly, the speech made on 20th May in the other place by Mr Paul Goggins, except that the Minister was able to complete his remarks. Mr Goggins was rudely interrupted by his own guillotine Motion. He had started:</p>

	<p pid="a.1009.4/3">Nothing more was heard by the other place. A guillotine Motion deprived the other place of debating this at all. Fortunately we have now had the conclusion&mdash;or, indeed, the substantial part&mdash;of what Mr Goggins intended to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.1009.4/4">I am concerned about the way in which the focus has been on blaming individuals who have tried to do what the Government have asked them to do when I believe the real blame is with the Government themselves. I would like to put that on the record. It is very easy to do so, because all I have to do is quote the present Lord Chancellor, now the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, from a speech made on 11th March in a debate with the very erudite and efficient Winifred Robinson on the &quot;Today&quot; programme. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1009.4/5" class="indent">&quot;We tried to do too much too early. We should have introduced the checks on a gradual basis. . . . The consequence of trying to do everything too early was we ended up in a situation where the CRB wasn't able to cope&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1009.4/6">He continued:</p>
	<p pid="a.1009.4/7" class="indent">&quot;We've now stabilised what the CRB does&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1009.4/8">However, the problems continue. We constantly hear press reports about how employees have been forced to wait months before starting new jobs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1009.4/9">I felt I had to put the record straight. I believe that the Government made a series of errors in setting up and demanding that the CRB should carry out these functions. I just hope that the Government will have an efficiency scrutiny of their activity in demanding the impossible as the review team now seeks to see its recommendations implemented. There is a lot to learn from this mess, and I hope the Government will learn the lessons.</p>

	<p pid="a.1010.0/1">I hope that I was clear when I introduced my remarks by indicating that not for one second did the Government seek to claim that they did not have responsibilities for how this process unrolled, even though others may have had responsibility as well. It does us no credit to pretend that we are not at fault.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010.0/2">As to lessons learnt, I recollect from the time when I was in the Home Office&mdash;not so long ago&mdash;that both Ministers and officials were seriously aware that they had learnt a lot about how to handle major projects of this sort so that they reduced the likelihood of such problems happening in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1010.0/3">Having said that, I think the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, is slightly uncharitable; the situation is nothing like as bad as it was a year ago. It certainly should not be as bad as it was a year ago because that was unacceptable. Substantial progress has been made and it is very important that we continue to sustain that rate of progress, which is why we believe these powers are necessary.</p>

	<p pid="a.1011.1/1">Earlier in this evening's proceedings, we received an assurance from the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, that a unit within her department was monitoring carefully every commitment made by a Minister to ensure that it was then implemented. I would be greatly reassured by her comments were it not for the fact that I am now being forced to introduce a new clause to exclude civil liability of victims of crime when last February the Home Secretary had a discussion with my right honourable friend Oliver Letwin, on the &quot;Today&quot; programme. In recognising the importance of the points being made by Mr Letwin, Mr Blunkett said that he would find a solution. The Home Office did not appear to have found a solution in May, even though it was said that a new clause would be put forward in this place. We are now on the final day of the Committee stage&mdash;sadly, because there is so much that we should have debated, and we have not had time properly to consider the Bill. We move towards Report stage on further days, and we have not had a new clause from the Government, which is why I am moving this new clause.</p>
	<p pid="a.1011.1/2">There has been public outrage about the fact that there appeared to be a situation in the legal system whereby a burglar could sue his or her victim and recover damages with the benefit of legal aid. It is probably a euphemism to use the phrase &quot;public outrage&quot;. That marvellous campaigning newspaper, the Daily Mail, has highlighted it on many occasions, as have the BBC and others.</p>
	<p pid="a.1011.1/3">The new clause raises the issue of civil proceedings brought by criminals against their victims after their conviction and arising out of the circumstances in which they committed the offence. The clause would wholly deprive anyone convicted of a crime of the right to sue or bring civil proceedings against their victim on the basis of the circumstances in which they committed the offence. In many ways, we on these Benches are seeking to turn the Home Secretary's words into action, given the lack of any response from the Government in moving a new clause, as was originally promised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1011.1/4">We are all aware of the extent to which the current system has given rise to that serious public disquiet. There have been a number of high profile cases, the most notable of which is probably that of Mr Tony Martin. I do not want to make a comparison with that case, because it is certainly not acceptable in any way to use excessive force. However, there are provisions in the existing system, in the criminal law, to deal with the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1011.1/5">The public, and many noble Lords, feel most strongly about the issue of compensation, for several reasons. First, if a criminal commences civil litigation, public money is often put at his disposal&mdash;a fact that is widely reported by the press. Secondly, the present system does not allow many victims of crime to receive compensation. Obviously, if they suffer injury, they are entitled to go to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. However, very often there are material losses to the victims&mdash;usually the poorest, who are often uninsured. It is often hard or even impossible for them to recover from those losses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1011.1/6">The law as regards self-defence, which should also be considered with regard to the new clause, is also unsatisfactory. What constitutes reasonable force, with which one is legally allowed to defend oneself, one's family and one's home, is decided in accordance with the facts of each case. However, from the way in which cases are reported in the press, it is now unclear to most people in the country whether they can defend their homes or themselves without problems or the fear of being sued. That is surely an untenable situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1011.1/7">I hope that the Government respond positively to the new clause and enable law-abiding people to feel that they can defend their homes without the fear that they may be punished twice. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.1012.0/1">We on these Benches support the new clause. It is very important that the victims of crime receive proper compensation. I know that the Minister will give us an assurance that the level of compensation paid under the compensation scheme will continue as it is now. Victims should not carry the burden of legal proceedings being brought against them on top of what they have suffered personally and physically. We support the new clause.</p>

	<p pid="a.1013.0/1">In supporting the amendments moved by my noble friend Lord Hunt, I repeat the question asked by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas. My noble friend referred to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. Is any review taking place at the moment of the scope of the board? If so, what are its terms and when will we know its outcome?</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.1013.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100212" speakername="Lord Filkin" colon=":" colnum="1013"  time="019:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-22.htm#31015-22_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.1013.1/1">I thank the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, for tabling this important amendment. I make it clear that the Home Secretary does not intend to resile in any way from the commitments that he gave. I shall explain in the course of my comments why there has been some delay.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013.1/2">The amendment would prevent any person who has been convicted of a criminal offence from pursuing a civil action in damages for any personal injury caused by a range of people falling within the definition of a &quot;victim&quot; of the offence, unless the court considered that it was in the interests of justice for the action to be brought.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013.1/3">The Government are sympathetic to the concerns raised by the Opposition in this area, and recognise the need for people to have confidence in the justice system. It is important that victims of crime are not subject to unjustified claims for damages when they have acted reasonably and proportionately in defending themselves or their property. We recognise that there may occasionally be cases that raise public disquiet and understand the concerns that can be raised by even one case. The Government have indicated that we shall take action.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013.1/4">We are thinking along the same lines as this amendment, but we consider that some aspects of it need to be improved. For example, it is unclear how and when a claim should proceed and what mechanisms would enable it to do so. The amendment would give a very wide discretion to the courts as to whether the claim should proceed, which could operate to reduce its effectiveness. It would cover corporate bodies and the proprietary interests of the victim, which we believe may not be the best approach, but would not protect from civil action a third party such as a police officer who had intervened to defend the victim. It also does not make clear that other defences currently available to the victim would continue to be available, such as the doctrine of ex turpi causa non oritur actio, which can operate to deny an action arising from a base cause.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013.1/5">We therefore intend to bring forward a government amendment which is clearer and more focused, and which will genuinely strengthen courts' powers to reject unmeritorious claims. This is a complex area of the law, and any amendment could have implications for a number of related areas, including the common law on self-defence; the law on negligence and contributory negligence; and the application by the courts of certain common law doctrines such as ex turpi causa. We are giving those implications very careful consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013.1/6">We have also been considering the concerns raised by the public about the granting of legal aid to fund the type of case that we are discussing. Public funding is intended to help the least well off in society with the cost of legal advice, and it is open to anyone who wishes to bring or defend proceedings in the English or Welsh courts to apply through a solicitor to the Legal Services Commission for funding. The criteria for the grant and withdrawal of public funding are laid down by Parliament. The Legal Services Commission cannot differentiate between applicants on the grounds that a decision to grant funding may be unpopular. Decisions are made solely according to whether an application meets the statutory criteria. Funding applications are assessed according to a means and merit test. Only those applicants who satisfy both statutory tests will qualify.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013.1/7">Reference was made to Mr Fearon, who was granted some limited legal aid funding under the Legal Aid Act 1988. A more stringent merit test was introduced under the Access to Justice Act 1999. The Lord Chancellor has directed the Legal Services Commission to include the current criteria for funding personal injury cases in its consultation about changes to the scope of Community Legal Service funding and the funding code later in the year, with a view to tightening the rules in that area, so that any future claim, such as that of Brendon Fearon, would be excluded from the normal scope of the Community Legal Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013.1/8">An application for public funding under the exceptional funding powers under Section 6(8)(b) of the Access to Justice Act 1999 would be possible for any excluded service. However, an application would be less likely to meet the additional criteria set for exceptional funding.</p>
	<p pid="a.1013.1/9">I hope that by outlining the measures that we are taking forward on both the civil law and legal aid, the Government have made clear their intention to address concerns that have been raised. However, as I indicated, this is a complex area of civil law and it is important to produce a clear, strong and effective amendment that does not have any damaging effects on the wider law. Unfortunately, it has not been possible to finalise matters in time to put forward an amendment at this stage of the Bill. However, we aim to bring forward an amendment on Report. I hope that on that basis the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, on behalf of the noble Baroness, will not press the amendment. We are trying&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1016.2/1">I speak for a number of Members of the Committee when I say that it may be the repetition which is causing us some concern. Here we are right at the eleventh hour with a matter of days to go before the consideration on the proceedings of this Bill will be concluded. We have a statement that the amendment which I had the opportunity of moving this evening is substantially what the Government would like to see but that they would like to make certain changes to it. Therefore, it is not clear to me why the Government do not accept the amendment and seek to improve it on Report. At least we would then have a basis on which we could work. As the noble Viscount pointed out, it may well be that the Minister already has a draft, in which case it would be very helpful indeed if he published it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1016.2/2">The only other point I make concerns my serious disquiet about the review of the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. I believe that we read about it in the press but I was not aware until this evening that the Government had confirmed that there was such a review. That causes considerable concern as in my experience of government the Treasury's hand will be somewhere within this. If I am wrong, let the Minister say that the Treasury is not at all involved in this matter. The Treasury will be looking for better value for money from the Criminal Injuries Compensation Board. The review is bad news for victims. I regret the fact that it just slipped out during the Minister's speech. I hope that the Minister will indicate whether he has a draft amendment and why he will not accept our amendment as a basis on which improvements could be made. I think that everyone is a little bewildered about why we cannot make progress.</p>

	<p pid="a.1017.0/1">I believe that I signalled at length why we thought that the amendment had merit in principle. However, considerable areas of difficulty arise regarding specific legal points on the intersection with other areas of civil law. Therefore, it would mislead the Committee to accept the amendment at this point. The best process is to bring forward an amendment as soon as possible which meets exactly the same issue that the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, wishes to achieve, but does it in a way that we consider is right and sound. We shall do that as early as we possibly can but it is important that we bring forward a sound amendment. I am advised that we shall try to table the amendments one week before they are due to be debated, if we possibly can. I think that is an improvement on what I said previously.</p>
	<p pid="a.1017.0/2">To be short about the criminal injuries compensation, there was a leak. I gave a straightforward response as a result of that leak. We make it clear that we will have a consultation paper which we will put out for proper consultation as soon as we can. There has been no breach of parliamentary procedure whatever on that; clearly, there has been a breach of some other codes in terms of divulging confidential government information. I hope that there will be general rejoicing at the serious intent to come forward with a consultation paper on criminal injuries, and we very much hope that Members of the Committee will participate in and respond to that.</p>

	<p pid="a.1018.0/1">The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, has done some excellent work on the amendment and bringing the issue forward, but that last comment is unworthy of him.

However, I shall not go over that, except to say that we immediately made the situation on leaks open and clear in a Statement to Parliament. That is what I rather regret is not happening. The Government may well have been caught by surprise, but something has leaked. Perhaps there should be a more detailed explanation, but that is for another time and place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.1/2">I am also very disappointed about the lack of any new clause or amendment so far, but heartened that it will be with us at least one week before we debate the issue again. I am comforted by that, and in those circumstances I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1018.6/1" pwmotiontext="asked">rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what progress has been made on African development strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/2">My Lords, this is a somewhat ambitious topic for dealing with in a dinner debate, but I am encouraged by the number of noble Lords who intend to contribute, albeit for three minutes each. Many of them have long experience of business, public administration or NGO work in Africa, and all will add real value to my main theme. In one respect, that theme is very simple. It is that a huge cultural change is needed for the African economy to grow to its full potential, but we have a golden opportunity to bring it about, with NePAD linked to a positive North/South agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/3">On 1st November, Ghana, nearly 50 years after its independence, will be the first country to be peer-reviewed under the procedure of the New Partnership for Africa's Development, and although President Nkrumah may be turning in his grave, it is indeed a red-letter day. It puts economics, and above all the totally inadequate levels of investment, into the proper context of the wider problems of peace and war, corruption and the gross misuse of power. It leads to a question for the developed world: how can we go further to incentivise NePAD by budgetary support in rewarding delivery?</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/4">A survey was published a week ago by Transparency International showing that many parts of Africa have a culture of deeply embedded corruption&mdash;bribing the taxman not to collect taxes, gross diversion of funds, and so on. Let us not beat about the bush: all that adds up to a guarantee that, if matters carry on like this, those economies will remain stagnant for a very long time indeed. To make the change requires a veritable cultural revolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/5">So far as we in Europe are concerned&mdash;there are at least half a dozen countries with a major colonial legacy, warts and all&mdash;we must answer those who say that we should hand over more cash without strings or, as the term has it, without prescriptive policies. The contention is that prescriptive policies often ignore local conditions and have no local ownership, and so on. They and we together have to remove layers and layers of doublespeak from this whole question.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/6">Here in the UK as part of the European Union, we too are at the receiving end, if you want to put it that way, of prescriptive policies in terms of human rights, obviously in terms of budget deficits, and in terms of environment, company mergers and framework conditions for employment. Indeed, it is true of nearly every department in Whitehall. However, African countries know that that is the sort of set-up to which they now aspire. Mr Amaoko, executive director of the UN Economic Commission for Africa, said at a meeting of the All-Party Group on Africa last month that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/7" class="indent">&quot;unless these governance and corruption issues are tackled more aggressively in Africa there is no chance of meeting the minimum development targets&mdash;notably on poverty&mdash;and the 7 per cent economic growth&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/8">per annum&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/9" class="indent">&quot;which that logically entails by 2015&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/10">My one reservation about the otherwise excellent update of the UK action plan is that it tends to pull its punches on that key issue of corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/11">One of the great values of NePAD is that it has focused our minds in a remarkable way on three interrelated levels of mutual accountability. The first level is within each African country, the second between African countries, and the third between Africa and first-world countries. That means that each of those partners has to put something on the table. It can mean benchmarks of performance or frameworks of governance. Of course, it can mean reform of the rules of international trade and investment, both North/South and within Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/12">I also hope that my noble friend will agree that the strengthening interface between NePAD in Johannesburg and the African Union in Addis Ababa augurs well for a new type of AU/EU interface on Africa, albeit with some leading countries in Africa pushing the programme forward as regional champions. Likewise in the EU, I take Britain and France as the exemplars that should drive forward the EU agenda and bring in other countries with long-standing interest in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/13">In that connection, some confusion seems to have arisen post-Cancun on the semantics of bilateralism versus multilateralism. There are in fact at least two quite different usages for the terms, and that can be quite off-putting in such formulations as,</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/14" class="indent">&quot;the poorest in Africa will suffer the most from any move from Multilateralism to bilateralism&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/15">Of course that is true if it means picking off African countries one by one. It is feared that the big economic powers could stand in the position of a lion negotiating with a mouse. There is an immanent danger of that and we must not allow it to happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/16">On the contrary, however, it is certainly not true of AU/EU relations. The idea of regional groupings is one whose time has come. Such types of jointly designed initiatives are essential for Africa if it is to get the investment needed to get anywhere near meeting the development goals. Essential as aid is&mdash;I salute the work of all those agencies at every level involved&mdash;being totally aid-dependent is certainly no answer. The fact is that there is a dearth of profitable private investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/17">A very timely report published this summer by a semi-official US-led group, entitled The Commission on Capital Flows to Africa&mdash;A 10-year Strategy, notes that the continent today attracts less than 1 per cent of global capital flows and accounts for less than 1 per cent of world trade. Africa has 10 per cent of the world's population&mdash;800 million or so&mdash;with only 1 per cent of the world's capital flows. One does not have to be Einstein to see Africa falling further behind the rest of the world on that basis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/18">The US study calls for the US to complete a free trade agreement with Africa in 10 years; that is, a bilateral arrangement with America, set out in a treaty. America would support investment through cheap credit in sensitive areas such as textiles and apparel, electronics and agribusiness.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/19">Although inadequate capital flows are in part a proxy for economic viability, relying largely on the accumulation of domestic capital, they offer a revealing way of analysing the broader issue. It would be helpful to have a high-level EU study and recommendations for action to complement that carried out by the Americans. The OECD is also sponsoring work in that area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/20">The straight-up business agenda produces a sharp dilemma for many African countries wanting to attract investment. They see the conditions set by business as a very mixed blessing. However, there is no alternative to some agreed framework, not just dictated by business, but agreed with governments and trade unions. I am pleased to note that the latter have now been invited to join the umbrella consultative committee for NePAD for precisely those reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/21">That is the key to unravelling the &quot;Catch 22&quot; of very little private investment and a poor public sector tax base. Those must go hand in hand if we are to find work for the reserve army of unemployed&mdash;or unproductively employed&mdash;who make up a rapidly rising number in the urban areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/22">On HIV/AIDS, I am not competent to comment, but simply note how poignant it was to hear a development worker say that if 300 US dollars spent on a retroviral drug gave an African expert in Malawi one more year of life, it would be worth it. That gives the dismal science of economics a whole new dimension. Fifty per cent of the staff of the National Audit Office of Zambia have died of AIDS. That too is devastating for the economy. The AIDS pandemic is a deterrent to private investment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/23">I turn finally to inter-ethnic questions. Those too are very much part of the economic equation. The past 50 years show that if one had to write one golden commandment for Africa, it would be, &quot;Thou shalt not stir up ethnic resentments&quot;. Zimbabwe is not the only example that springs to mind. The good news is that some otherwise unpromising countries have succeeded economically, having earlier been written off as hopeless, precisely because they learnt that lesson.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/24">The little island of Mauritius was written off by British experts a generation ago as having no natural resources, but it has achieved remarkable success. That success was not automatic, just because it has wonderful beaches. Through hard work and a cunningly constructed, inclusive electoral system, involving four-member constituencies, everybody has seen the necessity of entrenching peace between the mix of Creoles&mdash;people of African descent; Indians, of Hindu, Moslem and Buddhist backgrounds; British and French; Arabs and Chinese and one or two more besides.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/25">As Ministers there told us a year ago,</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/26" class="indent">&quot;When African leaders come here to Mauritius, they all ask, 'What is your secret'? We answer, 'That is our secret'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/27">Inter-ethnic conflict is at the heart of many problems. At their worst, as we see from Amin in Uganda onwards, such conflicts lead to open warfare and savagery.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/28">So there is hope or despair. Our purpose is to show our understanding and our determination that nothing will be allowed to stand in the way of helping Africa to make the huge cultural leap, because the people of Africa deserve no less.</p>
	<p pid="a.1018.6/29">I look forward to the debate and I know that I speak for all noble Lords in saying how encouraged we are by the fact that my noble friend the Leader of the House will maintain an active interest in this portfolio and continue to bring her own considerable standing to bear.</p>

	<p pid="a.1021.0/1">My Lords, I shall complement the excellent speech of the noble Lord, Lord Lea, by concentrating briefly on Sierra Leone. That country is at the bottom of the UN world index of human development. That is after 11 years of civil war.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/2">Sierra Leone is a special responsibility for the United Kingdom. How we help Sierra Leone deal with poverty is a touchstone of our overseas development assistance. A 10-year plan to reduce poverty was agreed by Her Majesty's Government and the Government of Sierra Leone in February. We all hope that a full strategy will be agreed for implementation by the middle of next year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/3">The &pound;30 million of direct aid from the UK Government is significant. Clare Short is to be congratulated, as is the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, for supporting that programme. There are two key ways in which that aid should be used. We should realise that 60 per cent of the budget of Sierra Leone is provided by donor assistance. The two key elements are standards of governance and democracy, and economic development. Democracy and development go hand in hand. One cannot have one without the other.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/4">I turn briefly to governance. President Kabbah has made an impressive start and we should support him, as I do. The special court should come to a speedy, sensible and clear conclusion; corruption must be put down and local government should be developed. We should also ensure the independence of the media.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/5">A delegation will travel from this Parliament to Sierra Leone in November, which I hope to join. In terms of governance, the continued interest of this Parliament in the Government of Sierra Leone and its Parliament will help.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/6">I turn finally to economic development. One priority about which I feel strongly is agribusiness. The transport costs of moving goods even from countries that are not landlocked&mdash;Sierra Leone has an excellent port&mdash;are great. We need investment in roads to help people up-country to move their products.</p>
	<p pid="a.1021.0/7">The noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, referred to the drop in private sector investment in developing nations. It has fallen sharply since 1997. More could be done in the United Kingdom to encourage UK investment in Sierra Leone. The problem is that the perception of many British businessmen lags behind the reality. That reality is a turn-around in governance and the beginnings of real development in Sierra Leone. I am pleased that trade missions have restarted and I hope that the noble Baroness can reassure the House that Sierra Leone remains a continued high priority for the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.1022.0/1">My Lords, I too thank the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, for the debate and shall follow the line of the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, in confining my remarks to the position of what was the Belgian Congo and is now the Democratic Republic of Congo, whence I returned at the weekend, having been part of a five-person&mdash;four MPs and myself&mdash;parliamentary delegation that went there last week at the invitation of the government. I have never returned from anywhere in such a state of both despair and zeal. I felt despair because the country was in a condition which would take me an hour merely to sketch. It is in a state of degradation and collapse that beggars description. However, I felt a sense of zeal because, although the country is not and has never been part of the specifically British connection, it is at the very heart of Africa, with nine bordering states, many of them with their own enormous problems: Burundi, Rwanda, Uganda&mdash;one could go on and on. It is a country the size of Europe, with 60 million people, and it is in what one would call the last-chance saloon.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022.0/2">The Congo has been bedevilled by a history that has seen no light&mdash;Joseph Conrad's Heart of Darkness might be the title of a book about the Congo today&mdash;save the fact that there has been one miracle in the past year, which is the creation of a transitional national government. That comprises all the warring factions in the Congo, which as recently as July of this year inaugurated a combined and united government with Joseph Kabila as president and four vice-presidents. We spent more than an hour in the company of all of them and were, on the whole, greatly impressed by them. For the first time there is the beginning of demobilisation and disarmament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022.0/3">However, with all that&mdash;the programmes and commissions they have set up and the work they are doing, especially via the United Nations &quot;MONUC&quot; with 13,000 men operating now under Chapter 7 so that they can actively intervene in the north-east where fighting still continues&mdash;the Congo needs at least one more great miracle. It needs to hold elections by the end of 2005 in a situation in which it has no electoral roll; where the cost of transport exhausts one-third of the UN budget in that country; where there is no road or rail network; and where corruption, fear and lawlessness are endemic.</p>
	<p pid="a.1022.0/4">I suggest to the House and to the Government that although we have been generous and increased our aid&mdash;this year we will be giving &pound;28 million in bilateral aid and perhaps another &pound;5 million in multilateral aid&mdash;with all the other contending demands the UK should take the lead in bringing together the OAS and the EU to draw up a special plan that is especially needed at this unique time. The Congo needs to get through the transition period and two years beyond. My time is up and I am grateful for the opportunity to make these few and inadequate comments.</p>

	<p pid="a.1023.0/1">My Lords, few politicians have worked harder on the issues at the heart of this challenging debate than my noble friend the Leader of the House in recent years. When she comes to reply, I hope that she will feel able to reassure us on the following concerns: the food crisis of southern Africa and the particular vulnerability of Zimbabwe, Angola and Lesotho.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023.0/2">In the case of Zimbabwe, it is imperative on no account to let the grave political situation divert us from a determination to find effective ways to assist the people in their desperate plight. It seems to me significant that Save the Children Fund, for one, believes that it can still implement programmes there without endangering the humanitarian principles which govern all its work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023.0/3">On NePAD, as Christian Aid powerfully argues, it is important to balance any &quot;Marshall Plan&quot; approach by both a genuine commitment to bottom-up development work and a determination to listen to civil society in the region&mdash;Churches, trade unions, NGOs and the rest&mdash;and to respond to validity in their analysis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023.0/4">There must be support for an indigenous private sector and a realisation that level playing fields in world trade are not enough. Nations have to reach a level of fitness in order to be able to play. There must also be an honest appraisal of how far orthodox liberal economic theory alone, not to say dogma, can provide the social infrastructure essential for decent life and development. As my noble friend has argued, we must look at the role of social mores, ethics and a stand against corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023.0/5">In general, we must all have at the top of our concern a refusal to allow resources to be diverted from Africa to Iraq and Afghanistan, where additionality must be the order of the day, and a recognition of the inescapability of our own responsibilities in the so-called developed world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023.0/6">Oxfam and others&mdash;I declare an interest as an Oxfam Association member&mdash;repeatedly emphasised these responsibilities as follows. On trade, urgent action is needed to deal with the immense damage being done by subsidies that rich western countries pay to their farm sectors to produce a glut of cheap food and cotton, much of which is dumped on world markets, undercutting African and other farmers and robbing millions of their potential livelihoods. The CAP is a major culprit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023.0/7">On aid, there is a necessity for the G8 to deliver the extra 6 billion dollars per year it has promised to Africa and to agree a timetable for reaching the 25 to 35 billion dollars a year which the UN estimates will be required for Africa to meet the millennium development goals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023.0/8">On debt, the G8 really must stop the prevarication and cancel the debts of African countries struggling to make repayments at the expense of their health and education systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1023.0/9">It is totally unacceptable that the world's poorest people, in their punishing struggle to survive let alone progress, should be crippled by debts accumulated in previous decades by undemocratic and corrupt leaders and their regimes.</p>

	<p pid="a.1024.0/1">My Lords, I, too, am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Lea, for giving us the opportunity to focus on this important matter. The Church of England fully supports the Millennium Development Goals. However, based on current trends, it is concerned that most of the goals will not be reached in southern Africa by 2015. It is upon this region that I want to concentrate in this short contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024.0/2">The UN Economic Commission for Africa has estimated that countries in southern Africa require a minimum sustained growth rate of 6.2 per cent per year to reach the income poverty target in 2015. Only Mozambique has grown more than 6 per cent in the past few years. During the 1990s, the average growth rate in Zambia has been 1.6 per cent and in conflict and war-ridden Angola, 0.5 per cent has been the rate. The Zimbabwean economy is the fastest contracting in the world today, with GDP shrinking by 17 per cent in 2002.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024.0/3">Six out of the eight MDGs certainly will not be reached if the international community fails to prevent the continuing rapid spread in the prevalence of HIV/AIDS in southern Africa. The loss of assets and income, the reduced ability of caregivers, usually women, to work and mounting medical fees and funeral expenses are pushing already poor households deeper into poverty across the region.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024.0/4">HIV/AIDS has been a major contributing factor to increasing child mortality, as increasing numbers of children are being born infected with the virus, dramatically reducing their life expectancy. In the absence of HIV/AIDS, southern African countries would have been well on their way to halting the incidence of malaria and tuberculosis by 2015. As it is, these targets are almost out of reach.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024.0/5">What can be done? First, an increase in bilateral overseas development aid is needed. To this end, the Churches welcome and support the Chancellor's proposal for an international finance faculty intended to double the amount of development aid from OECD countries by 2015.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024.0/6">Secondly, in the wake of the Cancun disappointments, fresh efforts need to be made to open up markets to African producers. It was good to hear the reflection of the noble Baroness the Leader of the House on that in Monday's debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024.0/7">Thirdly, the cancellation of bilateral and multilateral debt is the essential component in any attempts to get within striking distance of MDG targets. Meanwhile, the Church remains a fully committed partner in every country in Africa and in a supporting role here in Britain.</p>
	<p pid="a.1024.0/8">Across the river today in another palace, some dozen African archbishops have been meeting fellow primates from around the world under the leadership of the most reverend Primate the Archbishop of Canterbury. Important though their agenda may be, arguably the agenda in your Lordships' House this evening is of far more relevance to the people of Africa, for our agenda is literally a matter of life or death.</p>

	<p pid="a.1025.0/1">My Lords, it is impossible to do justice to this important debate in our allotted three minutes, but I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Lea of Crondall, for again giving us the opportunity to debate African development strategies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1025.0/2">There have been a number of major success stories in Africa this year&mdash;in particular, the removal of Charles Taylor from Liberia and, just last week, the breakthrough in Burundi, laying the foundations for a formula for a democratic government in that country. Of course, not only did the brief visit of President Bush reaffirm the United States' commitment to conflict resolution in Africa; it was also backed by a commitment in terms of promises of billions of dollars for tackling HIV/AIDS and assisting reform-minded governments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1025.0/3">On the other hand, there have been some concerns: the Great Lakes conflict is still unresolved; the situation in Zimbabwe continues to deteriorate; and, as we debated just last week, the unsuccessful outcome of the Cancun meeting of the World Trade Organisation was disappointing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1025.0/4">So quo vadis the African development strategies? While we all support the need, objectives and principles of NePAD, the reality is that, despite the high expectations, NePAD has not made great progress in the past year. Of course, there are the exceptions of Senegal and Kenya, where great progress has been made. NePAD's credibility has certainly been harmed by the inability of African leaders to expedite the resolution of the Zimbabwe crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1025.0/5">Having said that, just a few months ago I was fortunate enough to have a one-on-one meeting with President Thabo Mbeki in which he reaffirmed his confidence that a breakthrough in Zimbabwe is imminent and that there will be a change to the Zimbabwe constitution, reintroducing the position of a Prime Minister and giving President Robert Mugabe merely ceremonial powers, paving the way for a government of national unity. Well, the jury is out. We wait in expectation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1025.0/6">It is also encouraging, as the noble Lord, Lord Lea, mentioned, that 16 states have signed up for the NePAD Peer Review, which will, in all likelihood, commence in January or February next year. While there is clearly a full commitment by the G8 partners to assist in tackling the many economic, social and political challenges in Africa, all too often meaningful projects are hampered and paralysed by the lack of capacity, red tape and bureaucracy in low-income target countries. The African Union summit in Mozambique was also rather a disappointment. Many commitments were not followed through, and there certainly needs to be far more urgency in establishing the peace and security council and the roll-out of the African peacekeeping force.</p>
	<p pid="a.1025.0/7">My allotted three minutes are almost up. Her Majesty's Government have played a pivotal role in conflict resolution and post-conflict reconstruction in Africa, together with our humanitarian relief efforts. I am pleased that the noble Lord, Lord Freeman, mentioned the successes in Sierra Leone. The roadmap for Africa will be a bumpy one, but it is important that African issues keep centre stage in your Lordships' House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1027.0/1">My Lords, Kofi Annan said last week that it was more important to support people than governments. It is hard to resist the conclusion that some governments are less the mainstay of their people than the cause of their downfall.</p>
	<p pid="a.1027.0/2">The major forces for African development are still trade, aid and debt, but export subsidies have depressed prices in Africa, and African countries made a powerful and almost unanswerable case against them in Cancun. No wonder that trade talks have stalled because the EU is so unclear and such injustice is allowed to continue. How can African countries develop under the weight of such an albatross? Aid flows are just not increasing enough to finance the millennium development goals, and the likelihood of meeting those goals is fast receding, even in education.</p>
	<p pid="a.1027.0/3">Much hope is placed on the IFF, but countries will have to continue to open up their markets indiscriminately as a condition for accessing more resources. Half of all aid is still going to middle-income countries. Debt relief is the most efficient form of finance, as it will directly free up funding for poverty reduction. As the noble Lord, Lord Judd, said, that requires nothing less than the full cancellation of external debt to countries such as Mozambique, Zambia and Tanzania.</p>
	<p pid="a.1027.0/4">There have been problems with the HIPC programme, even in flagship countries like Uganda and Mozambique. Any instruments such as HIPC must be consistent with the millennium development goals, but that is not happening. The concept of debt sustainability falls down when one knows how precariously it is based on exports. It depends on coffee prices, which have lost Uganda millions in export revenue, and on foreign exchange, which has skewed Mozambique's exports in the form of one major aluminium plant.</p>
	<p pid="a.1027.0/5">With the collapse of commodity prices, countries that have been through the HIPC initiative are still in a position of unsustainable debt. In that case, what measures have been taken by the OECD countries to top up the HIPC initiative and compensate the countries affected? In the mean time, does the Minister agree that within the Africa Action Plan a more realistic debt sustainability analysis must be applied?</p>
	<p pid="a.1027.0/6">NePAD is an important initiative, which will have more success in a development than a political context, but unfortunately it advocates a single national model of economic governance and does not allow space for local initiative or people-based development. A poverty reduction strategy must address local realities. That may be why NePAD is still perceived by African civil society as a vehicle for donor conditionality and fundraising rather than the promised African renaissance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1027.0/7">However, the African Union, at its meeting in Maputo in July set up an economic and social council to engage civil society groups and that may be a positive way forward, although only in a highly controlled environment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1028.0/1">My Lords, the erosion of both grand and petty corruption is, indeed, one of the keys to development in Africa. I declare an interest as a member of Transparency International UK's advisory council and note the publication of a strong report by the Zambian chapter while I was there. DfID is funding the new Zambian anti-corruption commission, concentrating on high level corruption with co-operation from our own Serious Fraud Office. This seems to be having a knock-on effect on the petty corruption which so undermines people's confidence in a democracy and the rule of law. Half of those surveyed thought petty corruption had decreased, and all of the people I talked to, at various levels, thought so too.</p>
	<p pid="a.1028.0/2">Corruption has probably been most damaging in the extractive industries and I hope my noble friend can give us an update on the Prime Minister's Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative as well as the EU legislation on transparency and the UN Convention Against Corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.1028.0/3">Most Northern European oil companies broadly support the transparency initiative, but there is an obstacle to full transparency. Host governments tend to insert a clause obliging the agreement of all parties before disclosure can be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1028.0/4">Not all local joint venture partners, for instance, state oil companies, are into the transparency culture. So, in these cases only the western oil extractor's payments will be published, and then it is difficult to call the Government to account for their expenditure of all the oil revenues. Mr George Soros has thrown his weight behind the linked unofficial &quot;Publish What You Pay&quot; campaign, and I understand has just written to the World Bank and the IMF asking for extractive industry transparency to be made a condition for World Bank and IMF loans and for its inclusion in poverty reduction strategies&mdash;I hope not too late for Chad. May I ask my noble friend what the Government's reaction is? I hope my right honourable friend the Chancellor will support the requests.</p>
	<p pid="a.1028.0/5">Meanwhile, extreme poverty remains. I saw remarkable UNICEF projects to hold vulnerable communities together in Zambia&mdash;I declare an interest as a trustee&mdash;supporting community schools, emergency feeding and the care of AIDS orphans. These give people hope but what gives them power is the ability to earn a living. Formal employment touches only 20 per cent of the population, so other routes to economic survival must be created. That is where microfinance comes in. I declare an interest as an associate of Opportunity International.</p>
	<p pid="a.1028.0/6">In Zambia, their microcredit provides a lifeline into trading and eventually into more capital-intensive ventures. It is how school fees and medical emergencies are paid for. It will be playing a part in Zambian diversification from mining to agriculture. I hope that my noble friend can tell us something about DfID's support for microfinance.</p>

	<p pid="a.1029.0/1">My Lords, I add my thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Lea, for securing this debate. My focus tonight will be on strategies to develop the skills of African health professionals to care for Africa's young children. This approach covers the prevention of infections, the maintenance of health and treatment of ill children based on real partnership between Africans and others in African settings.</p>
	<p pid="a.1029.0/2">The Government's emphasis on helping the poorest countries of sub-Saharan Africa, one of the Millennium Development Goals, is essential for improving the prospects for children. The effectiveness of this policy can be improved by establishing sustainable services to secure better survival and health for young African children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1029.0/3">In the 1990s new medical schools established in southern African universities began educating and training local students to become doctors. This development, assisted by medical teachers from Britain, has resulted in African doctors remaining to practise in their home countries. One outstanding success has been in Malawi, where locally trained doctors provide much needed services in towns and rural areas. In the past Malawian doctors have continued to work in Europe and America where they were trained rather than return home.</p>
	<p pid="a.1029.0/4">The next step asked for by Africans is to develop doctors to become specialists, particularly paediatricians who care for sick children and teach undergraduate students. In order to achieve this without requiring African-trained doctors to spend many years in Britain or America, a partnership has recently been established between the Mandela Rhodes Foundation and the Rhodes Trust with our Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. I declare my interest as a Fellow of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health and as a patron of the college's international group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1029.0/5">This partnership discussed paediatric education for capacity building in developing countries, particularly in southern Africa, at a seminar at Magdalen College, Oxford, a fortnight ago. Lessons learned from experiences in developing countries were discussed and an action plan for southern Africa drafted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1029.0/6">The success of this partnership will be guaranteed if government, through DfID, were involved. As more African doctors, nurses and other health professionals take responsibility for childcare, we can look forward to better infant and child survival in sub-Saharan African countries.</p>
	<p pid="a.1029.0/7">The principle of capacity building the skills of Africans to promote and maintain the health of their children in Africa is also being developed against malaria. Here the investment by DfID is now being further developed by a new charity, the Malaria Consortium, of which I am chairman, to strengthen and train more African health professionals in two centres in Ghana and in Uganda to implement policies and practices to protect young children and pregnant mothers from malaria, which kills one million every year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1029.0/8">Knowing how committed the Leader of the House is to development in Africa, I look forward to her views on capacity building through skills transfer in African countries and the Government's plans for involvement in this essential activity.</p>

	<p pid="a.1030.0/1">My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall for initiating this debate. Its wording is carefully chosen because it does not imply that any particular organisations or countries are responsible. But, in asking Her Majesty's Government about progress, I think that supporters of the resolution are implying that the Government should be involved in Africa's development, especially in supporting initiatives led by African countries through the arrangements of NePAD.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.0/2">Some of those initiatives are supported by governments, United Nations agencies and African and international non-governmental organisations. We should acknowledge that the Government, through DfID are looking into and supporting these contributions to development strategy and projects. I declare an interest as chairman of ACOPS.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.0/3">I shall take this opportunity to report on positive developments taking place in Africa in the sphere of environmental improvement and sustainable development&mdash;an aspect highlighted by African leaders and our Prime Minister at the Johannesburg summit in 2002. During the debate in this Chamber on 21st May, I explained how NePAD's environment initiative is led by President Wade of Senegal. One of the eight elements of the initiative concerns the coastal and marine issues of vital concern to Africa. About 50 per cent of Africa's population and about 30 per cent of its economic activity is based in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.0/4">However, their future sustainability is in doubt because of the many damaging influences caused by actions of the developed world. These need to be addressed urgently, starting with the rapacious fishing by ships from Europe and Asia, restrictive trade practices, emigration of experts and climate change effects. Those issues were highlighted by experts from Africa and the UK and by Ministers from Senegal, Kenya and the Seychelles at a meeting held in London in May. My noble friend Lord Evans spoke on behalf of the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.0/5">Several positive developments, however, were presented, such as the effective policing by some countries of these foreign fishing fleets, new measures to ensure that tourism is beneficial ecologically, economically and, as one might hope, culturally, the establishment of marine protected areas, and most importantly, the involvement of many African communities in genuine sustainable development projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.0/6">The encouraging news this month is that the first NePAD operation has now been set up&mdash;the Coastal and Marine Co-ordinating Unit&mdash;under the auspices of the Minister for the environment in the Government of Kenya, Dr Kulundu. President Kibaki of Kenya has given his full support to this initiative, which will help to reverse the trend of marine environmental degradation and to help reduce poverty in these areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1030.0/7">I look forward to hearing from my noble friend the Lord president of the Council on how sustainable development is an integral part of the Government's strategy for Africa.</p>

	<p pid="a.1031.0/1">My Lords, I agree with the thinking of the noble Lord, Lord Lea, that regionalism&mdash;by which I mean shared responsibilities; shared resources&mdash;is in great part the answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1031.0/2">Together with Chief Anyaoku, recent Secretary-General of the Commonwealth, and with the patronage of the Ooni of Ife, the Emir of Kano and the Igwe of Achalla, I jointly chair a consultative process whose primary objective is to recapture and sustain the traditional links between Nigeria and the United Kingdom, drawing together through the private sector and civil society.</p>
	<p pid="a.1031.0/3">We identified 19 different sectors&mdash;ranging from civil society, education, health and environment to financial services, small to medium-sized enterprises, security and defence to agriculture&mdash;that are deemed to make up the bilateral relationship. Two substantive and complete documents authored by professionals covering a wide spectrum have been produced including identifying a range of implementable projects. Far-ranging activities have been undertaken to increase the capacity of civil society in its activities to support the democratic process, respect for human rights, eradication of poverty and good commercial and political practices, mindful of the role which good relations between faith communities in both countries can play to assist.</p>
	<p pid="a.1031.0/4">In the education sector, a detailed symposium on education illustrated the parlous state of the sector and identified where the United Kingdom can assist in &quot;education for all&quot; initiatives. Time does not allow me to list the three distinct strategic ways forward that have been identified&mdash;although, if requested, they can of course be provided to the Government. Future focus will be to motivate the SMEs of both countries to work in partnership, each bringing a mixture of local knowledge and expertise to the table; and, secondly, the agricultural sector.</p>
	<p pid="a.1031.0/5">In addition, our process has been, in discussion, to control theft and loss from security breakdown in the delta oil-producing region, which represents a loss to the economy of 3 billion US dollars a year. President Obasanjo has said that a long-term solution must be found. The UK is uniquely positioned to advise and assist in the exclusive economic zone command and control management. Will the Lord President urgently review government guidelines in the context of the benefits to British industry and of assisting an ally?</p>
	<p pid="a.1031.0/6">The letting of federal contracts for expediency without budgets being in place often presents nightmare commercial scenarios&mdash;a barrier to investors. Competition in the construction industry is also urgently required as main contractors have hitherto been charging up to double a fair price for essential infrastructure projects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1031.0/7">Although I have belaboured the endeavours of our process&mdash;and in so doing publicly thank all those people who have contributed&mdash;advances are being made and although we attempt not to supersede but to complement other effective initiatives, the Nigeria-British consultative process is able to offer guidelines for NePAD and for the future evaluation of bilateral relations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1031.0/8">In conclusion, the era of good intentions must now end. The doing is all. NePAD spearheads the drive for a resurgent Africa, but it is with the private sector, through equitable generation of trade and creating the conditions for such, that real solutions lie.</p>

	<p pid="a.1032.0/1">My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Lea, for raising this important issue, especially when so many eyes are on Iraq. On Monday, we discussed the breakdown of the World Trade Organisation talks in Cancun. That breakdown was bad news for the poorest countries. African countries, in particular, need trade protection and for their industries not to be decimated by cheap, subsidised imports. It is through economic growth and trade, rather than aid, that real progress is likely to come. Those talks must therefore get back on track, focussing on development and the relief of poverty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1032.0/2">Under the Millennium Development Goals, the aim is to reduce by half the proportion of people living in extreme poverty by 2015. What stands in the way of that in Africa? First, as we have heard, there is conflict, not only destroying lives and prosperity in one country, but affecting neighbouring countries. We have heard about the Democratic Republic of Congo and its key moment from my noble friend Lord Phillips. In Zimbabwe, it has been estimated that it will take seven years to put right each year of economic catastrophe. What action is being taken to address those conflicts? What is being done to check the sale of small arms across the continent?</p>
	<p pid="a.1032.0/3">Then there is the crisis of HIV/AIDS in Africa, to which noble Lords have referred. In some southern African areas, HIV/AIDS affects over one third of the population, largely those who should have been in their most economically productive years. In Zambia, 11 per cent of children are AIDS orphans. The effects of the epidemic will be seen for decades to come. Can the Minister tell us how far the agreement to provide drugs in the poorest countries really will assist, or whether the agreements are so ringed around that few will benefit?</p>
	<p pid="a.1032.0/4">Education has been undermined by the AIDS epidemic. Teachers have died, and pupils are kept from school to care for relatives, yet education is the key to the future of the continent. Does the noble Baroness agree that reductions in debt should be targeted to enable countries to spend more on education and training? The noble Lord, Lord Lea, stressed the importance of NePAD. How optimistic is the noble Baroness about the role that NePAD might play in promoting democracy, human rights and economic progress?</p>
	<p pid="a.1032.0/5">It is bizarre to try to cover a continent in three minutes. But it is a reflection of the interest in the House of Lords that we are subject to such a guillotine. That there is such a level of interest is surely very encouraging.</p>

	<p pid="a.1033.0/1">My Lords, I, too, congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Lea, on sponsoring this important debate. It is not surprising that it has attracted speakers from all corners of the House with widespread experience of Africa. In congratulating the noble Baroness the Lord President of the Council on her appointment, I also agree with the welcome expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Lea, that the noble Baroness will continue to speak on international development matters in the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1033.0/2">The combination of debt relief and encouraging free trade can act as a catalyst to securing economic regeneration throughout Africa. Free trade is vital and should be at the very core of development strategy. Yet, recently, Vijay Makhan, the African Union's Commissioner for Trade, Industry and Economic Affairs, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1033.0/3" class="indent">&quot;African countries should consider quitting the WTO if it does not deliver&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1033.0/4">What discussions have the Government had with African leaders, and what are they doing to persuade African nations to remain in the WTO?</p>
	<p pid="a.1033.0/5">The World Bank estimates that eliminating all barriers to trade would generate 250 to 520 billion dollars extra in global income. With almost 50 per cent of that income going to developing countries, that could lift more than 144 million people out of poverty by 2015. Noble Lords on these Benches have always stressed that point. We must be prepared to be bold and to make the first move in restoring the political impetus into those critical issues relating to multilateral trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.1033.0/6">Those issues are played out alongside the continuing scourge of HIV/AIDS, which many noble Lords have mentioned. HIV/AIDS is not merely a health issue; it is also a development issue. In sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, entire workforces are being eliminated. The situation is compounded by the fact that poor countries are losing workers to developed nations. There are an estimated 13 million AIDS orphans in Africa alone. By 2010, the total number is expected to be 25 million. What are the Government doing to help African AIDS orphans?</p>
	<p pid="a.1033.0/7">In Kenya, it is estimated that a person dies every minute from AIDS. Noble Lords are well aware of the cultural factors contributing to the crisis and the lack of education regarding the spread of HIV/AIDS. In Uganda, through a system of education and health programmes, the tide has started to turn and new infections are in decline. What discussions are the Government having with African leaders about education and treatment for those affected?</p>
	<p pid="a.1033.0/8">It really is time to get beyond rhetoric. What counts now for the people of Africa are the actions of countries such as the United Kingdom. We urge the Government seriously to push forward with their development work in Africa and to deliver on the promises made by the Chancellor three years ago.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.1034.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="1034"  time="020:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-24.htm#31015-24_spnew3">
	<p pid="a.1034.0/1">I begin by thanking my noble friend Lord Lea of Crondall for introducing this important debate. It will stretch all my skills because I have eight minutes to respond to the points that have been made, so I will write to noble Lords if I am not able to respond to specific points.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/2">I agree with the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark that some African countries will fail to achieve the Millennium Development Goals. That is true, and it will delay development in Africa for millions of people. Africa's problems are complex and inter-connected. We need to work jointly within the G8, the EU, the UN, the African Union and African governments themselves to address the range of issues on which concerted progress is needed. There are four underlying problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/3">First, as the noble Baroness, Lady Northover mentioned, is conflict in key countries and regions, which overrides any attempts to prioritise human development objectives. We must support African efforts to resolve armed conflicts. We have been instrumental in supporting the resolution of conflicts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, gave a graphic description of what is happening there. We have agreed an initial programme, but I am concerned that, because there is a transitional government, other donors will walk away. We have to prevent that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/4">We have also helped in Sudan, Burundi, Angola and west Africa. Some of those countries are on the road to peace and need the assurance of long-term support. We need to provide assistance so that African countries and regional and sub-regional organisations are able to engage more effectively to prevent and resolve conflicts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/5">The noble Baroness, Lady Northover mentioned the elimination of illegal weapons. We have pledged more than &pound;20 million to combat the global proliferation of small arms. The noble Lord, Lord Freeman, mentioned Sierra Leone in particular. I can say that we will continue our commitment to and engagement with Sierra Leone. We have pledged &pound;120 million over the next three years. We agreed a 10-year memorandum in November last year. There are a number of priorities, but tackling corruption and strengthening democratic institutions were areas raised by the noble Lord in his speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/6">Governance remains a fundamental issue for Africa's development. My noble friend Lord Lea raised the issue of corruption. The noble Lord, Lord Freeman, raised the issue in relation to Sierra Leone and my noble friend also talked about governance. Effective institutions, representative democracy and accountable government are essential conditions for private sector investment, growth and poverty reduction in Africa. We support the strengthening of capacity-building programmes that focus on economic and corporate governance, such as the African Capacity Building Foundation. We are working on anti-corruption in Malawi, Uganda and Nigeria and are also working in Zambia and Mozambique.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/7">My noble friend Lady Whitaker talked about the extractive industry transparency initiative. We are encouraging countries dependent on oil, gas and mining to pilot this new approach, companies to make their payments to governments clear, and governments to publish what they receive so that their citizens can hold them accountable. We are examining the George Soros proposals mentioned by my noble friend with respect to the World Bank and the IMF.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/8">My noble friends Lord Lea and Lord Judd, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark, the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich and the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, all talked about trade, as did other noble Lords. There is no doubt that the terms of trade have deteriorated and commodity prices have declined. The result has been low investment and economic growth, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. That means that insufficient jobs and incomes are being created for the poor and too few resources are generated for health and education&mdash;key areas for development. Progress on trade policy issues will be essential for Africa to become competitive, but most countries lack capacity for trade policy analysis, negotiation and implementation and for ensuring that trade reform leads to poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/9">We should be in no doubt that the current system does not work for the least developed countries. Africa's share of world trade halved between 1980 and 1999, so I am truly disappointed at the failure of the WTO talks in Cancun. It is most damaging to the world's poorest countries. I assure the noble Lord, Lord Astor of Hever, that we are in constant discussions with our African partners on the issue. I met many of them at Cancun. We feel that Africa stands to get a better deal through multilateral negotiations in the WTO, in which developing countries make up two thirds of the membership, rather than in a multitude of regional and bilateral agreements with bigger economic players.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/10">We are committed to securing progress in the negotiations most crucial to African countries: agricultural market access; reduction in trade-distorting subsidies; and specific and differential treatment provisions for poorer countries, which were a particular concern of the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/11">My noble friends Lord Lea of Crondall and Lord Judd and the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark raised the subject of economic growth. Increased aid is important, and we are committed to trying to double the amount spent on aid through the international finance facility under the leadership of my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer. We are committed to putting 0.4 per cent of our gross national income into development by 2005&ndash;06 and to providing &pound;1 billion for Africa by the same date. That commitment remains, despite the commitments that we have made on Iraq.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/12">Economic growth is essential to poverty reduction and development in Africa. We continue to argue that the interests of developing countries must be taken into account in international economic and trade discussions. We want to promote the responsible private investment and business activity that are the key to economic growth.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/13">The right reverend Prelate, the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, and other noble Lords raised the issue of HIV/AIDS, and the noble Lord, Lord Chan, spoke about health and child mortality. We have made a significant contribution in those areas. The noble Lord, Lord Chan, asked specifically about capacity building. I will write to the noble Lord with details of what we are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/14">My noble friend Lord Judd raised the issue of the food shortage in southern Africa. We continue our humanitarian support. There is a shortage in the World Food Programme appeal, and we have just agreed a further &pound;5 million for Zimbabwe.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/15">With regard to HIV/AIDS, we are the second-largest donors. We invested over &pound;270 million in programmes world-wide in 2002&ndash;03.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/16">We remain committed to the implementation of HIPC. I assure noble Lords who raised the question that we are pressing for improvements to the initiative to help to strengthen debt sustainability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/17">I am running out of time. We continue to support NePAD and African efforts to develop the continent. We see the peer review mechanism as an important tool for African leaders for learning lessons. The noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, referred to Zimbabwe. That situation must be resolved, but we do not see Zimbabwe as a test case for peer review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/18">I must answer two specific questions from the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Chesterton, on sustainable development. Our policy is to integrate environmental issues into broader support for government financial and planning systems in developing countries. The noble Viscount, Lord Waverley, spoke about Nigeria. We agree that progress in Nigeria is key to development in Africa. We work closely with the Government, particularly the new economic team. We have just reviewed our overall strategy, and we support the Education for All initiative.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/19">We will continue our efforts to work closely and collaboratively within the international system. I hope that, when the UK takes over the presidency of the G8 in 2005, we will be in a position to report considerable progress.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.1042.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100316" speakername="Lord Hunt of Wirral" colon=":" colnum="1042"  time="021:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-26.htm#31015-26_spnew8">
	<p pid="a.1042.7/1">The amendment paves the way for Amendment No. 252C, which would insert the new clause. It relates to the commencement of Part 12 of the Bill, which, as Members of the Committee will recall, makes some of the most sweeping changes to sentencing practice in England and Wales in many years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/2">The amendment would require that, before any element of Part 12 was brought into force, the Secretary of State would have to certify to your Lordships and to the other place that sufficient resources were provided in order to give the provisions adequate practical effect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/3">The issue of adequate resources is a crucial one if Part 12 is to make the difference that the Government hope it will. We have already debated the fact that the Prison Service, the police and the probation service are all overstretched as it is, and Part 12 will bring additional heavy burdens. The Explanatory Notes state that by 2008&ndash;09 the probation service will require nearly &pound;200 million in extra funding each year as a result of Part 12.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/4">We debated the amendment moved by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, on the prison population. There is considerable concern about prison populations in relation to the new sentencing provisions in the Bill. Currently there are approximately 72,000 people in prison. That figure has risen from 64,770 in 1999. Even in 1999, England and Wales had the second highest prison population in western Europe&mdash;worse than China. We now have the highest prison population in western Europe; and higher per capita than Libya, Malaysia and Burma.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/5">There has been much controversy over prisons and their rising populations. As I mentioned earlier, the Prison Reform Trust has suggested that longer custodial sentences rather than rising crime rates are driving up the prison population. The trust went on to criticise the Home Office for encouraging judges to impose harsher sentences with slogans such as, &quot;tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime&quot;, without providing the extra capacity that harsher sentences require.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/6">The BBC reported that the total prison capacity would be around 78,700 by 2006, but that the Home Office has stated that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/7" class="indent">&quot;between 8,000 and 22,000 extra places will be needed on top of this&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/8">It would be helpful to be given some explanation of where those figures come from and where the extra capacity will be found. It is against that background that the sentencing provisions will be implemented. The Government state that custody plus and custody minus will reduce the prison population. However, I think that most informed commentators, including most of your Lordships, believe that this Bill will initially push up the prison population markedly because custody plus and custody minus cannot be implemented until the Treasury finds enough funds to expand the probation service sufficiently to carry the extra load.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/9">Last year in a Written Answer Mr Hilary Benn stated that it was estimated that an additional &pound;19 million, &pound;70 million, &pound;136 million, &pound;175 million, &pound;186 million and &pound;194 million would be required for the financial years 2003&ndash;04 through to 2008-09.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/10">It would greatly assist the Committee if the Government could give some idea of where all this money is to come from and if they indicated that they certainly will not implement any of the provisions in this Bill until there are sufficient funds to cover any resources needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/11">I have set out the Government's estimates. However, they have been questioned by no less a figure than the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice. The noble and learned Lord had this to say at paragraph 59 of his memorandum about what is in the Home Office's explanatory notes on the cost implications of the new statutory provision on minimum terms for murder that are contained in Part 12:</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/12" class="indent">&quot;That is a totally erroneous assessment of the consequences of the change and indicate that those consequences have not been fully appreciated. What has been looked at is merely that those who are to be sentenced under the new tariff will be in prison longer than would otherwise be the case and so as they would not in any event be released for 10 years the effect of the increases will be postponed for 10 years. The distorting effect that the new minimum periods will have on other sentences has been ignored&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/13">The noble and learned Lord then concluded his memorandum at paragraph 70 in what Members of the Committee may consider very stark terms indeed. He stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/14" class="indent">&quot;I have already indicated that the costs implications of the proposals as to minimum periods for life sentences have been seriously underestimated. It is my belief that the costs of the impact of the proposals on the Court of Appeal have also been underestimated. In addition, the complicated nature of some of the provisions will inevitably prolong proceedings . . . There will also be 'knock-on' costs arising from the requirement for additional judges, their staff and the accommodation to house them&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/15">Will the noble Baroness respond to those very serious criticisms of the Government's costings, because I know how seriously she would take the words of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice? In particular, will she tell us the cost of the ratcheting-up effect on sentences for crimes other than murder, to which he referred?</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/16">Furthermore, will the noble Baroness explain the statement in paragraph 791 of the Explanatory Notes that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/17" class="indent">&quot;The costs will be subject to final decisions about the timing of implementation&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/18">Assuming that the Bill is enacted, when will those final decisions be made? Have they already been made on a provisional basis? Will she shed a little light on the thinking in the Home Office about when the various elements in Part 12 will be implemented, and on whether funding has been secured from the Treasury to ensure that it can be implemented effectively on whatever schedule it has?</p>
	<p pid="a.1042.7/19">I hope that the Minister will be able to give from the Dispatch Box the assurance about the provision of adequate resources to those working in the criminal justice system that is sought by the amendment, so that Part 12 can then be implemented properly and public protection enhanced. I am sure that that is what the Government and the whole Committee would wish. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.1045.0/1">We on these Benches fully support the amendment. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, asked from where the money was coming to have extra prison places and so on. Will the noble Baroness give an assurance from the Dispatch Box that the money to be saved on the criminal injuries compensation scheme will go into building more prisons? That way, if victims of crime get less money, they will at least have the satisfaction of knowing that the people who beat them up will spend longer in prison.</p>

	<p pid="a.1045.1/1">We come towards the end of the Committee. I hope that many feel, as I do, that the issues that we have raised have often crossed party lines. I am bound to say that many of the sentencing provisions of the Bill are not proposals that I would wish to see. I do not believe that the Government have thought out their effect on resources, as my noble friend Lord Hunt has said.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045.1/2">The minimum requirements on the length of murder sentences that judges should hand down, which are double the present standard, will increase the prison population. The proposal on dangerous offenders is bound to increase the number of indeterminate sentences, as well as life sentences. All of that will put enormous pressure on the Prison Service. Prisons are overcrowded and do not have the capacity to meet the new intentions of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045.1/3">I realise that the Government are trying&mdash;although they are making a poor fist of it&mdash;to counteract overcrowding by changing the rules for those serving more than four years and by dispensing with parole and releasing prisoners automatically, but without admitting to the public that that is what they are proposing to do. Imposing supervision on sentences of less than 12 months will create greater demands on the resources of the probation service. That will inevitably lead to a larger number of people going to prison for a breach of those conditions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045.1/4">Therefore, I share the concerns expressed by my noble friend Lord Hunt. I do not wish to make a party political point. I just do not believe that the Government have thought through the effect on their resources of that which they are doing in that area. I know that the noble Lord, Lord Thomas, and myself would align ourselves in attacking other matters elsewhere in the Bill&mdash;that is for another day&mdash;but we are discussing only the matter of sentencing. On that issue, the Government have not taken account of the drain on resources that their proposals will cause.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2003-10-15a.1045.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="1045"  time="021:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200203/ldhansrd/vo031015/text/31015-27.htm#31015-27_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.1045.2/1">I hope that I will be able to reassure noble Lords that the amendment is not necessary. I note the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, echoed by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, about our failure to take those matters into account. However, that would do the Government a disservice. We have thought about those matters carefully. We are seeking to put in place a regime that is able to meet the needs of the victims, the witnesses and those who perpetrate crime to enable us to reduce its incidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045.2/2">However, I understand the concerns that have been expressed this evening and I assure noble Lords that we are alert to them. It is in not in the Government's interest to implement any of the provisions in a way in which they could not be delivered effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045.2/3">Assurance has been given in another place that we will need to ensure that the new sentencing structure is properly resourced. Final decisions about implementation have not been made. However, we shall phase the introduction of the provisions to ensure both that they are fully affordable and that the necessary additional resources can be deployed to ensure that the provisions are delivered effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045.2/4">I have already outlined the extensive increase in money commitments for prisons and I shall not repeat them. However, I hope that that further reassurance will assist noble Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045.2/5">A number of noble Lords raised the issue of the probation service and the amount of financial commitment that it will need.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045.2/6">The Home Office is committed to ensuring that the probation service is resourced to deliver successful interventions in the community, to reduce re-offending and to protect the public. Funding for the service has increased by more than 50 per cent since 1998. The probation service will in particular need to be well resourced to deal with custody plus. Staging implementation will enable the probation service to reach the capacity needed in order to implement the reforms effectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045.2/7">We earlier discussed the provisions we are seeking to introduce in relation to home detention curfew and the success we have had with that so far. That is an opportunity that will increasingly be available to us. The costs will be met from within departmental settlements. However, we will keep a careful eye on phased implementation to make it work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045.2/8">There is already much that we have done. For instance, we hope that the Sentencing Guidelines Council will be set up relatively rapidly. We are looking to set up the council as soon as possible. The first tranche of guidelines should come out around April to support implementation of the Sexual Offences Bill. We have intermittent custody pilots&mdash;40 male and 40 female places will be available to use either in the week or at the week-end in two purpose-built prisons in Kirkham and Morton Hall. By the end of 2004 it should be possible to implement the generic community sentence, the structural changes, the sentences over 12 months and the new sentences for dangerous offenders. The target is for 2005 in relation to custody minus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045.2/9">Members of the Committee will already know about the pilots we have already sought to implement. We will analyse the results, hone the system and ensure that we discover the wrinkles, if I may put it colloquially, before we implement across the piece. We anticipate that in 2006 and 2007 we will be able to be more forceful about custody plus. Currently, we are considering whether we can bring it forward to the 2006&ndash;07 financial year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045.2/10">The exact timing of these measures will depend on the build-up of resources. Training is taking place even now and we are greatly helped by the massive investment that the Government have made; I believe that it is &pound;1.6 billion in CJIT. Members of the Committee will know that having an IT connection between all the criminal justice services should enable us to make some real savings and progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1045.2/11">Contrary to what has been said, the Government have looked carefully at the issue of resources and have that much in mind. We will bring forward the introduction and implementation of these procedures when the resources are available to ensure that they are fully and properly implemented.</p>

	<p pid="a.1047.1/1">I had actually sat down, but I appreciate that that makes little difference on these occasions. The noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice set out his views very comprehensively in that letter. I have said on a number of occasions that we are not as pessimistic as the noble and learned Lord in relation to those issues. We do not believe that the ratcheting up to which he refers will occur. We have examined the history of the way in which sentencing in relation to murder and other generic sentences takes place, I hope that Members of the Committee will accept that one does not tend to pollute the other. Therefore, the racheting up that is described is not evidenced by the empirical data that we have at present.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.1/2">In relation to the other matters, I have made it absolutely clear that mitigating and aggravating features will be considered within the discretion of the judge. The judge will have the opportunity to look at those matters and determine how justice can best be done. The judge will now have a much greater palette from which to choose than ever before and we believe that for the first time the sentences will be able to address offending behaviour as opposed simply to the individual offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1047.1/3">The accumulation of all those matters leads us to the informed view that on this occasion perhaps the noble and learned Lord does not have as comprehensive a view of the system as do we. We beg to differ with him.</p>

It may well be that the Minister and her ministerial colleagues have already responded in detail to the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice.

	<p pid="a.1048.0/1">The noble Lord will know that, when the noble and learned Lord made his speech in this Chamber, he said that he accepted that the answers to the details given in his letter would be dealt with as we went through our deliberations on the Bill. The noble Lord will know that, throughout Committee, noble Lords have raised the intricate details of the statement of the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chief Justice. I believe there is not one iota, one dot, or one tittle of that letter that we have not discussed at some stage in Committee. After 11 or 12 days in Committee, I say to noble Lords with humility&mdash;though is it 11 days?</p>
