	<p pid="a.3.9/1">My Lords, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-06">6 December</phrase>, the National Audit Office published a useful report&mdash;it is available only on the website, unfortunately, and not in the Printed Paper Office&mdash;on government departments and energy use. I am pleased to say that, leaving the Defra laboratories aside, Defra was lowest of all government departments, save for the Forestry Commission, on energy consumption and emissions and middle-ranking on carbon reduction, energy efficiency and renewable energy. The full list is available to see who the poor and good performers are; I will see that it is in the Printed Paper Office as soon as possible.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-10a.13.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100012" speakername="Lord Alton of Liverpool" colon=":" colnum="13"  time="015:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71210-0002.htm#0712104000093">
	<p pid="a.13.0/1">My noble friend Lord Patel has just said that there should be the strictest safeguards. He has also said that we should not proceed to incorporate these amendments as a light undertaking. He has recognised the seriousness of what is proposed in these amendments. Like him, we all want to see cures for the sorts of diseases that he has just enumerated. However, the Committee also needs to consider whether this is the right way to do it.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/2">These amendments in the name of my noble friend would overturn most of the current prohibitions and would enable gametes and cells of non-consenting children to be removed from their bodies and used to make interspecies embryos or human embryos for research. Proposed new paragraph 12A(1) would permit all types of hybrids specified in new Section 4A of the 1990 Act to be made from these children's gametes, including true hybrids at new Section 4A(5)(a), interspecies cloned embryos at new Section 4A(5)(b), human animal transgenic embryos at new Section 4A(5)(c), animal human chimeric embryos at new Section 4A(5)(d), and such other things as may be specified in regulations at new Section 4A(5)(e). It would also permit human embryos, including cloned human embryos, to be made from their gametes and cells. These could be made from the gametes and cells of non-consenting children for research, using them in combination with human or animal eggs. These interspecies or human embryos could also be stored and used without consent. That is the issue on which my noble friend and I will part company. It raises a number of objections on which the Committee will want to reflect.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/3">For instance, later in life, a non-consenting child might feel considerable antagonism that their gametes and cells were taken and used to create interspecies embryos without consent. Whatever the benefits that may be cited, where is the principle of autonomy that is so frequently cited in other debates in your Lordships' House? I can imagine the anger of a young adult who felt that their very personhood had been violated and sacrificed to a supposed greater scientific good. For example, how would a teenage girl feel if a true hybrid had been made between her eggs and animal sperm? Alluring scientific possibilities should never be allowed to corrode our sensibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/4"><I>Seeking Patients</I><I>'</I><I> Consent: </I><I>T</I><I>he Ethical Considerations</I>, produced by the General Medical Council, describes how a young person can be treated as an adult and can be presumed to have capacity to decide at 16. My noble friend referred to that. Therefore, one must assume that Amendments Nos. 50 and 54 are intended to exploit the potential inability of young children under 16 years of age to provide informed consent. The same document provided by the GMC also states:</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Where a child under 16 years old is not competent to give or withhold their informed consent, a person with parental responsibility may authorise investigations or treatments which are in the child's best interests&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/6">On the basis of existing empirical evidence, how can the creation of an interspecies embryo necessarily be stated to be in the best interests of a non-consenting child? Let us not forget that the purpose of these amendments is restricted solely to research rather than to clinical treatments that have already proven their worth and might be used in the interests of the child. My noble friend Lord Patel stated in our debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-03">3 December</phrase> how producing satisfactory results was too high a hurdle. He made those comments on Amendments Nos. 7, 44 and 46. My amendment said that,</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/7" class="indent">&quot;the research method proposed is most likely to produce satisfactory results&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/8">My noble friend said:</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/9" class="indent">&quot;That is too high a standard for any research project&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/12/07; col. 1544.]</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/10">Again, that opens a clear difference between my noble friend and I on those previous amendments, as well as this one.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/11">This amendment would allow human embryos to be made using gametes or cells from a child without their consent. How would the non-consenting child feel in later life once they realised that they were made a mother or father at an age too young to give consent, even if the embryo was destroyed by 14 days? Not many of us would want to know that our gametes had been taken, without our having any understanding of it, to make interspecies embryos or human embryos on our behalf and without our consent. No one has the right to take that decision on behalf of others. I feel that this is going too far.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/12">There are echoes here also of an application made more than a decade ago by an Edinburgh scientist, Roger Gosden, who sought permission from the HFEA to use the eggs of aborted baby girls for fertility treatments. The HFEA did not demur. It embarked on a public consultation on whether a little girl would be aborted and then robbed of her eggs from her ovaries. A woman is at her most fertile at 20 weeks' gestation, when she has 5 million eggs in her womb, 4 million of which are shed naturally before birth. An aborted girl could be seen as a rich source of organs and tissues.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/13">You can face a prison sentence for stealing the eggs of certain rare birds in Britain. Are birds to have greater protection in law than children when it comes to taking their gametes?</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/14">The noble Baroness, Lady Knight of Collingtree, and I tabled an amendment in another place to a criminal justice bill and successfully outlawed what I described as contemporary grave robbery. That a child should have an aborted foetus as its mother, and the aborted girl's mother as its grandmother, struck many members of the House of Commons as obscene and certainly not an auspicious start to life. However, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority had a public consultation over that issue. These amendments do not seek to create life beyond 14 days and, in that sense, are obviously different from the proposal that had been placed before the HFEA by Roger Gosden&mdash;but we should not seek to create life in that manner at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/15">Obtaining gametes, especially from a girl, is not like giving blood. The procedure needs to be spelt out in full and any attendant risk, present or future, should be made clear to your Lordships while we debate the matter. I hope that the Minister, when he comes to reply, will tell the Committee very clearly how exactly one would get the gametes from these infants and children, especially how one would obtain eggs or ovarian tissue from a teenage girl of reproductive age. That should be described in ordinary, everyday language so all of us can understand what the procedure would be. Furthermore, would the procedure involve a general anaesthetic, and would that involve a risk? Would there be any risk to the girl during any of the surgical procedures? My noble friend said on Amendment No. 62:</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/16" class="indent">&quot;I should like to see a greater degree of patient safety being promoted in all aspects of medicine&quot;,&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 3/12/07; col. 1592.]</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/17">and I entirely agree with him. We need clarification on that point. The noble Lord, Lord Winston, will speak next, I think, and help to illuminate our proceedings. I want to know whether we can guarantee that there will be no possible risk of future damage to the child's own reproductive system.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/18">On a related subject, I ask the Minister whether there is an error in new paragraph 9 in Schedule 3, in line 12 of page 63 and line 2 of page 64. Can he explain the relevance of &quot;donor&quot; with reference to &quot;child donor&quot; in that paragraph? Is that paragraph specifically related to the storage of gametes of children who may be ill or undergoing some medical procedure, such as chemotherapy, that may render them infertile, with the intention of storing their gametes to enable them to have their own genetic children later in life? That would seem perfectly reasonable. Is the purpose broader, to include donation as implied by &quot;child donor&quot;, and if so can these other purposes be explained? Is &quot;donor&quot; intended to mean &quot;patient&quot;, in which case could that be rectified, otherwise the meaning of the term could be considerably expanded in practice? If the word is intended to mean &quot;donor&quot;, does that mean that the child is intended to be an egg or sperm donor for somebody else's fertility treatment, or to provide eggs or sperm for research without their consent?</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/19">Finally, let me return to an issue raised earlier in our Committee. Why exactly do we need to do these things? We create embryos under any number of guises when alternatives exist. Yet, even if there were no alternatives, to create interspecies embryos from non-consenting children is going too far.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/20">Only last week, Bob Edwards of Louise Brown fame commented at the end of the HFEA annual review about the need for welfare of the child to be the priority. In passing, he questioned the wisdom of the HFEA being involved in sanctioning the creation of hybrids.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/21">Doubt was cast earlier on the figure I cited of 2 million human embryos destroyed or experimented on since the passage of the 1990 Act. A lesser figure of 82,955 was mentioned, but that is in connection with the number of embryos donated for research. The figures are in a parliamentary reply given to me on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-28">28 June</phrase> by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, at col. <I>WA</I><I> 159</I>. The number of embryos created involving fresh, non-frozen embryos is 1,940,576, with just 3.4 per cent resulting in live births from a total of 66,715 treatment cycles. Since 1991, 76,462 embryos have been created in treatments involving frozen embryos, with 13 per cent resulting in live births from 10,040 treatment cycles. Therefore, more than 2 million embryos have been destroyed or experimented on since 1990.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/22">I also asked why no data were held on embryos created using cell nuclear replacement or therapeutic cloning. The Minister replied that the HFEA,</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/23" class="indent">&quot;does not routinely collect data on the number of embryos created using cell nuclear replacement&quot;,&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 28/6/07; col. <I>WA 159</I>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/24">technology. Such data are kept by the local research project. Surely they should be made available to the HFEA and Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.0/25">If Amendments Nos. 50 and 54 were agreed to, would we collect data on the gametes and cells taken from non-consenting children or would that, too, become so routine that we would not feel the need to do it? I hope that the Committee will not incorporate these amendments into the Bill.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-10a.24.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100470" speakername="Baroness O'Cathain" colon=":" colnum="24"  time="016:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71210-0004.htm#0712104000157">
	<p pid="a.24.0/1">I support the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, and will speak to the remaining amendments in this group, the impact of which would be the deletion of Part 2 of the Bill and the attendant consequential clauses. Part 2 has the effect of redefining what it means to be a mother or a father. It is intended to create a separate category of parent for those who do not fit the description of either mother or father, thereby creating in law a family that could never exist in nature. Part 2 also allows a dead woman to be treated as a parent&mdash;even though she neither has nor had any biological relationship to the child&mdash;while preventing the child from having a father. The proposals are far reaching.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/2">The current law may not be perfect, but it is better than the Bill before us today. I propose deleting Part 2 in the interests of keeping the law as it is. Trying to unpack this complicated and convoluted mess would lead to more problems than it would solve. I contend that the Government should take Part 2 back to the drawing board. If there is anything there worth preserving in the interests of upholding or enhancing the status quo, I hope that the Government will reintroduce provisions in a new Part 2 in the near future.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/3">The relationship between children and their parents is, once again, at the heart of the redefinition of a family taken forward by Part 2. Clause 45 states that where two women wish to access IVF treatment as a partnership,</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/4" class="indent">&quot;no man is to be treated as the father of the child&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/5">I invite your Lordships to step back for a moment and consider the full ramifications of that statement. It effectively means that, from before the child is born until he or she ceases to be a child at the age of 18, the state, through this Bill, effectively makes it impossible for that child to have a father at any time during their childhood. Indeed, even when the child turns 18, they will not actually have a father but will only be able to find out who their father is. Whatever you think of the children's rights movement, surely every child has the right, at least, to have had the chance of having a father. Do we really want to enact a piece of legislation that will make this impossible? What would this say about our attitude to children?</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/6">To put this question in context, it is important to recognise that one of the main developments since the HFE Act has been the publication of a significant amount of research on fatherhood, the balance of which demonstrates that fathers bring something distinctive and important to the parenting process. The noble Baroness, Lady Deech, has referred to 80 pieces of research; what I have looked up gives me over 100. I commend to your Lordships the recently published CARE <I>Fatherhood Bibliography</I>, which is available on the website <a href="http://www.care.org.uk/fathers">www.care.org.uk/fathers</a>. It highlights more than 100 pieces of research.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/7">For those who do not get involved, or do not wish to get involved, in searching the web, I shall quote just three relevant statements. The first is from an article entitled &quot;The Importance of Father Love: History and Contemporary Evidence&quot;,<I></I>by Rohner and Veneziano, in the publication <I>R</I><I>eview of General Psychology</I>, <phrase class="date" code="2001-04-05">5 April 2001</phrase>, pages 382 to 405. I quote:</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/8" class="indent">&quot;This article explores the cultural construction of fatherhood in America, as well as the consequences of this construction as a motivator for understudying fathers, especially father love for nearly a century in developmental and family research. It then reviews evidence from 6 categories of empirical studies showing the powerful influence of fathers' love on children's and young adults' social, emotional, and cognitive development and functioning. Much of this evidence suggests that the influence of father love on offspring's development is as great as and occasionally greater than the influence of mother love. Some studies conclude that father love is the sole significant predictor of specific outcomes after controlling for the influence of mother love. Overall, father love appears to be as heavily implicated as mother love in offsprings' psychological well-being and health, as well as in an array of psychological and behavioral problems&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/9">The second quotation is from <I>Life without Father: Compelling New Evidence that Fatherhood and Marriage Are Indispensable for the Good of Children and Society</I>, by Mr Popenoe, published in New York by the Free Press in 1996. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Recent research has given us much deeper ... insights into the father's role in childrearing. It shows that in almost all of their interactions with children, fathers do things a little differently from mothers. What fathers do ... is not only highly complementary to what mothers do but is by all indications important in its own right for optimum childrearing&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/11">That is on page 144. It goes on:</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/12" class="indent">&quot;Fathers are far more than just 'second adults' in the home. Involved fathers&mdash;especially biological fathers&mdash;bring positive benefits to their children that no other person is as likely to bring ... They provide protection and economic support and male role models ... According to the evidence, fathers make important contributions to their children's intellectual competence, prosocial and companionate behaviour and psychological well-being&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/13">Finally, I quote from a work entitled <I>Fathers' Involvement in their Children's Schools</I>, issued by the US Department of Education's National Center for Education Statistics. It was written in 1987, by Mr Nord, Mr Brimhall and Mr West. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/14" class="indent">&quot;In two-parent families, the involvement of fathers exerts a distinct and independent influence on whether children have ever repeated a grade, get mostly A's, enjoy school, and participate in extracurricular activities, even after controlling for mothers involvement in school and other potentially confounding factors&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/15">Given that the balance of recent research demonstrates the importance of fathers and the fact that they bring something distinctive to the parenting process, I submit that changes in the law suggesting anything to the contrary would be foolish. The proposed change would make it impossible for children to have fathers from before their birth until they cease to be children, when all that they can do is find out the identity of that father. That would be grossly irresponsible of Parliament and exhibit a total disregard for the rights and well-being of the child.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/16">Some may respond by saying that the redefinitions of Part 2 simply extend principles established in the same-sex adoption situation. That debate has been and gone. The context of adoption and IVF are entirely different. Let us consider adoption from the perspective of the child. When a child who at some point goes on to be adopted is conceived, they have a chance of having a father&mdash;indeed, they may well enjoy access to their father for a period. At some point, however, they have to be taken into care and foster or adoptive families must be sought. Thus, adopted children are not purposefully conceived on the basis that they should never have a father.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/17">What the Bill seeks to achieve is entirely different. In a context where recent research overwhelmingly demonstrates the importance of fathers and the fact that they bring something distinct to the parenting process, the decision of the state to facilitate the deliberate creation of children who would be prevented from having a father is morally wrong. That is a clear example of the Government prioritising the interests and desires of adults&mdash;in this case, would-be same-sex parents&mdash;above the welfare and rights of the children. It also goes against the many-times-stated intention that children are at the heart of the Bill and, as we were reminded by the noble Baroness, Lady Deech, that the welfare of the child includes the child's need for a father, as my noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern said during the work leading up to the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/18">Not only do I believe that Part 2 is fraught with difficulties, because it affirms policy that is negligent of the balance of recent research, but I think that it is profoundly confused about public attitudes. A stated rationale for the Bill&mdash;one of many&mdash;was to take account of changing public views since 1990. Public views may or may not be changing, but one thing is certain: they do not agree with the redefinitions of the family in Part 2 of the Bill and, indeed, in relevant aspects of Part 1, such as Clause 14. In the Government's 2005 consultation preceding the Bill, <I>Review of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990: A Public Consultation</I>, question 17 asks:</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/19" class="indent">&quot;Do you think that the requirement to take account of 'the need of the child for a father', as part of considering the welfare of the child, should be removed from the Act?&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/20">Only 103 of the 505 responses published on the Department of Health website backed removing the obligation to have regard to the child's need for a father. Given that there is clearly no public appetite for doing away with the 1990 provision that the child's welfare includes the need for a father, by implication there is no appetite for making it impossible for some children to have fathers from before birth for the duration of their childhood. To be blunt, it is difficult to see how one could have regard to the child's need for a father and yet, at the same time, prevent some children from ever having fathers.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/21">More recently, a ComRes telephone poll demonstrated that 77 per cent of people think that the obligation on IVF clinics to have regard to the child's need for a father is either important or very important. Most interestingly, this figure rose to 84 per cent for the youngest category polled, namely the 18 to 24 year-olds. The same poll asked people directly whether they felt that Part 2's provision&mdash;that no man is to be treated as the father of the child&mdash;was fair on the child. Only 10 per cent of people thought that it was fair on the child. This figure fell to just 7 per cent in the responses from those with children in the household.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/22">Moreover, as the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, made clear at Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-19">19 November</phrase>, the redefinition of family relationships has the effect of denying some children a legal father, from conception and for the whole of their childhood. In the context of same-sex male partnerships, Clauses 54 and 55 make provision for bringing children into the world who will be denied a legal mother for the duration of their childhood. On this point, it is interesting to note that the option favoured in the responses to the government consultation about the 1990 fathers provision was that it should stay and have added to it a new reference to the child's need for a mother.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/23">Some may say that, despite the implications of both recent research that I have mentioned and public opinion, Part 2 must become law because the impact of the current law discriminates against some adults. I submit that that is not the case at all. Whatever you think about current arrangements, the truth is that single women can and do access IVF and that, where the woman is in a same-sex female partnership, her partner can subsequently adopt the child. The same is true of a man in a same-sex male partnership who, according to the new HFEA code, can now use surrogacy arrangements to produce a child who can effectively be brought up by two fathers. My amendments would not change that.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/24">It is not entirely clear to me why same-sex female partnerships should effectively be able to access IVF, given the current obligation to have regard for the child's need for a father. I suppose that it is a function of the fact that a woman seeking IVF presents herself as a single woman and is treated by the obligation to have regard for the child's need for a father in the same way as any other single woman is treated. That that takes place at all is, in my view, wrong, given the balance of recent research and what it shows about the distinctive roles of parents and how the child's interests are best served by access to both a father and mother.</p>
	<p pid="a.24.0/25">Part 2 further streamlines, automates, authenticates and thereby encourages what can currently take place as a result of the combined effect of the HFEA code and adoption law. We can only endorse Part 2&mdash;and Clause 14(2) of Part 1&mdash;if we are prepared to institutionalise the compromising of the rights of the child to a mother and a father. That would involve adopting a total disregard for the best interests of children. Remember, once more, that the best interest is not just the absence of harm but putting the child's welfare first and recognising that part of that includes the child's need for a father. I am not prepared to do so and I encourage your Lordships to join me in asking the Government fundamentally to rethink Part 2, bearing in mind both the balance of recent research and public opinion.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-10a.45.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100012" speakername="Lord Alton of Liverpool" colon=":" colnum="45"  time="017:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71210-0007.htm#07121019000009">
	<p pid="a.45.1/1">That is the reverse of the argument. If the law has not been used to discriminate against people having IVF, why change it? I would simply say, as my noble and learned friend Lady Butler-Sloss says, that we send out signals if we change the law in a way that is not helpful.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/2">I would like to draw the attention of the Committee to two newspaper articles that appeared last week. One was in the &quot;Law Report&quot; on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">Wednesday 5 December</phrase>. It was a judgment by Lady Justice Arden and Lord Justice Lawrence Collins from <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-23">23 November 2007</phrase>, stating that adoption agencies have no duty to consult fathers:</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/3" class="indent">&quot;There was no duty on a local authority to make inquiries of a child's extended family or father about the possibility of their providing long-term care where mother wished to place the child for adoption&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/4">Interestingly, on the same day, in the same newspaper, the Child Support Agency&mdash;another government agency&mdash;was reported as pursuing a Mr Andy Bathie, who is not recognised as the legal parent of a child who was conceived by IVF by a same-sex couple. He is now being pursued to pay thousands of pounds and he is required to accept responsibility as the father of that child. The noble Lord, Lord Patel, shakes his head, but &pound;400, as a result of a paternity test, was docked from his pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.45.1/5">Without going into the details of the case, I use it to argue that we are getting into quite a muddle on the duties and responsibilities of a father. I think it would suit a lot of men to be told that they had no duty or responsibility. Is that not at the heart of the problem? The noble Lord, Lord Winston, was right to remind us that we all cherish the memory of our fathers, however long we have known them. If we were to remove the biological identity of a father from a birth certificate, that would be the state colluding in a deception, the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, and others on the Joint Committee. As the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, reminded us at Second Reading, even Acts of Parliament cannot remove the biological necessity of the father to be present. Do not let us reduce the role of men to the provision of gametes in fertility tests. It is important that we recognise the social role that men have to play as fathers as well. I am very pleased to be able to support the amendment so ably moved by my noble friend Lady Deech.</p>
