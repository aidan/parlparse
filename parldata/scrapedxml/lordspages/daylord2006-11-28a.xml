<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-28a.735.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100541" speakername="Lord Roberts of Conwy" colon=":" colnum="735"  time="020:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61128-0012.htm#061128108000001">
	<p pid="a.735.0/1">My Lords, we are all grateful to the Minister for his clear exposition of the order before the House and for supplying us with ample Explanatory Notes on its detailed and occasionally abstruse provisions. The order is not hugely contentious, as far as I can see, although others may take a different view. That said, it would be helpful if the Minister could respond to one or two questions in his winding up.</p>
	<p pid="a.735.0/2">Before I comment on the provisions in the order, I would like briefly to refer to what I can only describe as the casual discussion that took place at the Welsh Assembly plenary session on this order on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October</phrase> this year. Only two Members participated in the debate, one of whom was the responsible Minister. The fleeting discussion that occurred concerned me, and I fear that the level of scrutiny was far from appropriate. The order includes, as the Minister said, the transfer of three items, two of which were barely even mentioned. I would be interested to hear whether the Minister believes that the debate that took place was satisfactory.</p>
	<p pid="a.735.0/3">The first part of the transfer order would give the Assembly the right to be consulted on the draft census order and the power to make regulations on the content and conduct of the 2011 census of population in Wales. That would allow for different information to be collected on census forms in Wales, as is currently done for data on familiarity with the Welsh language which has been done since 1891. It is sensible for the Assembly to have a share of influence over the production of the census form, especially since the tick-box debacle of 2001 to which the Minister referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.735.0/4">Discussions on the recording of Welsh identity, which became controversial prior to the 2001 census because of the absence of the Welsh tick box, has finally resulted in agreement that the Assembly should have a more formal role in agreeing future census forms in Wales. It is important that the Assembly gets the census data required to support effective policy-making in Wales. This is, therefore, a change that I welcome in principle. Of course, the challenge will be to exercise restraint and discrimination in the choice of special Welsh data sought in the census.</p>
	<p pid="a.735.0/5">Before moving on, I would like to clarify the financial implications of transferring these powers. Will the funding of the census in England and Wales still remain the responsibility of the Office for National Statistics, as will the conduct of the census? Is it the case that the Assembly will meet the costs of any change which it specifically requires? Can the Minister confirm that any such costs will be met from the Assembly budget? Are any extra administration costs expected and how will they be met?</p>
	<p pid="a.735.0/6">On the transfer of Section 156 of the Environmental Protection Act as it applies to Part 2 of that Act, this will, as the noble Lord said, supplement powers already available to the Assembly under the European Communites Act 1972 and enable the Assembly to make regulations giving effect to community and international obligations about waste management on land. I understand that the penalties for offences under the EPA are greater than those available under the European Act. The noble Lord has confirmed that. Will that have any specific significance in this context? Will it radically change the situation in Wales?</p>
	<p pid="a.735.0/7">The devolution settlement gives the Assembly extensive responsibility for environmental matters, which include waste management. Wales contributes to the 330 million tonnes of waste produced annually in the UK, a quarter of which is from householdsand business. The rest comes from construction, demolition, sewage sludge, farm waste, spoils from mines and the dredging of rivers. The issue of waste disposal is an increasingly important one, but because the functions under Section 156 have not been transferred to the Assembly, the Assembly has relied on the Secretary of State to use powers on its behalf. This has resulted in a confusing and messy situation where the waste management regulatory framework varies across England and Wales. The transfer is a tidying up measure which will help to avoid the difficulties of maintaining a common waste management regulatory framework across the border.</p>
	<p pid="a.735.0/8">The Assembly Government published their waste strategy in 2002, and have made substantial financial resources available to local authorities to supportthe delivery of the strategy. Any measures whichcan further improve the organisation of waste management must be supported. I therefore welcome this transfer.</p>
	<p pid="a.735.0/9">Finally, the transfer under the Water Industry Act will amend the basis on which the Assembly can make regulations prescribing requirements in relation to water fittings, or connections, and the prevention of contamination or waste of the public water supply by water or sewerage undertakers whose areas are wholly or mainly in Wales. It will amend an anomaly in the way that powers under the Water Industry Act 1991 have been transferred to the Assembly. I understand that this has been supported by Ministers in the Assembly and at Westminster, and I wish to add my support to the transfer.</p>
	<p pid="a.735.0/10">Before I finish, I raise the question of whether it is wholly appropriate to introduce orders containing three unconnected items, as this one does. I would be grateful if the Minister would comment on this decision. It is not that I have any strong objection, but I would have thought that it might be somewhat confusing to have three such disparate and different matters combined in one order, from a governmental point of view.</p>

	<p pid="a.739.0/1">My Lords, I am very grateful to noble Lords for their overall support for this order. On the first question raised by the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, regarding the plenary debate on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October</phrase>, I note his concern. I also note that he is sitting with two colleagues this evening. However, the level of debate that Assembly Members enter into is a matter for the Assembly, and it really is not appropriate for me to comment on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.0/2">The noble Lord's second point concerns funding. I can confirm that funding of the census in England and Wales will remain the responsibility of the ONS, as will the conduct. The Assembly will have only to meet the costs of any variations it wishes to make to the census in Wales. Assembly committees will discuss the 2011 census over the next few months. It is not yet possible to quantify the extent of additional costs, if any.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.0/3">The noble Lord's third point concerned penalties for offences under Section 156 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990. I can confirm that the level of penalties has no specific significance for the Assembly seeking these further powers. It will simply ensure that the Assembly is competent to legislate in this area to the same extent that the Secretary of State for Defra can in England.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.0/4">Finally, the noble Lord, Lord Roberts, questioned why unconnected items were contained in this single order. This is not the first time unconnected functions have been transferred to the Assembly in one order. It merely reflects different departments within the Assembly seeking to transfer functions within a common parliamentary timetable. It also means that we do not have to take up parliamentary time with individual orders, some of which are very small.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.0/5">The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, asked what type of questions could be contained within the Welsh census, and made a number of very important points. This is a matter for the National Assembly and, as I mentioned earlier, will be discussed in committee over the next few months, but I am sure that representatives of the National Assembly will be very interested to read the noble Lord's comments.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.0/6">The transfer of the Water Industry Act functions has not been subject to public consultation because its purpose is merely to amend a technical anomaly. The Assembly will consult interested parties as and when regulations using the stated powers are brought forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.0/7">The noble Lord, Lord Livsey, also raised some interesting points about the water industry's cross-border concerns. The Assembly does not have cross-border concerns in relation to this industry. However, any future concerns or problems that may occur can now be resolved following the transfer of this function.</p>
	<p pid="a.739.0/8">Finally, I can confirm that the Assembly would have been heavily involved in the consultation on transferring powers under the Water Industry Act 1991, as it was the instigator of the transfer request.</p>

	<p pid="a.740.2/1">My Lords, the National Lottery Act 2006 received Royal Assent in July. We are aiming to make the Big Lottery Fund fully functional on <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase>. So the fund can start distributing money from that date, we need to make this order under Section 22(3A) of the National Lottery etc. Act 1993 and to issue new policy directions under Section 36E of that Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.2/2">This order will allow the Big Lottery Fund to distribute lottery money for good causes that are charitable or connected with health, education or the environment. It largely re-enacts, within the new legislative framework, the interim orders we issued to the New Opportunities Fund last year. It is also almost identical to the illustrative order we made available to the House during the passage of the2006 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.2/3">The order will ensure that the Big Lottery Fund, once established as a new statutory body, can continue to fund exciting and worthwhile projects, making a real difference to communities the length and breadth of the country.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.2/4">I will set out as quickly as I can what the order does. It specifies two types of expenditure for the Big Lottery Fund: devolved expenditure and non-devolved, or UK-wide, expenditure. There are two types of devolved expenditure. First, there is expenditure on the three high level themes of community learning, promoting community safety and cohesion, and promoting well-being. The second type of devolved expenditure is expenditure on small grants: the popular and successful Awards for All scheme. Devolved expenditure will be the responsibility of the new country committees established under the 2006 Act&mdash;a subject on which I recall that the noble Lord, Lord Shutt, waxed eloquent during our deliberations&mdash;but subject to directions issued by the relevant devolved Administration. That represents a significant devolution of power to Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as well as within England. Each part of the UK will have a dedicated committee and lead board member. I know that the House will welcome that.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.2/5">The order also specifies one type of non-devolved expenditure: transformational grants. Transformational grant expenditure is intended to transform communities, regions or the nation as a whole, and is being delivered by the Big Lottery Fund through its Living Landmarks programme. Its budget of &pound;140 million will fund a number of projects of more than &pound;10 million, with a single major grant of up to &pound;50 million. The vote will be conducted in partnership with the People's Millions programme and ITV. The order will therefore allow the fund to continue to back the kind of major project that the Millennium Commission supported, such as the hugely successful Eden Project in Cornwall.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.2/6">I remind the House why we need to be able to prescribe types of expenditure for the Big Lottery Fund. That was the subject of considerable debate during the passage of the Bill earlier this year. Our policy has always been to adopt a much less prescriptive approach with the Big Lottery Fund than we did with New Opportunities Fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.2/7">Nevertheless, we do not want to be in a position where the fund could be given 50 per cent of all the lottery good cause money to spend on anything that is charitable or connected with health, education or the environment without further recourse to Parliament. The new Big Lottery Fund good cause is both broad in scope and large in terms of the percentage of lottery money allocated to it. It is therefore completely reasonable that we should be able to set out at the very highest level the types of expenditure on which the fund should focus, but I emphasise again&mdash;we discussed this extensively during the passage of the Bill&mdash;that only broad, high-level funding themes are envisaged.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.2/8">We will no longer set out relatively narrow funding initiatives, as we did with the New Opportunities Fund, where we sometimes went as far as detailing not only the specific outcomes to be achieved but how they should be achieved. Under the order and the accompanying policy directions, it will be the Big Lottery Fund, not the Government, that makes all the important decisions. The fund will have sole responsibility for deciding on programmes, choosing delivery mechanisms, identifying partners and selecting projects. In other words, the Big Lottery Fund will operate on the same basis as other lottery distributors&mdash;a point of considerable concern during the passage of the Bill, which is why I take this opportunity to emphasise it.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.2/9">We have made the decision not to carry out a full consultation on this order and to have limited consultation on the statutory requirements. I can assure the House that that is simply because the order and policy directions largely replicate the interim orders and policy directions that we issued to the New Opportunities Fund and the Community Fund last year, on which there was extensive consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.2/10">Furthermore, they are almost identical to the illustrative Big Lottery Fund order and directions that we made available during the passage of the 2006 Act. For these reasons, and conscious of the need to avoid consultation fatigue, we did not think that full consultation was warranted on the order. I must stress, however, that we remain committed to our policy of increasing transparency as we move forward to the Big Lottery Fund, and we expect to consult widely with lottery stakeholders on new orders and directions to be issued to the fund.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.2/11">I should also point out that the order is needed so that the Big Lottery Fund can continue to fund its new programmes. Following two rounds of public consultation, and with continuing stakeholder involvement, the fund hopes to have launched all its new programmes by the end of the year. Programmes will deliver the funding themes set out in the order. They will also help to achieve the four outcomes and the funding priorities set out in the policy directions. Underpinning all the programmes is the fund's mission to improve communities and the lives of people most in need. The fund has said that it will distribute no less than a third of its funding via demand-led programmes, which encourage organisations and groups to propose their own ideas and local solutions for funding. It has also given an undertaking that between 60 and 70 per cent of its funding will go directly to voluntary and community sector organisations.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.2/12">The order has been debated and approved in the other place, and I commend it to this House. I beg to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.740.2/13">Moved, That the draft order laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-11">11 October</phrase> be approved [<I>35th Report from the Statutory Instruments Committee</I>, <I>Session 2005-06</I>].&mdash;(<I>Lord Davies of Oldham</I>.)</p>
