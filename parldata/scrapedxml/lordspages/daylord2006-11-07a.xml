	<p pid="a.665.0/1">My Lords, I beg to move Motion A, That the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 1B and 1C.</p>
	<p pid="a.665.0/2">As I explained to the House when last we considered the Bill, Clause 2 is defective in a number of respects. For example, it refers to income from the enforcement of offences under subsection (2). This is inaccurate and could extend to income from offences detected by police officers as well as cameras. It also refers to several undefined terms such as &quot;safety camera scheme&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.665.0/3">Our obligation is to save this vitally important Road Safety Bill. Given that the House is keen that the Government should have a power to make such regulations, we have tabled Amendment No. 1C, which delivers the intended aims of Clause 2 but which is not technically defective and would be workable. As I have previously explained, new arrangements are being introduced for the integration and funding of safety cameras from <phrase class="date" code="">1 April 2007</phrase> which will see the end of the netting-off funding arrangement and local authorities receiving additional money for road safety through the local transport process&mdash;some &pound;440 million over four years. This is a significant and sustained level of funding at a time when future fine incomes are not guaranteed. The House will recognise that there are already signs of improved compliance with speed limits, which, of course, has the inevitable effect of reducing the level of fine income.</p>
	<p pid="a.665.0/4">The Association of Chief Police Officers national rollout of speed awareness courses from <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-01">1 April</phrase> will enable more offenders to opt for re-education rather than penalty points and fine. If anything, therefore, it is likely that the amount of fine income from speeding offences will reduce over time. This, of course, is very good news as it shows that the public are increasingly recognising the dangers associated with excessive speed. The whole purpose of speed cameras is to reduce the amount of speeding. We therefore hope and expect that the level of fine income will go down over time.</p>
	<p pid="a.665.0/5">In the event that use was made of the powers set out in Amendment No. 1C, this would be contingent on having a mechanism to ensure that the regulations did not create incentives for partnerships to drive up the level of fine income in order to secure additional income and to ensure that those partnerships which succeed in improving compliance with speed limits, thereby reducing the income from speed cameras, are not penalised by receiving less money for other road safety purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.665.0/6">I reiterate that our obligation is to save this vitally important Road Safety Bill. I hope the House will recognise that the Government have responded to the defeat we sustained last time on this issue and that we have acted accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.665.0/7">Moved, That this House do agree with the Commons in their Amendments Nos. 1B and 1C.&mdash;(<I>Lord Davies of Oldham</I>.)</p>

	<p pid="a.675.2/1">My Lords, we are in a sad position, as this is bad legislation that will do injustice. None the less, I thank the Minister because, although we have disagreed strongly on all these matters, he has been unfailingly courteous and his ministerial colleagues have given me a good deal of time to try to explain the position and to tease out what I believe are great flaws in this legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.675.2/2">I am sorry, but I cannot resile from the fact thatthis legislation has been rushed. A mistake was made on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-10">10 January</phrase>. I was certainly part of the mistake, which was made by everyone, including, I say with great respect, the House authorities, and I do not believe that the Government realised at that time that there had been a mistake. Let me just remind noble Lords what happened. After we voted on Amendment No. 4, which kicked out prison sentences from the magistrates' courts, the words from the chair were, &quot;Amendments 5 to 8 not moved? Not moved&quot;&mdash;and the crucial Amendment No. 5 disappeared into the ether.</p>
	<p pid="a.675.2/3">That is the difficulty of being rushed. Because the matter was not brought before your Lordships' House until Report stage, instead of there being three opportunities to consider and vote on it&mdash;in Committee, on Report and, if necessary, at Third Reading&mdash;there was an opportunity to vote on it only at Third Reading. If we had known about the matter at the beginning, at Second Reading, I am sure that it would have been corrected either in Committee or on Report. Therefore, I warn the House and, with great respect, the Government against bringing forward very important measures at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.675.2/4">The Minister said that the matter had been carefully considered beforehand. I beg to disagree. There was a short consultation period, which lasted two and a half months. The Minister may tell me that that is normal, but it seemed to me to be very short. I find it very surprising that, despite being warned against the serious potential injustice of this matter by the Lord Chief Justice, the Council of Circuit Judges and the Justices' Clerks' Society, who all know exactly what they are talking about in this area, the Government should charge ahead.</p>
	<p pid="a.675.2/5">Why is this going to cause injustice? The Minister said that it would somehow all be put right by the Sentencing Guidelines Council. I shall look with the greatest interest to see what the poor Sentencing Guidelines Council will say about this measure, which has filleted out the very well understood distinction between dangerous driving and careless driving. Dangerous driving falls far below the standards to be expected from a reasonable and prudent driver and applies to circumstances where the driver knew or should have known that what he was doing was dangerous and was likely to hurt or kill someone. Careless driving is simply that other area of driving that, sadly, is all too common, but which simply falls below the ordinary standard.</p>
	<p pid="a.675.2/6">Dangerous driving is massively more likely to cause death than careless driving is. Although statistics in this area are not extensive, they clearly show that dangerous driving is at least 20 times more likely to cause a death than careless driving is, yet 31,000 people are currently convicted of careless driving. It will be tragic for the victims and for the driver, but some of those incidents will lead to death. How is a court now to tease out in which of those cases of careless driving that cause death it would be just to impose a prison sentence?</p>
	<p pid="a.675.2/7">I say to the House that nowhere in all our law, in any field of life, do we impose prison sentences for ordinary negligence. I was astonished to see Alistair Darling seeming to propound the principle that sounded like an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. He said that a life is a life however it comes to be lost&mdash;I may not be quoting exactly, but that was the nub of it. Will that principle be carried to teachers who take children on outings or to doctors and nurses who have to administer drugs? Will it apply to industry and commerce? If people are to be sent to prison for ordinary negligence, we are in an uncertain and potentially unjust world.</p>
	<p pid="a.675.2/8">I come back to careless driving&mdash;I will not go on for too long. When it is between dangerous and careless driving, whether it be in the Crown Court or the magistrates' court, the prosecution must set out clearly what those dangerous ingredients are that justify a conviction for dangerous driving. In the right case, a sentence&mdash;possibly a severe sentence&mdash;would be justified for causing death or, indeed, for the dangerous driving itself. What are the ingredients of careless driving that will justify the prison sentence? Prosecutors in our world do not ask for sentences. It is contrary to our tradition.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-07a.678.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="678"  time="016:51:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61107-0006.htm#06110749000050">
	<p pid="a.678.1/1">My Lords, with permission I shall repeat a Statement made in the other place by the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The Statement is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.678.1/2">&quot;I would like to make a Statement on the single payment scheme administered by the Rural Payments Agency.&quot;In my Written Statements on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-09">9 May</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July</phrase>, and my oral Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-22">22 June</phrase>, I said that the well rehearsed difficulties in the administration of the 2005 single payment scheme would create challenges for delivery of the 2006 scheme, and I promised to keep the House informed of developments. On this occasion, as on every other, I would like to reiterate the apologies that I have offered to farmers on behalf of my department, and my commitment to remedy the problems. Today I can report progress under the 2005 scheme, and plans for the 2006 scheme. But the interim chief executive of the Rural Payments Agency and I are clear that much more needs to be done to learn the right lessons from the National Audit Office's recent report and to build on helpful guidance that I am sure we will see in the forthcoming reports from the EFRA Select Committee, the Public Accounts Committee, the Office of Government Commerce and the Hunter review. &quot;As I mentioned in my Written Statement on<phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July</phrase>, the total amount to be paid by the Rural Payments Agency for the 2005 scheme will not be known for certain until the last claim is completely validated and necessary corrections are made. However, the latest estimate, at <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-03">3 November</phrase>, puts the figureat &pound;1.528 billion, of which over &pound;1.516 billion&mdash;99.2 per cent&mdash;has now been paid. Moreover, 110,244 claimants have received a full payment and a further 4,756 have received a partial payment and are awaiting their top-up. This combined total of 115,000 represents 98.5 per cent of the revised estimated total claimant population&mdash;116,661&mdash;entitled to a payment.&quot;All but 50 of the claimants still awaiting any payment are currently calculated to have a claim value of less than &euro;1,000. The 50 cases are all difficult cases, involving issues such as probate or business liquidation, which would be challenging in any year. Dedicated teams are in place to deal with these cases and the other outstanding payments as soon as possible. Similarly, on hill farm allowance payments, some 95 per cent of claimants have received a full or partial payment, and a dedicated team is exploring all avenues to make the outstanding payments as soon as possible. &quot;During October, the Rural Payments Agency moved the bulk of its processing staff to detailed validation of the 2006 claims. Initial validation of those claims has been undertaken over the summer and has gone relatively smoothly. The same can be said of the 2006 round of eligibility inspections. However, the difficulties involved in completing 2005 claim processing have inevitably impacted on the 2006 payment timetable. &quot;Everyone wants claims to be paid in full as soon as possible. I understand that, and the new management of the RPA are dedicated to building stability and predictability into the system so that full claims are delivered in an efficient and timely way. However, the interim chief executive has reported to me that he can not guarantee that the agency can deliver full payments within the payment window for the 2006 scheme. Neither he nor I believe that it is acceptable to expect farmers to wait until next June or beyond for payments. I have therefore agreed with the RPA a challenging formal performance target of paying 96.14 per cent of valid 2006 claims by <phrase class="date" code="">30 June 2007</phrase>, and it is determined to do all in its powers to deliver on that. In addition, I have also decided to pursue a partial payment plan.&quot;Our aims can be simply stated. First, we want to maximise payments to farmers that arrive on a timely and predictable basis. That means making full payments where possible and partial payments where necessary. Secondly, we want to minimise the risk of late payment penalties and disallowance. Thirdly, we want our decisions this year to help the RPA to establish a new and sound footing for the delivery of the single payment scheme in future.&quot;I have therefore agreed with the RPA that where full payments are not possible in the early part of next year, partial payments should start in mid-February for eligible claims above &euro;1,000. The RPA estimates that the process will take around three weeks. Payments will be made for not less than 50 per cent of claim value. This reflects the level that EU regulations permit without diverting significant resource away from, and therefore delaying, work on validating claims for full payments.&quot;Needless to say, I will be keeping the situation under close review, but the interim chief executive of the RPA has set out for me and Lord Rooker the basis on which he is confident that partial payments can be made and we believe, in part on the basis of the partial payment experience in May this year, that the money will be delivered. &quot;The single payment scheme and its administration have caused distress to farmers. The only way to make good on this year's problems is to improve the management of the system so that confidence is rebuilt. I have set out clearly that this will not happen overnight, but I believe that the staged approach that I have set out is the only one that is prudent and responsible, and I commend it to the House&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.678.1/3">My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-07a.679.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100098" speakername="Baroness Byford" colon=":" colnum="679"  time="016:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61107-0006.htm#06110750000002">
	<p pid="a.679.0/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement made in another place. We are grateful to him for the update. I remind the House of my family's farming interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.679.0/2">I am disappointed by the Statement because the problems that occurred with the 2005 scheme, which resulted in chaotic late payments, have not been addressed and the Statement does not guarantee that the agency will deliver the 2006 scheme within the payment window. I am sure that that disappoints the Minister as well. The 2005 scheme meant a 50 per cent increase in calls to the rural crisis network,farm borrowing rising by &pound;379 million in one year, RPA administration costs rising by &pound;46.5 million&mdash;two year's worth of the hill farm allowance&mdash;and &pound;131 million being set aside for EU penalties. It was not a happy situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.679.0/3">Of 2005 single payments, 110,244 were paid in full by <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-03">3 November</phrase>, but that still leaves 4,756 partial payments awaiting top-up. Why has it not been possible for them to be paid? When will the problem be resolved? The Minister said that 50 claimants were awaiting any payment at all. He said that this was due to probate or business liquidation. How many fall into either category? When does he anticipate that these issues will be resolved?</p>
	<p pid="a.679.0/4">The Statement refers to &quot;dedicated&quot; teams. When they are established, will an individual be allocated to a farmer or is the RPA working to an overall dedicated team approach? What is the position regarding permanent or temporary staff? The Statement goes on to say that the validation of the 2006 payment scheme has gone relatively smoothly. Perhaps the Minister will share with the House what aspects have not gone smoothly and what has been done to rectify this. The Statement refers to the National Audit Office's report and reflects the Minister's intention to build &quot;helpful guidance&quot;. I have looked again at recommendations 23 to 32. Which of these has been actioned, or has no progress been made to date?</p>
	<p pid="a.679.0/5">Why was Germany, which adopted a similar dynamic system to ours, able to pay its farmers on time and what within our system made that impossible? At the time we had discussions about mapping, IT systems and human error. Were those difficulties also experienced by Germany or do we have lessons to learn from it? Will the Minister confirm that the mapping issues which created great difficulties in last year's scheme have all been rectified and that the problem will not occur again? Are the IT systems now compatible or is there an ongoing problem?</p>
	<p pid="a.679.0/6">According to the Statement, those to whom the 2006 payment cannot be paid in full will receive a minimum of 50 per cent. To some farmers that will be a disappointment, because this year when they eventually received it, they were paid 80 per cent as a partial payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.679.0/7">Some 95 per cent of hill farm payments were paid. That leaves some 700 of the most pressed farmers without any money to which they are entitled. Further to our debate on the delayed rural development programme yesterday, can the Minister tell us more, or will he acknowledge that those hill farmers may be doubly hit by the cancellation of that project?</p>
	<p pid="a.679.0/8">How confident is the Minister that proper controls have been put in place to ensure that the 2006 system will run smoothly? Has the relationship between the Minister and the RPA chief executive been resolved? In the past there was a certain lack of understanding and accountability. Has somebody been allocated to take overall responsibility and control? In the past, answers to questions on progress have not been forthcoming. Will the Minister ensure that such questions are answered? The 2005 system was riddled with incompetence. We cannot accept that with regard to the 2006 payments.</p>
	<p pid="a.679.0/9">The sum of &pound;131 million was put aside in case the EU called back on that money because the system ran late. Will that be an additional budget deficit to the &pound;200 million that is already forecast for Defra?</p>
	<p pid="a.679.0/10">Finally, is the Minister satisfied that the RPA's new &quot;sound footing&quot; for the future delivery of the single farm payment is in place? Will he share with us what exactly this new &quot;sound footing&quot; is? I am grateful to the Minister and look forward to his response.</p>

	<p pid="a.682.0/1">My Lords, I shall do my best in the time available to answer as many of the questions that have been asked as possible. I will have to write to any noble Lords whose questions I have not answered, because I am limited to answering questions from the Front Benches.</p>
	<p pid="a.682.0/2">It is no good asking me for guarantees. Both the Secretary of State and I have made the Statement, so that is it. It is absolutely clear, and we have confidence in it, based on the information that we have received from the Rural Payments Agency. We are not going beyond it; it is as simple as that. We are trying to learn the lessons from what has happened this year, and we need to give people confidence, but extra promises and dates&mdash;forget it. We will try to deliver, and the RPA staff will work their socks off to deliver what we have promised today.</p>
	<p pid="a.682.0/3">The noble Baroness asked me about 20 questions, some of which I will not be able to answer. The &pound;130 million is not cash, and it will not be called on, as the Secretary of State said in the other place. It does not do to talk this situation up. We have paid within 1 per cent of the legal requirement by <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June</phrase>. In other words, we have paid within 1 per cent of the 96.14 per cent. We do not know what will happen about disallowances and penalties from the European Union; it may be a couple of years before we do. That is nothing to do with the budget deficit of the &pound;200 million. As I said, it is not a cash sum.</p>
	<p pid="a.682.0/4">We will give partial top-ups as soon as possible. I cannot say how many of the 50 payments involve probate or business partnership disputes, because other factors are involved. Those are the two examples that we have given, but there are more, and they would have happened in the normal course of events under the old payment schemes. Only 50 are above &euro;1,000; all the rest are less than &euro;1,000.</p>
	<p pid="a.682.0/5">The dedicated teams are working on the payments that we have not made, as well as on the hill farm allowances, for 2005. The system of working will be different for 2006. It will not be task-based as under the old system, in which a farmer's form was dealt with by any one, or possibly by up to three or four, of the RPA offices around the country at any one time. Once all the farmers' forms have been divided up, each form will be dealt with in one of the offices by a team of 12 or 25 people&mdash;I cannot remember the exact figures. They have been training for that process throughout the summer.</p>
	<p pid="a.682.0/6">The validation process has gone relatively smoothly. The first stage, which is relatively easy, was all done in one office at Workington. I visited it when the validation was being done. That is the easy part. The second stage of validation is the one that takes the time. That is when the full payments are made, which is why we can say that we will make full payments where we can and partial payments where we cannot. So it is true that some farmers will get full payments, because they will have gone through the validation process by the time the buttons are pressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.682.0/7">I will get further information on Germany, which had problems with its system. The RPA staff went to Germany to discuss whether there were any mutual problems, which I fully accept is a point that comes up constantly.</p>
	<p pid="a.682.0/8">Bearing in mind that we have paid most of the claims for 2005, except for those with which we have had problems, we should not have too many mapping problems in 2006. Most field boundaries do not change. However, it is surprising how many change through the sale of fields or fields being split up. There will be those difficulties, but I will not rest on that. I do not say that the mapping issues will be on the same scale as last year&mdash;clearly they will not&mdash;because 40,000 extra customers to whom we had not paid food subsidies in the past and whose fields we did not know about were brought into the scheme. Those fields are called &quot;pony paddocks&quot;&mdash; perhaps it is not quite as crude as that, but we are talking about very small claims. These claims are in the system, so we should not have to go through that again. Some claimants got so little that they gave up, which is why the number of claimants for this year is lower than last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.682.0/9">The IT system is evolving. The plans for this programme beggar belief. I will not go over the past, but I have to live with it. Updates and other aspects of the system have to be dealt with constantly. It is agreed that sugar has to be incorporated into the programme in order that the 17,000 sugar farmers will get their subsidy, which was done differently this year. There are some programme upgrades that still have to be done. It is not one system that is in place and on which we can just press the buttons in the following year and out will come the money. It is not like that. Starting in mid-February, we are confident that a minimum of 50 per cent of each claim will be made 10 weeks earlier than 80 per cent of partial payments were made last year. That has to be a massive boost to and improvement in cash flow for farmers in comparison with what happened this year. I realise that a few farmers received payments early this year, but the vast majority got partial payments in the middle of May. I cannot go beyond what I have already said on the hill farm allowance, but I will give a further report because we still need to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.682.0/10">As I said in the Statement, we are confident that there are good relations between ourselves and the new management of the RPA. Members of the other place have a representative capacity. I have promised that I will hold surgeries during the winter on a weekly basis, if necessary. I met three dozen representatives recently. It is important for them to know that they can come to see the Minister every week. I will have someone from the RPA with me so that we can iron out problems as they arise. There has to be more contact between the Minister and farmers' representatives. I do not say that people in this House do not have contact, but I am doing the surgery for Members of the House of Commons, which was well received.</p>
	<p pid="a.682.0/11">I am not playing around with the Statement, but as regards putting the RPA on a sound footing for following years, I do not want to work one year at a time. On the basis of what we do this year, I want the RPA to be thinking about 2007. At the moment, I am still looking at the form for 2007, which we will sign off shortly. I want the RPA to know that it will not work piecemeal each year with one scheme to another. I am not saying that partial payments will be at the same times next year, but I want the RPA to be set up so that we can have as near the same system each year until we can make substantial changes.</p>
	<p pid="a.682.0/12">I have come to the end of the time allocated for the Opposition Front Benches. In respect of Wales, we are checking the problems of the border. I was asked about the bonuses to staff. The RPA deals with the single farm payment scheme. It also pays out on 41 other schemes relating to food and agriculture. It pays subsidies&mdash;the biggest goes to Tate and Lyle, which gets some &pound;120 million. The idea that farmers get most of the money is not true. I repeat&mdash;the RPA administers 41 schemes. Because there has been a problem with a high-profile scheme, you cannot say that the targets people were working to in the other schemes should deny them their performance bonuses. I do not say that it should be excluded, but the RPA wants to run a better system for the single farm payment and to maintain the quality of the other schemes that it operates, which, because I do not get any questions about them, tells me that it is doing a good job.</p>

	<p pid="a.685.1/1">My Lords, on the last one, no. No cuts have been made in the State Veterinary Service. The other morning, &quot;Farming Today&quot; lined up someone effectively to call me a liar. I have made statements in this House, and they have been made in the other place, to the effect that there have been no cuts in the State Veterinary Service; in fact, it has had &pound;16 million more this year than it had last year, and &pound;3 million was a resource figure swapped over for capital. The total budget stayed the same. I have to knock this one; there have been no cuts whatever. People outside are worried that we are playing fast and loose with food safety and animal welfare. It is simply not true. The State Veterinary Service has not been affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.685.1/2">On the other issues the noble Lord asked about, the target we have set is the European Union one: to pay 96.14 per cent of the money by <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June</phrase> next year. As we said in the Statement, the chief executive has made it clear that he cannot make the full payments by that date and hence we have had to look at partial payments. We paid out to within 1 per cent of that figure by June of this year; some 95 point something per cent of the money was paid out by June. The 4,756 people who have received a partial payment for 2005 should have received 80 per cent of the money because this year's partial payments were set at that percentage. The top-up is therefore 20 per cent. Obviously it is true that to work to that target next year suggests by implication that there would still be some money not paid out. However, the European Union target is to use the window between <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June</phrase> to pay out 96.14 per cent of the money. Beyond that, we could be subject to penalties. For this year we have said that where we have not paid out, we will make interest payments from <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June</phrase>, and indeed we are doing that.</p>

	<p pid="a.688.0/1">My Lords, I am not in a position to answer the noble Earl on his last couple of questions, but I will get some advice on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.688.0/2">I fully accept that some people have difficulty filling in the forms. The window for filling in the forms for 2006 closed some time ago&mdash;in fact, the EU gave us an extra month for that in the summer because we had sent the forms out late. We want to make sure that we do not send the 2007 forms out late; we have been discussing that with the stakeholders in the farming industry so that we can do that a lot earlier. However, I also know a lot of farmers&mdash;not all of them&mdash;who get specialists to fill in their forms for them. You are required to do that but I understand that if people are ill, that can cause difficulties. There is no easy answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.688.0/3">On the accuracy of mapping fields, I said in the Statement that the initial validation had gone relatively smoothly. I then said:</p>
	<p pid="a.688.0/4" class="indent">&quot;The same can be said of the 2006 round of eligibility inspections&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.688.0/5">So I have no reason to believe there is any difficulty with the inspections.</p>
	<p pid="a.688.0/6">On the noble Earl's first question, interest is indeed being paid. It can only be paid once the full payment is known about, because we are paying interest on the delayed payment from <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June</phrase>. It is only on the final calculation that we can pay the interest. Farmers have received interest payments where we have made the full payment since <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June</phrase>. We will not pay the interest until we know what is due and we cannot know what is due until we have made the final payment. There is a delay in a few cases, as the Statement makes clear.</p>

	<p pid="a.689.4/1">My Lords, today is <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-07">Tuesday 7 November</phrase> in the year of Our Lord 2006. At the first Second Reading of this Bill, as long ago as <phrase class="date" code="2005-01-20">20 January 2005</phrase>&mdash;nearly two years ago&mdash;the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.689.4/2" class="indent">&quot;One of the most important contributions that the Government can make to facilitating and promoting activities of the charitable sector is to create a modern legislative framework for it . . . By reforming the legal and regulatory framework for charities, the Government will enable people to use charities as a means to make a difference. The Bill will help existing charities to thrive, grow and realise their full potential&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/1/05; col. 883.]</p>
	<p pid="a.689.4/3">Sadly, the Bill could not complete its passage before the general election was called.</p>
	<p pid="a.689.4/4">At the Bill's second Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-07">7 June 2005</phrase>&mdash;a mere 18 months ago&mdash;the noble Baroness said:</p>
	<p pid="a.689.4/5" class="indent">&quot;The Government believe that a thriving charity sector is a cornerstone of a healthy society&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report, </I>7/6/05;col. 783.]</p>
	<p pid="a.689.4/6">Given those remarks, and the fine words that the Government use about the voluntary sector, the subsequent progress of the Bill&mdash;or lack of it&mdash;is very surprising. After that Second Reading in June 2005, there were a couple of days in Committee and on Report, in July and October respectively, with Third Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-08">8 November</phrase> last year. Since that date&mdash;one year less one day&mdash;we have heard nothing. The Bill has disappeared into some legislative black hole. It has only now emerged, with two days to go before the end of the Session if we are to avoid the extraordinary spectacle of the Bill failing and falling for a second time. The Government owe the House and the charitable and voluntary sector an explanation of why their behaviour on the passage of the Bill has been so dilatory.</p>

	<p pid="a.705.0/1">My Lords, from time to time there is good reason for charities to incorporate and sometimes there is good reason that they do not incorporate. It should not be the nature of the auditing regime that moves one in one direction or the other. Therefore, applying that auditing regime to either situation is absolutely right.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-07a.713.6" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="713"  time="018:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61107-0011.htm#06110755000238">
	<p pid="a.713.6/1">My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 100.</p>
	<p pid="a.713.6/2">The amendment reverses an amendment made in your Lordships' House on Report, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-12">12 October</phrase> last year. That amendment was moved by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips of Sudbury, who, for reasons that we well understand, is no longer with us. His contribution to this Bill&mdash;and to the field of charity law over many years&mdash;has been second to none. As ever, I shall not avoid an opportunity to praise him for that. He has done a fine service, and we are greatly in his debt.</p>
	<p pid="a.713.6/3">However, the amendment had an effect which I believe went further than the noble Lord foresaw or intended. It is to reverse that effect that the Government made their counter-amendment in another place. The noble Lord, Lord Phillips, was rightly concerned to secure the independence of the Charity Commission from ministerial interference and control in the way it operates in regulating charities. Many of your Lordships shared the view that the commission must be independent in how it operates as a regulator. The Government strongly share that vision. For that reason we have included in the Bill a provision expressly asserting and guaranteeing the commission's independence. The provision is in new Section 1A of the 1993 Act, inserted by Clause 6 of the Bill. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.713.6/4" class="indent">&quot;In the exercise of its functions the Commission shall not be subject to the direction or control of any Minister of the Crown or other Government department&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.713.6/5">I do not think it would be possible to be clearer than that as to the commission's independence as a regulator from ministerial influence.</p>
	<p pid="a.713.6/6">The need for the provision inserted by the amendment comes from the fact that the commission is&mdash;and, under the Bill, is to remain&mdash;a non-ministerial government department. While the commission is a non-ministerial department, its staff must be in the Home Civil Service. Without the amendment there will be, at the very least, serious doubt as to whether the commission's staff were in the Home Civil Service. We would be in the highly unsatisfactory position of having to tell the staff of a government department that the effect of the Bill might well be to remove them from the Civil Service. We could not, however, tell them with any certainty what their status was, since there is no obvious precedent for a government department outside the Civil Service.</p>
	<p pid="a.713.6/7">As I have said, the effect of the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, was probably not exactly what he had in mind. To quote from his contribution to the debate:</p>
	<p pid="a.713.6/8" class="indent">&quot;The Minister made a serious point, with a degree of tentativeness, about what this would do to the status of the employees. I am sure I speak for the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson, as well as myself in saying that, if that is the case, we would accept without demur an amendment at the final stage of this Bill that made it clear that the status of employees was unchanged&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/10/05; col. 327.]</p>
	<p pid="a.713.6/9">That is precisely what our amendment aims to achieve: to make clear that the commission's staff are to remain in the Home Civil Service. Our amendment is a common provision which is used in other legislation establishing non-ministerial government departments&mdash;for example, the legislation which established the Food Standards Agency. It does not mean that the Minister for the Civil Service will be involved in the determination of the terms and conditions of employment for individual members of staff. The Charity Commission already has delegated authority on behalf of the Minister for the Civil Service to determine, except for staff in the senior Civil Service, the number and grading of its posts and the terms and conditions of employment in so far as they relate to such things as remuneration, allowances, expenses, holidays, working arrangements performance, promotions and redundancy. The commission is only required to agree the overall pay remit with the Treasury. The commission takes its own decisions on terms and conditions of service within a broad framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.713.6/10">Finally, I repeat the most important point in this debate: that the Bill places the commission, for all purposes to do with the exercise of its regulatory functions, wholly outside ministerial control in both fact and appearance. I am very grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, for his contribution in that debate, which enabled me to move this amendment&mdash;unchallenged, I am sure.</p>
	<p pid="a.713.6/11">Moved, That the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 100.&mdash;(<I>Lord Bassam of Brighton.</I>)</p>

	<p pid="a.742.1/1">The point is that it was not necessary, my Lords. We have assumed that the houses are in an average state of repair. Someone who buys a house in poor internal repair would, chances are, pay less for it than if it was in good repair. That is the norm. It is not a question of taxing people on a pretty property. There has been no need for entry into people's houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.742.1/2">I fully accept the point about the convention's report. Published last Friday, it was an enormous tribute to the Members of both Houses and all parties who served on it. That will stand the test of time more than many of the other reports that discuss the relationship between the two Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.742.1/3">I fully accept what the noble Lord, Lord Trimble, says. There is no democracy, there is direct rule&mdash;I cannot argue with that. But we have consistently said that, while Northern Ireland politicians refuse to take up their responsibility as elected representatives, we will not slow the pace of reform. Indeed, we said that we would speed up reform over the whole gamut of life in Northern Ireland.</p>
	<p pid="a.742.1/4">In response to the noble Baroness, Lady Park, as soon as the Assembly is back, it is completely in charge. If everything goes according to plan, the Assembly will come back on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-26">26 March</phrase> and it will be immediately in control. It is true that this system will be introduced in April. If the Assembly so chooses, it can abolish the lot on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-26">26 March</phrase> next year. It would have to have an alternative for collecting the money because of the budget allowances, but it will be in total control. Devolution means what it says&mdash;the politicians will be back in charge. There is provision even in this order for them to adjust certain things, such as introducing a cap. Under that provision, they can give other concessions. They will have complete control&mdash;there is nothing left at the centre. If they want to abolish the system three or four days before it is introduced, they can, but they still need to raise the money somehow, otherwise there will be a hole in the budget. But it is their responsibility completely.</p>
	<p pid="a.742.1/5">I say to the noble Lord whose rates will go up by about 40 per cent that he will not pay 40 per cent extra the first year because he will benefit from the transitional allowance. I have answered the question of the noble Baroness, Lady O'Cathain, about the Joint Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.742.1/6">I realise that I will not satisfy everybody; it is just not possible. However, even when people have argued against me, nobody has had what I would call the political courage to stand up and say, &quot;I want what is quite clearly an unfair system to carry on&quot;. It is unfair, because it is based on 1968 valuations. It does not matter what has happened in the past couple of years or the past 10 years, the distortions are enormous. We are saying to people, &quot;I think you should pay a bigger share of local rates than others, based on valuations which are nearly 40 years old&quot;. We have to be serious about this. You cannot make the case for paying rates based on a system that is40 years old. That is why no one does so. I see that a noble Lord is prepared to stand up and try. I congratulate him.</p>
