<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-07-05a.1164.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="1164"  time="013:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70705-0006.htm#07070542000255">
	<p pid="a.1164.0/1">My Lords, I beg to move that the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No 2.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.0/2">This amendment brings back the principle raised in February in a worthy amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, at Third Reading in this House. At that time, the Government accepted another amendment tabled by the noble Lord which extended the deadline by which bus operators can appeal to the Secretary of State against reimbursement arrangements set by local authorities, in relation to the national concession under the Transport Act 2000. The deadline is currently 28 days after the date on which the reimbursement arrangements take effect. The amendment extended it to 56 days in England. I was able to respond favourably to that amendment on the grounds that provision of extra time should offer scope for the full gathering of high-quality data. This could mean that any appeals which operators feel compelled to make are more firmly grounded in empirical evidence. It should also help reduce some of the uncertainty that local authorities might otherwise face from more speculative appeals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.0/3">As many appeals are brought jointly under the Transport Act 2000 and the Transport Act 1985, the Government's amendment in the other place, which we are considering today, proposed changes in respect of appeals requiring operators to participate in concessionary schemes under the Transport Act 1985. Under the current arrangements regarding local authority travel concession schemes under the 1985 Act, an authority running a local scheme can serve an operator with a &quot;participation notice&quot; which requires the recipient to participate in the scheme. The operator can appeal to the Secretary of State against the participation notice, and the deadline for the appeal is currently 28 days from the date of the notice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.0/4">As noble Lords can see, the Commons amendment would largely mirror, in relation to the Transport Act 1985, the changes already made to the Transport Act 2000 by virtue of Clause 3(4) to (6) of the Bill. It would do so by extending the deadline for appeals against participation notices served by English local authorities in relation to local travel concession schemes. Instead of falling 28 days after the date of the participation notice, the deadline would fall 56 days after the date when the operator's obligation to participate in the scheme started, or if the relevant bus service is not yet operating, on the date that the obligation would have started had the service been operating. This would help to align the provisions for appeals under the two concessionary legislative regimes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.0/5">The last part of the amendment makes a connected change. At the moment, an operator intending to appeal against a participation notice must give the authority notice of his intention to do so either before the operator appeals or, if the participation notice requires it, before the end of a period specified in the notice. Regulations currently provide that this period cannot exceed seven days. This current provision allowing a local authority to specify that operators must give the authority notice of their intention to appeal within seven days, measured from the date of the participation notice, undermines the purpose of extending the appeals period and negates the benefits of giving operators more time to gather data, for example, before appealing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.0/6">The amendment would tackle that by providing in effect that the local authority could specify that the operator must give seven days' notice, or such other period as may be specified in regulations, before lodging an appeal. In other words, operators would be entitled to give notice of an appeal at any time before they lodged the appeal, except that if a local authority specified that it would like seven days' notice, or such other time as may be specified in regulations, then at least this notice would have to be given. The amendment would apply only to schemes made by English local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.0/7">My colleague in the other place, the then Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Transport, Gillian Merron, wrote to the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, copied to the noble Lord, Lord Hanningfield, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-23">23 May</phrase>, when the Government's amendment was tabled in her name, explaining the Government's intent. In his reply, the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, welcomed the move and said that he would support it when it returned to this House for consideration. I hope that other noble Lords will agree with the noble Lord in that respect. I am always happy when we are able to reach a productive, cross-party consensus on the best way forward. The Bill makes an important improvement in the provision of concessionary travel for older and disabled people in England. It will make a real difference to some 11 million people, and consequently I&mdash;and I am sure the whole House, but particularly those of us who engaged in proceedings on the Bill&mdash;look forward to its enactment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1164.0/8">Moved, That the House do agree with the Commons in their Amendment No. 2.&mdash;(<I>Lord Davies of Oldham.</I>)</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-07-05a.1168.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100015" speakername="Baroness Andrews" colon=":" colnum="1168"  time="013:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70705-0007.htm#07070542000283">
	<p pid="a.1168.0/1">I am delighted to say that I have never come across the situation of departments not talking to each other. In this instance, not only are we talking constantly, but I can assure the noble Baroness that we absolutely understand these concerns over the independence of the national parks. As I am sure the noble Baroness knows, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-19">19 June</phrase> in the other place, my honourable friend the former Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs announced that, where the creation of a unitary authority would result in that authority appointing more than eight members to a national park authority, the Government would review the membership arrangements with a view to reducing the number of local authority appointees.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168.0/2">I am absolutely at one with the noble Baroness about the need to control the impact of unitary authorities on the membership both of the national park authorities and the Broads Authority. I hope that I can persuade her that we do not need the amendments, because they are unnecessary and because they would not have the effect that she seeks. Amendment No 15A would require an authority, in framing a unitary proposal, to have regard to any guidance that the Secretary of State had issued about the potential impact of the proposal on a national park authority or the Broads Authority. It is not for the local authority to consider matters; the Government are responsible for the membership arrangements in the national parks and the Broads.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168.0/3">I refer the noble Baroness to the Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-19">19 June</phrase>. The Minister went through all the actions that he would want to take in order to ensure the independence of the authority:</p>
	<p pid="a.1168.0/4" class="indent">&quot;I have decided that where unitary local government might lead to a single local authority appointing eight or more members on to a national park authority, I shall want to take action in advance to ensure the independence of that authority. If such circumstances arise, I intend to review the membership of each affected national park authority with a view to reducing the number of its local authority appointees.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168.0/5" class="indent">Where I conclude that it is indeed appropriate to reduce the number of principal local authority seats on any national park authority, I shall also want to reflect on whether that should be allowed to feed through into a smaller overall size of authority or whether the number of 'other' seats&mdash;for example, those appointed by DEFRA&mdash;should be expanded so as to maintain the same overall size.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168.0/6" class="indent">If I do conclude that it would be appropriate to add some extra seats within the 'other' category&mdash;for example, those appointed by DEFRA&mdash;I would envisage using those new seats to recruit particular qualities that are either under-represented at present or might become so&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 19/6/07; col. 83WS.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1168.0/7">The Minister has certainly thought through the potential impact and how we might safeguard the parks' independence. I am very happy to send the noble Baroness a copy of the Written Ministerial Statement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168.0/8">Amendment No. 22A, as drafted, would require the Secretary of State to be satisfied that appropriate measures were in place before she determined to implement a unitary proposal. I understand what the noble Baroness wants to achieve, but she has created a Catch-22 situation. The amendment would not allow us to decide to implement a proposal until we had put new membership arrangements in place. We cannot do that until we make the order to create the unitary authority et cetera.</p>
	<p pid="a.1168.0/9">Amendment No. 42A would provide the Secretary of State with the power to make an order for the membership arrangements in the national park authorities or the Broads Authority. That is covered by the Bill in Clause 11(4)(e), which allows us to provide for the membership of any public body, including the national park authorities and the Broads Authority. I hope that this reassures the noble Baroness that we are absolutely serious about maintaining the very precious independence of the national park authorities and the Broads Authority. The Bill allows us to do that.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-07-05a.1171.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100269" speakername="Baroness Hanham" colon=":" colnum="1171"  time="013:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70705-0007.htm#07070542000299">
	<p pid="a.1171.0/1">I have tabled Amendments Nos. 20A and 25 in this group, which both concern consultation, or the lack of consultation time in the Bill and the lack of detail about who is to be consulted. There are a few stakeholders here and there and one or two others, but the local electorate seem to have been entirely left out.</p>
	<p pid="a.1171.0/2">Amendment No. 25 would extend the time within which it is possible to make representations to the Secretary of State following a proposal by the Boundary Commission. I regret that I have not seen the guidance on the clause that was promised to my honourable friend Robert Syms in another place. I do not know whether it has not been issued or whether it just has not come my way. If it has been issued, I should be extremely grateful if it was placed in the Library for reference between now and Report. I am sure that that was overlooked, if it has been issued, but it would be helpful to have it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1171.0/3">The current provision for a four-week period in which to make representations following a Boundary Commission report is simply not enough for councils and individuals to galvanise views and put together a convincing case. Even the two months that I propose in Amendment No. 25 would provide only just enough time to carry out a consultation in response to the proposals. I have proposed a shorter time than I would otherwise as a conciliatory gesture, but I am not sure whether it will be accepted. I hope that the Government can meet us on this because it is important not only for the interests of those who want a fair amount of time to make representations, but so that, in this whole process, the Secretary of State listens, and is seen to listen, and does not simply shut out dissenting voices through the use of unforgiving deadlines.</p>
	<p pid="a.1171.0/4">The Government have a bit of form on this. The date of publication of the White Paper setting out the broad basis of structural change&mdash;omitting some detail, as we know&mdash;and the <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-25">25 January</phrase> deadline for the submission of bids strangled the consultation process. Indeed, the strangulation continues in the government amendments. Amendments Nos. 27 and 29 have, I fear, provoked great anxiety among councils. The effect of the amendments seems to be that the Government will assign to themselves the right not to consult the public&mdash;in effect, they give the Government the means to make the decision on whatever grounds of consultation they might choose. I reiterate that the Bill and the Government's handling of it are in stark contrast to the message that the Government are sending out that they take into account the views of communities and seek to empower them through their proposals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1171.0/5">We have received representations from a number of parties going through what is becoming a messy restructuring process. As the Minister knows, there is already a judicial review on consultation. I have no doubt that that will be heard before Report, so we will have the benefit of it after the Recess. One party told me that the consultation process so far has been nothing more and talking to 44 citizens&mdash;presumably, some sort of residents' panel&mdash;75 interviews and a negative market research exercise. I am astonished that with these deep objections to the consultation procedures the Government are apparently seeking further to restrict communication between the Executive and the electorate. The electorate need to be involved in those decisions. This matters to them. After all, they are the people who are affected by any change to local government and it is paramount that they should be consulted properly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-07-05a.1172.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100015" speakername="Baroness Andrews" colon=":" colnum="1172"  time="014:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70705-0007.htm#07070542000304">
	<p pid="a.1172.0/1">I am grateful to Members of the Committee for addressing their amendments in the way that they have. I want to take them through the argument for the government amendments, Amendments Nos. 27 and 29, and address the various amendments tabled alongside them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/2">The whole group of amendments deals in various ways with processes of consultation. I am certainly happy to respond to the noble Baroness, Lady Hamwee, by clarifying our intention in our amendments, which will not restrict consultation in any perverse way, but which will align the consultation processes of the Bill and the invitation. Amendments Nos. 27 and 29 are intended to ensure that the Secretary of State is required to consult those whose views she needs to know to fulfil her role in the restructuring process, but does not duplicate the extensive public consultations that councils themselves will be carrying out.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/3">Amendments Nos. 16, 28, 28A, 30, 31 and 52, which have been tabled by opposition Members of the Committee, are also intended to develop in more detail the consultation requirement. Amendment No. 20A would allow a council when responding to an invitation to make a proposal reflecting consultation with its electorate, as the noble Baroness said. Finally, Amendment No. 25 would modify the period for representations to be made about a unitary proposal which the Boundary Committee has made as an alternative to the proposal put forward by a local authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/4">I fully understand the motives that inspire the amendments, and I hope I can persuade the Committee that they are more than met by the restructuring processes that we are establishing. In brief, we are bringing our amendments forward to ensure that the Bill and the process which we have followed throughout the invitation to local authorities to come forward with plans for restructuring are fully aligned with each other and with the principles of devolution itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/5">The amendment would replace the words in Clause 7(3)(b) with,</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/6" class="indent">&quot;such other persons as he considers appropriate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/7">The significance of the change is, quite simply, to correct the drafting&mdash;I have to hold my hands up to that need&mdash;so that the clause does not mean that the Secretary of State herself is required to impose a form of central general consultation on local areas, at a later stage of deliberation, above and beyond that which has already been undertaken earlier in the process, rightly, by the local authorities concerned. The proposed changes are consistent with the intention and the process of restructuring by invitation, which has been welcomed by local authorities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/8">Amendments Nos. 28 and 30 seek to restore the detail of the consultation requirement. They both use the same wording as in the present text of the Bill, which is inappropriate and redundant, because in any administrative process the Secretary of State must necessarily have regard to representations made to her by any person, whether or not she has consulted that person.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/9">I will address the process that we have already determined in the invitation. The whole process was to enable local authorities to decide whether to seek unitary status. One of the key tests for any such proposal was that it must have support from a range of key partners, stakeholders and service users or citizens&mdash;the electorate. That was a deliberate form of words, because we wanted a formative process of consultation. We wanted people to be part of the process of deciding&mdash;to ensure that the people most affected, such as the local partners and key agencies, could respond and contribute to the proposals, and that local authorities should seek the views of local people in whatever way was thought best. The key consultees, as they have emerged in the process and we have got to know, have been primary care trusts, strategic health authorities, police authorities, chambers of commerce, learning and skills councils, universities and so on. Within that notion of broad support is the principle that local authorities have got to show, in whatever way they think has been most effective, that they have involved local people. That is the most effective way to engage local people and to obtain well informed views of those affected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/10">The variety of ways adopted by local councils in obtaining views is very interesting&mdash;citizen juries, opinion polls, local referendums in some cases and citizens' panels. I am not making relative judgments on which are effective. In North Yorkshire, for example, the county council commissioned a citizens' panel survey&mdash;2,500 people took part&mdash;and three focus groups. Members and officers of the council attended approximately 250 parish and town council meetings. Three newsletters were sent out and there were 10 meetings with the VCS across the county. Key stakeholders, such as the chamber of commerce, received information through the LSP. The district council commissioned a MORI poll, directly communicated with the community&mdash;for example, council tenants&mdash;and contributed to newspaper articles. That is one example which is very typical of what has happened. I have other examples, but I will not go through them, unless noble Lords would like me to. When we come to the definition of &quot;person&quot; in the noble Baroness's amendments, a person includes a body by means of the Interpretation Act 1978&mdash;that means real people, but also organisations and companies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/11">I have described what councils have done, some of which was before the proposals were submitted in January. It was in a way a pre-consultation process, which provided key evidence about how the proposals stacked up against the support criteria. Councils have done more, following the decision in March as to which proposals on the information that we had then met the criteria. Councils have done that to provide more evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/12">The Secretary of State's consultation, which Clause 7 refers to and is the process in the current round of restructuring that ended on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-22">22 June</phrase>, had a very specific purpose. That purpose was to help her satisfy herself&mdash;by seeking the views of those who are in a position to give an informed judgment&mdash;that the evidence available showed that the proposals met the criteria. It was not a process for her to duplicate&mdash;almost certainly less effectively&mdash;what councils had already done in gathering evidence. Clause 7 provides for the consultation period&mdash;ending on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-22">22 June</phrase>&mdash;for the Secretary of State to satisfy herself that the proposals meet the criteria. As part of that, a consultation paper was issued and sent to stakeholders, inviting consultation responses. It was put on the website and was open for anyone to respond to. Gratifyingly, we had almost 60,000 responses; some were in the nature of campaigns, but many were individual responses. At this very moment the Secretary of State is, as it were, wading through the consultation responses, to see how people have responded.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/13">It is important to be clear because, although there would be some additional decision-making through popular referendums or suchlike, I want to stress that the amendments were never intended at this stage to impose from above on the local authorities some requirement for a universal public consultation. It is not intended by the Secretary of State to parachute in with a consultation that seeks to second guess the views and decisions of the democratic councils. The Bill recognises this, because it provides that when all councils are in agreement, no consultation is necessary, although the Secretary of State may if she wishes consult. In the last 12 weeks&mdash;since we announced the 16 proposals&mdash;the Secretary of State has been consulting with partners and stakeholders, considering the stakeholders' consultation and then, at the end of July, she will make those decisions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/14">Amendment No. 16, the call for guidance, would contradict some of that process. It would remove the power of local authorities to decide for themselves. Amendment No. 20A does nothing that a council cannot and does not do already&mdash;having regard to the electorate when making a proposal. Amendment No. 16, the notion of central guidance, is inimical to the spirit of the Bill. Amendment No. 20A would mean that the Secretary of State must consult every member of the electorate before implementing proposals. None of that is necessary or, indeed, compatible with the very thorough process that we put in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/15">Before going back to my own amendments, I will turn briefly to Amendment No. 52, which also would require of the Secretary of State to take full account of representations made at any time prior to the commencement. We are doing that, and I hope that what I have said reassures noble Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/16">Let us turn back to the Government's amendments about why we have to correct the Bill. Discussions around judicial review also highlighted that the consultation provisions in the Bill are drawn too wide, by proposing a consultation process that involves any other person believed to have an interest. That would add nothing but delay to a process that we have tried to make as swift and precise as possible, but we need to make the change, because it is possible that a court would be likely to require such a wider consultation than is appropriate or necessary. That would require the department to impose a consultation aimed directly at every citizen, taxpayer, council tax payer, business, voluntary group and so on, or consultations through advertisements. We have placed our trust in local authorities and believe that that would duplicate what has been done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/17">Finally, I come to the timescale for the Boundary Committee and Amendment No. 25. Let me make it clear that the four-week opportunity is at the end of a process that itself provides for sufficient consultation and engagement. I will explain. Where the Boundary Committee is minded to make an alternative proposal, it must publish a draft. That is the principal opportunity for people to comment&mdash;it is provided through a requirement on the committee to ensure that those who have an interest are informed of the draft proposal and the deadline. As a matter of course, the Boundary Committee follows the Cabinet Office guidance on consulting for a minimum of 12 weeks. The Bill follows the precedent in the Local Government Act 1992 and allows the independent Boundary Committee to set a window for the receipt of recommendations that it considers appropriate; the Boundary Committee has then to take account of those representations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1172.0/18">Where the Boundary Committee subsequently makes a proposal to the Secretary of State, we are providing a further opportunity&mdash;an additional one&mdash;hence the four weeks' window. The Boundary Committee has to inform anyone who has made representations that it has made a proposal, and has to inform those people that they can go directly to the Secretary of State in that four-week period. Unless revised, that will be four weeks from the date set by the Secretary of State for advice from the committee. Those two processes should provide enough opportunity for people to make sufficient representation to ensure that their voices have been heard. I hope that noble Lords will be able to withdraw their amendments.</p>

	<p pid="a.1177.0/1">If I have understood the Minister correctly, it is very helpful that the Secretary of State takes account of representations, solicited or not and whenever made. I raised a question on representations made following <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-22">22 June</phrase>, but the debate has gone more widely than that. As I read the clause, whoever is consulted, under the Government's amendment that is not a restriction on those who may make representations and who will be heard. The Minister is nodding and shaking her head at the correct moments, so that is very helpful. I am not entirely sure of the solution to this. Whether the consultation undertaken at a local level is adequate, and whether the Secretary of State's role in checking the adequacy of this, may be issues which will come out in the wash in the applications going forward. I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>
