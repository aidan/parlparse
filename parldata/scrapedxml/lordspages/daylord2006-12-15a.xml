<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-12-15a.1727.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100180" speakername="Lord Dubs" colon=":" colnum="1727"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61215-0001.htm#06121565000008">
	<p pid="a.1727.1/1">My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/2">I start by thanking Landmine Action and other organisations which have been very helpful in briefing me and other colleagues. I am also grateful to the many colleagues from both Houses who have indicated their support. Some from this House are not able to be here today, but support for the Bill is probably wider than the number of speeches that I hope will come in support of it. I also thank my noble friends Lord Drayson and Lady Crawley for the conversations that I have had with them and for the helpful way in which I have engaged in discussion with them&mdash;not that we left in agreement, but I am grateful for having had the chance to do it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/3">I want to talk about the Bill under four headings: first, the humanitarian aspects of cluster munitions; secondly, my belief that there is no real military justification for their use; thirdly, the international aspects; and, fourthly, the arguments as between smart and dumb weapons which have featured so strongly in some of the discussions both in this House and in the other place in recent weeks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/4">There was a very active campaign against anti-personnel landmines some years ago, which culminated in the successful abolition of those terrible weapons. Indeed, my right honourable friend Hilary Benn, the Secretary of State for International Development, is reported recently to have told Cabinet colleagues that cluster munitions are,</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/5" class="indent">&quot;essentially equivalent to landmines which are the subject of an international ban&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/6">Like anti-personnel landmines, cluster munitions remain dangerous long after the military conflict has moved on or is over. They then pose a threat to civilians: children playing or going to school, people gathering crops, collecting firewood or going for water&mdash;all normal, innocent and essential activities for people in some of these zones where there has been conflict. Those are innocent activities that may result in the loss of a limb or death.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/7">Perhaps I may quote my right honourable friend Hilary Benn again. In his Answer to a Parliamentary Question on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-11">11 December</phrase>, he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/8" class="indent">&quot;If they are used in large numbers, unexploded bomblets can be left scattered densely and indiscriminately over a wide area. When these are set off, the explosion can kill anyone within 50m. They represent a threat to aid workers, peace-keepers, medical services, internally displaced persons and anyone else entering an area immediately after the cessation of hostilities. The design of cluster munitions means that often children are attracted to them&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/9">He goes on to explain:</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The threat to returning civilians is exacerbated when cluster munitions are used over soft terrain such as recently ploughed farmland. Unexploded bomblets can lie buried just beneath the surface making it dangerous for farmers to cultivate their land&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/11">That is important in the discussion about dumb and smart bombs, to which I shall refer later. The Answer continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Casualty figures are hard to verify but reports indicate that unexploded cluster munitions killed thousands of civilians in Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam. The UN reports around 1 million unexploded cluster bomblets in Southern Lebanon. So far, 23 civilian deaths and 145 injuries have resulted from unexploded ordnance, mainly cluster munitions. It will take an estimated 12-15 months to clear this area of unexploded ordnance&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 11/12/06; cols. 743-44W.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/13">We know that sometimes that can take very much longer if the ordnance is buried, and indeed we know that there are many areas of the world where anti-personnel landmines are still there, causing enormous threat to ordinary people. We know that, for example, large areas of the Falklands are still fenced off because they are still too dangerous for people to walk on. I understand that even now in the Lebanon an estimated three persons are killed or injured by cluster munitions every day.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/14">According to Handicap International, although 10,000 known civilian casualties from cluster bombs have been indicated, the real figure is probably nearer to 100,000. The United Nations' most senior official for humanitarian affairs, Jan Egeland, has described cluster munitions in the Lebanon as,</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/15" class="indent">&quot;shocking and to me completely immoral&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/16">The ICRC has described the impact of CMs as &quot;horrific&quot; and called for urgent international action. And of course not only did Israel use these weapons in the Lebanon but Hezbollah did as well, the first known case of these weapons being used by non-state armed groups&mdash;an ominous sign that the use of these weapons is proliferating. Hence the urgent need to take action is clearly highlighted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/17">I turn to the question of military effectiveness. I say at the outset that it is not my intention to do anything that would weaken our Armed Forces. They are responding bravely to what we are asking them to do and I am certain that the Bill would not hamper their effectiveness in any way. General Sir Rupert Smith said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/18" class="indent">&quot;It is the way military success is achieved that directly affects whether or not it can be translated into political advantage. If the military success is achieved by bombing civilian targets and causing the loss of many civilians lives, which result in strong national and international public reaction, chances are it will not be easily converted into political capital&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/19">He is a person who knows what he is talking about from his own experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/20">Cluster munitions have been used in about 24 different countries. I will not go through the list, but most of the areas where there have been conflicts in recent years have seen cluster munitions used. The justification for them, as I understand it, is that they are particularly effective against tanks and other vehicles, against large dispositions of troops and against runways on airports. Other speakers have far more military knowledge and experience than I could ever have, but my understanding is that cluster munitions are no longer regarded as particularly effective against tanks because they cannot penetrate the latest tank armour. As regards large dispositions of troops, I accept that in the war following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait there were concentrations of Iraqi troops, but I put it to your Lordships that it is most unlikely that we shall see large concentrations of troops in the conflicts that the world will witness in the future. I am assured by those who know far more than I do that cluster munitions are not necessarily the best weapons to use on aircraft runways and that there are other ways of effectively disabling runways.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/21">This country is one of the largest users of cluster munitions. Indeed, 100,000 submunitions were using during the invasion of Iraq. My noble friend Lord Drayson wrote, in a letter dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-05">5 December 2006</phrase>, that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/22" class="indent">&quot;our policy must find the right balance between humanitarian concerns and military necessity the latter being particularly important when our Armed Forces are deployed in conflict areas&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/23">Of course, nobody would dispute that. However, I suggest to the House and, indeed, the Government that military necessity is not a good argument in favour of cluster munitions. I have not heard a single compelling argument that only these weapons will do the job. Many other weapons will, which do not have the other consequences of cluster munitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/24">General Sir Hugh Beach said in February 2001 regarding Kosovo:</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/25" class="indent">&quot;In the British case, the delivery of some 530 cluster bombs&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/26">containing 78,000 submunitions&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/27" class="indent">&quot;in the course of the campaign may have resulted in the destruction of as few as 30 major items of military equipment. This achievement can in no sense have influenced the outcome of the campaign&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/28">It has also been alleged that in Kosovo 20 to 25 per cent of NATO cluster munitions failed to go off.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/29">I refer to the international aspects and the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, normally referred to as CCW. Recently there were discussions in Geneva on this matter. The Government opposed a negotiating mandate but supported a discussion mandate. This seemed pretty esoteric to everybody, certainly to me. However, I am strongly advised that a negotiating mandate, had we supported it, would have been a clear sign of our intentions to proceed towards a ban, but that a discussion mandate is probably just a lot of old waffle. That is what I am told. I am not an expert on the discussions in Geneva, but I am assured that the Government's decision was very disappointing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/30">Belgium has banned these munitions. Norway has declared a permanent moratorium. People say that, militarily, these countries are not as important as we are. I accept that, but nevertheless there are international moves towards banning these weapons. We are not in the forefront of those international moves; in fact, we are lagging a long way behind. Having said that, it is only fair to point out that, as I understand it, the history of arms control is usually that progress has been best achieved by a small number of countries reaching agreement and then extending that agreement more widely rather than having an agreement to which everybody signs up immediately. However, that is something for the experts to comment on. I would rather we had taken a more positive stance in Geneva than we did.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/31">On the argument about smart versus dumb bombs, the Government have said on countless occasions that they abide by humanitarian law and that their stance on smart bombs will be incorporated in that process of abiding by humanitarian law. The clearly stated British policy is to phase out dumb bombs by 2015. If dumb bombs are not acceptable&mdash;the Government have admitted that they are not, as they want to phase them out&mdash;why have the date of 2015? Why not phase them out now, this minute? I do not understand why we have to wait so long. It is a sign that we are not that serious about the matter. Many other countries take note of that and say, &quot;If the British are going to use them until 2015, why should we not do so? Why should we bother?&quot;. The signal that we send out is as important as what we do; they both matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/32">In recent weeks, I have studied hard to learn the relevant terminology. Dumb cluster munitions are ones that either do not have a target discrimination capability or do not have a self-destruct, self-neutralisation or self-deactivation capability. That is MoD terminology. I think that we understand what it means. Much evidence gathered over many years indicates that, when weapons have a target discrimination capability, they sometimes do not work and that, when they have a deactivation or self-destruct capability, they also do not work. A great deal of faith is put in technology, which in testing conditions does not always live up to its promises and in battlefield conditions is even less likely to. I quoted Hilary Benn. If a bomb lands on soft ground, it is much less likely to go off than if it lands on hard ground. If a bomb's fall is broken by trees, it is less likely to hit the ground with as much force as it would if it landed on concrete. That is common sense even to someone as inexperienced in these matters as I am. All the evidence shows that smart bombs are simply not smart enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/33">The Government have gone some way to meet this concern. I understand that air-delivered weapons are no longer used. The main weight has been put on the M85, a cluster munition with 49 submunitions that scatter. My right honourable friend Adam Ingram said on <phrase class="date" code="2003-06-16">16 June 2003</phrase> that the failure rate of these smart bombs was 2 per cent. An MoD paper of March 2005 put the failure rate at 1 per cent. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-08">8 November</phrase> this year, Adam Ingram said that these weapons had a 95 per cent success rate. I notice that the figure has been tipped the other way to reflect not the failure but the success rate. It does not take much arithmetic to work out that if there is a 95 per cent success rate, there is a 5 per cent failure rate. But even 1 per cent is a high figure if one thinks of cluster munitions used on a large scale and scattered over a wide area. It seems to me that the smart bomb, as I said earlier, is simply not smart enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/34">The M85 bombs were widely used in the recent Lebanon conflict and, according to David Shearer, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Lebanon, it has been estimated that there may be as many as 350,000 unexploded bomblets littering the country. I have seen other suggestions that the figure may be nearer to 1 million. I have seen photographs of several lying together in south Lebanon, which clearly did not go off when they were supposed to have gone off. The M85 munitions that we use are made in Israel, so they ought to be the same ones that were used in south Lebanon.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/35">A UN report says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/36" class="indent">&quot;We can state categorically that we are finding large numbers of unexploded sub munitions that have failed to detonate as designed and failed to self destruct afterwards. In effect these sub munitions have failed twice. These M85 sub munitions are even more dangerous than other types because their self-destruct mechanism makes them more problematic to deal with and where ever possible they are destroyed in situ&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/37">In other words, the task of clearing them is made harder when they do not go off than it was when the old-fashioned ones did not go off.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/38">Another issue to do with the smart and dumb bomb argument is that, if the world is to ban dumb bombs and move to smart bombs, monitoring that will be very difficult. We had the same argument with anti-personnel landmines&mdash;that self-destruct anti-personnel landmines would be okay and the others would not be. That argument was scotched. The danger is that one cannot monitor international action if we allow some and not others. That is another case against them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/39">To conclude, on the way forward, obviously I really want the Government to take over this Bill, but I suppose that that is too optimistic a hope. The Bill makes it an offence to use, develop, store or transfer cluster munitions. It bans their import and export. Under the Bill, they are to be safely destroyed. That is what I would like the Government to take on board as legislation. I understand that the UK stockpile of cluster munitions contains four different types at the moment, so we have a lot of these.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/40">Failing that&mdash;and I hate saying that if the Government do not accept plan A let us go to plan B, because it implies that I am conceding something, but let us be realistic&mdash;why should there not be an immediate moratorium on all cluster munitions? That would be sensible. It means that they would still be there if there was some military reason for them&mdash;which I have said there probably is not&mdash;but at least let us have a moratorium as the Norwegians have done. In any case, there is absolutely no argument for not having a moratorium on all dumb cluster munitions. Having said that they are going to be phased out, let us put a moratorium on their use now. I do not see why the Government should not do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/41">It is a privilege to have been able to introduce this Bill. This is a desperately important issue, because it is a sign of our humanity if we do ban these weapons. I hope that the House will support that, and I hope that that is what the Government will do. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1727.1/42">Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.&mdash;(<I>Lord Dubs</I>.)</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-12-15a.1732.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100467" speakername="Baroness Northover" colon=":" colnum="1732"  time="011:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61215-0001.htm#06121565000030">
	<p pid="a.1732.0/1">My Lords, I welcome this Bill and congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, on introducing it so effectively and comprehensively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/2">The campaign to ban cluster bombs has all the hallmarks of that to ban landmines, for much the same reasons; they are not militarily effective and they produce disproportionately civilian casualties. Worldwide, civilians constitute 98 per cent of all recorded casualties from cluster munitions. But whereas landmines were in widespread use by all sorts of groups as well as states, this campaign has come in slightly earlier, before cluster bombs are in widespread use by non-states. If we act now, therefore, we can do a great deal to stop such proliferation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/3">Like others in this debate, I have read the material about the effectiveness, or otherwise, of these bombs. I have read what the Government say in their defence, and I am not persuaded by their case. It is very clear from the account of their use in the Balkans, where large quantities were used with extremely low success against armoured vehicles, that their military use seems extremely limited. We have heard that in Kosovo 78,000 cluster bombs were used, taking out only 30 major items of military equipment. Most of the UK cluster bombs are, I understand, unable to penetrate the armour of the main battle tanks that have been in operation since 1970. I will leave much of the assessment of their effectiveness to others, such as my noble friend Lord Garden, whose authority on these areas, I am sure the Minster will agree, is without question.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/4">During the Iraq war, there was enormous concern about the use of cluster bombs, and the UK Government, I remember, were evasive about whether they were using them. They were very keen to stress afterwards that everything had been cleared up when they admitted that they had used them. It is rather difficult for any of us to go in and check that, given the state of Iraq at the moment. What has happened in Lebanon over the summer has given further, and I hope definitive, impetus to the campaign against these bombs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/5">What happened in Lebanon was controversial enough without the use of cluster bombs. There we have a fragile society, which as we speak is verging once more on collapse, and every day in the south several people, among them women and children, are killed or wounded by a previously unexploded cluster bomblet. What reminder does that serve to those who resented the incursion into their territory? When the Israeli Embassy here in Britain sends me a message about how important it is that the Government of Lebanon do not fall&mdash;with which I wholeheartedly agree&mdash;I wonder whether they regret leaving their fatal footprints in the south of the country, the daily reminders of a failed military intervention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/6">The Israeli Ambassador to the Russian Federation stated on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-26">26 July</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Reports of the Israeli army using cluster munitions are an obvious propaganda of Hezbollah and other organizations who do not know what is actually going on&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/8">He knew full well how difficult, dangerous and damaging, both to civilians and to Israel's reputation, it would be if they were used in such a populated area. On the same day, the commander of Israel's ground forces said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/9" class="indent">&quot;We try to minimise their use&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/10">He knows both that they are being used and how controversial that is.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/11" class="indent">&quot;In the last 72 hours we fired all the munitions we had, all at the same spot ... ordinary shells, clusters, whatever [we] had&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/12">said a reservist, quoted in Ha'aretz on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-08">8 September</phrase>; the desperate but incredibly destructive reaction of an Army in retreat.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/13" class="indent">&quot;What we did was insane and monstrous, we covered entire towns in cluster bombs&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/14">says the head of an IDF rocket unit, quoted in Ha'aretz on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-12">12 September</phrase>. They all recognised the significance of what was happening; for it is civilians, above all, who are harmed by cluster bombs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/15">Cluster bombs kill civilians during attacks because they spread across a wide area. Anyone who has been to southern Lebanon will know how populated that area is. They also kill after the conflict, when civilians stumble across them. Of course, there is the wide, longer impact in that either farmers cannot use their land, or they endanger their lives and limbs by carrying on doing what they need to do to keep their farms going. For many, there is simply no choice. In Lebanon, Israeli-fired cluster munitions have damaged access to agriculture, housing, schools and water sources. Even now, bombs sit on people's roofs. In just one month after the ceasefire, bomb disposal teams had destroyed more than 25,000 submunitions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/16">Each time a cluster bomb goes off and hurts someone in southern Lebanon&mdash;even though Israel is now quite desperate to shore up the Lebanese Government, and even though it is making welcome moves to talk to the Palestinians and the states around about the way forward&mdash;it is Hezbollah that benefits. If ever there was a reason to ban these bombs, you can see it in the tinder box of the Middle East.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/17">What is the scale of the problem? Some 73 countries hold cluster bombs. Hezbollah used them; that is said to be the first known use of such weapons by a non-state armed group, although I gather warlords in the Balkans also did so. Of course, the use of such bombs goes far wider than the Middle East. As the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, said, the UK has been a significant user of them. It dropped some 78,000 bomblets during the air campaign in Kosovo and used more than 100,000 submunitions during the invasion of Iraq. It is therefore very appropriate that the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, is bringing forward a Bill which, as it were, targets what the UK can legally do. After all, the Government say that it is legal to use these weapons, but we can help them to a situation where it is no longer legal for them to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/18">Hilary Benn seemed to show some sympathy with that point of view&mdash;seemingly out of line with the MoD position&mdash;in calling for a campaign to ban cluster bombs other than those he considered &quot;smart&quot;. In a leaked letter on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-05">5 November</phrase> he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/19" class="indent">&quot;The high failure rate of many cluster munitions, and the failure of many militaries around the world to use these munitions in a targeted way means that cluster munitions have a very serious humanitarian impact, pushing at the boundaries of international humanitarian law.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/20" class="indent">It is difficult then to see how we can hold so prominent a position against landmines, yet somehow continue to advocate that use of cluster munitions is acceptable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/21">Too right.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/22">For the Convention on Conventional Weapons in early November, he argued to his colleagues:</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/23" class="indent">&quot;I believe we should go in ... advocating for a process that will lead to an effective ban of 'dumb' cluster munitions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/24">In fact, at that conference, Kofi Annan called for the freezing of the use of cluster bombs,</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/25" class="indent">&quot;against military assets located in or near populated areas&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/26">In a Written Answer in the Commons later in November, Hilary Benn said that there was agreement from Ministers at DfID, the FCO and the Ministry of Defence that the UK should play a leading role in pushing for an international commitment to end the use of dumb cluster munitions&mdash;that is, as we have heard, those without a target-discrimination capability or self-destruct mechanism&mdash;and phasing out the use of the UK's own dumb bombs. Welcome though that position is, it does not go far enough.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/27">As we have heard and will no doubt hear again during the debate, so-called &quot;smart&quot; bombs are hardly smart at all. The bomblets are not programmed to focus in on a particular area. What is supposedly smart about them is that they have detonators which are supposed to destroy them, should they not detonate on impact. As we have heard, not only do the bomblets clearly have a higher failure rate when used in warfare than has been indicated under test conditions but the detonators have a 25 per cent failure rate. Given the number already found unexploded in Lebanon, clearly the failsafe mechanism is not working adequately. The UN has reported:</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/28" class="indent">&quot;We ... are finding large numbers of unexploded ... [smart] submunitions that have failed to detonate as designed and failed to self-destruct afterwards&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/29">We have heard that Jan Egeland has described the effect of these weapons in Lebanon as &quot;shocking&quot; and &quot;to me, completely immoral&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/30">I feel for the Minister, a lady with the strongest of credentials in international development and a track record of support for civilians, especially women and children. I am struck that neither the MoD nor the FCO&mdash;nor, for that matter, DfID&mdash;wished to come near this subject, no doubt in the expectation that it might explode in their faces. I do not in the slightest associate the noble Baroness with someone who would argue for such weapons, and I feel that she has drawn a very short straw. I also think that the Government will change their view, but perhaps not in time to save her answering this debate. However, I suppose that that is the downside of being in government and it is what she has to put up with.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/31">I have some questions to put to the Minister. Has the UK undertaken practical assessments of the human impact of cluster munitions? I do not think that it has. Has the UK gathered field data on cluster bombs? I think not. Has the UK provided evidence on how its forces evaluate and control the humanitarian impact of cluster munitions? Again, I do not think that it has. I take it that she will clarify that the UK Government will abide by a moratorium on so-called &quot;dumb&quot; cluster bombs. Will she be able to go further than that? The UK claims that these weapons are legal; that is why the Bill is important: it would make them illegal. After all, people decide collectively what is legal, and whether these bombs should be legal is what we are considering here.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/32">As I said, I believe that ultimately this campaign will, as it must, prevail. As the Minister knows, the UK Government's reputation around the world has been somewhat battered in recent times, so let us at least take the lead in this area, call for the banning of all cluster bombs and put our own stockpile out of use. Let us once more show our humanitarian rather than our militaristic credentials. I hope that the Government will shortly come to support this Bill.</p>

	<p pid="a.1736.0/1">My Lords, I appreciate the broader context set by the right reverend Prelate. In supporting the Bill, so eloquently moved by my noble friend Lord Dubs, I recognise that, as a civilian who has never borne arms, I am questioning a decision made on the advice of military professionals. On the whole, civilians should be careful about that. But it is precisely because civilians&mdash;people who have nothing to do with battles and only want to harvest their crops and go about their day-to-day business&mdash;are so overwhelmingly affected by cluster bombs that I do speak.</p>
	<p pid="a.1736.0/2">Cluster bombs have been used in most major conflicts since the Vietnam War. In Laos, where I saw children on crutches and legless adults propelling themselves on small wagons to beg, there were nearly 5,000 casualties from them. In Iraq, there have been more than 2,000. Handicap International estimates that there may be 100,000 casualties worldwide and that 98 per cent of them are probably civilian. In Kosovo and Cambodia, where I saw many victims, boys under 18 are the biggest single casualty group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1736.0/3">The UK is one of the larger users of cluster bombs. Unexploded ones are still being found in Kosovo from the 78,000 submunitions inside cluster bombs. There were dropped, in our name, more than 100,000 submunitions inside cluster bombs during the invasion of Iraq, but I am not aware of our Government having made any analysis of their own of the harm to civilians caused by the use of these weapons. Yet the concept of banning weapons that cause unnecessary suffering to civilians is firmly embedded in the law that we adhere to, the Convention on Conventional Weapons. According to a YouGov poll, 81 per cent of British adults agree that the UK should support an international ban on cluster bombs. It seems to me that the Government have a case to answer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1736.0/4">I regret that the department for which my noble friend speaks has not seen fit to accept this case. In a Written Statement published in <I>Hansard</I> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-04">4 December</phrase>, my noble friend Lord Triesman repeated what my honourable friend Kim Howells said: that the UK would begin a process of withdrawing just one kind of cluster bomb, so-called dumb cluster bombs&mdash;a term which the noble Lord, Lord Garden, questioned in his supplementary question of <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-23">23 November</phrase>. We all agree that this small advance is, of course, welcome, but the Statement says of cluster bombs that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1736.0/5" class="indent">&quot;compelling and legitimate conditions may occur when our Armed Forces need to use these weapons&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 4/12/06; <I>WS 111</I>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1736.0/6">That is a bad precondition under which to start the reviews and the discussions which the Statement expands on. Apparently, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-14">14 November</phrase>, UK representatives had already objected&mdash;we were the only member state to do so&mdash;to a proposal for EU government experts to prepare a common EU position on negotiating a new legal instrument on these weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1736.0/7">If the Government pay little attention to the thousands upon thousands of dead and disabled civilians, many of them children, can we at least not join our allies and friends among other sovereign states? We have heard that Belgium has banned cluster bombs. New Zealand has called for a legally binding instrument, and the Lebanon, whose suffering we heard about from my noble friend and from the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, has joined the call for a ban. Then there are all those who have called for negotiations to begin without further postponements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1736.0/8">Such decisions should indeed be joint ones. I think all sides of this House have supported multilateral action on a ban. My noble friend's Bill would lead the implementation of such an international ban. There is, in fact, no need to work up all those long-term discussions and reviews held out by the Government through the framework of the Convention on Conventional Weapons. In the 1990s, states departed from the framework of the CCW to negotiate the Ottawa treaty to ban landmines, in which the UK, in those days, took an active part. The Ottawa convention now has 152 states parties, as against the CCW's 100, and the only country left now using anti-personnel landmines is Burma. The Ottawa action would be a good model to follow. It is political will that we are short of here, not lengthy processes. I do not say this with any satisfaction, but should we not be ashamed to stand apart from a gathering momentum of public and international opinion on this of all subjects, when we could be helping to lead it?</p>

	<p pid="a.1743.0/1">My Lords, I, too, am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, for bringing this debate to your Lordships' Chamber. I wish to associate myself strongly with the clear and persuasive speeches made by the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, and my colleague the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Coventry. I suspect that there is a good deal of unanimity in your Lordships' House on what these weapons do and the effects that they have. I wish to focus on the declaration made by the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, in his letter to the noble Lord, Lord Dubs, of <phrase class="date" code="2006-12-05">5 December</phrase>. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1743.0/2" class="indent">&quot;We consider that cluster munitions are lawful weapons when used in accordance with international humanitarian law&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1743.0/3">He went on to define how they might be properly used and be of military force and might.</p>
	<p pid="a.1743.0/4">This poses at once the question of whether we are going to base our use of any weapons on what is lawful or on what is right. As in other areas of debate&mdash;for example, bioethics&mdash;does a &quot;can&quot; automatically imply an &quot;ought&quot;? I believe that military action is justified and that our Armed Forces do an amazing job. We have a common duty to keep the peace, to protect the innocent and to minimise oppression, which is a duty that we all seek to support. But in pursuing those goals, we must surely be governed not by just what is legal, but by what is right.</p>
	<p pid="a.1743.0/5">In considering what arms we should use, I believe that we need to differentiate fairly clearly between those that are focused or targeted weapons&mdash;guns, bombs and missiles&mdash;that can be used against a defined military target and those indiscriminate weapons, such as chemical weapons, gas, nuclear weapons and cluster bombs, that affect civilian populations and areas as a whole. It is an increasingly easy distinction to make. Although there will be arguments about the boundaries, there cannot surely in your Lordships' House be any doubt on which side of that divide cluster munitions fall. Why do we need to be so clear about the kind of weapons? Because the use of force in any &quot;just war&quot; theory means proportional response. Can cluster bombs ever be a proportional response?</p>
	<p pid="a.1743.0/6">When war spills out from the battlefield with conventional armed forces opposing each other, such as was envisaged by theorists like von Clausewitz, into the soft sweep of violence which affects whole civilian populations as well as military forces, we need much more sharply targeted weapons, not more indiscriminate ones. I have no hesitation in supporting the noble Lord in this debate. I hope very much that a definition of weapons and how they can be used proportionally will form part of the way we think through these questions, as this issue, which seems to me so self-evident and clear, is taken on to its next stage.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-12-15a.1775.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100674" speakername="Lord Watson of Richmond" colon=":" colnum="1775"  time="014:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61215-0007.htm#06121565000253">
	<p pid="a.1775.0/1">My Lords, I confess to a moment's hesitation before putting my name forward to participate in this debate, despite my strong support for the Bill and for the cause that my noble friend Lord Dykes has long advocated. The reason for this is that there has been a strong agreement&mdash;maybe even a consensus&mdash;in British politics over the past couple of years that Europe is best not talked about. Whether this is because of the English trait of reticence&mdash;just as we are reluctant to talk too much about religion because people feel strongly about religion, perhaps we think that we should not talk too much about Europe because people feel strongly about Europe&mdash;I do not know. However, I strongly support the Bill having thought it through.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/2">I question why there is this reluctance. There are several reasons and they are worth looking at as a necessary background to the Bill. Let us take one or two inconsistencies. I travel abroad a great deal, in continental Europe, Asia, Africa and elsewhere, largely in support of the English-Speaking Union. Sometimes I have had the opportunity to work with our embassy or stay at the residence and have got to know the ambassadors and the high commissioners quite well. I am struck by the number of British embassies that display the European Union flag as well as our Union flag in front of the embassy or the residence. It is not at all uncommon. So why is this perfectly acceptable abroad but somehow rather difficult with public buildings in this country?</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/3">I have the same sort of question about the Prime Minister's speeches on Europe. There have been one or two exceptions in recent years but, by and large, all the Prime Minister's most pro-European speeches&mdash;he makes them, and he can even make them in French&mdash;are nearly always made abroad. Why are they made abroad rather than here?</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/4">If we start to look at the reasons for this reticence, it starts to become obvious. It is rooted in the predicament of the parties. Let us look at that, because it will colour their reaction to the Bill. The Conservatives view Europe as a minefield. If they stray from a most conservative and prudent path, the rather fragile new leadership of liberal conservatism might explode on one of those mines. For that reason, David Cameron has been extremely careful not to address any issues of substance on the European Union because of the damage that it might do to his party or the leverage it is calculated it might give to the UK ostrich party, UKIP.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/5">The Government also find Europe difficult. I asked a Question only last week about the five economic tests for the euro. It seemed to me that if Mr Brown was to move from No. 11 to No. 10, and as he owns the five tests, we might gain greater clarity. There might even be a new sense of urgency about the matter. But the Answer I received was somewhat ambiguous and certainly not infused with any sense of urgency. I was told that all this would be looked at in several years' time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/6">There are even Liberal Democrats who feel that maybe it is better not to talk too much about Europe because it is not always understood by voters. Of course, that simply will not do, for two reasons. First, there is a woeful level of ignorance about Europe and the European Union and the sort of information that my noble friend is advocating should be easily available by computer and in public buildings, libraries and schools. All the polls&mdash;MORI, Ipsos, endless Euro-barometers&mdash;show the same thing. Unfortunately, we are among the most ignorant about the European Union within the European Union. We are ignorant about how it is governed, how it works, what the institutions do, what its benefits are, and what its problems and challenges are. People really do not know and that makes them extraordinarily vulnerable to malignant journalism. I am afraid that Euro-phobic journalism has become an aspect of British public life.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/7">I had an extraordinary experience last month when I was in Bulgaria for the English-Speaking Union. When I got there, the ambassador said, &quot;We have two or three lectures laid on for you, but there is something much more urgent&quot;. The much more urgent matter was a report in the <I>Sun </I>newspaper that morning that, from <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January</phrase> the United Kingdom had to brace itself for an invasion of HIV/AIDS. The evidence for that alarmist story in the <I>Sun </I>was a report from a UK health authority, which said that the United Kingdom faced a higher incidence of HIV/AIDS from immigration, especially illegal immigration&mdash;a comma was inserted here, which I know because I looked at the original document&mdash; from sub-Saharan Africa. The words &quot;from sub-Saharan Africa&quot; had been removed and instead we were to brace ourselves for the invasion of Romanian HIV/AIDS and Bulgarian HIV/AIDS from <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-01">1 January</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/8">I tell that story because it is symptomatic of something that is now so common in our journalism that we no longer notice it and nobody complains about it. We have all become passive victims of this sort of prejudice. It is deeply shocking and very upsetting, as it has been to public opinion in Romania and Bulgaria. That is what has happened and it is the reason why there is this very strange reticence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/9">The other reason why it will not do is that too much is happening. There is the strange idea that a lot of us seem to have that if we stop thinking about Europe, it will stop moving. Somehow it will vanish, disappear or recede. The Channel will miraculously widen until it is thousands of miles wide, and we can all forget about it. The French shot the fox over the constitution; the Dutch do not want it; and as for the euro thing, the sky did not fall in when we did not join.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/10">But there will be a new president in France. There are important signs of economic recovery in Germany. The euro is in a strong competitive position with the dollar. Europe is attracting enormous quantities of investment. Make no mistake that, with a new French president, whoever that is, there will be a renewed attempt to try to establish Franco-German leadership of the European Union. Europe will not stand still simply because we do not want to talk about it. For reasons of our own ignorance, and because of its urgency, we should take this matter very seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/11">I shall end on a different, connected thought. People who object to flying the European flag or acknowledging our membership of the European Union, for example, do so because deep down they fear it. They see it as some sort of external menace representing a fundamental threat to our way of life. I see the issue fundamentally differently. I see our membership of the European Union as an aspect of our diversity. The flag is an illustration of that diversity. Coming to the House this afternoon, I was thinking of the identities that I feel that I have. I was born in South Africa. I have worked all my life in London. My home is in Richmond. I am international by instinct and experience. My patriotism, which I feel strongly, is British. I feel European by geography and interest, and English by language.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/12">I see none of these identities as contradictory. Churchill had three circles. I would be happy with six or seven. We are perfectly capable of dealing with these identities, but if we deliberately try to mask or hide one&mdash;the European one&mdash;we distort our own identity. We distort it not only for ourselves; we distort it for our children, which is perhaps more serious. I am concerned about children in our schools. A modern foreign language is no longer a compulsory subject at GCSE. I very much regret that, and I think that the Government regret that decision as well. They will probably reverse it. Also, in the teaching of citizenship in our schools, the European dimension is inadequate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/13">I ask the House to support this, and to start thinking sincerely and seriously about that aspect of our identity in which we are citizens of the European Union. It is by no means the only aspect, but it is one that, were we not to have it, we would be much the poorer, and our lives, and those of our children, would be at much greater risk.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-12-15a.1791.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100023" speakername="Lord Ashley of Stoke" colon=":" colnum="1791"  time="015:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61215-0009.htm#06121565000342">
	<p pid="a.1791.1/1">My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/2">As noble Lords know, the Bill received its Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-14">14 July</phrase> this year, but there was no time for it to complete its remaining stages. So, here we are again, full of hope that noble Lords will support the Bill and pass it through all its stages. I said at that time that the purpose of the Bill was to transform the lives of Britain's 11 million disabled people from frustration to fulfilment by providing a legislative framework for rights to independent living. It is an idealistic and a practical proposition, and it is a blueprint for the future of disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/3">The Bill aims to change the whole ethos of the debate on disability from a discussion on how we take care of helpless people to a discussion of equal citizens who happen to have a disability. So how can we best help them cope and exercise the same choice, freedom, control and dignity that we all expect? I want to pay tribute to the Disability Rights Commission, its chairman, Bert Massie and its staff for their extremely constructive assistance. The extraordinary Caroline Ellis has worked extremely hard to make the Bill a success, and I put my warm appreciation on record. She has been of more help than any noble Lord has the right to expect, and I am deeply grateful to her for her efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/4">The springboard for the Bill is the appalling discrimination that disabled people still suffer. In realistic terms, they are second-class citizens and are treated as such. The Prime Minister has said that one in five British adults is disabled and that they can find themselves cut off from the opportunities that other people enjoy. They are more likely to live in poverty, to have fewer educational opportunities and to experience prejudice and even abuse. Most have low expectations. Only 50 per cent of disabled people of working age are in employment, compared to 80 per cent of non-disabled people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/5">The question before the House today is this: how can we rescue this one-fifth of our adult population from being an underclass? The answer must be nothing less than comprehensive legislation that will provide real opportunities of equality and independence and place specific duties on public authorities. There will be a duty on the Secretary of State to prepare and implement a national strategy for independent living.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/6">Before I explain the provisions in the Bill, I shall say one further word on one urgent need for it. Seventy per cent of our councils offer services only to people whose needs are judged as &quot;critical&quot; or &quot;substantial&quot;. The rest can go to pot. The rights that they have are disgracefully minimal. For example, their right to services means help with being washed and fed, rather than comprehensive assistance and rights that would help towards independence. There are no positive rights in existing legislation to enable disabled people to choose where they live and no legal protection against their being forced to live in institutions against their wishes. That really is scandalous. There is no legal entitlement to advocacy, except in limited circumstances, or to communication support. It is simply impossible for disabled people to have independence when they have no communication support and no advocacy. There are no rights of support to cover a disabled person who moves to a different part of the country. They have to start all over again and negotiate a new care package from scratch and from many different sources. It is an awfully confusing business. The Bill provides that right.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/7">People with mental health needs have no right to assessment or support for their needs. The notorious postcode lotteries prevent the provision of services all over the country. It is luck rather than judgment as to who actually gets what&mdash;fancy that in 2006. I hope that, like me, other noble Lords feel ashamed and angry at this neglect. It is basic neglect.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/8">A basic element of the Bill is the provision of rights for disabled people and the imposition of duties on local authorities and the NHS. It is a twin-track attack. As a starting point for assessing needs, I want to emphasise the need for contributions from disabled people themselves. In the simple but profound words of Plato:</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/9" class="indent">&quot;Only the wearer knows where the shoe pinches&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/10">Disabled people are the best qualified to define their own requirements. This is one hundred times better than a local authority assuming what they are and simply handing out what it thinks is best.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/11">At present, many disabled people are forced to live, first, in an institution against their will, and, secondly, with someone they do not want to live with. They are forced into it just because of their disability. It is absolutely unbelievable. The Bill empowers disabled people to determine where they live and with whom they live. If and when the Bill becomes an Act, it will be unlawful to force anyone into an institution against their will&mdash;and about time too.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/12">Local authorities will have to identify all disabled people in the area and maintain a register of them. They will need to provide a wide range of assistance, such as communication aids and other forms of equipment, technology, independent advocacy and practical assistance in the home and elsewhere. Those are crucial elements of the Bill. Some people will say that they are all-embracing; in a sense, they are, but we must aim high. The neglect at present is so gross and so frustrating that we need to do something. This kind of element in the Bill will ensure that people are not left fighting alone with their disability. There will be a new system of individual budgets. The present range of different funding streams to help with personal care support, equipment and adaptations will be brought together, and disabled people will be able to use their individual budgets in the form of cash or services, or a mixture of both, to spend as they wish, on housing, equipment, personal assistance, transport or whatever they desire.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/13">I assume that some local authorities will try to evade their responsibilities, although of course I cannot calculate how many. To outmanoeuvre them, the Bill provides that regulations will be made specifying minimum outcomes. That will effectively prevent local authorities wriggling out of their responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/14">I am anxious and hopeful that Gordon Brown will support the Bill. David Cameron says that, although he shares my aims and aspirations, such as extending direct payments, individual budgets and others, he is not convinced at this stage that legislation is the way in which to make all these changes. As we all know, however, history has taught us that the voluntary approach has failed and that there will be no new rights for disabled people and that no new duties will be imposed on public authorities without legislation. I firmly and deeply believe that simply requesting change is like the cooing of a dove in a cage&mdash;it sounds good, but it is perilous. This is what will happen when people are begging, pleading, asking and urging. We need strong legislation to ensure that these things happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/15">I hope that Gordon Brown and other Members of both Houses will recognise the important economic benefits of investing in independent living. As people become more independent and return to work, earning from their employment and paying taxes, savings will be made in the social security budget. There will also be a big reduction in the use of health and social services as people become active and return to work. Vitally, the net costs incurred under the Bill will be far less than people first assumed when they saw these demands.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/16">I was impressed by the comments on housing made my noble friend Lady Wilkins in an earlier debate. The provision of disability housing services is, of course, supremely important in the Bill. Each local authority will have to compile a list of accessible properties and disabled people requiring such properties and then&mdash;this is an important part of the answer&mdash;provide a matching service. The terrible shortfall of accessible housing will no longer be a bugbear, because people will be able to fit properties via the matching service. All new dwellings of whatever type will have to meet minimum standards of access&mdash;and about time, too. As a result, there will be a vast saving for local authorities by avoiding the very heavy cost of later adaptations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/17">It is not possible to do justice to the many provisions in the Bill in such a short debate. I hope that the House will accept that the thrust of the Bill is to transform the lives of millions of disabled people and to provide them with the necessities for real independence which we all take for granted but which are so cruelly denied them. Among the other provisions is the duty on the Secretary of State to prepare and implement a national strategy for independent living.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/18">I offer these proposals to the House in the hope that we can initiate a movement to enrich the lives of disabled people with new rights for them and new duties on public authorities. None of it will be easy, and we can expect a great deal of opposition and indifference from various quarters. But the rewards for disabled people are enormous, and we can literally transform their lives with this far-reaching legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/19">Independence, dignity and freedom can transform the lives of disabled people, and we can do this job working together. We often use the words &quot;freedom&quot; and &quot;independence&quot; without realising what a lack of them means, and many severely disabled people lack those vital things. The Bill aims to put that into practice and ensure that something is done. Without those things, their lives are sadly diminished. It will be a far happier story if and when the Bill is passed and implemented. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1791.1/20">Moved, That the Bill be now read a second time.&mdash;(<I>Lord Ashley of Stoke.</I>)</p>
