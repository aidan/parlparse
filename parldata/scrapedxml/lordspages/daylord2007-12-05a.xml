The Government subsequently announced that there will be a Statement when that review is completed. Given the considerable public concern and urgency on this issue, can the Minister give us an indication of the timetable for the completion of that review? In particular, may we have an assurance that, at the very least, an interim Statement will be made before the House rises for the Christmas Recess?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-05a.1731.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100666" speakername="Lord Wallace of Saltaire" colon=":" colnum="1731"  time="017:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71205-0006.htm#07120553000210">
	<p pid="a.1731.3/1">My Lords, we have been entirely clear in our statements that if we are to debate the issue publicly, we need to debate the underlying issues I am talking about&mdash;that is, the advantages of Britain being in the European Union&mdash;not the scare stories that revolve around the details of this treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1731.3/2">Some noble Lords are, no doubt, avid readers of the <I>Spectator</I>. I direct those who are not to an article in that magazine from <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-24">24 November</phrase> for a partial answer to why Gordon Brown's Government, like Tony Blair's, is so mealy-mouthed on the European issue. The article is by Irwin Stelzer, memorably described by Andrew Neil as Rupert Murdoch's representative on earth, and a regular visitor to No. 10 and Chequers&mdash;as of course is Rupert Murdoch himself. It criticises the Prime Minister's recent Mansion House speech for being insufficiently pro-American and for calling for a special relationship between Europe and America, rather than between America and Britain. The Brown Government, Stelzer argues, are outsourcing foreign policy to,</p>
	<p pid="a.1731.3/3" class="indent">&quot;a variety of international organisations&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1731.3/4">like the European Union and the UN. Of course, the Murdoch press hates the UN as passionately as it hates the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.1731.3/5">Oddly enough, since News International has not yet given up hope that Gordon Brown will follow its lead, Stelzer then goes out of his way to add:</p>
	<p pid="a.1731.3/6" class="indent">&quot;None of this is to criticise the Prime Minister&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1731.3/7">This unwelcome shift from subservience to a right-wing US Administration is apparently due to the influence of an evil genius mistakenly invited into the heart of the Government:</p>
	<p pid="a.1731.3/8" class="indent">&quot;Malloch Brown, who proudly claims to represent terrorist-supporting Syria&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1731.3/9">with,</p>
	<p pid="a.1731.3/10" class="indent">&quot;his history of hostility to America ... his defence of UN corruption ... his presumption of lobbying the US Senate in opposition to the confirmation of the President's choice of US representative to the UN&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1731.3/11">This diatribe, we should remember, comes from the same organisation whose &quot;fair and balanced&quot; Fox News has given air space to allegations that Senator Barack Obama is a secret Muslim. So, it is possible that not all of these charges may be entirely accurate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1731.3/12">We believe that Britain's best interests are served by active participation in European co-operation. We will scrutinise the reform treaty from that perspective. We urge the Government to rediscover some courage in leading public opinion on the issue and in particular to stand up to the Eurosceptic press. We welcome the positive and constructive speech with which the noble Baroness the Lord President opened the debate and hope that her colleagues will begin to discover the same degree of courage. Britain has drifted into semi-detachment from European co-operation for far too long. It is time to re-engage.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-05a.1732.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100261" speakername="Lord Grenfell" colon=":" colnum="1732"  time="017:23:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71205-0006.htm#07120564000001">
	<p pid="a.1732.0/1">My Lords, I thank the Lord President for introducing this Motion to Take Note. As the noble Baroness has just mentioned, the Select Committee on the European Union and its seven sub-committees are currently engaged in a detailed analysis of the text of the reform treaty on which the heads of state and government reached agreement at the informal summit on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-18">18 October</phrase> in Lisbon. Our purpose, as I have mentioned before in your Lordships' House, is to provide the House, in advance of the arrival here of the ratification Bill, with an objective assessment of the impact of the treaty on the United Kingdom in the event that it is ratified by the member states and comes into force.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/2">Our methodology is to compare the provisions of the draft treaty with the provisions of the treaties that preceded it, which it amends. Put simply, what difference will the treaty make to the European Union&mdash;and, by extension, to us&mdash;compared with where we were under the preceding treaties, the most recent of which was the treaty of Nice? Her Majesty's Government have assured us that they will present the reform treaty to Parliament after the European Council with an Explanatory Memorandum and provide the Select Committee with a comparison of the reform treaty with the existing treaties, with supporting analysis, after Christmas. We anxiously await that. Meanwhile, given that any amendments to the text will be minimal, we are pursuing our inquiry on the basis of the text currently available. We are taking considerable expert evidence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/3">Your Lordships will understand why, at this stage, I cannot share any emerging conclusions based on work still in progress. The only conclusions so far reached by the Select Committee&mdash;that is to say, on the intergovernmental conference process that produced the text of <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-18">18 October</phrase> and some preliminary conclusions on the general role envisaged in the treaty for national parliaments&mdash;were published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-01">1 November</phrase> in our report with evidence, <I>The EU Reform Treaty: </I><I>W</I><I>ork in </I><I>P</I><I>rogress</I>. Perhaps I may remind the House of what we concluded.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/4">Your Lordships will recall that June's European Council, under the German presidency, presented the IGC with a clear and tight mandate, so that its work was mainly technical and its goal was to ensure that a text was prepared that delivered on the mandate. As the Portuguese presidency intended, this mandate was by and large adhered to. The giving of such a precise and detailed mandate to an IGC is unusual and the tightness of the timetable was equally unusual. Your Lordships' Select Committee therefore recommended in its report that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/5" class="indent">&quot;the Government report to Parliament, after the December European Council, on the implications, both in terms of scrutiny and transparency and of effectiveness in agreeing policy, of an IGC proceeding on the basis of such a tight mandate&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/6">and such a tight timeframe.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/7">As the Lord President mentioned, the role of national parliaments is for the first time recognised in an article of a European Union treaty. Previous reference was only in protocols, such as that attached to the Amsterdam treaty. That protocol, Protocol 9, stated a desire to encourage greater involvement of national parliaments in the activities of the Union and provided for information, including Commission proposals, to be provided to national parliaments, plus a six-week period during which parliamentary scrutiny could be applied. In the new reform treaty, the early version of the text of the article dealing with national parliaments stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/8" class="indent">&quot;National Parliaments shall contribute actively to the good functioning of the Union&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/9">The Select Committee in this House, like our sister European Scrutiny Committee in another place, was concerned that the use of the word &quot;shall&quot; might imply that the EU could prescribe functions and impose obligations on sovereign national parliaments, which would be quite unacceptable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/10">We drew this matter to the attention of the Minister for Europe, who agreed with us that the wording was inappropriate and assured us that it would be raised in the IGC. It was, and the word &quot;shall&quot; was removed from the English text. National parliaments cannot, of course, contribute actively to the good functioning of the Union without being fully informed. Well before the new treaty was drafted, the European Commission had set up a system of direct transmission of documents to national parliaments. This means that our Select Committee receives these documents, many of them draft legislative Acts, a little in advance of the Government's own delivery to us of the same documents, numbering about 1,200 a year, accompanied by Explanatory Memoranda prepared by the departmental ministries. That is the grist for the scrutiny mill operated by the Select Committee and its seven sub-committees.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/11">The need for ensuring that national parliaments are properly informed is set out, with detailed provisions, in Protocol 1 to the treaty. This should, in principle, contribute to transparency and allow direct engagement by national parliaments in EU matters. We would like the Government to ensure that not only the Commission but all the EU institutions and others covered by the protocol, such as groups of member states, fulfil their obligations under these provisions. The period between documents being made available to national parliaments in the official languages of the EU and their consideration by the Council is extended by the reform treaty from the six weeks allowed under the treaty of Amsterdam to eight weeks. That is good news, but we hope that the Government can clarify that the clock begins only when a document is available in all those languages.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/12">The protocol makes no mention of the system agreed by the Commission and noted in the European Council conclusions of June 2006, whereby national parliaments are encouraged to correspond directly with the Commission on any legislative matter, in particular, but not limited to, subsidiarity and proportionality. Your Lordships' Committee attaches high importance to this process, as do our sister European affairs committees right across the European Union. There is an as yet modest, but growing, flow of Select Committee correspondence with the Commission, initiated by us. It is usually related to recommendations for Commission actions featured in our reports to this House. At a tripartite meeting yesterday in the European Parliament with the national parliaments and the Commission, I thanked President Barroso for his Commission's prompt and thoughtful responses to our comments and recommendations. We hope that that will continue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/13">Our Select Committee has asked the Government why this important commitment, often known as the Barroso initiative, was not enshrined in the treaty. The Minister for Europe agreed that the system was working well and that there was no reason why it should not continue. That opinion, coupled with the Commission's assurance that it remains strongly committed to the initiative&mdash;President Barroso confirmed that yesterday&mdash;is welcome, but we must remain vigilant.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/14">Protocol 2, annexed to the reform treaty, deals with applying the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality on which the Commission is required to consult and justify its actions, which, on the whole, it does. The existing protocol introduced by the Amsterdam treaty did little more than encourage COSAC, the body that brings together the European affairs committees of the member states' parliamentary chambers, to look at subsidiarity issues. The scrutiny committees of our two Houses took that as an invitation to get proactive in monitoring draft EU legislation for compliance with those two principles&mdash;as did other parliaments, particularly the two French chambers. An EU-wide mechanism was set up and pilot projects jointly launched and completed. That is why the reform treaty takes parliamentary monitoring very seriously.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/15">Under Protocol 2, national parliaments now have eight weeks in which to send, if they wish, a reasoned opinion why a draft piece of legislation does not comply with the subsidiarity principle. If a third of the chambers raise concerns, the EU institution&mdash;usually the Commission&mdash;will have to review its proposal. It could decide to maintain it, amend it or withdraw the draft, giving its reasons in each case. That is known as the yellow card.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/16">However, the treaty, as the Lord President observed, goes further in favour of national parliaments, introducing an additional and stronger mechanism triggered at a higher threshold of votes. I make no apology for repeating this, because it is significant. In the case of draft legislative Acts subject to co-decision by the Council and the European Parliament, where the reasoned opinions for objection on subsidiarity grounds represent a simple majority of the votes allocated to national parliaments, the Commission must first justify its reasons if it wishes to maintain the proposal. It is then for the Council and the European Parliament to consider the Commission's justification and the national parliaments' objections. If 55 per cent of Council members or a majority of votes cast in the European Parliament are against the Commission, the proposal must be dropped. That is known as the orange card, it being the brainchild of the Dutch Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/17">We see no problem in there being two systems; together, the yellow and orange cards enhance the direct involvement of national parliaments in EU legislative procedures. However, in our preliminary report, which is already published, we identified a number of detailed questions to be asked about implementing the orange card. We suggest that the Government find the means to consult both Houses to ensure that the operation of these procedures is agreed between the Government and Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/18">The final issue for national parliaments that I will raise is the simplified procedure provided for treaty revision by the reform treaty, which the noble Lord, Lord Howell, mentioned. This is extremely important for your Lordships' House. The so-called passerelle or bridging provisions allow certain changes to the treaties without formal treaty amendment involving the convening of an intergovernmental conference. Under an article in the new treaty, any national parliament would have the right of veto over any proposed use of the simplified revision procedure, which may be applied to provisions of Part 3 of the treaty on the functioning of the Union, on Union policies and on internal actions. This is in line with earlier recommendations from the Select Committee to provide safeguards over the use of the passerelle.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/19">There are, however, still uncertainties over the precise extent and operation of the treaty's various passerelle provisions, although the principles are clear. In particular, it is not clear whether any national parliamentary veto will operate separately for two chambers in a bicameral parliament. The Select Committee objected strongly to the Government's previous proposal in relation to the aborted constitutional treaty that the parliamentary veto would be a matter for the other place, with this House merely allowed to express an opinion within 20 days. Our objection stands and we need to hear from the Government whether this discriminatory practice will apply under the new treaty. We sincerely hope not.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/20">I have spoken at some length about the reform treaty's impact on the role of national parliaments because we in the Select Committee and the sub-committees feel very strongly that the role of national parliaments in the conduct of the European Union's affairs is of the highest importance. I venture to suggest that that may be a view shared on all sides of the House, regardless of differing opinions on the merits of the reform treaty. The Select Committee will revisit the conclusions on the role of national parliaments reflected in our recent preliminary report of work in progress in light of the evidence that we are now taking on the broader report. I am sorry that I cannot say more about those emerging conclusions at this stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1732.0/21">Finally, I take this opportunity once again to express my sincere thanks to the nearly 80 members of your Lordships' House and the excellent staff supporting them, in their arduous and continuing task of ensuring that this House will have at its disposal a comprehensive and thoroughly objective assessment of the reform treaty before the Bill to ratify the treaty reaches your Lordships' House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-05a.1738.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100642" speakername="Lord Tomlinson" colon=":" colnum="1738"  time="017:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71205-0007.htm#07120564000025">
	<p pid="a.1738.0/1">My Lords, as the noble Lord knows, I have made my argument. I will listen to his later on if I have to.</p>
	<p pid="a.1738.0/2">At times, I believe that my Government are too timid about Europe. There are times when they should show greater drive, imagination and commitment to some of what I believe are our European obligations. I represented your Lordships' House in the Convention on the Future of Europe together with the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, and supported a draft constitution, as did my Government initially. Prior to ratification and under strong parliamentary pressure, the Government identified their red lines and sought to protect them. They succeeded, which resulted in major changes for all and even greater changes for some. The UK red lines were entrenched in the reform treaty by opt-ins, opt-outs, exemptions and emergency brakes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1738.0/3">Notwithstanding my view about the timidity of my Government, the simple fact is that we have only one reform treaty on offer and we have only one thing that we can do with it: if we do not support it, we must reject it. If we reject it, because of the requirement of unanimity in treaty changes, we will wind up with possibly the worst of all conclusions, which is a continuation of the Nice treaty, the most unsatisfactory of the amendments that have taken place over the years. It is not a question of the promised land being round the corner if we get rid of this reform treaty; this is the only reform treaty on offer and the alternative is the status quo of the treaty of Nice. I have my regrets, as I know other noble Lords may have, but our idiosyncratic wishes are not on offer when we come to debate the reform treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1738.0/4">We have a draft reform treaty agreed by heads of government with unanimity. It can be changed only by unanimity; we will not be offered a variant treaty. We must ratify or reject what is currently on the table. Nobody in your Lordships' House should allow their concept of the best to jeopardise the good that I believe is on offer.</p>
	<p pid="a.1738.0/5">What does the reform treaty significantly improve to the substantial benefit of not only our partners in the EU but also us? The noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, spelled out clearly the benefits to national parliaments. Those are very significant improvements, which we would be foolhardy to criticise or reject as somehow being a worsening of the position of national parliaments. There is the whole packet of extremely important institutional changes. My noble friend the Lord President referred clearly to the benefits of having a full-time president. There are the advantages that are made in the area of common foreign and security policy, with the double-hatting of the high representative.</p>
	<p pid="a.1738.0/6">The advantages that have come from our engagement in common foreign and security policy are many and important. That role has expanded dramatically. Our role in the Middle East peace process and in the stabilisation of the Balkans, our role with our European partners in relation to Iran, the various security missions in Bosnia, in Gaza, on the West Bank and in the Central African Republic and the role that has just been adopted in Chad are very important. They will be made more efficient and effective by the system of the double-hatting of the high representative. The benefits are manifold and I am sure that we will go through them when we come to ratification.</p>
	<p pid="a.1738.0/7">Much more can be said in favour of the reform treaty; we will no doubt talk about this day by day over goodness knows how many days when we come to ratification. As I said, only two things are on offer: the reform treaty agreed by unanimity and requiring ratification by unanimity, or the treaty of Rome, with all its imperfections. No other options or permutations are available. In such circumstances, I unhesitatingly commend the agenda for the Lisbon summit. I look forward to my right honourable friend the Prime Minister coming back and saying that the discussions have been successfully concluded and I look forward to us getting the Bill that it will be our prerogative to ratify.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-05a.1742.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100689" speakername="Lord Williamson of Horton" colon=":" colnum="1742"  time="018:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71205-0007.htm#07120564000050">
	<p pid="a.1742.0/1">My Lords, I begin by welcoming the Government's decision to hold a debate before a European Council. We have traditionally had Statements after European Councils, with a rather brief time for comments, particularly for Cross-Benchers. This is one of the first debates in advance of decisions by heads of state and government in a European Council. It may be true that, in the particular case of the reform treaty, our influence on the course of events is small, but the debate is none the less welcome.</p>
	<p pid="a.1742.0/2">I spent a good part of my career in the United Kingdom public service dealing with EU matters, and some years in the European Commission as I yo-yoed between London and Brussels in those days before the wonderful Eurostar. In the light of that I declare that I have pensions from both sources. More particularly, I spent many years on the business of European Councils and I was present in&mdash;not, unlike most officials, outside&mdash;every meeting of the heads of state and government in the European Council for 10 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1742.0/3">Although this debate is very welcome, we do not know precisely all the subjects that will be discussed at this European Council. At Seville, in 2002, the European Union decided that in future the draft agenda of European Councils would normally be available about six weeks before the meeting and the draft conclusions about three to four weeks before. I know that the Select Committee in another place in its current inquiry is considering who in its opinion might have access to these documents, but, in the mean time, that does not mean that ordinary Back-Benchers or even ex-Convenors have seen one.</p>
	<p pid="a.1742.0/4">Obviously, the reform treaty is the principal dish on this occasion. I am not too clear about the other, perhaps related, matters which may also be discussed in the European Council. I understand that these may include the proposal to appoint a group of wise men&mdash;and women, I hope&mdash;to examine the future direction of the Union. If so, I express the hope that they will be given terms of reference that enable them to concentrate on those issues that will be of interest and benefit not just to the so-called elite but to all our fellow countrymen and women and that they will not delve into institutional questions which should, in my view, be put away for many years to come.</p>
	<p pid="a.1742.0/5">I assume also that there will be discussions on globalisation and the European Union, to which the Government have referred in their pamphlet of October this year entitled <I>Global Europe</I><I>,</I> to which the noble Baroness the Lord President referred. I welcome that pamphlet and shall return to it later in my speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.1742.0/6">I come now to the reform treaty, as it is expected that this will be signed by the leaders of the member states of the European Union at the Lisbon European Council. If so, we know that the Government intend that it should not be submitted to a referendum but should be submitted for ratification by Parliament in the tradition of our parliamentary government. In consequence, we in this House will be asked to approve a Bill for that purpose. The treaty itself cannot be amended. It seems to me none the less that the key issue for us is to judge whether and in what respects the treaty is of benefit to the United Kingdom and its people since that is the decision we have to take in voting for or against a Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1742.0/7">I have already made it clear in earlier debates that I consider the measures in this treaty to be useful but not very important for Britain. That view puts me in a very small minority. Relative to the major issues of today, in particular the changes in our society resulting from the high level of immigration and our involvement in wars outside our frontiers, this treaty is not at the top of my agenda. However, I would stress the place of the proposed treaty and its historical context within the European Union. It was launched in the belief by many member states that the highly significant enlargement of the Union by the recent addition of the 12 new member states in central and south Europe, so that we are now a Union of almost half a billion people, in a very diverse Union of different national histories and traditions&mdash;a truly great event in the history of our continent&mdash;does call for some changes in the institutional structure and the rules to make the new Union work better. As I have always been a strong supporter of the recent enlargement of the Union, I think that this perception by our partners of the role of the new treaty is also important for Britain. We have to recognise that this is what our partner member states think and we have to take proper account of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1742.0/8">I pick out some points which illustrate why there is this perception of the reform treaty. Many of them have been mentioned here and no doubt will be mentioned again so I select a few. First, it is clear to me that the role which the member states of the Union together can play in encouraging peace, respect for human values, international development and stability, both worldwide and around our borders, has not been as effective as it might have been.</p>
	<p pid="a.1742.0/9">The common foreign and security policy has played a part but most member states think that they can do better as a result of the proposed changes, in particular, combining the foreign policy roles of the Commission and the high representative of the Council. The single person holding this role will be appointed by the member states in the European Council and can be sacked by it. He will chair the foreign ministers' council and be responsible to it, thus ending the six-monthly rotation rule. This should not only make action more consistent but also maximise the advantage of combining diplomacy and the leverage which the Commission can sometimes bring to bear. It is true that this is no more than a redistribution of existing functions in Brussels in order to make them more effective in arriving at and implementing policies on which all member states agree, but in the greatly enlarged Union this can be of value.</p>
	<p pid="a.1742.0/10">Secondly, there already exists a large network of external delegations of the European Commission. How many may come as a surprise; they fell within my responsibility to some degree when I was in Brussels. There are plenty of them all over the place, concerned for the most part with trade, aid and development issues. That is clearly a legacy of great value to the enlarged Union. It is now proposed to make better use of this network by putting it under the high representative, thus meshing it in with national diplomatic services which would also provide some people from their own national resources to widen the scope of the delegations' work. While maintaining our own excellent diplomatic service and presence in the world, I am certainly in favour of a little help from the External Action Service of the European Union. Indeed, when I was in Brussels I always believed that it could be used better.</p>
	<p pid="a.1742.0/11">Thirdly, the reform treaty includes elements which reflect public opinion right across the Union and are the opposite of supranational; for example, the increase in the role of national Parliaments&mdash;about which there has been quite a bit of discussion so far, and I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, for his intervention on that&mdash;and the specific recognition that the European Union's powers are only those which member states confer upon it,</p>
	<p pid="a.1742.0/12" class="indent">&quot;to attain objectives they have in common&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1742.0/13">More widely, we should use this Lisbon European Council, if the reform treaty is signed this week, as an opportunity to take stock, to turn away from dry and sterile arguments about institutional or treaty matters and to look towards the areas for priority action which we, the British, want to see in Europe. I therefore welcome the Government's pamphlet <I>Global Europe</I>. Most of the British public will welcome the eight priority areas in it, and their first reaction will be, &quot;Well, now, let's get on with it and achieve them, or at least make some progress towards them&quot;. That is clearly true of growth, employment, free trade, openness, climate change and energy security, and tackling terrorism and organised crime. Of course, most potential progress must rely on specific actions, such as improvement of the EU's Emissions Trading Scheme or the opening up of the energy and telecoms markets, as we have seen in the EU's action to reduce mobile phone roaming charges.</p>
	<p pid="a.1742.0/14">One point which the brochure might emphasise a little more is the importance of making as effective as possible the adaptation resulting from the current enlargement of the Union. It is not a one-off operation; some things must still be dealt with to make the best use of this greatly enlarged market and area of influence. The document demonstrates that the European Union is involved worldwide in tackling problems and exploiting opportunities which can be of considerable benefit to Britain. I strongly hope that, after the reform treaty, we can look to a future in the European Union no longer mired in treaty amendments, but committed to the search for action within the Union&mdash;which men and women in the Bell Inn Broadway, the indicator of political life in my part of the world, will see as worth while for them and their children.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-05a.1750.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100306" speakername="Lord Howe of Aberavon" colon=":" colnum="1750"  time="018:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71205-0008.htm#07120572000006">
	<p pid="a.1750.1/1">My Lords, I think that is enough badinage&mdash;I could not resist it. I have long since lost count of the number of speeches and pronouncements I have made on the European Community. I have often recalled in this House my first one. In the Jean Monnet era, in July 1950, I wrote a letter to a school friend just five years after we had left school. I wrote,</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/2" class="indent">&quot;Active British leadership of some more positive form of European Union is essential&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/3">Rather to my astonishment, three decades later, I found myself involved in the implementation of that wish. I became steeped in it in 1971-72, when we were engaged with the passage of the European Communities Bill. It lasted 53 days in the House of Commons. I made 91 speeches. We had 104 Divisions, and I was there for 325 hours. That was the first step in laying the framework for the positive achievements of the European Community, to which even my noble friend Lord Howell is willing to pay tribute. The second step was at a rather different pace. It was the Single European Act of 1986, which my noble friend Lady Thatcher enthusiastically supported. That took us only six days to get through the Commons, with the assistance of a guillotine. Those two formidable steps were taken without any form of referendum and were the foundations of all that has been achieved within the European Union: a partnership of co-operation in foreign policy and in the production of the single European market.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/4">What I find so astonishing in listening to the peroration of my noble friend Lord Howell&mdash;and we have worked together in many partnerships over the years&mdash;with the resurrection of nation states bargaining with each other and forming new agreements quite independently of treaties and alliances that may have been embodied in the European structure, is that my noble friend's dream would involve the disregard and destruction of almost all the European institutions we have created so far. He may wish to escape and yet retain all that, but the future can never be as simple as that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/5">I must confess that, having been involved in all those Acts years ago, I feel less well qualified to comment on any of these things. I can only listen with great admiration to the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell. The work he does with his many colleagues in this House in clarifying what we are about is of formidable importance, and it is particularly striking that this evening he dealt as clearly as he did with the enlarged role of the Parliaments as a result of the treaty we are considering. He went some way to offering me some comfort in relation to the passerelles. They are legitimate concerns.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/6">The fact is that since we took those initial steps, there has been a significant change in the scene, the environment and the agenda that we in Europe have to address. In almost all these respects it has become more important, not less, for us to address those issues than it was at the outset; for example, economic liberalisation is now relevant on a global scale; the single market achievement within the European Union is to be reproduced with success in the Doha round; and so on. There are many further measures of that kind.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/7">Beyond that, the agenda which is now so rightly being emphasised by my right honourable friend David Cameron in his leadership of our party is that of climate change, the environment and energy security. All those modern topics are additional items that call for a European approach to their solution. If one looks at the political world which the European Union is required to face, that, too, has enlarged as the years have gone by. Initially, we were grateful to the Union as it addressed the conflicts which were internal to our Continent from the Somme to Salerno and perhaps to Stalingrad. Those were the conflicts that we sought to tackle then.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/8">At the next stage, we mobilised the European Union to help us tackle the much more wide-ranging Cold War from Washington to Moscow. In today's world, the problems we have to tackle in foreign policy extend more widely and less predictably than that&mdash;from Kosovo to Kabul to Korea. They are problems that engage much larger powers than those with which we modest European states can deal. I have spoken in the House recently about China; for example, the extent to which China is leading Shanghai Co-operation Organisation in drawing together not just the five or six &quot;stans&quot; that were once in the Soviet Union but also China and Russia, and, increasingly, with India, Pakistan and Mongolia as observers of that international organisation. The case for European partnership in foreign policy is underlined by that, and, even more so, by the resurgence, if that is the right word, of Russia. Dean Acheson once said that our country had lost an empire and was looking for a role. Russia is now playing that part under the leadership of President Putin, as he still is. As my noble friend Lord Hurd pointed out in a remarkable speech on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-14">14 October</phrase> at Norwich, in the early days of the Putin era our European leadership behaved in a not very impressive way. My noble friend described it as the &quot;vain leadership&quot; era, with heads of Government, not only European heads of Government, but also the President of the United States, rushing in to compete with each other and establish a more favourable picture of themselves with President Putin. The President of the United States actually claimed to see President Putin's soul, he got so close to him. Fortunately, as a result of the changing style of Russian leadership, we now recognise the need for much more integrated policy development within the European Union and less of the competitive stuff.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/9">I quote from the speech of my noble friend Lord Hurd where he emphasised the positive nature of this. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The possibility of acting with our EU partners as Europeans should be regarded as a welcome opportunity not a fearsome threat. Because of the unanimity rule in the EU, whether under the proposed new Treaty or the existing rules, Britain cannot be forced on any subject into a common European foreign policy of which it disapproves. But as in Iran, as in Palestine, as in the Balkans today there is everything to be said for acting as Europeans if we can reach agreement. I believe&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/11">my noble friend concluded&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/12" class="indent">&quot;this is particularly true, but not yet achieved, in our dealings with President Putin and Russia&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/13">To facilitate this kind of partnership, the changes proposed in this treaty have been put forward; for example, the changes as a result of having a much larger Union. The enlargement of the Union is something for which our party, indeed every party in this country, has been campaigning. As a result, we have been able to nurture democracy instead of dictatorships, first in the Iberian Peninsula and thereafter throughout what used to be part of the Warsaw Pact. It is inevitable that we have to make the kind of changes that are contained in the treaty for decision-making purposes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/14">In foreign policy, we need also to have the changes made that concern themselves with the high representative of foreign policy. My noble friend Lord Waddington paints a picture of this foreign policy monster, this fearful creature somehow stripping away all our power in foreign policy. I do not regard the European institutions of that kind as threatening us; I regard them as amplifying our potential influence. We have to draw together our views with those of our European partners and be more clearly seen on the world stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/15">To have got away from the six-month turnover presidency of the European Union is plainly nothing more than common sense. In the good old days I took part in designing a European Union presidency tie. The idea of having to design a new tie every six months, because the turnover is that fast, is absurd. To have a president for two and-a-half years is a much more sensible arrangement. And to have someone who is able to speak with the authority, backed by the Council as well as the Commission, of the High Representative is exactly what we want.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/16">I come finally to the process of ratification. If ratification takes place at all, it will do so, as it did in relation to the Single European Act and the European Communities Act, with the consent of both Houses of Parliament. As I have said, I do not believe that it was right for the previous Prime Minister to promise a referendum in respect of this treaty. I commended the cause of referenda of the kind that I helped to design about Sunday pub opening in Wales every seven years on a county basis. That is an issue that can be plainly put to the electorate, and was so put; but a referendum on this topic is unnecessary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/17">I say one word beyond that; a word to those who would urge leadership of my own party, when elected, after the treaty has been ratified by the parliamentary process, exactly as it was in 1972 and 1986, to set about having a referendum on the approval or otherwise of the treaty. That would be a profoundly mistaken move. It would be entirely wrong to consider embarking on that course which might involve deliberately repudiating an international obligation. It would be extremely damaging to our position in Europe since it would inevitably be interpreted as a first step towards withdrawal from the Union. It would be equally damaging to our own domestic agenda, to have the early years of a Cameron Government dominated by that problem, as the Labour Government of 1974 were, which is now some 30 years ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/18">If one wishes to secure changes within the working of the European Union after this treaty has been ratified&mdash;and I can understand colleagues in any body wishing to do so&mdash;the right way to achieve them would not be by constantly threatening to make our way to the exit, but by becoming effectively engaged in the organs of the European Union. There, I feel one anxiety profoundly at present. If our country is to be effective in securing what we can achieve by discussion through existing and future organisations of the European Union and to be effective in amplifying our policy ambitions more widely, we need the kind of leadership in those institutions that is likely to persuade our colleagues, rather than making them turn away in despair and frustration.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/19">I am not altogether convinced that our new Prime Minister will be able to address that topic in the right way. He has a disregard for staying at British embassies. During his time as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in one year, he attended Finance Council meetings only twice. That is no way to represent British interests and achieve British objectives in the European Union. He needs to be there; his Ministers need to be there. There again, I am concerned. It is not his fault, but during my six years at the Foreign Office&mdash;this is nothing to do with my decision-making&mdash;I had only two Ministers of State responsible for European policy: my noble friend Lady Chalker and my right honourable friend Malcolm Rifkind, for three years each. During 10 years of the Labour Government, there have been nine European Ministers who, with the exception of Denis MacShane, who survived two and a half years, had an average span in office of about nine or 10 months. We need engagement of a human and effective kind.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/20">I hope that the Prime Minister will benefit from the story on which I shall close. It is quite a short one. At one European Council meeting under Danish chairmanship, when we were grinding close to Christmas Day&mdash;we were sitting at 2 am on the last night&mdash;the Danish Prime Minister, Mr Schl&uuml;ter, finally said that we had to pack up, although we had not completed the agenda. We hastily began packing up our papers and, suddenly, to my astonishment, President Mitterrand, at the other end of the table, began holding forth as though it was doomsday, saying that if we were going to go on like this, we would find ourselves disintegrating and we might as well go back to the six nations with which we started.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/21">When he finished, to my astonishment, my noble friend Lady Thatcher, who was sitting beside me, piped up. We were all waiting to go. She said, &quot;It's not been like that at all, President Mitterrand. It has been very good. We have not quite succeeded but, if you remember, under your presidency in Fontainebleau a year or two ago, we were able to complete the agenda. I am sure that the same will happen now, President Mitterrand, and that next year under Chancellor Kohl's leadership, it will all be right. So cheer up, Mr Mitterrand&quot;. The president looked as though he had been smacked in the face by a wet fish, but only for a moment. He responded by saying, &quot;Madame Thatcher is even more beguiling when she is saying yes then when she is saying no&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1750.1/22">I cannot imagine the present Prime Minister being able to evoke that kind of response, but that is what he ought to try for.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-05a.1762.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100279" speakername="Lord Harrison" colon=":" colnum="1762"  time="019:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71205-0010.htm#07120571000043">
	<p pid="a.1762.1/1">My Lords, I am grateful for that intervention, but my charge is that often the noble Lord and other Euro-Glums refuse to talk about the elements of either the constitutional or the reform treaties and simply refer to their genesis. In purporting to defend British values, the Euro-Glums are calling for a referendum, which is itself an un-British circumvention of established and well tried parliamentary practices, including those in your Lordships' House. The red Benches are best fitted to examine the red lines of the reform treaty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1762.1/2">I notice also the invocation of various dignitaries from political life in the European Union. The noble Lord, Lord Howell of Guildford, mentioned Val&eacute;ry Giscard d'Estaing. I heard him on the &quot;Today&quot; programme and he was less than keen on the British Government's view of what had happened. He is, of course, a Euro-federalist and it is surprising that the noble Lord should choose to invoke him. It is noticeable that others are not invoked. An old friend from the European Parliament, Elmar Brok MEP, who leads the EPP and on foreign affairs, was very angry that the British obtained the red lines they did at the negotiation. I was in Italy two days after the decision and I read the Italian publication <I>La Republica</I> of <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-20">20 October</phrase>. It declared:</p>
	<p pid="a.1762.1/3" class="indent">&quot;La Gran Bretagna invece ha ottenuto tutto&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1762.1/4">In other words, Great Britain won the lot. That was a clear view from another country which is simply not reported or allowed for in the thinking on this important subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.1762.1/5">I congratulate Her Majesty's Government on defending the red lines so assiduously. It is true that some tidying-up and clarification is still needed. The noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, helped with the question of the passerelle. But we need some assurances on that, on the charter of fundamental rights and on the status of the United Kingdom's opt-outs and some of its opt-ins; we would like to know about any possible expiry dates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1762.1/6">My main purpose in speaking today is to say to Her Majesty's Government that it is time to move up a gear from defending the red lines to defining the green lights&mdash;to tell the people the good things about the reform treaty. Her Majesty's Government should celebrate sweeping away the defunct bureaucracy of institutions that were constructed principally at the time of the original six pioneering states. This is sensible reform which enables 27 EU countries to concentrate on the real issues confronting the European Union and the wider world that the noble Lord, Lord Howell, referred to&mdash;economic reform, terrorism and climate change. I heard a pleasing story the other day that the Champagne country in France would, as a result of climate change and global warming, move to Britain and we would be responsible for growing the grapes and making the wine in our own country if matters were not taken into hand.</p>
	<p pid="a.1762.1/7">We should celebrate giving continuity to the European Union councils by the longer two-and-a-half-year renewable presidencies, and having only one high representative&mdash;in foreign affairs&mdash;who is free to act only when all 27 states have spoken with unanimity. Also, reducing the size of the European Commission to make it more athletic in the way it responds to the changing world outside must be a sensible reform. Indeed we should celebrate your Lordships' House and other national parliaments, which have new and strengthened powers, referred to again by the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, to intrude on Brussels law-making and not only to emphasise those elements of subsidiarity which would require national parliaments to make decisions, but&mdash;this is often forgotten&mdash;to make a judgment about whether proposed EU law is proportionate to the requirements that challenge and face us all. Do the Euro-Glums reject this giving of powers to the national parliaments to be able to scrutinise legislation? Indeed, as I understand it, the new treaty, which we should celebrate, enshrines the right of member states to leave the European Union if they so wish. Is that also rejected by the Euro-Glums?</p>
	<p pid="a.1762.1/8">We should celebrate the extension of QM voting to take us from the sclerotic to dynamic and vital areas such as the creation of energy policy, humanitarian aid and realising a common and foreign security policy that was agreed as long ago as 1992. I celebrate, and I ask the Government to do likewise, the double check on safeguarding Britain's vote within the Council by the new form of what I call double-entry voting in the Council, thereby making Britain, as a large country, less vulnerable to the Lilliputian states that might otherwise circumvent our views. We should celebrate the extension of co-decision-making. Earlier in the debate the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, emphasised the role of the European Parliament. We should not hide the increasing of the democratic element of the European institutions under a bushel, but should celebrate it. I remind those who reject the European Union and the European Parliament, and there are too many of them, that when I was last voted into the European Parliament by the good people of Cheshire, I received over 100,000 votes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1762.1/9">I say to the Minister, who is batting&mdash;and battling&mdash;on the front foot, that the treaty is a good thing that will bring about its own rewards. The EU story is a good one. I shall give noble Lords an example from Sub-Committee F of the European Union Select Committee, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell. We went for a tripartite meeting with other national parliaments and the European Parliament, and we heard about the European Union arrest warrant, which was so berated in this country. We learnt from the director-general of the European Commission Justice, Freedom and Security department, Jonathan Faull, that 7,000 arrests had been made in the past year, a number that has doubled. That number reflects our increasing ability to catch the criminals and potential terrorists who might otherwise threaten the people of the European Union. Let us shout that from the rooftops and say, &quot;This is because Europe has decided to get together to demonstrate and help the people of Europe not only to enjoy their freedom, but to create the prosperity that they deserve&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1762.1/10">When we come to the end of this Council and the reform treaty is signed, I would ask one other thing of our Prime Minister. This is only a little point, but I will say it. No one would describe the Prime Minister as a champagne socialist, but the next time the glasses are raised to celebrate, with champagne, the coming of another treaty that marks an advance for the British people within the European Union because such a treaty is signed, he too should get up and celebrate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-05a.1769.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100102" speakername="Lord Campbell of Alloway" colon=":" colnum="1769"  time="019:43:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71205-0011.htm#07120576000001">
	<p pid="a.1769.0/1">My Lords, it is a privilege to follow the noble Lord, Lord Watson of Richmond&mdash;more than usually so on this occasion. The question that he has asked is the one that I proposed to address, and almost in that form. We have different means of address, of course, but I agree that that is the substance and heart of what we have to debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1769.0/2">Speaking late in an important debate such as this, I do not propose to indulge in repetition. I will try, if I may, not to bore the House. I will therefore not speak about a referendum. What I think about it is relatively unimportant. In fact, I am not really so keen on a referendum but, as I said on a previous occasion, the Conservative Party should have a manifesto commitment on it. I should say at once that I do not have the privilege of speaking for my party; I do not think that I ever have had, or ever shall. Yet, speaking for myself, I believe that we really have to resolve the heart of the problem that the noble Lord raised by having a manifesto commitment at the next general election to withdraw from this reform treaty. I have said it once, I say it again: that is at the heart of this problem, because the electorate will then have the opportunity to decide. It is for the people to decide, not your Lordships' House or the other place. The best way of deciding is on a manifesto commitment, not a referendum. However, I will say no more about that, because I do not suppose that anyone agrees with me much.</p>
	<p pid="a.1769.0/3">Taking the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Williamson, I would love it if the Council could take stock when it meets, but I do not believe that that is a viable proposition at this stage. We owe an enormous debt of gratitude to the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, for the European Union Committee's report. If its advice is read carefully, it draws attention to the need for the Government to explain the manner in which the European Court of Justice will interpret treaty provisions. I talk of the heart of the problem, on which I propose to address the House. It also draws attention to the need&mdash;and I am using its words, not mine&mdash;for a government explanation on how the passerelle provisions will protect our national interest. On that, there is the report of the European committee from another place that the red lines could not protect our interests by reason&mdash;I come to it again&mdash;of the extended powers of the European Court of Justice in the exercise of its jurisdiction on treaty interpretation and of the extended powers of the Commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.1769.0/4">We may have to face up to rejecting the treaty, but we cannot do that before there is another Government, because, whether you like it or not, and I do not like it much, this Government is our Government. They have made an agreement and, having done so, that agreement has to be ratified, because in the order of international affairs you cannot make an agreement and then not ratify it. The only way to extricate ourselves from this situation now is, as I have suggested, on a manifesto commitment and an election. That is because another Government will not be bound by what this Government did.</p>
	<p pid="a.1769.0/5">In that context, it becomes relevant to consider what our global and national interests are. I go back to the remarks of my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford&mdash;I am using some of his ideas. We are concerned with our Commonwealth, our special relationship with the United States, from which we should never step aside, our financial global interests and our massively expensive defence structure and commitments. Those alone are wholly disparate from the concerns of the 27 or more member states of an enlarged European Union, which, incidentally, has already engaged the sensitivities of Russia, a matter not to be ignored.</p>
	<p pid="a.1769.0/6">This enlarged European Union, seeking its ever closer relationship, cannot operate without a form of administrative integration and harmonisation of customs and law, imposed by the Commission as a matter of administration. With 27 states, how on earth is it going to operate without a very tight administrative structure imposed on it? That has been reflected in a series of decisions made by the European Court of Justice, which has interpreted the provisions of the treaty in different cases always in favour of integration on the balance of a series of objectives that, under this treaty, include Articles 1 to 3. I never refer to cases in your Lordships' House because I know that it is very boring to do so, but with that series of cases I think that the principle of the balance of objectives would be accepted as common ground. It certainly is by lawyers who know anything about it. However, as my noble friend Lord Howell of Guildford said in a previous debate, we are already moving in the wrong direction. To avoid repetition, we can leave it at that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1769.0/7">The Government have, so to speak, supported ratification of this treaty on a series of ministerial assurances. One was that there would be no further step towards integration for 10 years; another was that there would be no adverse effect on employment in the United Kingdom; another was that competition law would remain unchanged. I am not going to read out my notes on that, as I have dealt with it at Question Time and on previous occasions and this is no occasion for an academic debate. However, it is an occasion to say that the principle of the balance of objectives is the manner in which the European Court of Justice will interpret treaty provisions in the exercise of a supranational authority. There is nothing in the way of the concept by which our courts make their decisions; it is a totally different form of dispensation of justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1769.0/8">I am leaving the question of competition law and principle to the noble Lord, Lord Wedderburn of Charlton, to deal with, as he dealt with it before on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October</phrase>, at cols. 121-22 in the <I>Official Report</I>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1769.0/9">In conclusion, there is no cause for surprise that Russia should be sensitive about an overextending Union of integrated states on its borders. Indeed, the advice of the first Earl of Malmesbury would be welcome today, albeit that President Putin is not Catherine the Great. It would not have been expected that any dispute between the retention of state sovereignty insisted on by de Gaulle and a form of integration advocated by Jean Monnet which could not be resolved at Messina should be resolved by ratification of this treaty. It remains open; the door has not been totally closed. It was left open because there could not be agreement&mdash;left open in the Rome treaty to enable the Court to devise and implement its own procedures. At the UK accession to the EEC, the concept of integration was not accepted and, as far as I am aware, has never been accepted by the electorate, albeit that Governments have taken steps in that direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1769.0/10">I conclude by referring again to my noble friend's concept. He may be speaking for the party&mdash;I have no idea&mdash;but I am not. But at least he said, and I agree, for the reasons given, that the Government have taken a step too far in the wrong direction.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-05a.1775.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100945" speakername="Lord Willoughby de Broke" colon=":" colnum="1775"  time="020:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71205-0012.htm#07120576000026">
	<p pid="a.1775.0/1">My Lords, when I heard the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, suggest that the Conservatives should have a manifesto commitment for withdrawal from the European Union, I could hardly believe my ears. Whether that will find favour with my erstwhile friends on the Front Bench I do not know. I thought I saw the noble Lord, Lord Howell, turn a whiter shade of pale when he heard that. We will see; I do not expect him to have to answer that this evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/2">I will draw your Lordships' memories back to the Laeken declaration. How many noble Lords remember that? I know that the noble Lord, Lord Tomlinson, did, but he was on the substitutes' bench during the later convention. That was when, if noble Lords recall, the leaders of the European Union finally recognised that perhaps the people of European Union states were fed up with not being consulted, with their views not being taken into account, with deals being done behind closed doors and with the apparently incessant transfer of powers from their parliaments to the centre, to the unelected bureaucrats in Brussels. The Laeken declaration proposed returning powers to member states, to national and local level, at least to give the appearance if not the reality of some sort of redress of what has been referred to as the democratic process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/3">Even those minimal fig leaves for sovereignty and national parliaments were soon swept away during the subsequent convention under Val&eacute;ry Giscard d'Estaing, which was given such a resounding raspberry by the French and Dutch electorates. I am rather sorry that they voted against the treaty, because it deprived us of having our say. Had the French and Dutch voted &quot;Yes&quot;, we in this country would have had a referendum; no prizes for guessing what the result would have been. The French and Dutch votes effectively allowed Mr Blair to slip out of his commitment to give us a referendum. The French and Dutch votes did not even dent the Eurocrats' determination to press on with further integration. They went on as though nothing had happened. As Mr Juncker, the Prime Minister of Luxembourg put it:</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/4" class="indent">&quot;If it's a yes we will say 'on we go' and if it's a no we will say 'we continue'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/5">That is democracy in action for you.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/6">So after what was amusingly called a period of reflection, the Eurocrats have come back with the reform treaty, which is a sort of constitution in drag, if you like; Tommy Cooper dressed up as Widow Twanky. I do not want to do the heads of state of the members of the European Union an injustice; they have been very honest about what the reform treaty is. It is the constitution. I will not weary your Lordships by going through the list. The noble Lords, Lord Waddington and Lord Howell, mentioned all the many heads of state who have said that this is just the same thing as it was before. You can take your pick; 90 per cent or 99 per cent the same, it is the treaty by another name.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/7">In preparing for the debate, I looked up the blog written by Giscard d'Estaing. Obviously it is in French, and I have translated it. In case any noble Lords think that I am traducing him in my translation, I have a copy here, which anyone is at liberty to look at. He says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/8" class="indent">&quot;I have given myself the task of comparing the new Lisbon treaty with the Constitution on the 'nine essential points' published on this blog. To my surprise and in truth, to my great satisfaction, these nine points are repeated word for word in the new project. There is not a single comma that has changed&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/9">The &quot;nine points&quot; are: legal personality; the fixed presidency&mdash;he notes with some satisfaction that Germany will not get the presidency for another 13 years; the Minister for Foreign Affairs; definition of competences; the legislative procedure; national parliaments' role; number of commissioners; confirmation of the Commission's sole right to initiate legislation; and the rules on QMV. The man who wrote the constitution says that there is no change. Let us not pretend that it is different.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/10">He went on to answer a question asked by someone on his blog who was worried about the right of member states to leave the Union. He says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Don't worry about that. It was in the Constitution as well, as a reply to the intimidation campaign run&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/12">the noble Lord, Lord Dykes will recognise this&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/13" class="indent">&quot;by the 'anglo-saxon eurosceptics'&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/14">who on earth can he mean by that?&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/15" class="indent">&quot;who made the EU sound like a prison from which there was no escape&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/16">He goes on to say, unblushingly:</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/17" class="indent">&quot;This is in the text simply to underline that membership of the EU depends, like any great democratic act, on popular approval&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/18">That is, la volont&eacute; populaire. I assume that means Giscard d'Estaing wants to have a referendum. He wants popular approval for the treaty. Or does he? I do not know. Perhaps the noble Lord, Lord Watson, could answer that for me.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/19">What popular approval has there been? This goes to the heart of the whole debate on Europe, as my noble friend Lord Pearson has said. There is the undoubted feeling in this country that we have been conned on Europe and that we have not been told the truth for a very long time, going right back to the early days of our entry to the Common Market&mdash;not, pace the noble Lord, Lord Watson of Richmond, the European Community; we voted for the Common Market in 1975, not the European Community&mdash;when we were told that there would be no essential transfer of sovereignty. Try telling that to the people of this country now; now that we have given away our powers over trade, immigration, social policy, energy, the environment, farming and fisheries. Try telling that to the people now that we have a European Parliament, a European Court of Justice, a European flag and a European anthem. I remind your Lordships that all that has been given away and transposed to Brussels without the people of this country ever being asked if that is what they wanted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/20">Here we are again, proposing to give away yet more powers without the permission of the people of this country and without a fight, telling another blatant whopper that the treaty is not a constitution because it has no constitutional character, even though it gives the EU legal personality, abolishes the national veto in 60 areas, creates a Foreign Minister and diplomatic service, and reduces our ability to block EU legislation by up to 30 per cent, as well as providing the means to transfer more powers to Brussels without consulting national parliaments at all. Kafka could have written the script.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/21">The red lines have been effectively disposed of by others, particularly by the committee in the other place. Just under six months ago, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-24">24 June</phrase>, the Prime Minister said that it was a matter of honour and trust. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/22" class="indent">&quot;the manifesto is what we put to the public, we've got to honour that manifesto. That is an issue of trust for me and with the electorate&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/23">The more the Government talk about honour, the faster we count our spoons. We were promised, finally, a long-overdue referendum on our relationship with the EU. We were promised that; it is a fact. Now the Government are trying to wriggle out of that promise, which is shameful.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/24">Fundamentally, this is about democracy. As the noble Lord, Lord Waddington, said, the last time that people in this country had a vote on Europe was 32 years ago. No one under the age of 50 has had a vote on whether we want to give more powers away to the European Union. We have been asked neither that nor whether to take powers back&mdash;or even to leave the EU, which is what my party wants. I ask both Lord Watsons, what would be disastrous about actually leaving the European Union? Is it disastrous to be freer, to run our own trade, immigration or foreign policy? Is it disastrous to have powers in our elected Parliament or not to give away &pound;14 billion every year to the European Union? Would it be disastrous to run our own agriculture and fisheries? Of course not. Masses of countries outside the EU prosper. We are the fourth or fifth biggest economy in the world, depending on whether or not you believe the Chinese statistics. Of course we can prosper outside the EU. We can trade with it perfectly happily, even though we trade at a massive deficit. The scare story that we need to be in the EU as a trading, financial and political necessity is simply a sham&mdash;a scare story that is not true.</p>
	<p pid="a.1775.0/25">I come back to the Laeken declaration. Is it not ironic that the Government are to give away more power without public consent? The Laeken declaration's aim was to reconnect&mdash;I think that that was the word&mdash;with the voters. Why are the Government running scared of a vote if they want to reconnect with the voters? Is it because they might lose it? That would be democracy in action. If they lose the vote, they lose it. That is reconnecting with the voters. I thought that that was what Governments wanted to do. It seems that we are getting back to the position where the man in Whitehall knows best. If that is the case, it will be very dangerous.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-05a.1778.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100942" speakername="Lord Wedderburn of Charlton" colon=":" colnum="1778"  time="020:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71205-0012.htm#07120576000038">
	<p pid="a.1778.0/1">My Lords, it is a great pleasure to follow the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, even if I do not accept some of his conclusions. In an attempt to be brief I have engaged in the perilous venture of adapting my notes so as not to repeat much of what has already been said.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/2">First, I want to say to my noble friend Lady Ashton that I am sure that whatever conclusions noble Lords reach they have no doubt about the ambitious aims which she set out for the Government in regard to this reform treaty. It is what we are supposedly here to discuss. Many noble Lords have ventured into historical and future realms that have little to do with the treaty. We are grateful that my noble friend gave an introduction that was, in my humble opinion, very useful. The House has a duty to examine the likely effects of this treaty. It has effects on our law and, if one speaks frankly and accurately, it has effects on our constitutional practices.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/3">The streamlining in the evolving form of the amendments alters the relationship between our practices and those of the European Union. I hope that our debates that follow this debate, of which there will be many, can be engaged in without acrimonious styles of speech. Indeed, I welcome especially what the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, had to say about the work of the European Union Committee in attempting to assist us in our debates on the ratification Bill. I wish only that I were more directly engaged in the committee's work, but we will thank him for the results that he produces with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/4">It appears to be customary to say something about how one has approached this moment in our history. I have spent some 40 years in scholarly life working with friends and colleagues in western Europe, especially in France, Europe and the Nordic countries in the comparative law of our social affairs, especially as regards employment. I have to say to the House that I cannot easily fit into one of the boxes that some noble Lords insist one must inhabit, either as a pure Europhile or Eurosceptic. They usually add some remark that their views must be somehow infected with poison or undue prejudice. That approach is in parallel absurdity to the line in Gilbert and Sullivan's &quot;Iolanthe&quot; that every little girl and boy alive must be either a liberal or a conservative. We on these Benches know that to be wrong and absurd, however many Benches people inhabit in their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/5">Our debates will profit better if varying views can be discussed rationally and with the usual tolerance of the House. Indeed, some noble Lords this evening should have had in mind the guidance on pages 50 to 53 of the <I>Companion</I> that one should not refer to Members of another place in a personal manner and that Standing Order 33 refers to asperity of speech. I hope that our debates can reach a slightly different plane from the speeches of some noble Lords, most of whom have left. I do not refer to the two or three speeches that preceded mine.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/6">I had wished to address four aspects of the treaty&mdash;the so-called passerelle articles, the Court of Justice, the charter of fundamental rights and the United Kingdom's protocol, which currently is No. 7. My greatest problem arises from the evolving texts that have been extremely difficult to obtain, but I have had much help from the Library. As to the final text, we still do not know how each word will be placed. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November</phrase>, at col. 738, my noble friend Lady Ashton said that the texts were still being worked on&mdash;exactly as I had believed. She believed that she could present the final text to the House,</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/7" class="indent">&quot;very soon. I cannot say when, but I am told that it will be very soon&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 20/11/07; col. 738.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/8">The document placed in the Printed Paper Office today was the latest text of rather opaque amendments to the existing treaty. We are now to have two treaties, the treaty of the European Union and the treaty on the functioning of the European Union. Only last week, I understand, the whole thing was about to be renumbered. It is difficult to know how the European Court of Justice would approach some of the phrases that are being worked on. The ECJ is of course the supreme court for what broadly amounts to our constitutional affairs&mdash;at least, for the aspects that are covered by the treaty which are very wide indeed. The passerelle clauses are the articles that allow the Council to move by unanimous vote from unanimity to qualified majority on issues that include revisions of the treaty. They were explained in the Statement of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-22">22 October</phrase> in the following way. He said that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/9" class="indent">&quot;we propose to build further safeguards into the legislation ... we will make a provision in the Bill&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/10">that is, the ratification Bill&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/11" class="indent">&quot;that any proposal to activate the mechanisms in the treaty that provide for further moves to QMV, but which require unanimity of member states, will have to be subject to a prior vote by this House&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 22/10/07; col. 22.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/12">I carefully checked <I>Hansard</I> on this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/13">The European Court of Justice will not regard as a binding source of law a vote in this House. That is quite apart from the question, which I have to leave aside, of whether both Houses should be involved. The European Court of Justice will look only at what is in the treaty. I understand that the current text of the treaty affords to us a paragraph which states that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/14" class="indent">&quot;if a national parliament makes known its opposition within six months of the date of such notification&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/15">of a proposal&mdash;to use a passerelle clause&mdash;then the decision referred to in the first and second subparagraphs will not be adopted. It is very unusual for any other body to apply a time clause to what this House and this Parliament should do. It is unusual and it is also something that the German and Italian constitutional courts objected to when the European Court of Justice developed its doctrine. It is a development of the doctrine of the Court&mdash;and it is far more than a doctrine based on texts in the previous treaties&mdash;that it is a supreme court of an activist kind and it can develop in a most positive way the meaning of what is called the &quot;new legal order&quot; of the Community as it was.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/16">In a judgment in 1992&mdash;I shall quote only one sentence&mdash;the Court said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/17" class="indent">&quot;As the Court of Justice has consistently held, the Community treaties established a new legal order for the benefit of which the States have limited their sovereign rights, in ever wider fields, and the subjects of which comprise not only Member States but also their nationals&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/18">That quotation fairly summarises many other judgments in which the Court has developed its position. Because that is so, the Court's interpretation of the treaties constitutes our highest national law in the field covered by them. Some of us hold that that is especially important in regard to the social protections available in this globalised world&mdash;especially for people at work. The Court of Justice already determines the meaning of the very positive side of European law&mdash;a positive side that touches on sex equality, the prohibition of discrimination, and the protection of work transfers and the like. But the legal base of European social policy is now in the balance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/19">In his expert book, <I>Labour Laws and Global Trade</I>, Professor Sir Bob Hepple recorded that after a judgment in 1999 the European Court of Justice,</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/20" class="indent">&quot;came to recognise the possible conflict&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/21">between, on one side, articles establishing employers' economic rights to freedom of movement of goods and so on and, on the other, social rights that commentators find inherent in the treaties. With one exception, it is very difficult to find texts on which to base that social dimension. The one exception is the European Charter of Fundamental Rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/22">At the European level, the charter of fundamental rights, adopted at Nice, was and is regarded by most member states as binding and, as mentioned by one noble Lord earlier, as being a charter on which their nationals could no doubt rely in the common method of their legal system. This is very important because only next week the European Court of Justice will deliver two judgments which will be fundamental to this conflict between the economic rights of employers on the one side and, on the other, the so-called rights of workers' organisations collectively to bargain and even to take industrial action. One writer, Dr Ann Davies of Oxford&mdash;not the home of extreme radicalism&mdash; said in a headline article that this occasion will be:</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/23" class="indent">&quot;The Right to Strike Versus Freedom of Establishment in EC Law&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/24">Two opinions are given by the Advocates-General, Maduro and Mengozzi, who offer a parallel perspective. If in fact the Court decides that the economic article of rights of freedom of establishment and freedom to offer services in any state can be restricted or interrupted by industrial action in collective bargaining, there will be a very difficult situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/25">That should lead me, although I apprehend that I shall not be able to deal with it in detail, to the protocol&mdash;currently No. 7&mdash;which the United Kingdom has successfully bargained to be part of a legally binding protocol to the treaty. It is in two parts. The first states that the European Court of Justice cannot extend its jurisdiction to give the charter any legal force in the United Kingdom. The court that decides whether it is extending its jurisdiction is the European Court of Justice. The second part states that nothing in the charter is to be justiciable unless it is included in United Kingdom law. However, that second limb has the words,</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/26" class="indent">&quot;in particular, and for the avoidance of doubt&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/27">On the avoidance of doubt, many writers at least raise the question of whether the European Court of Justice will be able to avoid that conclusion because &quot;avoidance of doubt&quot; accepts that there is a doubt. In parallel cases, which I have not time to explain in detail, the Court has used precisely that sort of argument. The case in which I think it would arise is, as another noble Lord said, one brought by a citizen of another member state.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/28">The charter is therefore of great importance in the reform treaty and I hope that we will have further occasions to advert to the protocol. Such fundamental legal questions which test how far the treaty's neo-liberal economic ambitions allow for social protections that intervene on them were, unhappily, not at the centre of any discussion in the IGC. They will, however, be at the centre of further juridical developments in the Court of Justice and may eventually have profound effects on whatever text is finally agreed. This House and another place will have to see how far they can influence the ratification Bill in advance of that problem. Some noble Lords have said that we can have no influence at all. That is a despairing plea which echoes a widespread feeling.</p>
	<p pid="a.1778.0/29">When the Government meet continuing requests, as they will, including from the grass roots of our own party, for some voice for the people on this new arrangement which deeply affects our constitution, the absence of such preparation to meet those problems on which there is now a vast literature will, I fear, have very unfortunate consequences for the Government whom I support.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-05a.1796.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="1796"  time="021:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71205-0015.htm#0712066000002">
	<p pid="a.1796.0/1">My Lords, it has been an extremely good debate. I note with interest that I am the only woman speaking today. I hope that by the time we get to the legislation, that will not be the case. There have been some predictable speeches and some persuasive speeches: all have been extremely passionate. The prize for being succinct and to the point goes to the most reverend Primate to whom I am most grateful. I get very nervous when people wish to speak in the gap because it extends our debate, but on this occasion I was delighted that the most reverend Primate did so for very obvious reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/2">We returned to some themes that have already become very familiar to me. My particular favourite is what I call the &quot;referendum with quotes&quot; theme. For every quote noble Lords are able to produce in one direction, I can produce a quote in another direction. I can quote President Barroso saying on 11 of October&mdash;and I say this with feeling:</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Please read the treaty. It is not a constitution. I have been a constitutional lawyer teaching in Geneva and Washington, this is not a constitution, this is another treaty, and by the way a treaty, even as a treaty where Britain negotiated very, very clear opt-outs&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/4">The Dutch Council of State referred to earlier, but perhaps not given the prominence it deserves, said that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/5" class="indent">&quot;the proposed Reform Treaty is substantially different from the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/6">We could spend a lot of our time, and we no doubt will, discussing different points. My main point is that when we discuss the legislation, I hope that rather than trade quotes from others, we will be able to debate and deliberate on the detail of what is before us, to make sure that we all understand it precisely and can make our decisions accordingly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/7">Being in your Lordships' House is a little like listening to a gramophone record. For younger viewers and listeners to the debate, I also mean using the repeat button of an iPod nano. We do, on occasion, refer to things again and again. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, referred to a piece of granite. I was thinking about the granite in my kitchen, which I regard as strong and durable. It is occasionally beautiful; I also have earrings made of granite. I do not necessarily accept that being referred to as granite is something that we should regard as detrimental.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/8">I am still not sure that the noble Lord has answered my question, so I will pose it again. I do not expect him to intervene on me, for I am conscious of time. I pose it so that we can again discuss it when we come towards the Bill. If we believe that Parliament has the role of debating and determining our legislation, and if this Parliament in both Houses decides to support the ratification of the treaty, will the party opposite accept that ratification? That is an important question, and Europe wishes to know the answer, because it is important to be sure that those who believe in Parliament accept the will of Parliament. At some point, we must debate that. The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, gave an alternative proposal for a manifesto, which the noble Lord, Lord McNally, referred to. I wait with interest to see whether that is picked up. The noble Lord may indeed be listened to by his colleagues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/9">The fundamental issue that I failed to understand in our debates&mdash;noble Lords will have to forgive me for this&mdash;is how, if over four years we have moved from 15 member states to 27, the processes and practices that were applicable to the 15 can possibly be applicable to the 27. Noble Lords on all sides of the House will no doubt be critical of the bureaucracy of Brussels. I spent two and a half years on the Justice Council, where I met many eminent and distinguished people across the European Union, including Ministers, officials and members of the Commission. It was as blindingly obvious to me that we could make things more efficient as it was to them. This is part of that process. We should not take away the need&mdash;which is important whatever stance noble Lords wish to take on Europe&mdash;to make sure that it runs as efficiently as possible; except perhaps for those noble Lords who would wish us out of the process altogether.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/10">It is important that we look at this in the context of what we are seeking to achieve. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Wallace, that I was grateful for his support, but I take a very old-fashioned view of words that we use in your Lordships' House. The one thing that I do not believe my right honourable friend Mr Blair ever was is cowardly. Noble Lords may disagree fundamentally with what my right honourable friend did, but he did not succumb to cowardice. I hope that we will not return to use those words and a few others I noticed being used tonight in your Lordships' House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/11">If there is word across Whitehall on what to do, it has missed me on the way. I cannot add anything to that. Indeed, I have met Mr Stelzer, and I disagree with his analysis both of what is happening in Europe and of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister. I will not give him any further publicity, but I have invited him to lunch.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/12">I agree completely with the noble Lord, Lord McNally, in his admiration of the work of the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, and of the committee and sub-committees referred to by my noble friend Lord Lea. It is an extraordinary piece of work that is done constantly, and not only for your Lordships' House. I have heard the same thing as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, when going into Europe, about how much people look forward to the reports from the Select Committees. Noble Lords will know that I am very keen to enhance that and make sure that whatever happens in your Lordships' House we do not lose the work of the Select Committees, which is very important. I am extremely grateful that the noble Lord will play an invaluable role in the work that we do in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/13">The noble Lord, Lord Waddington, asked about the purpose of the debate. I offered the debate in the Statement that I gave; it was as simple as that. Noble Lords responded that they would like to have the debate, and so here we are. The noble Lord said that he would let off steam, and I believe he did so in his contribution. I hope that he now feels better, but no doubt he will wish to do again. I was interested in the noble Lord's reference to the proposition on the ballot paper in 1975. I am wondering how one would frame the proposition that noble Lords have discussed so widely in the context of a referendum. There were several propositions underlying what was discussed, from what you might describe as an in-out proposition to variations and gradations of what would be sought. I am glad that the noble Lord did not suggest leaving what he referred to as &quot;the club&quot;. We believe that we have an amending treaty. It is not the same as the constitution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/14">Several noble Lords referred to the role of national parliaments. I am very heartened that within the propositions before us there is an enhanced role for national parliaments. Whether noble Lords like yellow cards or orange cards, it is an important new role which I hope we will be able to debate at greater length when we discuss the legislation. My noble friend Lord Tomlinson noted the importance of this change. I agree with him. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, made the same point. I do not believe the interpretation put on this by the noble Lord, Lord Blackwell. We will debate it at greater length, but it is important that in all our deliberations, whether we accept this enhanced role at face value, we are careful to make sure that that our Parliament plays the role that we all would wish it to play, both in the ratification process and in the future, and is enabled by the proposal to be able to do more in the context of working within the European Union. Parliament should ensure that legislation is appropriate and that it tackles the largest question of all in the proposals, that of subsidiarity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/15">Noble Lords referred to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, particularly the noble Lords, Lord Howell, Lord Waddington and Lord Blackwell, who did so in a perhaps less positive way than my noble friends did in the context of a social Europe. We have to be clear that the charter creates no new enforceable rights. The European Court of Justice is an institution that we will debate at greater length during the passage of the legislation and the ratification process, thanks to the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, and other noble Lords. It is important to know that it will continue to take account of the charter. It is binding on EU institutions and on member states when they implement European Union law, but the charter protocol guarantees that the charter does not create any greater rights than already apply in EU law. That is the view of the Government, of the Commission and of the legal advice within Europe. So we are confident that we are where we should be in terms of that process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/16">The president of the European Council was discussed by a number of noble Lords, particularly by the noble Lords, Lord Howell and Lord Waddington. The president will be chosen under the proposal and be responsible to elected national Prime Ministers. Whoever this person is, the president will not be superior to national Prime Ministers. As noble Lords know, the European Council already has a president in the shape of the Minister at the head of the Government of the country that holds the rotating presidency. That applies to all Ministers who work within the EU. Thus, when we held the presidency, the Justice and Home Affairs Council was chaired by British Ministers. I had the privilege of doing so. A six-month rotating presidency is extremely difficult. Put simply, just when you think that you have got to grips with how to do it, the presidency moves on. Consideration of having someone who will perform the function for two and a half years, subject to the will of national Prime Ministers, is an important change. It will be more efficient and cheaper. That is an important aspect which has been raised a number of times by noble Lords, not least by the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, in considering money issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/17">The noble Lord, Lord Waddington, talked about the double-hatting of the president of the European Council and the president of the Commission. It is fair to say that under Article 213 of the treaty of the European Communities the president of the Commission is excluded from holding another post. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/18" class="indent">&quot;The members of the commission shall not, during their term of office, engage in any other occupation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/19">Open Europe was the first to raise this issue. The Commission has certainly not raised it with us.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/20">The noble Lord, Lord Williamson of Horton, on whose head many have heaped praise for his work, was the first noble Lord who referred to the other aspects of discussion in the European Council. I am grateful to him for that. I was grateful, too, for his welcome of the Government's work and the production of the pamphlet, <I>Global Europe</I>. I pay tribute to his knowledge and expertise. The noble Lord talked about the ratification of the treaty, a point picked up by the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, and others. The treaty will be laid before Parliament after signature on <phrase class="date" code="">13 December</phrase>. We will introduce a Bill to give effect to the treaty shortly after signature. I quote the Prime Minister from his Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-22">22 October</phrase>. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/21" class="indent">&quot;The Government will recommend that there is sufficient time for debate on the Floor of the House so that the Bill is examined in the fullest of detail and all points of view can be heard&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 22/10/07; col. 23.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/22">He said that, once the Bill is approved, the treaty will be ratified. I will discuss the process. The noble Lord, Lord McNally, knows that I dare not tread on to the Chief Whip's territory, but it is important that we have full debates, and that is certainly the Government's ambition in relation to this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/23">I agreed very much with the stance taken by the noble Lord, Lord Dykes, over sovereignty. He referred to the importance of understanding the profound sovereignty of nations and said that the enhanced role of Parliaments was an important aspect of that&mdash;a point that I have already mentioned. I agree very much with, and am grateful to him for, the analysis that he put forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/24">The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, with whom I agreed almost completely, gave the tour de force of the evening. He touched on a whole range of issues going back to 1950, when he first started to discuss these questions, through to the role of the European Union and, in particular, its relationship with other nations. The noble and learned Lord was the first in the debate to raise the question of our relationship with Russia. He also used the word &quot;partnership&quot; extensively. I very much echo his sentiments on that. My experience of working in Europe as a Minister was certainly that the partnership that one developed with other member states in thinking through difficult and important issues was critical. Thinking about how we operate in the world when working with our colleagues in the other 26 nations is very important. However, I say to the noble and learned Lord that he should not underestimate the beguiling nature of my right honourable friend the Prime Minister; I never do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/25">The noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, was concerned that more power should be given to Parliament and the people. He referred to the gracious Speech and questioned whether we had already begun to erode that power. The truth is that my right honourable friend has already done a huge amount to reach out beyond our party to discuss with other parties and none all kinds of issues concerning our constitution and the work that is going on, whether in counterterrorism or party funding. I hope that the noble Lord will urge his friends, both here and in another place, to work closely with us in areas where we need to build as great a consensus as possible. I loved the idea that it is pantomime season. I cannot tell noble Lords how much fun I had sitting here working out who would be wearing which costumes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1796.0/26">True to form, the noble Lord, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, put forward his proposition in a very straightforward manner. I do not agree with him any more than I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart; none the less, the noble Lord knows I have huge respect for him. He was particularly concerned about fishing quotas and whether that issue would be raised by my honourable friend Jonathan Shaw, the Minister responsible. Noble Lords may recall my honourable friend appearing on the &quot;Today&quot; programme recently, when he spoke of his concern about what is brought in in the catch and the ensuing waste. The issue of total allowable catches&mdash;the quota, as I believe it is called&mdash;will be discussed at the Council. We will be pressing for the best possible deal for a sustainable fishing industry in the UK and will be looking at the scientific evidence, so I think that the noble Lord can be reassured that the matter will be raised. If he shakes his head because he is not reassured, perhaps I may reassure him further by saying that I shall endeavour to find out what happens and shall ensure that he is informed.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-05a.1801.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="1801"  time="021:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71205-0015.htm#0712066000023">
	<p pid="a.1801.1/1">My Lords, I have tried to answer the noble Lord as best as I can. It is better that I leave it for my honourable friend to discuss that directly with the noble Lord, as he is involved in the matter directly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/2">The question of whether individual nations choose to continue with symbols is for those nations: it is called sovereignty. If a country, as a member of the European Union, wishes to run up the flag of the European Union, so be it. If it wishes to change its anthem, so be it. That is entirely up to individual nations and is nothing to do with this treaty; it is to do with national sovereignty.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/3">I had a sense of the line from the Monty Python film, &quot;What have the Romans ever done for us?&quot;, and was tempted to leap in from time to time with a list. The noble Lord referred to one light. I think that there are a number of lights in our relationships across the globe, and I believe that our relationship with the European Union is very important.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/4">I am not quite old enough to remember &quot;The Glums&quot;, although I often hear my older brother talk about it. I am looking at the noble Lord, Lord Pearson, but I am thinking of my noble friend Lord Harrison, who is sitting behind me. I did not want to turn round because I would have moved away from the microphone, but I am very grateful for his congratulations on the red lines. Noble Lords will know what the red lines are. I do not intend at this late hour to go through them again, but they are very important and we must discuss them in detail when we look at the ratification process. The red line on justice and home affairs is particularly important. I myself was responsible for not opting in to three measures within civil and family justice. It is very important to look at the question of what happens after five years. The opt-in and opt-out process is going to be extremely valuable to the UK, but within the context of co-operation in justice and home affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/5">People have already spoken about the European arrest warrant. There are many examples, such as Schengen-building measures on data sharing and so on, that are critical to our ability to solve serious and organised crime, such as people trafficking, and to tackle issues as important as terrorism. Noble Lords should not underestimate our wish to make sure that we are able to do this.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/6">The noble Lord, Lord Leach, raised three questions, and I shall be very brief. The first was whether this is different from the constitutional treaty. The answer is yes. He asked whether it will bring us closer to the people. Of itself, it is a tiny part of that. I have always believed that it is the practical things that we provide for our citizens that make us better understand the European Union and wish to recognise it. When people can buy goods abroad and find that if the goods do not work they are able to get their money back more quickly; when they are able to study at universities in Germany, France or Portugal or wherever they wish to; when they find that they can go and live easily, buy property and enjoy life in whatever country they wish to; it is then that being part of the Union becomes a practical reality&mdash;as well as when they see all the travelling that we will all be able to do now that Eurostar is even faster and comes even closer to where I live.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/7">Is it about being prosperous? As I said before, 57 per cent of British trade is within the European Union. Our exports have gone up by 25 per cent since 2005-06. That is a growing trend. I believe that the Union makes us more prosperous and that it enriches us culturally and in every other way as well.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/8">The noble Lord, Lord Watson of Richmond, talked about testing out propositions. I found some of the propositions mentioned today very testing. As the noble Lord said, it is about managing affairs more effectively. Keeping the project going forward is an important part of this; it is not about standing still. The European Union is a project that should move forward within the context of ensuring that we move to institutional change only when we need to. I have already indicated the importance of doing that after the move from 15 to 27 member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/9">The noble Lord, Lord Watson of Richmond, and the most reverend Primate talked about what is at stake. That is a very important debate that needs to underpin our debates on the ratification process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/10">The noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, talked about the passerelle. Perhaps I may quote the Prime Minister on the passerelle, because not only my noble friend but the noble Lords, Lord Grenfell and Lord Howell, also referred to them. The Prime Minister has made this commitment:</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/11" class="indent">&quot;To ensure that no Government can agree without Parliament's approval to any change in European rules that could, in any way, alter the constitutional balance of power between Britain and the European Union, we will make a provision in the Bill that any proposal to activate the mechanisms in the treaty that provide for further moves to QMV, but which require unanimity ... will have to be subject to a prior vote by this House&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 22/10/07; col. 22.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/12">I can confirm to the noble Lord, Lord Grenfell, that the Government's intention is that both Houses of Parliament will have a prior vote on any such passerelle.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/13">My noble friends Lord Watson of Invergowrie and Lord Wedderburn were concerned about the issues of what I have described as social Europe. My noble friend Lord Lea also raised his concerns to make sure that we do a number of things&mdash;first, that we promote more effectively what has happened as a consequence of being part of social Europe. I take that point extremely well and will ensure that I am confident in future speeches in outlining the benefits of being part of the European Union in that context.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/14">A very important part and dimension of the European Union is that we tackle exclusion and increase opportunity. That means, as my noble friends would expect me to say, investing in skills and human capital. I have not had to read out from the results of today's discussions, and my noble friend Lord Lea may know more than I do on the working time directive and agency workers. Our position on those dossiers has not changed. We support the principle of the agency workers directive. We want a text that strikes a balance between protecting workers and not putting their jobs at risk. On working time, we want a solution to the problems caused to the National Health Service, as noble Lords would expect, and the retention of a workable, individual opt-out on working hours. We will strive to make sure that we can achieve that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/15">I do not agree with my noble friend Lord Watson that UK workers will have second-class rights compared with other member states because of the UK charter opt-out. The charter, as I have already indicated, does not create any new rights, so there is no question of us putting our citizens in that position.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/16">I understand the strength of feeling of the noble Lord, Lord Willoughby de Broke, and his party affiliations. He and I live in different worlds as to our views on Europe. It is important that we reconnect with people, an important aspect of what the noble Lord said. To move away from Europe in the manner suggested would leave us exposed and isolated in a way that would not be good for us economically, socially, environmentally or in any other way. Too many of the problems we face in this country require solutions way beyond our borders. Collaboration is an important part of what we do. As the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, mentioned in the context of the Commonwealth, it is not either/or, it is both/and. Our relations with NATO, the US, Europe, the Commonwealth and a whole range of countries enhance our opportunities to both trade and be secure in our borders, and ensure that we have opportunities for our citizens. It is both/and, not either/or; it is as simple as that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/17">I have already indicated to my noble friend Lord Wedderburn the important issues that he mentioned about social Europe. I apologise that the notes that he received were not good enough; I shall endeavour to ensure that they are better than they were. As ever, he spoke with great passion, and great experience from a long and distinguished academic career.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/18">I view the contribution of the noble Lord, Lord Sheikh as a &quot;What happens if&quot;. The noble Lord mentioned the Danish Justice Ministry, and the work in Denmark. The Danish Justice Ministry published its analysis of the reform treaty on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-04">4 December</phrase>. The noble Lord will know that the Danish constitution says that if you transfer powers to an international organisation by treaty, you must have a referendum or a five-six majority in parliament. The report says that it is the Justice Minister's conclusion that, for Denmark, the Lisbon treaty does not transfer new powers to the Union; on this basis, the Justice Ministry concludes that Denmark can ratify the treaty by the normal means that would be expected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/19">I am nearly at an end. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, accused me of making a eulogy; I took that as a huge compliment, as he would expect. I have already indicated the issues of the Commonwealth versus the European Union. I understand that the noble Lord has heard all about moving to the point where we have the institutions settled for some considerable time. Well, I hope that time will prove us right and, perhaps, the noble Lord wrong for once. Trying to get this to the point where settling how we have an efficient, effective and best value European Union in terms of how we work together&mdash;the bureaucracy and so on&mdash;is important and not to be underestimated. As my right honourable friend the Prime Minister has made abundantly clear, he wishes now to move into areas where practical action to solve some of the huge problems we face across Europe and beyond forms the basis of our role and work within the EU. I am sure that my right honourable friend will ensure that that happens. I could spend a long time picking up various points of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart. I will not. I am sure that we will have plenty of opportunity to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/20">My noble friend Lord Lea paid tribute to the Select Committee and the sub-committees I have already referred to. I hope that I have answered or made reference to at least some of the points about the social agenda, about which I know my noble friend feels strongly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/21">The noble Lord, Lord Blackwell, talked about incremental change. He was also very kind about the fact that I have sat here for five and a half hours. I would not have missed it for the world; it is important. The noble Lord was particularly concerned about European Union citizenship and that it might undermine national legitimacy, an issue which I do not think anybody else raised. It has existed, of course, since Maastricht. It is limited and covers only the rights which people hold by virtue of their national citizenship&mdash;the treaty is explicit on that point. The rights therein are common sense, and I hope that we will be able to look at that as part of the scrutiny of the legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1801.1/22">I end with the noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, when he said that in 1950 he wrote about active British leadership. I feel that I have been chastened by some of the comments, but hope that, tonight at least, we have had some active British Government leadership on supporting our role in the European Union.</p>
