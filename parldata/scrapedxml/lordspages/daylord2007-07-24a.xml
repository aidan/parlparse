<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-07-24a.704.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="704"  time="015:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70724-0004.htm#07072490000148">
	<p pid="a.704.1/1">My Lords, I beg to move Motion C, that this House do not insist on its Amendments Nos.15 to 21, 23 and 24, to which the Commons have disagreed for their reasons Nos. 15A to 21A, 23A and 24A.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/2">A great deal has happened since this House amended the Pensions Bill to reflect concerns about the generosity and efficiency of the financial assistance scheme. We have a new Prime Minister, a new Secretary of State for Work and Pensions and a new Minister of State for Pensions Reform. We still have the same old Lords' Minister, who has not yet been churned out of office. And we have the interim findings of the Young review into assets remaining in failed pension schemes.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/3">As a consequence of those findings, the Minister of State for Pensions Reform announced on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-17">17 July</phrase> that the Government will match the extra value available from scheme funds that the review identifies. Our goal is to move towards 90 per cent of expected core pension for all qualifying members. This is a potential commitment of some &pound;225 million in addition to the &pound;1.9 billion already promised, in net present value terms, to FAS.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/4">The work done by the Young review so far is impressive, especially as it was completed by the review team in such a short time. The interim findings demonstrate that a better outcome is possible for scheme members. By approaching the winding-up process differently, we can make more effective use of the monies remaining in schemes. I hope that noble Lords will join me in welcoming the findings and the Government's subsequent commitment. That commitment to move towards 90 per cent is in addition to the extension to FAS already announced, thus making all members of schemes eligible regardless of how far from retirement age they are, raising the cap, scrapping the de minimis, helping schemes where there has been a compromise agreement, and raising the level at which we pay initial payments from the time the Bill receives Royal Assent.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/5">I was also pleased, though not surprised, that the review's interim findings have confirmed what the Government have been telling the Opposition for some time&mdash;that other non-tax sources are unlikely to play a significant role in any solution.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/6">I can also announce today that we have decided to accept the review's recommendation that we should not enforce a cut-off date for employer insolvency.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/7">On the <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-27">27 February 2007</phrase>, the Minister of State for Pensions Reform announced that he would extend to <phrase class="date" code="">31 August 2007</phrase> the date by which an employer of a scheme in wind-up had to experience an insolvency event for that scheme to qualify for FAS. I can confirm today that we will not now enforce that date. We will consult on whether there should be a cut-off date and bring forward regulations in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/8">The other place has asked us to reconsider the bulk of the amendments made to the Bill on the financial assistance scheme on the grounds of financial privilege. The noble Lord, Lord Turnbull, warned us in Committee that the proposals to fund higher levels of assistance by using unclaimed assets were straying into dangerous territory. He has been proved right.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/9">Notwithstanding the fact that the Young review has determined that the non-tax sources of funding that it looked at are not suitable, the proposals to guarantee the lifeboat fund and on-account payments by trustees rely on taxpayers' money being made available to plug the gaps that would inevitably occur in such uncosted and untested bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/10">Amendments Nos. 16 and 24, bringing in schemes with solvent employers and paying PPF levels of benefit, represent obvious calls on the public purse, perhaps running into hundreds of millions of pounds. It would be fiscally irresponsible to insist on them.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/11">The other place disagrees with Lords Amendment No. 15 on the grounds that it is inappropriate to replace as FAS scheme manager the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions with the board of the PPF. That would be inappropriate at this time, and without substantial preparatory work.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/12">Last year's review of FAS administration, which enjoyed input from the PPF, was well received. It concluded that, although lessons could be learned from the PPF's approach to proactive data gathering, there would be significant constraints on its ability to manage FAS operations. The issues involved in FAS are complex and outside the experience of the PPF. The Government would not want PPF operations to be hampered by having to come to terms with an unfamiliar system, with its own unique difficulties and challenges, especially in PPF's early years of operation.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/13">I acknowledge the criticisms that have been made of FAS, but I emphasise once again the professionalism and commitment of the staff, who are working with schemes that may have inadequate records and where members may have long since abandoned hope of seeing anything of their pension. To quote Andrew Gaspar of Pitmans Trustees:</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/14" class="indent">&quot;The FAS is doing its best in fairly trying circumstances. People there are trying to get the job done while the press is continually on their back. I am not sure they are at fault&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/15">He is the independent trustee of a scheme where we have received data for all 52 members and assessed them for annual payments from the FAS.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/16">I do not rule out wanting to look again at the issue, especially if the Young review identifies different approaches to funding, but I do not think that it is sensible to pre-empt those findings or to cause disruption and distraction to FAS operations at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/17">The Government have given a commitment to raise the levels of assistance towards 90 per cent if, as we believe will be the case, the Young review is able to get better value from funds remaining in schemes. The Young review is also gathering information on schemes with solvent employers to allow us to make a considered decision on to how they should be treated. We must wait for the review's final report, which we have asked to be brought forward to November, before committing to any additional spending.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/18">Let us not lose sight of the fact that we will, from Royal Assent, be able to pay more money to more people immediately as a result of raising initial payments. I urge Your Lordships not to stand in the way of getting that help to people now.</p>
	<p pid="a.704.1/19">Moved, That this House do not insist on its Amendments Nos. 15 to 21, 23 and 24, to which the Commons have disagreed for their reasons Nos. 15A to 21A, 23A and 24A.&mdash;(<I>Lord M</I><I>cKenzie of Luton</I>.)</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-07-24a.717.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100222" speakername="Lord Fowler" colon=":" colnum="717"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70724-0005.htm#07072490000222">
	<p pid="a.717.0/1">My Lords, I beg to move, as an amendment to Motion E, Motion E1, leave out from &quot;House&quot; to end and insert &quot;do insist on its Amendment No. 28.&mdash;(<I>Lord Fowler</I>.)</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/2">I welcome the tone of some of the Minister's remarks this evening, which are substantially different from what we have heard at previous stages of the Bill, particularly what he said about the principle of post-legislative scrutiny and seeking to put a duty in the Bill. Step by step we are getting to the position that we would like to get to but we have not yet arrived there.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/3">I am not very impressed with the so-called compromise being offered by the Government on when their form of post-legislative scrutiny should take place. Many advocate scrutiny after three years. I have proposed four years, but with the addition that the Secretary of State can carry out a further scrutiny at any stage later on, which I think meets many of the points that the Minister put. The Government propose their form of post-legislative scrutiny not in 2012 or 2015 but 10 years hence by the end of 2017. Frankly, it puts a whole new time-scale on the plea, &quot;Make me good but not yet&quot;. Even then it sounds as though it will be only half good because I suspect that the review being offered is the Secretary of State's own review and not that of a Select Committee. However, I may be wrong on that. I am afraid that, as regards the timing, the offer is impossible to accept. I suspect that that does not come as a vast surprise to him, the Government or to the department.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/4">I also do not accept the argument that we are now running out of time. The forthcoming business of the House of Lords is not a state secret; it is set out in the programme of <I>Forthcoming Business</I>, and for <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-25">Wednesday 25 July</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">Thursday 26 July</phrase> it is set down that consideration of Commons Amendments may be scheduled. I stand ready to respond to whatever new proposals the Government wish to make.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/5">I will be brief, as I have rehearsed my argument at earlier stages of the Bill. In essence, it is that some of the worst mistakes take place not because legislation is badly drafted, but because it is wrongly implemented. In other words, pre-legislative scrutiny may be important, but checking the legislation after it is passed to see that it is being implemented properly is also essential. We are not concerned with repeating the arguments used during the passage of the Bill, but in checking the outcome. That process of checking what happens after the Bill becomes an Act is supported, among others, by the Hansard Society, the Law Commission and by the House of Lords Constitution Committee. It has also been strongly endorsed by a number of influential individuals. One said:</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/6" class="indent">&quot;Parliament and government have a common interest in strengthening post-legislative scrutiny. From the Government's point of view, it could help to ensure that the Government's aims are delivered in practice and that the considerable resources devoted to legislation are committed to good effect&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 6/6/05; col. 769.]</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/7">That was the noble Baroness, Lady Amos, when she was Leader of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/8">Another former Minister said that she advocated post-legislative review,</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/9" class="indent">&quot;in order to illuminate and see what lessons can be learnt for the future handling of the legislative process&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/10">That was Margaret Beckett, former Foreign Secretary and at one stage deputy leader of the party opposite. Perhaps the most interesting intervention was by a current member of the Cabinet, who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/11" class="indent">&quot;In principle I think this is a very fruitful avenue for us to explore together because there is no point in passing legislation if it is not having the desired impact or it is having a different impact&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/12">That was Peter Hain, the Secretary of State in charge of this legislation, who is now resisting the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/13">The trouble is that, when it comes to it, Ministers are in favour of post-legislative scrutiny in principle but not when it comes to their own Bills. It reminds me of the position with departmental Select Committees when they were set up by my noble friend some years ago. All Ministers thought that in general it was a good idea, as long as it did not apply to their department. In post-legislative scrutiny, they do not want to run the risk that it may be pointed out that their plans are not working out. I suggest that that is wrong and that the earlier the intervention the better, from the point of view of the public and the taxpayer.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/14">Pensions are a prime example. At an earlier stage, as the Minister said, I gave an example of legislation of my own, the Social Security Act 1986, which reduced and changed the amount of SERPS that widows or widowers could inherit. My then Minister of State, John Major, promised a major publicity campaign. We both left the department in 1987, there was no publicity campaign, and the department published the wrong advice in a leaflet. A Select Committee carrying out post-legislative scrutiny would have picked that up, and it may well have picked up the fact that the department was giving the wrong advice about the security of final salary occupational pension schemes, about which we were talking earlier, which led to the adverse finding against the Government in March 2006 by the Parliamentary Ombudsman. As the noble Baroness, Lady Hollis, fairly pointed out in our debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-11">11 July</phrase>, post-legislative scrutiny could have helped in avoiding the failure of stakeholder pensions and one of the unforeseen consequences of pension credit; bringing more and more people into means testing.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/15">Potentially, the amendment could prevent error and avoid costly mistakes. What is the Government's case? Up to now, it has been that the amendment is unnecessary. I am glad to say that they are now moving from their position that they do not need any advice. Now their position is that four years for post-legislative scrutiny is too early; for example, they say that the earnings uprating of pensions will come into effect only in 2012. However, the Bill is about much more than that. It is 65 pages long, with 70 pages of Explanatory Notes. To give but one example, the workings of the Personal Accounts Delivery Authority may be important for the success of widening pension ownership. Even the statement about the earnings uprating coming into effect in 2012 is not quite true; as the Minister said, the Government's White Paper states:</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/16" class="indent">&quot;Our objective, subject to affordability and the fiscal position, is to do this in 2012, but in any event by the end of the Parliament at the latest. We will make a statement on the precise date at the beginning of the next Parliament&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/17">Therefore, it could come in in 2015, and post-legislative scrutiny might want to point out the cost of that delay in extra pension credit. More generally, it might want to take into account any events of importance affecting pensions over the previous four years, which is the average length of a whole Parliament, after all.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/18">The Government's case ignores the point that my amendment explicitly gives the power to the Secretary of State to have further scrutiny. We should remember that a second Pensions Bill is behind this one; I doubt very much that all the unseen problems will be dealt with in one round of scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/19">In a sense, my next point is even more crucial than all my others. Some in the House may have their reservations about my amendment; the Minister clearly does. I hope that not all noble Lords share them; certainly, that was not the case in earlier debates. The amendment was originally carried by 141 votes to 138. It then went to the House of Commons. Any of your Lordships who wanted to check the argument used there for rejecting the amendment would be sadly disappointed. It was never debated. Ministers were never questioned. The guillotine came down before any Member of the House of Commons had the opportunity to say a single word. That is utterly destructive of the parliamentary process. The Minister says that the other place has decided, but it has decided without debate, questioning or words being uttered.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/20">The new Prime Minister talks of restoring the authority of Parliament. I agree. The kind of parliamentary scrutiny by a Select Committee or some other parliamentary committee implicit in my amendment would certainly help that process. Equally, I am sure that guillotining Bills so that the Commons simply does not have the opportunity of even debating the amendments of this House is against the interests of anyone who believes in the effective working of Parliament. For both those reasons, I ask the House to support my amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.717.0/21">Moved, as an amendment to Motion E, Motion E1, leave out from &quot;House&quot; to end and insert &quot;do insist on its Amendment No. 28&quot;.&mdash;(<I>Lord Fowler.</I>)</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-07-24a.770.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="770"  time="019:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70724-0013.htm#07072498000179">
	<p pid="a.770.1/1">My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Transport. The Statement is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.770.1/2">&quot;With permission, Mr Speaker, I should like to inform the House about a Statement that the Government have made today on how they intend to strengthen the country's railways over the next seven years and beyond. It is the most ambitious strategy for growth on the railways in more than 50 years. The Statement is made against a background not of decline or crisis, as in the past, but of remarkable success for our railway network. &quot;Of course, anyone who travels regularly by rail, as many of us in this House do, knows that big challenges remain before our country has the rail system that it needs. There is no room for complacency. But the measures that the Government have put in place since the Hatfield tragedy mean that our railways are safer than ever before. Reliability, which declined sharply after Hatfield, is improving strongly across most lines, and passenger satisfaction has improved. There has been sustained investment in the network itself; for instance, in the modernisation of the west coast main line and in new rolling stock. The result is that more freight and more people are travelling by rail than at any time in the past 50 years. &quot;So our challenge today is not about managing decline but about how we can build on this solid progress to provide a railway that carries more passengers on more and better trains on frequent, reliable, safe and affordable services. This needs government, working with the industry, the regulator and passenger groups, to take action in three main areas: first, to secure continued improvements in safety and reliability; secondly, to achieve a major increase in capacity to meet rising demand; and, thirdly, to deliver sustained investment through a fair deal for passengers and taxpayers.&quot;Let me take each in turn. On safety and reliability, safety has improved, and reliability is back to the levels seen before Hatfield, even though we are running many more trains. Those who work on our railways deserve credit for their focus. The White Paper sets out how the Government intend to continue reducing the risks to passengers and staff on our railways. We also intend to build on the improvements in reliability, which now see 88 per cent of services running on time. By 2014, the Government want this figure to reach 92.6 per cent, through investment in new rolling stock, maintenance and equipment, which would make our railway one of the most reliable in Europe. And, for the first time, the Government will require the industry to concentrate on cutting, by one quarter, delays of more than 30 minutes&mdash;those that cause the most inconvenience to passengers. But as safety and reliability have improved, passenger numbers have increased. Overcrowding has become a real issue for many commuters. The White Paper contains the biggest single commitment for a generation to increasing the capacity of the railway through more services and longer trains. By 2014, the Government will have invested &pound;10 billion to make this happen.&quot;Starting now, and over the next seven years, there will be 1,300 new carriages to ease overcrowding in London and other cities such as Birmingham, Cardiff, Leeds and Manchester; &pound;600 million of investment to tackle bottlenecks at Birmingham New Street and Reading stations; the &pound;5.5 billion transformation of Thameslink, which provides a vital north-south artery into and across London; and new plans put in place for the development of each of our main lines, including the next generation of InterCity trains and signalling. This Government are also committed to ensuring that we close no rural lines in this period. &quot;This continued investment will provide nearly 100,000 new seats for passengers on InterCity and commuter trains to our major cities. The Government's proposals will accommodate a further seven years of record passenger growth and, at the same time, will start to tackle some of the worst overcrowding on some of our busiest services. There will be some 14,500 more seats in the peak hour on Thameslink alone, and although Crossrail remains subject to financial and parliamentary approval, it has the potential to deliver a similar scale of improvement for east-west services in the capital.&quot;The White Paper also outlines other improvements that groups such as Passenger Focus say passengers want to see: a radical simplification of the fares structure, and the modernisation of tickets to allow people to use smartcards; a further &pound;150 million in 150 stations in the towns and cities outside London, which form the backbone of the national network; better and safer stations from Wolverhampton to Dartmouth, Cleethorpes to Swansea, and Barking to Chester; and support for Transport 2000's idea of local station plans so that people can have better access to the railway and make it part of a greener travel choice. The Government are also investing &pound;200 million in a strategic freight network that will both help to reduce congestion on our roads and the environmental impact of moving goods.&quot;Underpinning all this needs to be sustained investment. Having fought its way back to a stable financial footing, following the demise of Railtrack, it is essential that the industry maintains financial discipline. Both passengers and taxpayers have suffered the consequences of past financial crises. The Government will not allow a return to those days. &quot;The challenge is to deliver the sustained investment the rail system needs while continuing to protect passengers, but we must also strike a fair balance between the call on taxpayers and fare payers. Because the Government are determined to continue to protect passengers, any increases in regulated tickets will remain capped at RPI plus 1 per cent. These account for more than half the use of the railway and include season tickets and saver fares. &quot;There has been some recent debate about unregulated fares, for unregulated fares operators can vary prices to respond to customer demand. So, some unregulated ticket prices have increased. This is something the Government will monitor closely and is why today they are committing to give Passenger Focus more say in the specification of future franchises before they are tendered. At the same time, many other tickets have been discounted. In fact, around 80 per cent of passengers do not use the headline-catching first and peak tickets, but buy either a regulated ticket or a discounted product. A significant number of these fares have fallen in real terms over the past 10 years with many deals cheaper in cash terms than they were under British Rail. &quot;The result is that many more people are now choosing to travel by rail&mdash;some 340 million more passengers each year than in 1997. This strong growth also means the railways need less taxpayer subsidy. In the difficult years of Railtrack, it was the taxpayer who footed the bill. The proportion of subsidy funding nearly doubled in five years. It is right that the Government now seek to return it closer to historic levels. This Government are meeting their goals; that is, protecting passengers and achieving a fair balance between the taxpayer and the travelling public, while delivering the necessary investment that we all agree is needed. &quot;Today's White Paper has set out the Government's ambition for a railway capable of carrying double the number of passengers and twice the amount of freight by 2030 with modern trains and a network whose reliability and safety counts among the best in Europe. This is not a White Paper that rests on distant promises of all or nothing projects. Schemes such as new north-south lines may have their place and we will consider them if and as the need arises. This is a strategy that seeks to deliver real improvements which reflect passengers' priorities and builds on the real achievements and successes of our rail system over the past decade.&quot;Twenty-five years ago, the railways were advertising, &quot;This is the age of the train&quot;, but it was against a background of falling demand and chronic under-investment in trains and infrastructure. Perhaps that claim was premature. By building on the progress of the past 10 years with sustained investment and increased capacity, and by harnessing the full environmental gains of rail transport, we will be entering a new and exciting era of rail travel. The White Paper is a resounding vote of confidence in Britain's railways and I commend it to the House&quot;.</p>
