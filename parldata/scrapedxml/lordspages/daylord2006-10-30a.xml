	<p pid="a.5.3/1">My Lords, I would probably have difficulty explaining to anybody that &pound;200 million is petty cash, but it is petty cash in terms of our overall budget of &pound;3.7 billion. It is a small part of the money. We have a satisfactory arrangement for readjusting Natural England's budget, and we do not envisage any of its major schemes being affected. Some will probably start a little later than others&mdash;it had a spending moratorium in the period before it was launched.

	<p pid="a.13.6/1">My Lords, I shall also speak to Amendment No. 2 in the same group. Both amendments are also tabled in the names of my noble friend Lady Sharp and the noble Lord, Lord Judd.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.6/2">My colleagues and I have brought back these amendments because, despite helpful meetings with the Bill team, we have not been satisfied that there is any good reason why the local authority's duty to secure the child's right to an education should not be put in the Bill. The Joint Committee on Human Rights, in its report on the Bill, made clear its wish that the child's right as enshrined in the UN convention be placed in the Bill. The question is how to do it.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.6/3">The Government's lawyers say that the right is enshrined elsewhere in law, under four pillars, and that if we restate it in the Bill the whole edifice will come tumbling down. However, a different view was taken in Scotland and the world has not come to an end. In the Standards in Scotland's Schools etc. Act 2000, the Scottish Parliament provided in Section 1, entitled &quot;Right of child to school education&quot;:</p>
	<p pid="a.13.6/4" class="indent">&quot;It shall be the right of every child of school age to be provided with school education by, or by virtue of arrangements made, or entered into, by, an education authority&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.6/5">Section 2, entitled &quot;Duty of education authorityin providing school education&quot;, provides in subsection (1):</p>
	<p pid="a.13.6/6" class="indent">&quot;Where school education is provided to a child or young person by, or by virtue of arrangements made, or entered into, by, an education authority it shall be the duty of the authority to secure that the education is directed to the development of the personality, talents and mental and physical abilities of the child or young person to their fullest potential&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.6/7">I will not tire noble Lords by reading the rest of that section; it is pretty clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.6/8">I accept that this is a declaratory statement but it is none the worse for that, and I do not believe thatany civil servants have lost their job because of its inclusion in that legislation. Indeed, in Amendments Nos. 7, 8 and 9, which are very welcome, the Government are doing the same thing. For two years they have been assuring us that schools already have a duty to promote the well-being of pupils but now they see fit to make it clear in legislation. That is what we are trying to do today with the right to education.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.6/9">It might be worth asking why the Joint Committee on Human Rights felt it necessary to include such a provision in the Bill. Children's right to education is under threat across the world. Political situations, refugee situations and poverty mean that many millions of children do not receive an education. Some teachers even lose their lives for providing education. I was moved and horrified to read that on <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-25">25 September</phrase> Safia Ama Jan was gunned down in Afghanistan by the Taliban simply for teaching girls and giving them their right to education. Teachers in Ethiopia are also being put under a great deal of pressure for providing education. When children's right to an education is being threatened across the world, it is time for us in this country, where most children are lucky enough to be provided with a good education, to stand up and say so proudly in our legislation, clarifying that we support children's right to a suitable education appropriate to their needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.6/10">Our amendment is not a blank cheque. We are asking for no more than the right of the child as enshrined in the UN convention, not any particular kind of education in a particular school. Lines 7 and 8 of Clause 1 refer to the education functions,</p>
	<p pid="a.13.6/11" class="indent">&quot;to which this section applies...(so far as they are capable of being so exercised)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.6/12">To fulfil our requested duty, a local authority must show only that it has done its very best to provide an appropriate education for each child. Obviously, we hope that the education they provide will be appropriate for every child and properly resourced.</p>
	<p pid="a.13.6/13">We are not asking for a lot. We are not asking for anything that the Government say is not a child's right. We are asking that we stand up and be counted on this, and make it quite clear. The ordinary man in the street does not have the opportunity to go to a legal library to consult half a dozen Acts of Parliament and a good deal of case law in order to find out what the law is. We have here an opportunity to make it absolutely clear that it is the duty of the local authority to ensure that parents are carrying out their responsibility to give their child an education, whether that education is provided by the authority itself, bought in from another authority, provided at home, at an independent school, or in another appropriate way. That is all we are asking for: it is little enough. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.16.0/1">My Lords, the House is grateful to the noble Baroness for giving us the opportunity to discuss this issue yet again, but I fear that the Government's position remains as it was on the two previous occasions we considered it. While we wholeheartedly agree with the sentiment and intent behind the amendment, as supported by my noble friend, we do not believe it would be appropriate to make this change to primary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/2">After long and careful consideration, we still believe that the current legal provisions, supported by jurisprudence, are the most effective way of securing the right to education, and we do not support these further changes. In particular, I note that Amendments Nos. 1 and 2 relate only to duties on local authorities. This could cut across the existing fourfold foundation of the right to education which, as I expounded at length at cols. 657 and 658 on<phrase class="date" code="2006-10-17">17 October</phrase>, also places duties on parents, the Secretary of State and governing bodies. I hesitate to read it out again, but on that occasion I also cited at length the judgment of the noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, in the case of Ali v Lord Grey School, a judgment issued only this year. It strongly supports the fourfold foundation which, the noble and learned Lord said,</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/3" class="indent">&quot;has endured over a long period because it has, I think, certain inherent strengths&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/10/06; col. 657.]</p>
	<p pid="a.16.0/4">We believe that seeking to elevate one of those elements risks weakening the others. Furthermore, an effect of placing a duty on local authorities to secure the right of every child to suitable education in the way proposed here could, we are advised, be used as a legal argument to cut across parental choice and the right of children to be educated either at home or at an independent school. As regards Scotland, raised by both my noble friend and the noble Baroness, it is right that there is such a provision in the law of Scotland, but it has not yet once been deployed in a legal case, so we are not in a position to judge what its effect might be on those who wished to avail themselves of an education that was not of a kind approved in other respects by the public authorities. For these reasons, I regret to say that we oppose these amendments.</p>

	<p pid="a.53.0/1">My Lords, my name also appears on the amendment and is attached to a letter that the noble Baroness, Lady Turner, addressed to the Minister and the Secretary of State, dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-20">20 October</phrase>, asking for replies to be given to us before Third Reading. As we have not yet had that reply&mdash;I am very sorry that the Minister has not been able to address his mind to the important questions put to him by noble Lords then&mdash;I shall repeat some of the questions that were asked.</p>
	<p pid="a.53.0/2">First, I must point out that, although the clause may not be contrary to the letter of the employment directive, it is certainly contrary to its spirit. For that reason, it is highly objectionable. From speeches already made from every Bench of this House, your Lordships will understand that it is a matter of tremendous concern that the Government should have introduced proposals such as this, which run contrary to what we have all agreed are ways to remove discrimination throughout Europe&mdash;in this country, in particular.</p>

	<p pid="a.57.1/1">My Lords, I appreciate the strength of feeling of my noble friends against faith schools generally. That is a perfectly proper view for them to hold and I respect it. With respect, however, I point out that they have hugely exaggerated the impact of these amendments. I hope I may explain how, but itis simply not correct that there has not been consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/2">Voluntary-controlled schools are religious schools. They are schools which are maintained almost entirely by the Church of England because of their faith character. The issue at stake is a legal uncertainty about whether the head teacher of schools that are already Church of England religious schools can or cannot be appointed with reference to a faith requirement. As the right reverend Prelate said, it appears that it is possible to do that at the moment but it is not absolutely clear. This amendment clarifies the fact that a Church of England voluntary-controlled school is actually able to appoint its head teacher to maintain the ethos of the school.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/3">However, even under this amendment, and this is at the discretion of the governing body&mdash;of course the governing body will make a decision about whether this is going to lead to a dearth of candidates&mdash;it is highly unlikely that a governing body is going to pass over an outstanding candidate because of the faith requirement if they believe that the need could be met in a different way. The amendment allows only heads to be reserved teachers, even in voluntary-controlled schools, where they also teach religious education, which particularly meets the point of the noble Baroness, Lady Flather, who said she could accept that there would be a case for it where these teachers in question teach religious education, but not beyond.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/4">It is specifically because of that factor that we allow these reserved posts to come about. The case which has been made to us particularly applies to primary schools because a large proportion of voluntary-controlled schools are primary schools. Not having this flexibility at the moment is making it difficult for small primary schools, which is a large proportion of voluntary-controlled schools, to adequately arrange their teaching staff to ensure that they have sufficient teachers who can maintain the ethos of the school and teach religious education in those schools.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/5">To reiterate the point of the right reverend Prelate: if a school chooses to appoint the head teacher as a reserved teacher, this appointment will count towards the one-fifth of the teaching staff who are already permitted to be appointed as reserved teachers under the 1998 Act. I know the noble Baroness does not approve the 20 per cent requirement at the moment but this does not expand that requirement at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/6">I believe that this is a modest amendment which clarifies the existing law in respect of faith schools. There is no great plot here to introduce faith requirements for the head teachers of other schools. I would also like to stress that our proposal will include transitional provisions in the commencement order for Clause 37 to provide that the change to Section 66 will not take effect for any non-teaching staff in post at the date of commencement. The unamended Section 66 will continue to apply to such staff, and also to head teachers who are in post at the moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/7">The other amendments that I have tabled refer to staff other than teachers to whom it is now permissible to apply a faith test. The case for those amendments is very simple. Since the 1998 Act, particularly in the past two or three years, there has been substantial reform of the workforce in schools to provide for many more support staff and to encourage schools to diversify their workforce so that a wider range of staff can carry out the wider range of activities that we want to see. That includes, not least, the <I>Every Child Matters </I>type of agenda, which will require pastoral staff and all kinds of other support staff. We also need staff to carry out the clerical and administrative jobs that have hamstrung teachers for too long.</p>
	<p pid="a.57.1/8">As those reforms have taken place, we have been concerned to ensure that voluntary-aided schools are not unduly restricted in their capacity to use a religious test in appointing support staff who have a pastoral mission directly related to the school ethos, in exactly the same way as they can appoint teachers.</p>

	<p pid="a.84.0/1">My Lords, the noble Baroness has raised a practical solution that has very seductive undertones. There is clearly an issue. Sometimes people have destroyed their heritage&mdash;that is, the forest&mdash;because of money. There is no other crop, as it were. They have to be prevented from doing so, and shown the wisdom of preserving it. But they have to have alternatives. If we can sell this to our people on the basis that we can make all these changes and still grow our economy, the same must apply to everyone else. They will want to grow their economies, because they are far behind us in that respect. This issue has to be dealt with.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/2">I regret that I did not comment on the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Taverne, relating to public perception. He is right: if the public are not on side, nothing will happen. Ministers talking, business acting or taxes changing to change people's behaviour will not work. It will build in resentment. People have to be made to understand that there is a major problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.84.0/3">We have an outreach programme focusing on the private sector, legislators and broader civil society. I shall briefly give some examples of what was done. In December last year, a new campaign was launched, called &quot;Tomorrow's Climate, Today's Challenge&quot;, which included free resources; short films; a website; a communications guide; a &pound;6 million climate challenge fund to support local level communication projects, and we expect to announce winners on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-05">5 June</phrase>; a European environment day; large-scale national activities allowing local level activities to feel part of a wider government-backed initiative to commencein 2006-07; and a youth competition to help communicate climate change in their region, in which nine regional climate change champions were announced on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-11">11 May 2006</phrase>. Work has to go on over a whole range of activities. It is not just about the media but about understanding the footprints of normal people's lives.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-10-30a.88.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100791" speakername="Baroness Murphy" colon=":" colnum="88"  time="019:55:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61030-0004.htm#06103075000027">
	<p pid="a.88.0/1">My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, for bringing forward this debate today, although, unusually, I find myself in disagreement with some of what she said.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/2">I came here today hotfoot from a hospital closure party. We were all given pens with which to write graffiti on the hospital walls, which was an extremely popular event. The Poplar and Stepney District Sick Asylum, which opened with great splendour in 1871, closed today at St Andrew's Hospital, Bow. Not a single person was there to protest. The people in the local community are extremely pleased to lose their out-of-time, inadequate hospital and, instead, to be provided with splendid new facilities in other areas around the district and, in particular, at Newham General Hospital. It is a very popular hospital closure programme locally, as it is a community hospital that has had its day and is now developing an alternative service.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/3">I declare my interest as a member of the board of Monitor, the NHS foundation trust regulator, which is examining with interest and some excitement the possibility that some community hospitals and wider community health services could be delivered via foundation trust status. That would be a practical means of injecting improved local accountability and bringing better financial and managerial rigour and service innovation into the community services sector. This is a &pound;7.5 billion industry and perhaps it needs a little more rigour to be brought to it. To justify effective governance and financial expertise in such trusts, sufficient size is important&mdash;perhaps less than &pound;30 million would be unwise&mdash;but I urge the Minister not to get too hung up on this or on the current geography of services. It may be better to let some specialist services thrive across larger areas, rather than leave existing generic services as they are.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/4">In this brief debate tonight, I want to highlight three other matters: first, the need to increase the diversity of providers of community health; secondly, the importance of better commissioning of those services; and, thirdly, how crucial it is to understand the detailed costs if we are to make an impact on service delivery.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/5">I have lived through numerous decisions and revisions relating to the role of community hospitals. There are still 450 of them, in spite of the alarms about closure, all the way through from the traditional cottage hospital at one end of the spectrum to, at the other end, a modern, almost bedless site for outpatients, diagnostic tests, minor operations and day treatments. I believe it is possible to have community hospitals without beds. However, we need to ensure that the next generation of community hospitals is the second sort, rather than the latter, traditional sort, where many of the services can be provided rather better by independent sector nursing homes and the spot-purchasing of beds of different sorts. The recent White Paper set out clearly what needs to be delivered, but the infrastructure to deliver that vision is not in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/6">Revenue follows capital investment in the NHS, so the Government's announcement of &pound;850 million capital investment in such schemes is very welcome. But we must pause and consider why NHS LIFT, which, as the National Audit Office pointed out recently, has been relatively successful in getting new private money invested in GP premises, has not on the whole stimulated the new-style community services or the new kind of community hospitals which the Government support. The answer lies in the poor commissioning of services. Unless we strengthen the commissioning and detailed procurement of services, acute hospitals will continue to dominate. We have seen how difficult it has been for United Healthcare to make inroads into primary health and community health services in the teeth of reactionary opposition. Can the Minister tell us what steps the Government are taking to strengthen expert strategic service commissioning in the development of hospitals for the future?</p>
	<p pid="a.88.0/7">I was very encouraged to see in the <I>Health Service Journal </I>of <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-19">19 October</phrase> a commitment from the Minister to unbundling the tariff for rehabilitation services&mdash;to encourage community-based options&mdash;and for diagnostics, too. This is crucial if we are to understand what money is being spent on community health and how we can begin to spend it better. When is some definite news expected on that unbundling work, which is so crucial to delivering the services that we need?</p>

	<p pid="a.91.0/1">My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend on securing this debate and on the way in which she posed the Question. One of the great mysteries about this Government's health policy is that they can spend so much more money and still face a barrage of hostile complaint from the public. The policy on community hospitals is an example of this. My noble friend set out the problems that are occurring around the country, which are rather more typical, perhaps I may respectfully say, than the example given by the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/2">The Government use the remarkably ugly word &quot;reconfiguration&quot; of services to explain what they are doing. Basically, that means closing some facilities to develop others. They are never entirely frank in public about the implications and, particularly, the closures. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-05">5 July</phrase>, an announcement from the Department of Health trumpeted a,</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/3" class="indent">&quot;huge cash boost for community hospitals&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/4">without the press release quite making it clear that the promised &pound;750 million was capital spending and not revenue, which is where the problems were.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/5">However, the department knows as well as everybody else that the general policy that it is following involves hospital closures. They are difficult decisions for any Government to take, where, at the very least, the public should be able to expect that decisions are taken absolutely objectively. This is the one point that I want to make in this short debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/6">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-03">3 July</phrase>, two days before the &quot;huge cash boost for community hospitals&quot; press release, a meeting took place which involved not just health Ministers, but party political representatives of the Labour Party, including the party chairman, Hazel Blears, and political advisers from Number 10. I quote from the <I>Times </I>of <phrase class="date" code="2006-09-15">15 September</phrase>, reporting on a number of e-mails which had come to it. The e-mails stated that Patricia Hewitt, the Secretary of State, called for those at the meeting to be provided with &quot;heat maps&quot;, showing public opposition and the potential political implication of any closures. Another e-mail from Patricia Hewitt's private secretary asked for a political meeting to discuss the implications of the Civil Service submission on how services should be changed. The e-mails in the <I>Times </I>report went on to state that the Health Secretary wanted a political meeting to discuss the submission and that she wanted the health Ministers, the noble Lord, Lord Warner, and Andrew Burnham, to attend with their advisers, as well as Ms Blears with her two advisers and two advisers from Number 10. A further e-mail from Miss Hewitt's diary secretary stated that Ms Blears had asked for a party representative to be included at the Department of Health meeting. Later, a spokesman for Ms Blears confirmed that the meeting had taken place, but said that, because it was political, there was no record of who was present. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/7" class="indent">&quot;It wouldn't be unusual for Labour Party press officers to attend meetings with ministers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/8">This is a serious matter which goes to the heart of how the Government are run.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/9">For six years, I was Secretary of State for Social Services and I had one special adviser. My Ministers of State&mdash;unknown people like John Major and Ken Clarke&mdash;had a no special advisers whatever. At this meeting there appear to have been six or seven special advisers. However, I find it utterly extraordinary that the Labour Party chairman, plus this array of political advisers, should be allowed to give their views on such an official submission. It is beyond belief that the Labour Party press officer should have been invited and utterly incredible that not one of the six or seven advisers actually took a note of anything that took place at the meeting. I find that simply unbelievable. Without that we cannot judge whether party political interests entered into what should have been an impartial and objective process.</p>
	<p pid="a.91.0/10">There is one man who can answer those questions: the noble Lord, Lord Warner, who was at the meeting. Will he confirm that such a meeting took place? Will he explain what he understands by &quot;heat maps&quot;? Will he confirm the membership of that meeting and confirm that no note was ever taken of it? Above all, how can such a clearly party-political meeting be justified to consider an official submission on such issues of health policy? Should not any policy involving closures be fair and clearly seen to be fair? Is there not a danger at the moment of the whole process appearing tainted?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-10-30a.96.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100800" speakername="Baroness Neuberger" colon=":" colnum="96"  time="020:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61030-0004.htm#06103078000017">
	<p pid="a.96.0/1">My Lords, I too would like to thank the noble Baroness, Lady Cumberlege, for asking this Question and in this short speech I want to address maternity services. Women of my generation believed that the hugely successful campaigns for choice in childbirth had changed things. The <I>Good Birth Guide</I> generation would be able to give birth where and how they wished. Some wanted to give birth in warm water, some went for natural childbirth and others for home births. Some wanted an epidural; others, despite medical advice at the time, wanted a caesarean, and so on. It seemed as though things had truly changed, but towards the end of the 1990s that perception began to shift. Reform, the think tank, showed in December 2005 that women giving birth in NHS hospitals received less care from their midwives than 10 years earlier.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/2">To support the question of the noble Baroness, Lady Masham, the number of hours worked by midwives in NHS hospitals fell 14 per cent between 1994 and 2004. In 1994 60 per cent of midwives worked full time. By 2004 that figure had fallen to39 per cent. In addition, the Council of Deans of the nursing and health professions representing nursing and health faculties at UK universities voiced its fears in May this year that the NHS would by 2009 be stuck with a chronic under supply of nurses, midwives and other allied health professionals because ofcuts. But, as of last month, we are being told by David Nicholson that there may be as many as60 reconfigurations of NHS services, some&mdash;perhaps all&mdash;of which will affect maternity services. That runs alongside a government policy, as stated in, <I>Our Health, Our Care, Our Community</I>, of expanding community provision for expectant mothers. It stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/3" class="indent">&quot;We want to ensure that maternity services are women focused and family centred. This means increasing choice for women and their partners over where and how they have their baby&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/4">That acknowledged that women were not being able to choose where their baby was born.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/5">However, in, <I>Our Health, Our Care, Our Say: making it happen</I>, published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October</phrase>, there is no explicit mention of maternity services&mdash;at least, I could not find one. The Minister in another place, Andy Burnham, said that decision-making is a matter for PCTs and strategic health authorities in consultation with the local population. That may be right. Nevertheless, something strange seems to be going on here. Part of that may concern a real difficulty.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/6">In Stroud, a renowned local midwife maternity unit was given a last-minute reprieve last month after strong local objections to its projected closure because of local health service debts. Near where we live, in Leamington Spa, people in Banbury are up in arms about the Horton Hospital&mdash;not to mention Kidderminster, not very far away. At the same time, there are clear clinical reasons for shifting some services to specialist centres or to newer configurations, as the noble Baroness, Lady Murphy, said. That needs to be much better explained or consulted on. The case of Stroud is not alone. Nor is its future assured for the long term, unless the Minister can give us those assurances this evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/7">David Nicholson said that the NHS had to tackle the &quot;wicked&quot; issue of maternity services. He said</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/8" class="indent">&quot;Pregnant women would be best served by maternity departments big enough to sustain a 24-hour, consultant-led service. That would require work to be concentrated in fewer hospitals.</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/9">For whom is that true? For all pregnant women? The noble Baroness, Lady Emerton, has already pointed out some difficulties that have occurred in some of those acute hospitals. How can the Secretary of State for Health announce &pound;750 million for local people to set up and develop local community services, as she did, if David Nicholson wants to cut community maternity services, which are hugely popular&mdash;and, for women without complications, often preferable?</p>
	<p pid="a.96.0/10">If the promise is that all women will have choice over where and how to have their babies by 2009, how will what seems to be happening now with community services help; and how will the Government monitor whether it will be possible for women to choose? We seem to have two conflicting policy objectives. Since we have the fifth most important person in the NHS here&mdash;the Minister&mdash;perhaps he can explain how the Government will make that possible.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-10-30a.102.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100032" speakername="Lord Baker of Dorking" colon=":" colnum="102"  time="020:46:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61030-0005.htm#0610315000005">
	<p pid="a.102.5/1">My Lords, I beg to move Amendment No. 12&mdash;at last. For those of us interested in education it has been a long day's journey into night. This amendment differs from the amendment tabled last week by myself, the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, and the noble Lords, Lord Skidelsky and Lord Taverne, which your Lordships will recall was much more prescriptive. It gave the Secretary of State the power to insist on a25 per cent quota. This amendment does not do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/2">Perhaps I may draw the House's attention particularly to subsection (2), which states that when a new school is set up:</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/3" class="indent">&quot;The local education authority for the area in which the school is to be established may, if they so desire, specify that up to&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/4">not necessarily the full amount&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/5" class="indent">&quot;25 per cent of places at the school shall be allocated to pupils who do not follow the religion or religious denomination of the school&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/6">That is the nub of the amendment. It goes on to state that where the local authority does not specify a certain percentage because it is prepared to grant a totally exclusive faith school, the Secretary of State can call that in if there is significant opposition from residents. That is the amendment we are about to discuss.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/7">I had better turn off my mobile phone&mdash;though you never know, it may be God. I apologise to noble Lords for that little intermission.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/8">The point I want to make is that the amendment we have tabled today was the Government's policy just a week ago. It was the policy enunciated at the Dispatch Box by the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, on<phrase class="date" code="2006-10-17">17 October</phrase> when he said that, on the undertaking that I withdraw my amendment, the Government intended to,</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/9" class="indent">&quot;bring forward an amendment on Third Reading along the following lines. We do not believe it right for there to be a mandatory national 25 per cent requirement...However, we wish to give local authorities, in their role as guardians of community cohesion&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/10">that is where the term came from in these debates, and it is absolutely right&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/11" class="indent">&quot;a power to require that new faith schools have admissions policies which include the offer of at least 25 per cent of places on the basis of local preference, not faith preference alone&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/12">That was the policy that the Government intended to follow. The Minister also said:</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/13" class="indent">&quot;We also wish to confer a reserve power on the Secretary of State&mdash;a power, not a duty&mdash;to act in this matter where a local authority's decisions give rise to a sufficient body of local objections&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/10/06; col. 738.]</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/14">The Minister has already said in reply to an earlier amendment that that was conditional upon his securing a degree of consensus. He said that he was very sorry but that he could not secure a degree of consensus. I will come back to that later, if I may.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/15">So, what I have tabled is in effect what the Government's policy was seven days ago. Indeed, so enthusiastic was the Secretary of State for this policy that he actually leaked no less than a Cabinet document to the <I>Sunday Times</I> of the day before last Monday revealing that this was the Government's policy. He made a speech on that Monday saying that faith schools must cross ethnic and faith barriers. As late as Wednesday of last week, one of my friends went to see him and he confirmed that on the following day the Government would table those two amendments. However, on Thursday night everything changed. Unfortunately, I was on the way to Oxford in a coach and it was very difficult to find out what was happening. But the Government completely changed tack. They abandoned their principle and their policy. One might ask why there was such a huge U-turn, because it was certainly the fastest U-turn in political history. I think Churchill said that the best diet in the world is your own words. But when Churchill said that, he thought that there would be a decent interval between the utterance and digestion. In this case there was not; it was a mere matter of seven days.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/16">The reason why the policy was withdrawn is very clear. There was a very effective Catholic campaign&mdash;brilliantly effective&mdash;headed by the Archbishop of Birmingham, who wrote an article in the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> saying that this was the thin end of the wedge&mdash;those were his very words. Of course, it was not the thin end of the wedge, because the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, who is gifted in these matters, said very clearly that,</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/17" class="indent">&quot;there is no question of requiring this admission arrangement in respect of existing faith schools where it does not already apply&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 17/10/06; col. 739.]</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/18">The Government made very clear when they said they were going to table these amendments that in no way were they to apply to existing faith schools. But the view of the Catholic Church, led by the Archbishop of Birmingham&mdash;of whom I am an admirer, because he has managed to secure a complete surrender by the Government without conceding an inch&mdash;is exactly the same as it was seven days ago. The noble Lord, Lord Alton, is nodding. I hope that the Minister has noted that the noble Lord nodded when I said that. He is the closest that we get in this House to a Catholic authority.</p>
	<p pid="a.102.5/19">The Archbishop of Birmingham, in an interview last Friday, said, &quot;If we are going to have any new Catholic schools&mdash;though we have no such proposals because we cannot afford any new schools at the moment&mdash;but if we have any new Catholic schools, we will determine what the demand is locally for such schools&quot;. If they decide that there are 200 pupils in Bury St Edmunds who want to have Catholic schools, they will then put forward a proposal for a Catholic school for 200 pupils in Bury St Edmunds. Then he said, &quot;When we fill that lot, if there is any spare, we will add a few more&quot;&mdash;that is their present policy. So I think that the Archbishop of Birmingham&mdash;and I hope that the noble Lord will take this back to him&mdash;is a brilliant negotiator. He has got the Government to surrender without yielding an inch. I think that the Government ought to use him in Iraq. I think that he would do a marvellous job there. Congratulations to him.</p>
