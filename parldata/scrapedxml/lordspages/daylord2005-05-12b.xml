	<p pid="b.3.1/1">My Lords, I beg to acquaint the House that a Commission has been issued under Her Majesty's Great Seal to several Lords therein named authorising the said Lords to declare in the name and on behalf of Her Majesty Her Majesty's Approbation of the choice of the Commons of Mr Michael Martin to be their Speaker.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/2">Then, the Lords Commissioners (the Lord Chancellor (Lord Falconer of Thoroton), the Lord President of the Council (Baroness Amos), the Lord Strathclyde, the Lord Roper and the Lord Donaldson of Lymington) being robed and seated in front of the Throne, the Lord Chancellor directed Black Rod as follows: Let the Commons know that the Lords Commissioners desire their immediate attendance in this House.</p>
	<p pid="b.3.1/3">Then, the Commons being at the Bar, Mr Speaker-Elect (Mr Michael Martin), addressing the Royal Commissioners, said: My Lords, I have to acquaint your Lordships that, in obedience to the Royal Command, Her Majesty's faithful Commons have, in the exercise of their undoubted rights and privileges, proceeded to the election of a Speaker, and that their choice has fallen upon myself. I therefore present myself to your Lordships' Bar and submit myself with all humility to Her Majesty's gracious Approbation.</p>

	<p pid="b.3.2/1">Michael Martin, we are commanded to assure you that Her Majesty is so fully sensible of your zeal in the public service, and of your ample sufficiency to execute the arduous duties which her faithful Commons have selected you to discharge, that Her Majesty does most readily approve and confirm you as their Speaker.</p>

	<p pid="b.4.0/1">My Lords, I submit myself with all humility and gratitude to Her Majesty's gracious Commands. It is now my duty, in the name of and on behalf of the Commons of the United Kingdom, to lay claim, by humble petition to Her Majesty, to all their ancient and undoubted rights and privileges, especially to freedom of speech in debate, to freedom from arrest, and to free access to Her Majesty whenever occasion shall arise, and that the most favourable construction shall be put upon all their proceedings. With regard to myself, I pray that, if in the discharge of my duties I shall inadvertently fall into any error, it may be imputed to myself alone, and not to Her Majesty's most faithful Commons.</p>

	<p pid="b.4.1/1">Mr Speaker, we have it further in Command to inform you that Her Majesty does most readily confirm all the rights and privileges which have ever been granted to or conferred upon the Commons by Her Majesty or any of her Royal predecessors. With respect to yourself, Sir, though Her Majesty is sensible that you stand in no need of such assurance, Her Majesty will ever place the most favourable construction upon your words and actions.</p>
