	<p pid="a.325.13/1">My Lords, it is impossible accurately to determine how many people are in the United Kingdom illegally. The Home Office published a report on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June</phrase> last year that included an estimate of the size of the illegal migrant population in the United Kingdom in 2001. The central estimate of that report was 430,000, although that was based on data from the 2001 census. It is reasonable to assume that the overall number will have reduced since EU enlargement, because any illegally resident migrants from those countries will now be able to reside legally. I remind the House that the removal of embarkation controls by the previous government in 1994 has had an impact on our ability to assess how many people come in and go out.</p>

	<p pid="a.327.0/1">My Lords, we certainly do all that we can to encourage the earliest possible elections to a constituent assembly and the negotiations which are needed between the warring parties in Nepal. Some useful steps have been taken forward in what is quite a fragile position. The peace talks that started with the Maoists on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-26">26 May</phrase> were a good start. The reality is that the Maoist forces have to be brought into a political process, and that involves them renouncing violence. There is no place for people to engage in political processes while retaining arms and using them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-15a.379.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100846" speakername="Lord Tyler" colon=":" colnum="379"  time="014:52:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60615-14.htm#60615-14_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.379.0/1">My Lords, this has been a fascinating and very thoughtful debate, not least in the maiden contributions of my noble friend Lord Lee and the noble Lord, Lord Taylor.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/2">I had a very small, walk-on part in the Power inquiry. I was, first, very interested in it as a concept; secondly, very intrigued; and, finally, very impressed. I should like to place on record the thanks of the whole House, I think, to the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy, and her team. Above all, it succeeded where so many others have failed in securing the direct involvement of a huge number of people&mdash;not least, young people&mdash;outside the Westminster village and outside the usual political anorak group. I went to the conference at the end of the exercise. The many, many hundreds of people there were not the usual suspects. I have been involved all my political life in this sort of circle and there were people I did not know. That in itself is a great tribute to this exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/3">I believe there are two seminal reasons for the decline in interest, participation and commitment of British citizens in political institutions. First, the continuing and escalating failure of our systems to clearly represent and implement their democratic choices; and, secondly, the shattered hopes and expectations of those who put their faith in promises of change and improvement which did not then occur. I shall concentrate on the first, with only a brief reference to the second.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/4">As I had a role in producing a draft Bill on the reform of your Lordships' House with the late Robin Cook, Ken Clarke, Tony Wright and George Young, which was specifically endorsed by the Power commission, I will be very modest and keep completely off that subject. Instead, as a former Member of Parliament, shadow Leader of the Commons and a constitutional reform spokesman, I want to concentrate on the Power analysis of the shortcomings of the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/5">It is interesting to see what a good debate we have had here when, as far as I know, there has been no reference to the Power commission in any substantial form down the Corridor. I note, incidentally, that four of us speaking in today's debate are refugees from that place&mdash;only four&mdash;and I am the most recent, so I suppose that I come with the scars to show for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/6">In essence they have shown in this report that the citizens of this country believe that our representative parliamentary system has become dysfunctional and, in the current fashionable phrase, not fit for purpose. At a time when so many are busy challenging the legitimacy of this House&mdash;with some justification&mdash;it is surely a healthy corrective for us to examine the legitimacy of the House of Commons.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/7">In the first general election which attracted my interest&mdash;in 1955, at school, when I was very young and na-ve, so I was the Labour candidate&mdash;96.1 per cent of the national vote went to either the Conservative or Labour parties; the winning party gained a fraction under half of the total vote, just under 50 per cent, and every vote seemed to matter. The turnout was 76.8 per cent. Most important of all, the result reflected what the people had voted for and could be seen to have done so.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/8">Fifty years later, in 2005, what do we see? Only 67.5 per cent voted for those two parties, only 35.2 per cent voted for the winning party&mdash;21 per cent of the registered electorate&mdash;which, nevertheless, won for it an overall majority of 66 in the House of Commons. In huge swathes of the country the outcome seemed entirely predictable and the turnout was a miserable 61.3 per cent. The average figure disguised huge variations, with the safest seats typically scoring little more than half that of the most marginal.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/9">Election turnout is not, of course, the most effective test&mdash;it is not the only litmus test&mdash;of a healthy democracy, as many noble Lords have said already, but if such a substantial proportion cannot be motivated to pop into their polling station, and have good reason to think it is a waste of time, that must surely worry all democrats. A whole generation is getting out of the habit of voting.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/10">In some areas, of course, there was no representation at all for one or other of the three major parties. Labour gained nearly a quarter of the votes in Cambridgeshire and won no seats; the Conservatives did the same in Cleveland and won no seats; while in Cornwall we now have a Tory-free zone and a Labour-free zone. The Conservatives achieved some 50,000 more votes than Labour in England but ended up with 92 fewer seats. Chris Patten and others have referred to the fact that if it does not change its attachment to first-past-the-post the Conservative Party now faces built-in distortions of gigantic proportions.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/11">Local representation can be equally haphazard. In the recent May council elections, the Conservatives won 40.8 per cent of the votes in the London borough of Kingston, compared to the Liberal Democrats' 38.5 per cent, but the latter retained control, winning 25 seats to the former's 21. In Birmingham, Labour had the largest share of the vote but the Conservatives had the most seats. In some councils where party supporters recorded substantial numbers of votes, they got no seats at all&mdash;the Conservatives in Cambridge, Labour in Richmond and the Liberal Democrats in Croydon.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/12">For those noble Lords who need more evidence, the report published yesterday by ERS, <i>The Great Local Votes Swindle</i>, demonstrates some extraordinary distortions. No wonder voters feel cheated. Some 54.8 per cent of the votes cast in the Birmingham elections were cast for losing candidates and a further 18.2 per cent contributed to excess majorities, making a total of 73 per cent of votes effectively &quot;wasted&quot;. No wonder even registered electors do not bother to vote; no wonder an increasing number of citizens do not even bother to register.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/13">The one certainty of the past 50 years, between 1955 and 2005, has been the constant trend towards greater uncertainty. The linking thread has been a consistent reduction in linkage&mdash;reflecting also, of course, a reduction in identification with social class&mdash;between the nation's wish and the electoral outcome. There has also been a dramatic drop in the membership of the three major parties. This has identified a most important change in our society. There is less personal identification with the various parties. In fact, it has almost halved during that period.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/14">There have been attempts to tinker with the system, which have had minimal impact. My noble friend Lord Greaves referred to the compulsory postal voting scheme, and I believe that the Electoral Commission has quite rightly objected to what was, to a large extent, an open door to minor corruption. It is already clear that that will not make a major change. Indeed, there have been attempts to improve the registration process, but people&mdash;particularly in the 18 to 30 age group&mdash;will not bother to register if they think the whole process is pointless.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/15">Last year, of course, there were some important elections in other parts of the world. In New Zealand, where everybody knows that every vote counts, electoral registration reached 95.2 per cent&mdash;they were slightly disappointed, but we could do with that.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/16">Reference has already been made to the fact that there is at present a secret and incestuous review of electoral systems, apparently still chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister. But it is anybody's guess what will come out of that because it is not transparent and, in particular, it seems to be looking only, as Ministers have confessed, at recent experience in the United Kingdom. Surely, international comparisons of the kind to which I have just referred are important. We should all be asking that that particular exercise now be made transparent, inclusive and independent, and not simply be a government exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/17">Presiding over the increasing but avoidable democratic deficit could prove a lasting legacy for Mr Blair. I believe that he will have to consider this issue again in the next few months if that is not to be the case. The blatant injustice of the system to the voter&mdash;not to the politicians or the parties&mdash;is clearly the most powerful reason for doing something about it. One can hardly blame the 40 per cent of those who could vote but refused to do so when they could see that it was so pointless. Again, international comparison showed that last year in Germany the turnout was 77.7 per cent and in New Zealand over 80 per cent. As the noble Baroness's commission has so rightly noted, turnout is not the only health check on the body politic but it is the most tangible one.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/18">The ignominious retreat from the promises of 1997, which were so implicit in the agreement that my noble friend Robin Cook negotiated before 1997, have been very damaging to the whole reputation of the business of politics. The Power commission pulls no punches. It identified as essential:</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/19" class="indent">&quot;A responsive electoral system&mdash;which offers voters a greater choice and diversity of parties and candidates&mdash;should be introduced for elections to the House of Commons, House of Lords and local councils in England and Wales to replace the first-past-the-post system&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/20">It has been noted that the report also advocated the use of the single transferable vote to maximise voter choice and minimise party dominance.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/21">In his book <i>New Britain: My Vision of a Young Country,</i> published just before the 1997 election victory&mdash;I took it out of the House of Commons Library and was interested to find that only one person had read it before me&mdash;Mr Blair pledged,</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/22" class="indent">&quot;an end to hereditary peers sitting in the House of Lords as the first step to a properly directly elected second chamber, and the chance for the people to decide after the election the system by which they elect the government of the future&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/23">Just a few paragraphs later, he emphasised the nature of these commitments:</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/24" class="indent">&quot;The party I lead will carry out in government the programme we provide in our Manifesto beforehand. Nothing more, nothing less, that is my word. We deliver what we promise. We don't promise what we can't deliver&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/25">At Prime Minister's Questions on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-09">9 February</phrase> last year, I asked him which of those two broken promises he most regretted. I leave it to your Lordships to see from <i>Hansard</i> that I did not really receive an answer&mdash;no surprise at that.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/26">The second major cause of public disenchantment with politics and politicians is the widespread perception that you cannot trust the system to deliver what it and they promise. The rosy dawn of <phrase class="date" code="1997-05-02">2 May 1997</phrase>, when even those who would never dream of voting Labour thought that they could detect a fresh, transparent, inclusive approach in our democracy, is now a distant memory. I am struck with the increasing detachment of Ministers from the day-to-day concerns and aspirations of their citizenship as the years go by. To misquote the noble Lord, Lord Acton:</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/27" class="indent">&quot;All power disconnects but absolute power disconnects absolutely&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/28">I am a firm believer in the parliamentary system and we have had some notable victories, but we still have some important challenges to come, not least to see whether your Lordships' House will remain a fully appointed Chamber of Tony's cronies or whether we can do something better. Again, I welcome the recommendations of the Power commission.</p>
	<p pid="a.379.0/29">Where does that leave us? Churchill urged politicians 50 years ago to trust the people, but what if they do not trust the politicians or the political system? A <i>Daily Telegraph</i> poll on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-22">22 May</phrase> showed that trust in Labour Ministers is now at 20 per cent, in leading Conservatives it is 19 per cent, and in Liberal Democrat leaders it is 25 per cent&mdash;much better. Compare that with family doctors at 89 per cent and judges at 77 per cent&mdash;very relevant to today's discussions on the role of judges. Admittedly, &quot;my local MP&quot; scores 44 per cent&mdash;across parties. Journalists on the red-top tabloid newspapers, who so often attack all those within the political system, rate only 12 per cent.</p>

	<p pid="a.399.2/1">My Lords, noble Lords will recall that the issues addressed in these regulations were the subject of much debate during the passage of the Human Tissue Bill. The concept of consent is the principle that underlies the whole of the Human Tissue Act. Part 1 of the Act sets out the requirement for consent to carry out activities for particular purposes. The first aim of the regulations is to set out, in Part 2, the circumstances where there is deemed to be consent to activities regulated by the Act in relation to adults who lack the capacity to consent for themselves.</p>
	<p pid="a.399.2/2">Section 6 of the Act states that where a living adult lacks capacity to give consent to the storage and use of their bodily material, the Secretary of State can specify in regulations circumstances where consent can be deemed to have been given. The circumstances in which it was envisaged that Section 6 would be used was signalled by Ministers in Parliament during the passage of the Act. These circumstances are realised in the regulations. They are: first, where it would be in the best interests of an incapacitated person from whose body the material came; secondly, for research, where the research is authorised under the Medicines for Human Use (Clinical Trials) Regulations 2004; and, finally, for research in circumstances that would be consistent with Sections 30 to 33 of the Mental Capacity Act 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.399.2/3">Part 3 of the regulations deals with transplantation. Section 33 of the Act provides for regulations to: first, allow live donor transplantation if the Human Tissue Authority is satisfied that no reward has been, or is to be, given and that conditions and requirements specified in regulations are satisfied; secondly, provide for a mechanism for the Human Tissue Authority to reconsider its decisions&mdash;in other words, an appeals system; and, finally, define what is meant by &quot;transplantable material&quot; for the purposes of Section 33.</p>
	<p pid="a.399.2/4">Regulation 10 defines transplantable material as whole or part organs and bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells. These are the materials that are subject to control and scrutiny, although Regulation 10(3) limits the regulation of bone marrow and peripheral blood stem cells to that taken from an adult or child who is not competent to consent. These potentially vulnerable donors need a higher degree of protection, in line with the requirements of the European bioethics convention, through the introduction of a properly independent element into decisions where the procedure is principally for the treatment of another person.</p>
	<p pid="a.399.2/5">While most donation cases can be dealt with by the authority through a simple executive procedure, Regulation 12 sets out the cases that must be considered by a panel of at least three members of the Human Tissue Authority. Cases requiring this procedure for approval are: the donation of an organ or part organ by a child; the donation of an organ or part organ by an adult who lacks capacity; or where the donor is an adult who has the capacity to consent, but the case involves paired donations, pooled donations or a non-directed altruistic donation.</p>
	<p pid="a.399.2/6">There are cases where a higher degree of protection is necessary because of a combination of factors, including the higher risks involved in removing an organ or part organ compared to regenerative tissue, the inability of the donor to give consent, and, in the case of paired, pooled or non-directed altruistic donations, the novelty of the procedure.</p>
	<p pid="a.399.2/7">Regulations 13 and 14 set out the circumstances in which the Human Tissue Authority may reconsider its decision, and the procedure for dealing with such reconsiderations.</p>
	<p pid="a.399.2/8">Section 34 of the Act provides for regulations to specify what information must be supplied, by whom and to what authority, about transplants, and creates an offence for non-compliance. This power is exercised mainly through the Human Tissue Act 2004 (Ethical Approval, Exceptions from Licensing and Supply of Information about Transplants) Regulations 2006, which were laid before Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-10">10 May 2006</phrase>. These require a person who removes transplantable material from a human body for transplantation, or receives such material for transplantation into a recipient, to provide certain information to NHS Blood and Transplant. However, the regulations that we are considering today define in Regulation 9 what constitutes &quot;transplantable material&quot; for the purposes of the provision of information.</p>
	<p pid="a.399.2/9">The Department of Health has worked closely with stakeholders, including representatives in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, patient representative groups, healthcare professionals and interested individuals, while drafting these regulations. They were the subject of a formal consultation exercise for a period of 12 weeks between <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-11">11 July</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-04">4 October 2005</phrase>. In my view, the provisions of the Human Tissue Act 2004 (Persons who Lack Capacity to Consent and Transplants) Regulations 2006 are compatible with the European Convention on Human Rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.399.2/10">Before I conclude, I must declare an interest as a patron of Kidney Wales. I believe that these regulations provide a clear and workable framework for dealing with difficult issues relating to transplantation and consent, and I commend them to the House. I beg to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.399.2/11">Moved, That the draft regulations laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May</phrase> be approved [<i>28th Report from the Joint Committee and</i> <i>37th Report from the Merits Committee</i>].&mdash;(<i>Baroness Royall of Blaisdon</i>.)</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-15a.413.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100464" speakername="Lord Northbrook" colon=":" colnum="413"  time="016:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60615-22.htm#60615-22_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.413.0/1">My Lords, like other speakers, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Moser, for initiating this debate. I claim no special interest in this subject, except as a director of a fund management company. I see the way that economic statistics move the markets. So, from that viewpoint, their accuracy, as far as that is possible to achieve, is vital.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/2">There has been cynicism about statistics for many years. Andrew Lang, the prolific Scottish novelist and expert on mythology and folklore, is noted for saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/3" class="indent">&quot;An unsophisticated forecaster uses statistics as a drunken man uses lamp-posts&mdash;for support, rather than illumination&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/4">Yet statistics, not least of all, official statistics, matter. They are a necessary input into vital policy decisions by Governments, companies and individuals. To take just one example, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee, when making its interest rate decisions, relies heavily on a battery of survey evidence and official data&mdash;even though those data are inevitably lagging indicators.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/5">Unfortunately, public confidence and trust in official data have deteriorated in recent years, at the same time that users of statistics have become more demanding. The much-respected head of the Nuffield Trust, Sir Denis Pereira Gray, said at a recent seminar at the Cass Business School that the crisis of confidence in national statistics is getting worse. As the Financial Secretary to the Treasury, John Healey, stated at the same seminar, there is a need to build and reinforce public trust in the statistical system, which will take a long time.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/6">Suspicions remain, as other speakers have mentioned, that there is ministerial interference in the classification and presentation of official statistics, and the Treasury, as I will demonstrate, is a prime culprit in that exercise. The first example was the altering of the goalposts in determining the golden rule. Its refusal to classify Network Rail's liabilities of some &pound;17 billion as public sector debt was incorrect. Also, the extent of private finance initiative liabilities is understated, according to Capital Economics, by some &pound;25 billion, thus ignoring the requirements of UK accounting standard FRS5, which seeks to ensure transparency in corporate accounting for off-balance-sheet items. Also the public sector unfunded pension liability has, according to the actuaries Watson Wyatt, been understated by some &pound;230 billion and the local government pension shortfall by some &pound;71 billion, because too high a discount rate has been used.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/7">So it is ironic, but nevertheless welcome, that the Chancellor, as Minister for national statistics, has made moves to improve the independence of statistics. Last November, he announced that the Government intended to,</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/8" class="indent">&quot;legislate for . . . the creation of an independent Governing Board for the Office for National Statistics, with delegated responsibility for meeting an overall objective for the statistical system's integrity&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 28/11/05; col. 78.]</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/9">In March this year, the Treasury launched its consultation document. I found the document a bit of a curate's egg; it has some merit. One promising proposal is to make the ONS a non-ministerial department directly accountable to its independent governing board and Parliament. Professor David Rhind, chairman of the Statistics Commission, stated at the recent Cass Business School seminar that the key points about the board were its two roles: the oversight of the Office for National Statistics and scrutiny of all government statistics. The board also has an important role in reporting to Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/10">However, I am concerned that unless the powers given to the governing board are considerable, it may not be able to resist ministerial interference in the ONS's statistical output. At a recent seminar, Professor Adrian Smith, principal at Queen Mary, University of London, had concerns about how the board would function. Would it have executive powers, a monitoring role, or both? I put the same question to the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/11">At the same seminar, John Pullinger, chairman of the Royal Statistical Society national statistics working party, thought that the board could play a leading role in getting departments to work together to create a single statistical system but that would be successful only if it was non-executive. He believed that executive responsibility, as the noble Lord, Lord Moser, stated, should remain with the National Statistician, who should have a statutory duty to lead the ONS and to co-ordinate colleagues across government departments so that there is a single agreed picture of what is going on in society and the economy.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/12">One move that may improve confidence in the ONS's output is for the Treasury to relinquish its role as the ONS's parent department. Even if the ONS becomes a non-ministerial department, as proposed in the document, it is likely that there would still be Treasury departmental involvement. An ideal could be an organisational structure similar to the National Audit Office or the Electoral Commission, answerable to Parliament rather than to the Treasury. Or, as the noble Lord, Lord Moser, stated today and in the debate of <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-23">23 February</phrase> last year, the ONS could report to the Prime Minister, through the Cabinet Office, where its predecessor was until 1989. However the document is silent on this subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/13">In my view, it would be foolish to see independence as a magic solution: scrutiny is also key, either through a new body or a strengthened Statistics Commission. A scrutiny body should be able to influence the quality of official statistics over time. It would help to identify a gold standard applying to key statistics and it would drive up the quality of other statistics by establishing high expectations.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/14">The document's biggest failure, in my view, is the relative discussion of the data issued by departments. These include such politically sensitive issues as the Home Office's crime figures and the Department of Health's hospital waiting times, or subjects such as public sector productivity, where early experimental data from the ONS showed a truly dire picture.</p>
	<p pid="a.413.0/15">These departmental data are especially vulnerable to ministerial spin on release. The big question is: what can be done about these figures? I ask the Minister whether the Government would consider the radical proposal to centralise all data compilation and delivery in the ONS, out of government departments. Alternatively, a half-way house would be to transfer release procedures from the departments to the ONS, distancing them from any accompanying ministerial statements. Without that transfer of power, the notion of independence of statistics is a pipedream.</p>
