<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-07-12a.1525.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100625" speakername="Lord Tanlaw" colon=":" colnum="1525"  time="012:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70712-0005.htm#07071266000209">
	<p pid="a.1525.0/1">My Lords, I join previous speakers in welcoming the Minister to the Dispatch Box and congratulate him on his excellent maiden speech. His qualifications in the real world of business, rather than in politics, are formidable, and I intend to draw on them during the course of my intervention today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/2">I hope that his appointment signals a real change in the new Administration's approach to changes in climate and, in particular, to a related subject in which I can declare an interest; namely, daylight saving. I am the founder chairman of LEAP, the Lighter Evenings All-Party Group, which will, incidentally, meet again on <phrase class="date" code="">Monday 16 July</phrase>. All noble Lords are of course cordially invited.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/3">I hope also that Her Majesty's Opposition and the Liberal Democrats will take the opportunity provided by the change in administration to look again at their own response to daylight saving as a means of &quot;meeting the energy challenge&quot;, which is the title of this debate, as well at the other benefits that it will bring to our society.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/4">However, before I embark on the energy-saving aspect of the debate, it should be worth while my questioning what statistics the Government and the opposition parties have to back up their continued insistence on GMT for the winter months. Where is the data to demonstrate that this policy makes any contribution towards meeting the country's energy challenge?</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/5">I have been fortunate enough to have had sight of a detailed study in draft of Dr Elizabeth Garnsey and Brendan Cronin from the University of Cambridge's Centre for Technology Management in the Department of Engineering and Judge Business School. It is entitled, <I>Re-evaluating Daylight Saving in the United Kingdom</I>. Their considered conclusions recognise the differences of opinion on the relative advantages and disadvantages of darker mornings or darker evenings, when the total hours of daylight are constrained. However, no factual evidence in favour of a return to GMT in Scotland or elsewhere in the United Kingdom is to be found anywhere in the study. In fact, research estimates show that a greater loss of life and a greater number of casualties occur as a result of the annual return to GMT on the last Sunday of October throughout the UK, including Scotland. It is clear that since 1971, at least 5,000 deaths have occurred on the road that are directly attributable to switching to GMT during the winter months.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/6">I shall come to saving energy in a moment, but I first want to hear from the Government and the opposition Front Benches statistics which can justify the current situation. I want to hear also statistics showing that maintaining GMT, with darker afternoons and evenings during the winter months, can be of benefit to the tourist industry, with which I believe the Minister is well acquainted. Was he not until a few days ago the chairman of Tourism Alliance, which represents most, if not all, of our tourist businesses? Was he not also a director of VisitBritain? Therefore, how can he justify his Government's apparent continued resistance to changing the time-scale for the winter months, which is seriously damaging all businesses connected with the tourist industry and about which we have received many representations during the past two years? Will he not take advantage of his new position and influence and use his specialised knowledge to change the situation regarding GMT, or has he been given new statistics, unbeknown to us, which can justify the status quo? If so, perhaps he will be good enough to let us have them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/7">I have referred to the position paper from Cambridge University on electricity generation. Can the Minister show what economies in electricity consumption are brought about by returning to GMT for the winter months? Does he dispute the facts recently given by the National Grid Company, which stated that shifting from GMT+1 in summer to GMT in winter has caused an average increase in electricity consumption of 1.2 per cent during the past six years? This is the equivalent of putting an additional 47,000 cars on the road in terms of carbon emissions. Furthermore, is the Minister aware that the increased peaking of electricity usage during the week after the autumn clock change to GMT on the last Sunday of October increased the cost of electricity generation by an average of &pound;18 million during 2004-06?</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/8">I can find no mention of daylight saving in the Stern review, which is 576 pages long, or in the <I>Economics of Climate Change</I>, volumes 1 and 2, which is 393 pages long, or in the draft Climate Change Bill, which is a mere 63 pages long, or in the White Paper before us today, <I>Meeting the Energy Challenge</I>, which is 342 pages long. That is a total of 1,374 pages of printed matter, weighing just over six kilograms on my scales, and there is not a squeak on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/9">That is strange. If the Government and the opposition parties do not support daylight saving, they must surely have a good reason for maintaining GMT during the winter months. If so, what is it? By their omitting to mention it in the glut of government papers referred to, one is given an uncomfortable impression that something fishy may be going on, such as a political stitch-up between the parties. I hope that I am wrong.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/10">I will therefore, if I am permitted to do so, bring before the House another Lighter Evenings (Experiment) Bill, but with one big difference from the original. Instead of switching to GMT+2 during summer months, under the new Bill the country would remain on GMT+1&mdash;summer time&mdash;throughout the year. My reason for this is that new evidence has been put before me which has convinced me that the existing switchover from summer time to GMT, quite apart from wasting electricity, puts an unnecessarily large strain on the country's present generating capacity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/11">The extra load is currently taken up by the ageing peak stand-by generators, and, as the old nuclear power stations are shut down, as noble Lords have mentioned, this problem will be further aggravated in the years ahead. Daylight saving by maintaining GMT+1 throughout the year would greatly reduce this problem and deliver lighter afternoons and evenings throughout the winter month, which should satisfy the interests most critical of the status quo.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/12">The only advantage it would not deliver is to harmonise the United Kingdom's time-scale with Central European Time. However, I wonder if this change of heart might persuade the doubters on the Conservative Benches to look again with more enthusiasm at a new Bill on the subject.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/13">The question I must put to the Minister in the sphere of this debate is: where are his department's statistics to justify the maintenance of GMT during the winter months? None has been forthcoming from his predecessors, or the Opposition Benches to date, in spite of the passage of the Lighter Evenings (Experiment) Bill through this House, which was without their help; while the Energy Saving (Daylight) Bill, introduced by Tim Yeo MP, chairman of the Environmental Audit Committee in the other place was disgracefully filibustered out of time by the Government with the connivance of the opposition parties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/14">The Minister must surely be aware that the United States, Australia and Canada have recently introduced daylight saving procedures, in spite of the different time zones within their countries, in order to save energy and carbon emission Therefore, can he give any reason why there is a delay in this country in following suit?</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/15">The US Department of Transportation claims that energy use across the country has been cut by 1 per cent each day of daylight saving time. Has the Minister's department produced any figures, which could either prove or disprove benefits occurring here if British Summer Time, GMT+1, was maintained throughout the year, thus requiring no clock change on the last Sunday of October?</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/16">Hardly a week goes by when members of my All-Party Group do not receive representations on lighter evenings from varying interests, such as the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, the tourism industries, school teachers and sporting and leisure organisations to ask what is happening about daylight saving.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/17">Therefore, I looked with hope, but without success, at the forthcoming Bills in the Queen's Speech, released by the Prime Minister yesterday, to see if the Government have changed their mind on the subject. I have also looked through again before this debate at the plethora of papers which surround the subject of climate change to see if I had overlooked mention of this important subject. Again I had no luck in finding anything.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/18">Will the Minister, with his long experience with the CBI, comment on the desirability of the United Kingdom harmonising its time-scale with Europe, a provision which could be added at some other time? The only surveys I can recall seemed to indicate certain ambivalence by the CBI in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/19">I have no objection to Dr Stern's review, which advocates the alchemy of taxation combined with lucrative carbon set-off procedures to transmute carbon emissions into gold for the government agencies involved with climate change. The plethora of Government agencies and advisers can have a field day with the amount of additional paper they can generate as a result of the Stern review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/20">The argument I put on daylight saving is entirely based on energy efficiency and a reduction of pollution. The question of atmospheric carbon is another question altogether, which I will come to when I have a few moments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/21">I want to take noble Lords back 30 years. I tabled an Unstarred Question on atmospheric changes and weather patterns as long ago as <phrase class="date" code="1978-11-30">30 November 1978</phrase>. It is a perfectly respectable speech which is relevant today. Absolutely nothing has happened for the past 30 years in gripping this problem. I said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/22" class="indent">&quot;In conclusion, my Question raises the far wider issues of communication between the scientific community, Government agencies and the general public. Scientists work within an entirely different framework from that of us in Parliament. Their statements have to be more restrained and are based on proven scientific fact, and often because of that their conclusions are not necessarily unanimous. That is particularly the case with questions of weather and climate&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 30/11/78; col. 1447.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/23">I said that 30 years ago. It is absolutely relevant today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/24">The jury is still out about atmospheric carbon. I am sure that the Minister has stacks of papers on the subject. Will he say that carbon and methane emissions occur after the increase in global temperature? The ice cores clearly show that they do. Therefore, if they come after, how on Earth can we reduce global warming by reducing atmospheric carbon or methane? I am not a scientist; I am reliant on the distinguished scientist Dr Michael Cole for making some of these things simple for me. This situation must be addressed by the scientists. They have not made it clear and are still arguing about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/25">There is a further question on methane. There has been a lot of talk of biodiesel. In each of the past 20 years, I have spent two months in the Far East. I have driven from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur on the highway. When I first went there it was wall-to-wall rainforest. I drove along it last year and it was wall-to-wall palm oil. Perfectly good forest areas have been cut down. Forest peoples have been displaced, as in Sarawak and Borneo. Indeed, rice plains are being replaced with palm oil plantations. It is very simple to grow, requires little maintenance and offers high profitability. Indeed, Europe gives grants for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/26">I met a man who told me that if he was given six men with six cans of diesel, he could clear 1,000 hectares of rainforest in 30 days. He was paid to do this by the plantation company. The more Europe buys biodiesel from the Far East, the more forests will be destroyed and the more people will be displaced from their houses, and now the greater encroachment will be that people will be tempted to sell their land which at the moment produces rice. This is absolutely crazy and totally unnecessary. I also question the doubt expressed by one speaker that oil reserves will last only five years. I have no doubt that that is completely wrong and that they will last a good 40 years.</p>
	<p pid="a.1525.0/27">I am left with a slight bewilderment. Everyone has been talking about the same thing for 30 years, very little has happened, no nuclear power has come about and we are still doing nothing. That is the problem with a democratic government of which we are all part, one way or the other. No one can make long-term decisions without them being changed. The situation has been set out by a whole number of Peers so far. It has to stop. We all have to get together and come to a considered conclusion with the help of the scientists to do something sensible about meeting the energy challenge.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-07-12a.1537.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100377" speakername="The Earl of Liverpool" colon=":" colnum="1537"  time="013:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70712-0006.htm#07071266000476">
	<p pid="a.1537.0/1">My Lords, the White Paper provides a rich seam of aims and aspirations for the provision of our future energy needs and is a catalyst for promoting a debate on the vital need for this country to develop a coherent low-carbon future. The Government deserve to be congratulated on that, and I join other noble Lords in congratulating the Minister on his maiden speech from the Dispatch Box. However, there are a number of technologies to which the Government have not given proper consideration; I shall come on to these a little later. I believe that we owe Al Gore a debt of gratitude for his efforts to alert the world to the absolute necessity to reduce our carbon emissions. His film, &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot;, left me in no doubt that we need to act now. The fact that the public are increasingly coming to this view is encouraging.</p>
	<p pid="a.1537.0/2">To those who say, &quot;It's all very well reducing our carbon footprint, but what about China or India?&quot;, I say that we should lead by example. I know that this brings with it issues of competitiveness, but the importance of this issue is such that it transcends even those arguments. As the Minister said, energy saving is where our efforts should begin. That is why I am a little surprised that low-energy light bulbs still seem to cost 400 per cent more than conventional ones. I wonder whether the Government might investigate that. If the manufacturing process dictates such a high price, perhaps they could consider subsidising responsible companies and individuals who wish to make the changeover.</p>
	<p pid="a.1537.0/3">The fact that 8 per cent of all our electricity consumption is used up by machines on standby is appalling. More emphasis needs to be given by manufacturers to cutting that out altogether, and any assistance that the Government can give in that regard will be welcome. The national grid is a wasteful way of distributing electricity, as the White Paper's executive summary acknowledges. Almost 65 per cent of energy is lost through inefficient generation, transmission and distribution. The provision of electricity generating plants, be they CHP, biomass, solar and so on, should be sited near conurbations, as the White Paper again acknowledges. That would greatly reduce wastage.</p>
	<p pid="a.1537.0/4">I turn to three methods of electricity generation that have zero carbon emissions. The first is CSP, which stands for concentrating solar power. This is a mature and proven technology, which has been operating in California since 1985. A new plant went on stream in Spain two months ago and another one is planned for Sicily. CSP is the technique of concentrating sunlight using mirrors to create heat and using that heat to create steam, which then drives turbines and generators, just as a conventional power station does. Solar heat can also be stored in melted salts, enabling electricity to continue to be generated during the hours of darkness.</p>
	<p pid="a.1537.0/5">I hear siren voices asking of what relevance that is to us, particularly given the summer that we are having, but it has great relevance because of the recent development of highly efficient transmission lines, called HVDC, which have transmission losses of only 3 per cent per 1,000 kilometres. That would mean that we could receive electricity from the Sahara Desert with only 10 per cent loss of power. The amazing thing is that, if a CSP farm measuring 80 square miles was established in the desert, it could produce enough electricity to satisfy the entire needs of the whole of Europe. The Germans were sufficiently interested to commission a report, the TRANS-CSP study, which estimated that electricity imported from north Africa and the Middle East could become one of the cheapest sources of electricity for European countries, allowing us to make deep cuts in CO2 emissions and negate the need for nuclear power. My question to the Minister is whether the Government have given proper consideration to this technology and whether there has been any exchange of views with the German Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1537.0/6">Secondly, I turn to tidal power. I understand that the Sustainable Development Commission is carrying out a study into the various ways of harnessing tidal power and that it will report in September this year. The report is eagerly awaited by those with an interest in this technology. I hope that proper and unbiased consideration will be given to tidal lagoons. These lagoons are offshore and actually encourage marine habitats; they do not cause silting problems, unlike the Severn barrage, which I do not advocate. Since becoming interested in tidal power, I have noticed that the Government are encouraging and indeed subsidising tidal stream technology and are inclined to support the Severn barrage, which will require public funding. However, there remains a distinct lack of support for lagoons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1537.0/7">My second question to the Minister is why this is so. Tidal Electric, the company seeking to construct such a lagoon in Swansea Bay, is not seeking any public funding and the research shows that it would be three times cheaper to produce electricity from lagoons as opposed to tidal streams. This fact was confirmed in Ofgem's report in 2005. Interested investors have been impressed by the detailed analysis and costings carried out on behalf of the company by WS Atkins and AEA Technology plc, but when they approach the DTI they receive a negative response, which seems to be based on an incorrect assumption that construction costs will be as high as those for building the Severn barrage. The potential investors are well known businessmen who understand the risks involved, but the killer punch for them is finding that the DTI does not support the project.</p>
	<p pid="a.1537.0/8">Surely every means of harnessing the power of our tides&mdash;we have the second highest tidal range in the world&mdash;should be given the chance to prove its capability. I find this negative attitude incomprehensible. I understand that the Minister has hardly had time to get his feet under his desk at DBERR and so an answer today is a big request, but I hope that he will be able to look at the matter and write to me in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.1537.0/9">Thirdly, and lastly, I would like to touch on matters nuclear. As I said when we debated the energy review report last year, I am against nuclear fission but strongly support nuclear fusion. As noble Lords will know, this type of nuclear power generation offers the potential to provide a major new source of energy using basic non-toxic fuels that are widely available, with no greenhouse gases or long-lived radioactive waste.</p>
	<p pid="a.1537.0/10">The international fusion research programme, which we support, aims to build and demonstrate full-scale power generation in a prototype power plant within 30 to 35 years. If such a prototype is successful, we will have discovered the Holy Grail for our future energy needs. With this in mind, and given the other carbon-neutral schemes that I have mentioned, is it not a great mistake to embark on building more nuclear power stations remotely sited and therefore grid inefficient, which will be hugely costly to build and will leave a lethal legacy of toxic waste with a life of up to 500,000 years?</p>
	<p pid="a.1537.0/11">We still have 2 million cubic metres of nuclear waste to deal with from our existing nuclear power stations. Although dealing with it in geological shafts may be a solution, I do not believe that we have yet arrived at a conclusion. Would it not be far better to try to speed up the nuclear fission research? Meeting the energy challenge provides us with a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to think outside the box, which I have tried to do today. I hope that when future generations look back on our efforts and our decisions we will not be found wanting.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-07-12a.1542.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100334" speakername="Lord Jenkin of Roding" colon=":" colnum="1542"  time="014:09:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70712-0007.htm#07071266000500">
	<p pid="a.1542.2/1">My Lords, following the exchange that has just taken place, I point out to the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, that the leader of the Liberal Democrats in this House has been a member of the Nuclear Energy All-Party Group for a good many years and, as with others, he has many friends.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/2">At this stage, I am not going to attempt another comprehensive assessment of the White Paper. I want to concentrate on a few points. My noble friend Lady Wilcox said rather firmly that the Government need to become much clearer on how they are going to achieve their objectives. We all welcome to the House the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham. I should like to add to the congratulations that have already been offered on what was, by any standards, an excellent maiden speech. I would add only one thing. The most encouraging statement that the noble Lord made during the course of his tour d'horizon was that decisions must be made this year. He nods vigorously. That is absolutely crucial and what we need.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/3">A few weeks ago at the Foundation for Science and Technology&mdash;I declare an interest as its president&mdash;we held a discussion on the energy White Paper. It was attended by a wide range of people from government public bodies, universities and industry. The Minister will be interested to know that we had a presentation from his senior civil servant, Mr. Willy Rickett, the director-general of the Energy Group&mdash;in what was then the DTI and is now, I think, the DBERR, which sounds like a sort of French aristocrat. There were also other energy experts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/4">I will mention one or two of the points that arose during that discussion. Referring to the White Paper, one speaker asked whether the policy is market-oriented or government-oriented. He quoted the <I>Financial Times</I> aphorism, &quot;Is it Gosplan or Greenplan?&quot; The answer is that it is a bit of both. The Government stress that investment decisions&mdash;as has been said, over the next two decades billions of pounds will need to be invested in this country to keep the lights on&mdash;must be made by the market, by energy companies and by the financial markets from which the investment funds will flow. However, the Government can and do use a variety of fiscal and other instruments to steer markets in the directions which they want. An obvious example, mentioned several times today, is the renewable obligations certificates to subsidise renewable energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/5">Ministers often boast about the ROCs and the modest expansion in renewable energy that they imply. There is always the implication that this is financed by a government subsidy. It is not. The subsidy comes directly on to consumers' bills. Ofgem has estimated that cost as &pound;15 per year on every electricity bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/6">The other aspect of what I might call the Gosplan features is this huge list of other organisations, bodies, principles and policies which represent the Government's view. If I may, I am just going to take a moment or two to recite what they are. We have had mention of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme and I will come back to that in a moment. We also have the carbon reduction commitment, the energy performance certificate, the carbon emissions reduction target, the carbon capture and storage initiative, the distributed generation package, the biomass strategy, the energy efficiency commitment, the renewable transport fuel obligation&mdash;my Lords, I am half way through the list&mdash;the low-carbon transport innovation strategy, the environmental transformation fund, the Energy Technologies Institute, the climate change levy, climate change agreements, the Coal Forum, national policy statements, Warm Front, the UK fuel poverty strategy, the Sector Skills Council, et cetera, et cetera.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/7">That is not an exhaustive list. On top of that, there is the new Planning Bill and the Climate Change Bill. If the noble Lord, Lord Jones of Birmingham, could do something to rationalise and bring coherence to this vast tangle of government-sponsored initiatives, he would make a huge contribution to an excellent energy policy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/8">Many of the contributors to our debate at the FST laid stress on the overriding need for an effective and realistic mechanism for pricing carbon. That is essential if these investment markets are going to work properly. It is an issue which, the noble Lord, Lord Jones, may have been warned, I have raised on several occasions in this House and on which I have had lengthy correspondence with his colleague, the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, notably last February.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/9">The noble Lord, Lord Truscott, acknowledged that the EU ETS, the chosen mechanism for pricing carbon, was not working properly in phase 1. It was hoped that the review, then in progress, would bring about improvements. He promised that the White Paper would set out the Government's view in more detail. Well, my Lords, it does. I draw attention&mdash;one has to hunt for it, but it is there&mdash;to Annex C, at the back of the White Paper. I am not going to quote it all as that would be inappropriate. However, four perfectly valid bullet points are set out on page 334. First, the EU ETS,</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/10" class="indent">&quot;should ... set safe, predictable and affordable limits on emissions, which tighten over time&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/11">That is quite right. Secondly, it should,</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/12" class="indent">&quot;be improved such that it is more efficient with fewer distortions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/13">Thirdl, it should,</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/14" class="indent">&quot;cover the right emitters&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/15">which it most emphatically does not do at present. The carbon capture and storage is not yet in it. Fourthly, it should,</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/16" class="indent">&quot;form the hub of a global carbon market&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/17">We are a long way from that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/18">Where does that take us? How are the Government getting on with this? What is being done to make these thoroughly desirable objectives happen?</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/19">In the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-08">8 February</phrase> on the electricity industry, I asked the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, about the so-called carbon hedge proposal advanced by EDF Energy and others. Put briefly, it is a market mechanism for establishing a floor price for carbon. That would be a valuable start. In his letter to me written after the debate, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-19">19 February</phrase>, the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, commented generally, but he did add the words, in italics, in the final paragraph, that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/20" class="indent">&quot;we committed in the Energy Review to <I>'keep open the option of further measures to reinforce the operation of the EU ETS in the UK should this be necessary to provide greater certainty to investors</I>'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/21">EDF Energy briefed me this week to the effect that nothing whatever is being done about the carbon hedge proposals. Can the Minister now tell us what other options, what further measures as promised by the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, are being pursued to attempt to deal with the question of trying to get a clearer price for carbon.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/22">The future of nuclear policy was raised by a number of noble Lords. This had a very bad start from the risible 2003 White Paper. That was followed by what has been described in the courts as &quot;the deeply flawed consultation&quot;, following the Greenpeace action. Therefore, Ministers had to start again. In May, they issued <I>The Future of Nuclear Power</I>, a consultation document with the closing date of <phrase class="date" code="">10 October</phrase>. I am quick to give credit where credit is due. I think that is a very splendid consultation document. They have asked all the right questions and learnt the lessons of the court case. It is very well written, but the botched consultation of the previous year has cost us a year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/23">The new consultation makes it very clear that no decisions have yet been made. This is a consultation paper. I have seen reports of meetings held by some of the noble Lord's officials, including one excellent meeting held in the north-west by his senior man, Mark Higson. It is clear that Mr Higson and others have been bending over backwards to make it absolutely clear that no decisions have been taken: this is a consultation document. If he said &quot;we are consulting&quot; once, he said it 10 times. So I come to the point raised by my noble friend on the Front Bench. What are we to make of the question and response made at Question Time in the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-04">4 July</phrase>? Sir Menzies Campbell asked:</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/24" class="indent">&quot;Will the Government now abandon their headlong rush towards a new generation of nuclear power stations?&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/25">In a long answer that also covered other things, the Prime Minister said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/26" class="indent">&quot;That is why we have made the decision to continue with nuclear power&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, 4/7/07; col. 954.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/27">It is interesting to note that, absolutely right on cue, a letter has come from Greenpeace addressed to the Prime Minister. It states that this makes the consultation a nonsense, it will need to start all over again, and that although the Government would be prepared to consult widely, they will have to embark on yet a third round of consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/28">We must have an answer from the Minister this afternoon to the question: what do the Government intend to do about that? If we are simply told, &quot;I am sorry. The Prime Minister got it wrong and he shouldn't have said that&quot;, we will understand. Although he had been in his job for more than the five days that he said, nevertheless it was clear that he had not been properly briefed on the issue. Many people would accept that, although I doubt whether Greenpeace will. The noble Lord may find that there will be another case and we need to be told this afternoon what the Government are going to do about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/29">Finally, I return to the issue I raised at Question Time on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-28">28 June</phrase> about the siting of new nuclear power stations. I should make it perfectly clear that I am not asking where these should be, and I accept entirely the thrust of the answer given by the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, in which he made it clear that the Jackson Consulting report was one of several policy documents being fed into the system. Rather, I want to ask about the process that the Government have in mind for deciding these issues. Both last year and this year the Government have made some important announcements about the siting process, and I have a few questions based on statements which have been made. The first appeared in the Energy Review Report of July last year at page 124. The Government promised that they would,</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/30" class="indent">&quot;monitor whether an appropriate market in nuclear sites is developing&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/31">I am aware that Ofgem is worried that somehow it is going to be drawn into the process because there will be arguments about whether there is free and fair competition, and whether those who sit on the present sites, such as the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority and British Energy, will give proper access to them. If there is a conflict of interest, what role will the Government play in helping to resolve it?</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/32">Then there is the question that arises in the nuclear power consultation document published in May this year, when the Government proposed that they would,</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/33" class="indent">&quot;invite nominations for possible sites for new nuclear power stations&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/34">and on,</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/35" class="indent">&quot;restricting build to the vicinity of the existing sites&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/36">Who will be invited to nominate the sites? Would the nominations be limited to the current owners or could another energy company, perhaps a speculative developer, nominate a preferred site? Which other bodies might be able to do that&mdash;the local authority or the regional development agency? Again, I think that the Minister could answer that without in any way anticipating where these sites will be.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/37">Thirdly, in the Energy Review Report last year the Government noted that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/38" class="indent">&quot;There might be other attractive sites, for example, sites with retiring fossil fuel generators&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/39">Many of those are power stations that are going to have to close because of the EU Large Combustion Plant Directive. Will&mdash;or perhaps I should ask, could&mdash;retiring coal power station sites be nominated for new nuclear development under the Government's siting consultation process?</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/40">All these questions are based on statements that the Government have already made. I hope that I can get some answers. When the noble Lord comes to wind up the debate, he will recognise that I do not expect him to give me detailed answers to my questions, but I would very much welcome a general response and perhaps an undertaking to write to me in greater detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.1542.2/41">The Government have embarked on what seems to me at last to be the right road towards what might become a viable energy policy. As I said at the beginning of my speech, it is very welcome that we can expect decisions before the end of this year. We shall want to hold Ministers firmly to account as the decisions which must be taken, are taken.</p>
