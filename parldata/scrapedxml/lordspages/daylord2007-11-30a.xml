<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-30a.1421.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100306" speakername="Lord Howe of Aberavon" colon=":" colnum="1421"  time="010:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71130-0001.htm#07113045000049">
	<p pid="a.1421.0/1">My Lords, the striking feature about the work of the so-called &quot;cross-party&quot; group has from the outset been a search for consensus. &quot;Consensus&quot; is defined in any dictionary as &quot;general agreement&quot; or &quot;comprehensive agreement&quot;. Against that background, we have heard many times from the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, that the search is not just for consensus between the two parties, but also for consensus, as it must be, between the two Houses. When I say that, I do not mean to cast any doubt on the principle of the primacy of the House of Commons. However, that was not the principle that we applied in 1999. A compromise was arrived at and consensus was reached in 1999. It surely must be right to seek consensus taking account of the views of this House. The views of this House must be being expressed&mdash;one wonders, by whom&mdash;in the discussions taking place in the cross-party group.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/2">The only matter that is obstructing the progress of this Bill along the lines supported by the noble Lord, Lord Steel, to whom I pay tribute, and the noble Lord, Lord Lea, is the argument about elected Members or not. I suggest that that need not inhibit the Bill's progress. As to why this is still on the agenda, I must ask three questions. Is there any fault to be corrected by the arrival of elected Members? Is there any improvement to be achieved by the arrival of elected Members? One scours in vain all the documents about this topic that have been published for any evidence to support the answer &quot;yes&quot; to either of those questions. The third question is: what is the reason for any such change? Again, one asks that almost in vain, but one gets an answer; that is, that it is necessary to make this change to deal with the problem of legitimacy. That argument has disappeared since 1999. The reason for the sense of our illegitimacy was the fact that the House had a built-in Tory majority of an overwhelming size. That is why we hesitated ever to use our powers. There is therefore no reason to respond to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/3">There remains the question: why then should we now be contemplating election as an added component? The curious answer is given by the House of Commons Public Administration Select Committee under the chairmanship of Mr Tony Wright, which said that any change that was made should take account of the,</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/4" class="indent">&quot;widespread public disillusionment with our political system&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/5">because of the,</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/6" class="indent">&quot;virtually untrammelled control... by the Executive&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/7">of the elected House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/8">The committee reached two conclusions: first, the need,</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/9" class="indent">&quot;to ensure that the dominance of Parliament by the Executive, including the political Party machines, is reduced not increased&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/10">Secondly, the committee's fifth report says that the second Chamber must be,</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/11" class="indent">&quot;neither rival nor replica, but genuinely complementary to the Commons&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/12">and, therefore,</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/13" class="indent">&quot;as different as possible&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/14">It is hard to see why at any stage in the future&mdash;although we are not at that point yet&mdash;a replica of another elected House, wholly, partially or at all, can be the answer to that problem. The truth is&mdash;and this is the important thing&mdash;that perhaps we have not recognised the extent to which the House has been transformed so that there is no need to go beyond the very clearly defined ground set out in the Bill proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Steel. The reason for saying that was quoted to the House by none less than the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath, when he spoke in the previous debate on this matter on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-19">19 July</phrase>. He said that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/15" class="indent">&quot;this House has performed very well since the major changes made in 1999. We need to build on... the incredibly valuable role of this House as a revising and scrutinising Chamber&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/7/07; col. 396.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/16">That is the present position. The reason given for blocking this Bill&mdash;because a process is still taking place in search of some other consensus&mdash;is unfounded.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/17">The noble Lord, Lord Steel, closed by drawing our attention to what is necessary and added to that by quoting a sentence often quoted by my right honourable friend David Cameron:</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/18" class="indent">&quot;We keep what is good and change what we need to change&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1421.0/19">No evidence is before the House or anywhere else to suggest that this House is other than good. If one asks the question, &quot;What do we need to change?&quot;, the answer is that embraced by the consensus supporting the Bill introduced by the noble Lord, Lord Steel. It is necessary change that will remain necessary as long as the other argument lingers on. I should like to think that those representing any party in this House in deliberations as a cross-party group will represent those arguments in search of a genuine consensus that can be achieved while most of us are still alive.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-30a.1424.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100846" speakername="Lord Tyler" colon=":" colnum="1424"  time="010:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71130-0002.htm#07113045000062">
	<p pid="a.1424.0/1">My Lords, my noble friend Lord Steel has already referred to the unfortunate coincidence that it is today that we are having the memorial service for our late and much-lamented colleague, Tim Garden. I regret that I shall miss some of the speeches in the middle of this debate for that reason.</p>
	<p pid="a.1424.0/2">On these Benches, we welcome the opportunity to discuss the obvious weaknesses and anomalies of the current composition of your Lordships' House. However, I do not consider that this Bill is a realistic basis for a sustainable reform. Indeed, my noble friend has made it abundantly clear that he does not regard it as anything more than a temporary expedient. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-14">14 March</phrase> he did not vote against the substantial majority of Liberal Democrat Peers who supported a fully elected reformed second Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.1424.0/3">Ministers have repeatedly promised us a White Paper in the new year, which will, we hope, give a consistent and comprehensive message about what is to happen next. It will also take advantage of the fact that MPs have voted so conclusively for democratic legitimacy for the second Chamber, as well as of the commitment of all three parties in their election manifestos to the people of this country for such a reform. We believe that the White Paper should be followed immediately by a draft Bill for pre-legislative scrutiny by a Joint Committee of both Houses. That is particularly important because it would avoid the pitfalls of misunderstanding between the two Houses. That was the promise given by the then Lord Chancellor, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer, many months ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.1424.0/4">There may be deeper concerns about sections of my noble friend's Bill. For example, under Clause 8(2) on the Appointments Commission, it may be difficult to fulfil the requirements laid on the commission. Suppose&mdash;heaven forbid&mdash;that a large number of Conservative hereditary Peers are struck down by food poisoning at Royal Ascot, or some other calamity occurs. In the absence of by-elections, would the Appointments Commission then have to redress the balance of parties in this House? What would happen if the membership of the House of Commons changed dramatically at a general election? What would happen if a Cross-Bench Peer went to join a political party? All those are difficulties if the legislation is to be maintained for any length of time; it could be sustainable only for a very few months. My noble friend Lord Steel emphasised that in referring to this as a &quot;transitional House&quot; on a number of previous occasions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1424.0/5">Similarly, on the exclusion of hereditary Peers through by-elections, the original discussions never mentioned the by-elections; they were an afterthought, as my noble friend has already said. In the excellent Library note, it is made clear that the Weatherill amendment never anticipated that there would be a renewal process. There was never going to be a continuation in the long-term of the hereditary element; it was literally going to die out. Of course, the by-elections have been the subject of some ridicule, the most notorious being the one on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-30">30 October 2003</phrase> when there were 11 Labour candidates and only three eligible electors. Imagine what would happen if all the eligible electors suffered some sudden demise. There would be no electors, although no doubt there would be plenty of candidates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1424.0/6">This is only a very temporary expedient and so my noble friend Lord Steel is right to seek to end this anomaly. In his speech at Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-20">20 July</phrase>, to which reference has been made, he pointed out that this was to try to fulfil Mr Asquith's pledge of 1910. The best way to do that is to move swiftly on to consideration of stage two of reform, which is what the Government promised and what all Members have looked forward to, just as my noble friend and everyone else have anticipated since 1999.</p>
	<p pid="a.1424.0/7">In summary, we recognise the value of this Bill as a timely reminder of unfinished business. That business is now urgent and this Bill should not be used by those who are in essence refuseniks to any reform to let the Government off the hook. Is this Bill a stepping stone to a long-promised stage two of comprehensive reform or is it merely an island from which further progress cannot be made? My noble friend Lord Steel clearly believes that it should be only the former. Therefore, he and his fellow promoters of the Bill should make that explicit in Committee by including a sunset clause to time-limit the provisions of the Bill to the first Thursday in May 2009. Incidentally, my noble friend referred to 2010 as the first likely date for an election. I hope that is not the case because it would suggest that the Prime Minister has other things in mind.</p>
	<p pid="a.1424.0/8">If there were such a sunset clause, it would be possible to ensure that this is indeed a transitory and temporary expedient. It would also ensure that the Government would know that they had to get on with implementing the firm decision of the other place, whose decisions all Members of this House believe should retain primacy in our Parliament.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-30a.1426.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100536" speakername="Lord Richard" colon=":" colnum="1426"  time="010:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71130-0002.htm#07113045000073">
	<p pid="a.1426.1/1">My Lords, I know that the noble Lord used the word &quot;incrementalism&quot;, but that does not destroy the point that I was making. The fact is that this Bill is grossly premature. It is inevitably and unpleasantly pre-emptive. The White Paper is forthcoming, as we know. The arguments on composition should take place in that White Paper and not in a Back-Bench Bill introduced into this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426.1/2">I have three points to make against the Bill: the first is that of pre-emption, which I will not labour any further; the second relates to the principles on which the Appointments Commission is supposed to operate; and the third is about the overall context and timing of the Bill. The creation of an Appointments Commission to recommend all new Members&mdash;and the noble Lord, Lord Steel, emphasised that it would do so&mdash;is frankly and obviously inconsistent with the views of the House of Commons. Indeed, it is inconsistent with the Government's policy in favour of a wholly or largely elected second Chamber. It is also inconsistent with the policy of the Opposition and the Liberal Democrats.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426.1/3">We have heard the argument that the commission will be created to recommend only life peerages and that that would not preclude the introduction of another basis of membership; namely, election. I do not accept that: it is not the case. The broad political impact of moving at this stage to a more permanently appointed House would cut across the direction toward an elected second Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426.1/4">More particularly, the detailed provisions of the Bill are based on the assumption of a 100 per cent appointed House. Moreover, several provisions are directly inconsistent with an 80 per cent or 100 per cent elected model. Clause 8 goes some way to setting out rules for the party balance between the Government and the Official Opposition in an appointed House. Clause 8(2)(b) expresses the principle that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1426.1/5" class="indent">&quot;no one party shall have a majority of members in the House&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426.1/6">Clause 8 (2) (c) states that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1426.1/7" class="indent">&quot;the Government of the day shall be entitled to&quot;</p>
	<p pid="a.1426.1/8" class="indent">a majority over the Official Opposition but that this,</p>
	<p pid="a.1426.1/9" class="indent">&quot;shall normally be ... [limited to] ... three per cent of the total membership of the House&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426.1/10">Whatever the merits of the latter proposal, it is plainly inconsistent with a Chamber that is wholly or substantially elected; where the majority of one party over another inevitably cannot be predetermined.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426.1/11">find Clause 8(4) an extraordinary proposition. It would give the Appointments Commission discretion to phase in the majority for the Government over the Opposition over a period of up to eight years. That is extraordinary. If there is to be a change in the relationship between the Government and the Opposition, this House should not take eight years in order to produce it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426.1/12">Finally, this is a point that I really want to emphasise: the Bill grossly underestimates the votes and the implications of the votes in the House of Commons on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-20">20 July</phrase> this year. The Commons, by a large majority, committed itself to a wholly or mainly elected House. If this Bill were passed, it would put the House of Lords on a direct collision course with the House of Commons. I cannot believe that that is what most noble Lords would wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.1426.1/13">One of the main arguments used over the years against elections is that it would confront the House of Commons and that there is a danger of encroachment by the Lords on the powers of competence of the other place. If anything were in that argument, I would have expected that the Commons would have been anxious to guard the competence and the powers of the House of Commons against the possibility of encroachment by the House of Lords. Not a bit of it. What do we have? We have the House of Commons saying&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-30a.1439.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100102" speakername="Lord Campbell of Alloway" colon=":" colnum="1439"  time="011:33:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71130-0004.htm#07113045000146">
	<p pid="a.1439.0/1">My Lords, it is a privilege to follow the noble Lady and I agree with everything that she said. It saves a little time on my speech because she said it better than I could have done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1439.0/2">As has already been said, there is no consensus on the way forward and, at the moment, the Government are seeking that consensus. This Bill was rejected in substance by the Government in the Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-19">19 July</phrase>. It is not a gift horse, other than a Trojan gift: it is but an albatross hanging around the neck of government to pre-empt stage 2 and renege on the Cranborne deal; it hangs around the neck of your Lordships' House as a grievous trespass upon the convention that we shall remain master of our own procedures; and it curtails the exercise of the royal prerogative to grant peerages for life.</p>
	<p pid="a.1439.0/3">In saying that, I do not call into question in any sense the integrity of the noble Lords and Members of the other place who got together to devise and support the Bill. In the wake of this debate, it is suggested that the Bill be withdrawn, pending debate in both Houses on the White Paper, which is in the course of preparation. That was suggested in a document that appeared on my desk yesterday, although I do not know who put it there. It was a briefing on the Bill by a group of Labour parliamentarians and Members. As I said, I do not know how it got there but written at the top were the words, &quot;It may help you&quot;. Well, it does, but they had reasons for the suggestion other than to help me. However, I am with them on the suggestion for the reason given in the briefing and not because they would have said other things. I think that they are right: this is a pre-emptive affair. I totally agree with what has been said by my noble and learned friend Lord Howe and indeed with what was said by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt, the first time around.</p>
	<p pid="a.1439.0/4">The object of this speech is to give notice of my intention to oppose the Question whether Clauses 10 and 11 to 17 shall stand part of the Bill. The tripart intendment of the Bill is flawed. As to Part 1, which has been spoken to by my noble friend Lord Ferrers, there is no provision to determine the balance and size of the House, and no reason has been given as to why the present Appointments Commission could not in fact do what it is proposed the statutory commission should do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1439.0/5">Part 2 reneges on the Cranborne deal, albeit that the criteria for stage 2 reform cannot be met. This is well-trodden ground to be revisited on another occasion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1439.0/6">I turn to Parts 3 and 4. Contrary to the convention, Clauses 11 to 17, which are so drafted that you cannot get at them to amend them in the ordinary way, provide that our domestic procedures shall be ordained by primary legislation. This House has the conventional entitlement under Standing Orders to make provision for permanent leave of absence on or without application; for the deprivation of membership, also on conviction of a serious criminal offence; and to establish a fair regime&mdash;three noble Lords have spoken about that&mdash;for the implementation of both under the aegis of the Privileges Committee, on which, so far as I am aware, there is no reason why the four Law Lords should not be enabled to sit. My time is up.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-30a.1448.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100374" speakername="Lord Lipsey" colon=":" colnum="1448"  time="012:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71130-0005.htm#07113045000194">
	<p pid="a.1448.0/1">My Lords, I crave the indulgence of the House for my voice, which at least means that I will be brief.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448.0/2">Fortunately, reforming this place is difficult. I say &quot;fortunately&quot; with a pang of regret, because I would like to change this House in many ways to make it more effective. The only way in which I do not want to change it is by introducing election. Although a reformer at heart, I do not think it is wise to rush into reform or to take it in giant bites without seeing what are its consequences as we go.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448.0/3">In particular, I cannot think that it is wise to base the case for reform on a single vote&mdash;a pretty confused vote, too&mdash;in the House of Commons as if that were the end of the story. For one thing, the electoral system under which the House of Commons is chosen is very flawed. Two MPs in three got fewer than half of the votes in their constituencies. That is some mandate. Although I believe in the primacy of the Commons, I do not believe in the dictatorship of the Commons or that we should be cowed by that single vote.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448.0/4">Just how difficult reform is was spelt out to some Members of your Lordships' House by Dr Meg Russell of the Constitution Unit when she addressed the Leader's seminar on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-13">13 November</phrase>. Dr Russell is a former adviser to the late Robin Cook. She has long been a fervent and articulate advocate of election to this place, albeit that some of us detect that she is not as fervent as once she was. Looking to the future of reform, she asked the gathering, &quot;What can really honestly be achieved?&quot;. Her answer was, &quot;I am a lot less convinced than I used to be that large-scale reform is possible. If Robin Cook couldn't do it, with his brain, what hope is there for anyone else?&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448.0/5">This is what makes the Government's position on the Bill&mdash;public neutrality, private hostility&mdash;so infuriating. Behind it stands Jack Straw, the Minister responsible in another place. It will be 40 years next year since I first met Mr Straw, when he and I were summoned by the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, to meet the then Home Secretary Lord Callaghan and to tell him what young people thought. Unlike me, Mr Straw has myriad great achievements behind him&mdash;he is a man whom I applaud&mdash;but if he has a flaw, it is that there is about him something of the student politician yet. Let us face it, he is against the Bill for one reason only; he thinks that if he gets rid of the obvious flaws in this House, his chances of getting it elected will be weakened.</p>
	<p pid="a.1448.0/6">As I said, I do not think that election is a good thing. If, however, like Mr Straw today, not Mr Straw two years ago when he took a quite contrary view, I did think that election was a good thing, I hope that as I lower myself into the bath each morning I will remember the old saw quoted by the noble Lord, Lord Howarth of Newport: &quot;Do not let the best become the enemy of the good&quot;.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-30a.1464.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100081" speakername="Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe" colon=":" colnum="1464"  time="013:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71130-0007.htm#07113045000269">
	<p pid="a.1464.0/1">My Lords, I thank the noble Lord, Lord Steel of Aikwood, for giving us the opportunity for further debate on House of Lords reform. However, like some of the previous speakers, I do not welcome the Bill at this juncture. There is an awful lot in it that is needed and on which there is genuine consensus in Parliament, including in this House, but there are other points on which there are quite deep divisions between both Houses and, indeed, within this House. Those cannot be ignored. Nor can we ignore the underlying change in voting patterns in the Commons over the past 10 years. I would like to hear evidence from anyone that there are indications that it will change and go in the opposite direction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1464.0/2">Incidentally, I congratulate whoever was responsible for briefing the <I>Sunday Times</I> last weekend on the Bill's intentions. It was a masterly piece of spin which elevated, on Lord Steel's own admission, the smallest part of the Bill, Part 4, while mainly masking the fundamental objective behind it. Here I share the argument expressed by my noble friend Lord Richard that basically it is about the entrenchment and legitimisation of a 100 per cent appointed House of Lords. Perhaps whoever was responsible for arranging that briefing might care to assist my party with its media difficulties.</p>
	<p pid="a.1464.0/3">In my opinion and that of many previous speakers this Bill seeks to pre-empt the business of the Government and their forthcoming White Paper on the reform of the House of Lords with the introduction of elections. Instead it pursues an outcome which is opposed by the public in most opinion polls and is opposed overwhelmingly by their elected representatives in the other place. While many Peers on these Benches may support a 100 per cent appointed House, such a policy would be totally rejected by my party. It would fly in the face of all that we have stood for historically&mdash;the extension of democracy and the greater involvement, access and participation of the people of this country in the government of this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1464.0/4">What I found surprising in the <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-20">20 July</phrase> debate was how little regard was paid to the Commons votes for 80 or 100 per cent elections, although there was more mention of that today. It is true that some people have argued that there was tactical voting. But not one Peer&mdash;I underline this&mdash;either then or today mentioned that MPs had voted 375 to 196 against a 100 per cent appointed House. There has been no mention of any tactical voting in that vote. I do not believe that there was. I believe that was a true reflection of the feeling at the other end. Therefore, my first question to the noble Lord, Lord Steel&mdash;I pick up some of the points that the noble Lord, Lord James, has just made&mdash;is, in the light of that vote, how does he believe that the Bill could conceivably be carried in the Commons? I take it for granted, of course, that it will be carried here. Does he believe that at some stage the Government will accept and support his Bill, even without amendments to provide for an elected Chamber? I would be grateful if my noble friend the Minister would make an observation on that and endeavour to define what neutrality means in this context.</p>
	<p pid="a.1464.0/5">My fear is that the way this Bill is being propelled will bring us into direct conflict with the Commons. There are already portents for conflict with the Government. I hope that I am wrong and I look to the noble Lord, Lord Steel, for reassurances that I am misreading the position. The best reassurance I could get from him would be confirmation that, ultimately, he and his supporters will respect the supremacy of the other place on a Bill on House of Lords reform which introduces elections to this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.1464.0/6">The noble and learned Lord, Lord Howe of Aberavon, referred to the consensus reached in 1999 and feels and hopes that we may be able to get there. He, of course, was not here then. But for those of us who were, at least on these Benches, it felt more like blackmail than consensus being reached at that stage when we were forced into a compromise that on these Benches we were very unhappy about. That consensus, or compromise&mdash;or whatever it might be called&mdash;was achieved through open threats that Peers were prepared to disrupt and derail the Government's legislative programme.</p>
	<p pid="a.1464.0/7">I have heard talk that if we are unable to get consensus some Peers, if faced with a move towards election, will take on board the idea that was used in 1999 and could endeavour to derail legislative business to oppose the change to elections. I hope that I am wrong and that the noble Lord, Lord Steel, and his colleagues will give me full assurances that such an incident is not likely to be repeated this time round.</p>
