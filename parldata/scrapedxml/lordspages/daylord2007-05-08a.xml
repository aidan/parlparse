<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1257.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="1257"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0001.htm#0705081000022">
	<p pid="a.1257.2/1">My Lords, I rise to pay tribute to Lord Weatherill. Bruce Bernard Weatherill, known to all as Jack, made his mark on public life as Speaker of the House of Commons. He reached a far wider audience than his predecessors because his tenure as Speaker from 1983 to 1992 coincided with the introduction of television cameras to the Commons Chamber. He became known to millions for his interventions during Prime Minister's Questions. In Parliament he was known for his belief in making government accountable and in making Parliament matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1257.2/2">Lord Weatherill was born in Guildford. His father owned a Savile Row tailoring business and it was into this trade that he was apprenticed aged 17 after completing his education at Malvern College. He remained involved in the family business throughout his life. Commissioned in 1940, he served as a Bengal Lancer during the Second World War. He referred to this period as &quot;formative years&quot; and many of his experiences clearly had a lifelong impact. He was proficient in Urdu, became vegetarian after seeing famine in Bengal and practised meditation. He maintained an interest in the region throughout his life. Noble Lords may recall his interventions in this House on the subjects of the Kashmir earthquake and the readmission of Pakistan to the Commonwealth.</p>
	<p pid="a.1257.2/3">After the war he focused on the family business. In 1964 he won election as the Conservative candidate for the seat of Croydon North-East. He retained his seat until 1992, standing as in independent candidate in 1987 after he had become Speaker of the House of Commons. He served as a Whip in opposition and, in government, as Deputy Chief Whip. He was elected as the 154th Speaker of the House of Commons in 1983. His years of service were marked by a desire to encourage the free flow of debate and the expression of all opinions. He championed the role of Back-Benchers and his tenure as Speaker was sometimesan uncomfortable period for the Government of the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.1257.2/4">Lord Weatherill also made a significant contribution to this House. He was raised to the peerage in 1992 and from 1995 to 1999 served as Convenor of the Cross Benches. From the beginning he commanded tremendous respect from all sides of the House. He was a Convenor at a critical time in the development of the role of the Cross Benches and was always helpful and absolutely fair in his dealings, ensuring that the interests of the Cross Benches were well represented in the usual channels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1257.2/5">Lord Weatherill was always modest about the role he played during the passage of the House of Lords reform Act of 1999, but this House will not forget it. It was in large part due to him that an agreement was reached which allowed the Bill to pass. He used his skills to considerable effect at what was an extremely challenging time for this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1257.2/6">It is difficult to do justice to a life characterised by such a broad range of interests and experiences. Lord Weatherill will be remembered as a remarkable man; respected by all and missed by many. He is survived by his wife Lyn, their three children and seven grandchildren. I am sure that all sides of the House will wish to join me in sending our condolences to Lord Weatherill's family and friends.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1258.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100621" speakername="Lord Strathclyde" colon=":" colnum="1258"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0001.htm#0705081000028">
	<p pid="a.1258.0/1">My Lords, I agree wholeheartedly with the Leader of the House in everything that she said about the late Lord Weatherill, whose death has saddened the whole House. We on this side, who were proud that he was a Conservative, deeply share her expressions of sympathy for Lady Weatherill and the family. They have lost much, but they will know that they were also given much, as was every one of us.</p>
	<p pid="a.1258.0/2">Jack Weatherill was a rare figure; someone who had, as Speaker of the Commons, been for millions the embodiment of that House but who, in coming here and being chosen as Convenor of the Cross-Bench Peers at such a critical time in their history, became part of the fabric of this House also. Those of us who saw him well into his 80s, with that crisp, swift, upright walk along the corridors, could have had no doubt that he was a military man in younger days&mdash;a cavalryman, indeed, who saw service in India and retained not only his love of horses from those days but some of his habits of life; his vegetarianism, for example, and his practice of meditation. As a horseman, it was apt that he personally sewed the riding breeches used by the king and queen at the Trooping, and it was no accident that the Royal Warrant was given to his firm.</p>
	<p pid="a.1258.0/3">It is as a true parliamentarian&mdash;someone concerned for, and about, the standing of Parliament inside and outside these walls and for his great and dedicated service to Parliament&mdash;that Lord Weatherill will be remembered. It has been widely commented that he was the Speaker who encouraged, over the heads of many doubters, the introduction of television to the other place&mdash;a House, incidentally, that was so much more reluctant to innovate than this House was at the time. That introduction was to the good of Parliament, as was so much that he did. He was rough only with Ministers who preferred the &quot;Today&quot; studio to the House for their announcements. One of today's obituaries calls him, rightly, a great Speaker. He was famously independent, not always to the delight of the Government, but he won the trust and affection of all Members; his ready wit and light humour were always there to defuse any situation that might risk getting out of hand. He opened up the Speaker's House to all Members and to their families, and he took pride in the fact that at least once in every Parliament an MP and his wife would have been to dine.</p>
	<p pid="a.1258.0/4">When Lord Weatherill came to this House, he was Convenor of the Cross Benches at a time whena government Bill threatened the removal of 226 Cross-Bench Peers, nearly two-thirds of the then strength of those Benches, which are so vital to the character of this House. As the noble Baroness has outlined, Lord Weatherill played a major role in the compromise that led to the eventual House of Lords Act, moving the Weatherill amendment that shaped that legislation and saw the present House created with massive majorities in both Houses. Out of conflict he helped bring compromise and a House whose performance and independence since 1999 should surely have gladdened him who helped to mould it so much.</p>
	<p pid="a.1258.0/5">For all his great offices and achievements, Jack Weatherill always retained a great humility, symbolised by the famous thimble that he carried to remind him of his origins. For his epitaph, he wanted simply this: that he always kept his word. That he did; and with that word he kept a trust, a faith and a dignity that all of us who knew him will sorely miss.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1259.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100408" speakername="Lord McNally" colon=":" colnum="1259"  time="014:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0001.htm#0705081000033">
	<p pid="a.1259.0/1">My Lords, since the Lord President and the Leader of the Opposition have not mentioned it, I start my tribute with the story that Lord Weatherill told so often against himself. He used to say that when he was elected in 1964 as a young Conservative Back-Bencher, he found himself in the gents' toilets down the other end of the Corridor and heard two of the Conservative knights of the shire talking. One said to the other, &quot;I think this place is going to the dogs. My tailor is in here now&quot;. He loved to tell that story.</p>
	<p pid="a.1259.0/2">As the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, has said, it would be difficult not to see Lord Weatherill as both a tailor and a solider: dapper, crisp and well dressed. He was a skilled Deputy Chief Whip. Indeed, he has one of the few battle honours that any Opposition Whip could have: he brought down a Government, as the pairing Whip during the 1979 Government. As has been said, he was a respected chairman of Ways and Means, and an even more respected Speaker&mdash;our first TV Speaker. The fact that he was able to move from a background as a Whip to Convenor of the Cross Benches is also a clue to his character. He had a personal integrity that allowed him to be at certain times partisan and at other times absolutely neutral.I once attended a dinner at the Pakistan High Commission when he was there, and was impressed by his affection for and deep knowledge of the subcontinent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1259.0/3">I was never in favour of the Weatherill amendment, but admired the skill with which he played poker with the Government of the day. They blinked first. Apart from the epitaph given him by the noble Lord, Lord Strathclyde, it can truly be said of him, &quot;If you seek his memorial, look about you&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1259.0/4">Lord Weatherill was a parliamentarian who had affection and respect at both ends of the Corridor. We on these Benches share the sense of loss that his family must feel at this moment, and send them our deep condolences.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1260.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100689" speakername="Lord Williamson of Horton" colon=":" colnum="1260"  time="014:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0001.htm#0705081000037">
	<p pid="a.1260.0/1">My Lords, the death of Bernard Weatherill&mdash;always Jack Weatherill to his friends here&mdash;is a sad occasion for the whole House. I express my sympathy, as others have, to Lyn and his children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1260.0/2">Today is a particularly sad day for the Cross-Benchers, because Jack Weatherill was a most distinguished and respected member of the Cross-Bench group. Herein Parliament we think of him as a remarkable parliamentarian, embodying for me the spirit of our democratic Parliament; as a Member of the House of Commons, one of the most distinguished Speakers and a national figure in that office; and as a real star in this House. We on the Cross Benches also like to remember how he was always willing to share his knowledge and experience. He was invariably helpful, often humorous and a source of much wisdom.</p>
	<p pid="a.1260.0/3">I had many contacts with Jack Weatherill myself, in particular because he was one of my predecessors as Convenor of the Cross Benches, from 1995 to 1999. He was a true independent Member and an independent spirit here, as we saw with his role in the last reform of the membership of the House. I learned a lot from him, and can honestly say that I never once failed to enjoy our meetings and discussions. He gave of his experience not only in this House but also more widely, in the organisations and charities that he supported. I particularly remember the Industry and Parliament Trust which he chaired for nine years and supported very effectively, reflecting both his affection for Parliament and his links with commerce and industry&mdash;particularly small businesses, since he was not only a great parliamentarian but also, from experience before he entered politics, the best tailor in the House. His interests extended far beyond our shores. He held office in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association for many years and had lots of contacts with Parliament, Government and people, particularly in the Indian subcontinent and other countries with close links to the United Kingdom. We shall miss Jack Weatherill very deeply. Parliament has lost a great servant.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1260.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100384" speakername="The Lord Bishop of London" colon=":" colnum="1260"  time="014:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0001.htm#0705081000040">
	<p pid="a.1260.1/1">My Lords, on behalf of these Benches, I add our condolences to those of other noble Lords who have spoken. We have the title &quot;Lords Spiritual&quot;, but Jack Weatherill was one of the Lords Spiritual in reality. We have heard about the integrity of his life and the thimble of humility; he was a genuinely spiritual person. In addition to the services to Parliament, about which Peers with better right to speak have referred, he cared for the coherence of the whole of society. I think of his work on the Speaker's Commission on Citizenship, for example, which gave birth to the Institute of Citizenship Studies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1260.1/2">He saw his own contribution to the story in the light of the continuous story of the generations. He looked back to some of the past great Speakers of the past; he located himself in a continuing story and saw himself as making a contribution to something in which we all have a share. The Speakership was almost a perfect expression of his gifts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1260.1/3">He was conspicuously fair and inclusive. It was typical of Lord Weatherill that he was the patron of the Three Faiths Forum, and its members were all keen to share him as their own. I remember vividly him describing the first time that he was under fire, not politically but in that period to which the Lord President has referred&mdash;the Second World War. He was in a vehicle, the bullets were buzzing around him and it was being driven by a Sikh. The Sikh turned round to him and said, &quot;Put your trust in God, sahib, he's a very reliable fella&quot;. So we believe, but so, more importantly, Jack Weatherill lived.</p>

	<p pid="a.1261.0/1">My Lords, my first encounter with Jack Weatherill was when he was chairman of Ways and Means in the other place. I had just been made a chairman of a Standing Committee there. I was very wet behind the ears. My first big committee meeting was a housing committee. At a Division, I thought that all the Members were there, I calledfor the doors to be locked and for the Division to take place. I had locked out the Opposition Whip and the Opposition Front Bench Member dealing with the Bill. A hullabaloo broke out. It was a Thursday morning and I spent a terrible weekend because I knew that I was being reported to the chairman of Ways and Means, whom I did not really know. On Monday morning, I went into Jack Weatherill's office to see him and confess all, believing that my days of chairmanship were well and truly over. I opened the door and he came in and said, &quot;come along, Betty, come and sit down. I don't care what you've done, but I am totally in support of you. I am on your side&quot;. Throughout the years that I worked with Jack Weatherill, that was his attitude to all those who worked with him. He was totally loyal, committed and supportive. He was my dear friend and mentor. I shall miss him very much indeed.</p>

Although we have the Commonwealth Day service in Westminster Abbey, there seems to be a lack of enthusiasm about distributing information about the Commonwealth to schools. This country's place in the Commonwealth network is vital for our future position and prosperity, so will the Minister urge her colleagues and the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to give far more emphasis to the future importance of the Commonwealth, which contains some of the richest and most advanced countries in the world and whose development is crucial to the stability of the whole planet?</p>

	<p pid="a.1267.2/1">My Lords, first, I pay tribute to my noble friend's work in this area to ensure that a range of fair trade products are available in the Houses of Parliament, including your Lordships' House. I also thank him for his work in international development. I certainly agree with his sentiments about supporting people in developing countries. As he will know, between 2002 and 2007, DfID has given more than&pound;1 million of support to the Fairtrade Foundation, and the UK is in the lead in the fair trade movement. It is very welcome that, between 2005 and 2006, UK fair trade sales increased by about 50 per cent with sales now estimated at about &pound;300 million. That is benefiting 368 producer groups from Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia who are selling to the UK market. We would like to see that success replicated across the globe.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1273.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="1273"  time="015:25:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0003.htm#0705081000127">
	<p pid="a.1273.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord who, as he has indicated, returns to an issue that we debated in Committee. The amendments would work in a way in which we would end up with a hybrid between the present Legal Services Complaints Commissioner and the proposal in the Bill in relation to the LSB and the improved regulators. Having looked again at the provisions in the Bill, as I said I would do, I believe that we have satisfactory arrangements to make sure that the board has the appropriate range of controls over the OLC.</p>
	<p pid="a.1273.0/2">I will demonstrate this in six key ways. First are the overall arrangements in Part 6 which provide for the OLC to operate through a series of rules which, in Clause 152, must receive the consent of the LSB before they can take affect. The LSB will have complete oversight of the way in which the OLC's rules are framed and, provided they are adhered to, how the OLC operates. Additionally, in Clause 153, the board may amend or modify any of those rules if it considers that they are deficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.1273.0/3">Secondly, in Clause 115, the OLC is accountable through its annual report to the LSB, which must deal with any matter that the board has directed. For example, they may have to show how they have dealt with the speed with which complaints are resolved. Of course, the OLC has a separate annual report to the LSB because it has a distinct function and its status is as a distinct non-departmental public body. The LSB will present both its annual report and the OLC's annual report to the Secretary of State, who will lay them before Parliament. This will reflect the fact that the OLC reports to the LSB.</p>
	<p pid="a.1273.0/4">Thirdly, Clause 117 allows the board to require the Office for Legal Complaints to prepare a report on any matter relating to its functions. This might include, for example, a strategic plan for how it proposes to remedy a particular failure to meet a performance target. Fourthly, the power to set performance targets in Clause 118 allows the board to impose conditions on how those targets are met and, crucially, to monitor performance against targets. This will allow the LSB to monitor systematically how complaints are being handled.</p>
	<p pid="a.1273.0/5">Fifthly, the LSB's ultimate power in relation to the Office for Legal Complaints is at Schedule 15(8)(b). As the noble Lord has said, this allows the board the power to remove members of the OLC. The noble Lord described this as, perhaps, a &quot;sledgehammer to crack a nut&quot;, but it is important as the ultimate power, only to be used on members of the OLC where there is obviously a significant failure in the discharge of their duties. Finally, in addition to the above statutory powers, as a non-departmental public body, the Office for Legal Complaints will be accountable to Parliament for the efficient use of resources and the discharge of its statutory responsibilities in a way that the current complaints-handling and regulatory bodies are not.</p>
	<p pid="a.1273.0/6">We consider that, taken together, these six key points provide an appropriate and effective control over the Office for Legal Complaints and the way it operates, intentionally different from those the board has in relation to approved regulators, designed specifically to govern the relationship between two distinct non-departmental public bodies with different functions, but with the OLC being subordinate to the LSB. On that basis, I hope the noble Lord can withdraw his amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1275.3/1">My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 353, 355, 357 to 360, 379 and 380, 382, 394 and 395, 402 to 404, 427, 434 and 446. This group of amendments, aimed at further protecting the consumers of legal services, responds to amendments debated in Committee which I agreed to take away and consider. While some are minor and clarificatory, I hope noble Lords will agree that others are of real substance and will improve the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1275.3/2">Amendments Nos. 352 and 353 respond to amendments helpfully moved by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, in Committee. They will require scheme rules to make provision permitting specified persons to continue a complaint following the death or incapacitation of the original complainant. This means that the Office for Legal Complaints must give proper consideration to, and consult on, which persons should be allowed to continue a complaint. Complainants and their relatives or representatives will be certain whether and when they are eligible to continue a complaint.</p>
	<p pid="a.1275.3/3">Amendment No. 355 arises out of helpful points made in Committee by my noble friend Lord Whitty clarifying the limits on the power of the Office for Legal Complaints to award costs against a party in favour of the OLC. As I said in Committee, it is important to strike a balance between allowing on the one hand the Office for Legal Complaints to be able to call to account complainants who, although they may have a genuine complaint, add disproportionately to the costs of determining it by utterly unreasonable behaviour, and preventing members of the legal profession from abusing this provision by deterring well founded complaints by suggesting that the complainant might have to contribute to the costs. We think that the wording of this amendment will produce the right balance. Noble Lords agreed in Committee that it is enormously important that the ombudsman scheme should not deter in any way genuine complainants from complaining, and therefore this amendment sets a high threshold for the award of costs against a complainant.</p>
	<p pid="a.1275.3/4">Amendments Nos. 357, 358, 359 and 360 make it clear who can exercise the power of summary dismissal of a complaint. I agreed with the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, on the fifth day in Committee that this should be a power exercisable only by an ombudsman, and the wording has been reconsidered with a view to making it entirely clear.</p>
	<p pid="a.1275.3/5">Amendments Nos. 379, 380 and 382 have been drafted in response to amendments tabled earlier by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and my noble friend Lord Whitty. In those circumstances, which we expect to be rare, where a respondent fails or refuses to comply with an ombudsman's determination, these amendments will give ombudsmen the power to take enforcement action in relation to that determination on a complainant's behalf, and we will set out the exact details in the scheme rules. These amendments therefore provide additional protection for vulnerable people who might not wish or know how to seek a court order themselves. Individuals may of course take action themselves, if they so wish, without the ombudsman's assistance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1275.3/6">Amendments Nos. 394, 395 and 446 address concerns expressed in Committee by my noble friend Lady Henig, who is not in her place today. They enable approved regulators to respond quickly and effectively in cases of widespread wrongdoing, where potentially large numbers of consumers may be affected, but they may not know that they have a complaint or, indeed, the procedure for complaining. In circumstances where an approved regulator suspects widespread wrongdoing, these amendments will ensure that approved regulators can require authorised persons to investigate their files, and if they find signs of potential wrongdoing, alert the consumer and initiate the internal complaints process. Because of the importance of maintaining a clear role for the Office for Legal Complaints in providing redress, the amendments I have tabled do not allow approved regulators to award redress or require authorised persons to pay redress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1275.3/7">Amendments Nos. 402 to 404, 427 and 434 again are tabled in response to persuasive arguments made in Committee by my noble friend Lord Whitty and others who have rightly identified that it is important for the OLC to have the power to administer a voluntary complaints handling scheme. The amendments will therefore give the Office for Legal Complaints the necessary powers to establish a voluntary scheme, subject to and within such boundaries as may be set by an enabling order made by the Lord Chancellor on the recommendation of the OLC or the LSB. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.1277.3/1">My Lords, I will speak also to the remaining amendments in the group. The most important reason for supporting the amendment, and those that flow from it, is one of principle. Those exonerated following investigation or litigation should not be penalised for being found blameless. Accordingly, to require an authorised person under the Bill to pay the Office of Legal Complaints for the costs of handling a complaint when the complaint is unfounded and the person has handled the matter properly in house would be wholly unjust.</p>
	<p pid="a.1277.3/2">It would also have the effect of deterring practitioners from acting in those fields of law where unjustified complaints are disproportionately likely such as in the areas of criminal and family law. In any case, since it will not be the Government or the OLC but the authorised persons in general who will have to pay instead through the general levy, neither the Government nor the OLC have any financial interest in sustaining the scheme set out in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1277.3/3">The Bill's provisions are founded on the approach adopted by the financial ombudsman scheme. There, financial service providers are required to pay charges in respect of the handling of a complaint whatever its outcome. The Government believe that the OLC should be free to adopt the same approach; but the circumstances of the provision of legal services are different from the provision of financial services. Unfounded complaints, for example, from those who have lost a court case or whose house purchase has fallen through, are far more likely than in financial services. Furthermore, some practitioners are disproportionately likely, as I have indicated, to be the subject of such complaints. We think it is imperative that the administrative convenience of the OLC is not allowed to cause the clear injustice to lawyers of having to pay costs even where a complaint is not upheld and where their in-house handling of the complaint has been exemplary.</p>
	<p pid="a.1277.3/4">Yet if the OLC has an unrestricted power to charge, it is likely to opt for a case-handling fee inall circumstances simply because that would be administratively more convenient to operate. I would add parenthetically and, I hope, reassuringly that of course we accept that the power to order authorised persons to pay charges cannot sensibly be confined only to cases where the complaint is upheld after a determination by an ombudsman. The likelihoodis that the great majority of complaints will be conciliated in one way or another. It would not be satisfactory if authorised persons could avoid any liability to pay simply by settling the matter shortly before a determination would have to be made.</p>
	<p pid="a.1277.3/5">Our amendment would also have the added attraction of encouraging practitioners to operate proper in-house complaints resolution systems. Failure to operate proper in-house procedures damages one of the Bill's key objectives; namely, ensuring that complaints can be resolved as rapidly as possible. Leaving all matters to be sorted out by the OLC is unsatisfactory from the perspective of complainants and involves putting an additional burden on the OLC. There is no reason why the profession collectively, rather than the practitioner who has failed to deal properly with the matter in-house, should bear the cost of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1277.3/6">In conclusion, it is important for the Bill to set out the limits of the OLC's discretion to impose charges. It would be quite wrong to put administrative simplicity ahead of the need to avoid causing injustice to those authorised persons who are the subject of unfounded complaints. I need add nothing to what I have said about the Minister's proposition that complaints that have got as far as the OLC must be partially justified. That assertion was effectively demolished in Committee. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.1278.0/1">My Lords, I support the amendments as being of principle, for the reasons given by my noble friend. There is not, and never has been, any entitlement to costs. An award of costs is entirely a question of discretion. In this case, with the ombudsman or the OLC, it is an exercise of quasi-judicial discretion. There is no entitlement; there never has been. The exercise of quasi-judicial discretion imposed by a mandatory costs order under primary legislation is anathema; it is ill-conceived and outrageously unfair.</p>
	<p pid="a.1278.0/2">The exercise of such discretion, whether judicial or quasi-judicial, takes due and fair account of factors relevant to the case. I never cite cases here, but there was one in which I won in the Privy Council against my erstwhile noble friend, the late Lord Ripon, in which I did not get my costs. There was another in your Lordships' Appellant Committee, in which I lost and I did not have to pay any costs. The details do not matter&mdash;they are all recorded in the law reports&mdash;but what matters is the principle on which the court or the tribunal makes a fair decision.</p>
	<p pid="a.1278.0/3">Is it really the business of Government to impose a costs order upon a lawyer who has committed no misconduct because he or she happens to have rendered legal services? How on earth did this happen? Well, you start off by calling the lawyer a &quot;polluter&quot;. You take a spin for a placebo to feather, perhaps, the legacy nest. You conjure up in your mind a puppet show on the seaside in the old days: consumer with a truncheon clobbers bewigged polluter, and everyone screams with enjoyment. Why on earth were the recommendations of the Joint Committee, on which I had the privilege to serve, rejected? I would like that question to be answered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1278.0/4">Why cannot the Clementi soft touch be found in the Bill? My noble and learned friend Lord Mackay of Clashfern mentioned this the other day, albeit in another context. Why was it ignored?</p>
	<p pid="a.1278.0/5">I have another question which is relevant for answer. Is it the business of government to usurp this quasi judicial function as to costs? For the reasons given by my noble friend, which I have sought to supplement, I suggest that there is no justification for that whatever.</p>

	<p pid="a.1280.3/1">My Lords, may I ask one further specific question?

If she can, will she specify it?</p>

	<p pid="a.1281.1/1">Indeed, my Lords, but I like to give the noble Lord credit where credit is due for at least some denting.</p>
	<p pid="a.1281.1/2">I looked very carefully at these issues, because I hope that noble Lords accept that it is my wont, certainly in Committee, to listen very carefully to what is being said. The only issue that divides us on the amendment is whether we define in the Bill at this point how a charging regime might operate, or whether we leave that to the Office for Legal Complaints, which must do it in consultation with the approved regulators, with the consent of the Legal Services Board and of the Lord Chancellor and in line with the regulatory objectives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1281.1/3">The Government's position is that the latter route is more appropriate in seeking to set out in the Bill how it would happen, not least because it allows for flexibility and it ensures that the charging system can change and adapt over time based on the sort of experience and good practice that noble Lords would wish to see the OLC consider. I know that noble Lords are worried and concerned about how the Office for Legal Complaints would exercise that flexibility, but I emphasise that the flexibility does not happen in an unconstrained way. In drawing up its rules, the Office for Legal Complaints must have regard to the regulatory objectives, including the public interest, and to the ombudsman scheme best practice, which is in Clause 113. It is also under a duty to consult on the content of the rules, which is in Clause 195.</p>
	<p pid="a.1281.1/4">The Legal Services Board will have to give its consent to the rules under Clause 152 and, in doing so, must have regard to the regulatory objectives we have debated at length. The consent of the Lord Chancellor is required under Clause 152 and, taken together, we expect the oversight of both the Legal Services Board and the Lord Chancellor to be an important check, if needed, on how the Office for Legal Complaints drafts the rules to ensure that they are fair and proportionate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1281.1/5">I could add that the Office for Legal Complaints and, indeed, the Legal Services Board are responsible to Parliament for the operation of the scheme, including the system of case fees. They will have to produce the annual report and, if need be, appear before&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1281.3/1">My Lords, if the noble Lord will let me continue, I will deal with that point.</p>
	<p pid="a.1281.3/2">As I was saying, the OLC can also be required to appear before a parliamentary Select Committee to give evidence on the operation of the scheme. Ultimately, the decision of both bodies which set out the rules is judicially reviewable on the usual grounds. So my first proposition is that the constraints ensuring that the system of case fees operates fairly are in place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1281.3/3">We come to the proposition, which I have seen in briefing material for today's debate, that Clause 133 is manifestly unfair. I could not disagree more. Nowhere does Clause 133 say that a flat fee will apply for every complaint the OLC receives. Nowhere does it say that every lawyer will have to pay the same rate of charge. Nowhere does it say that the lawyers will pay the charge even if the complainant is vexatious or frivolous. It says that the scheme rules will set out how charges against lawyers are to operate. I have been through this in great detail because I was much taken with our debate in Committee. The implication of many speeches in your Lordships' House has been that we were setting out a system under whichevery lawyer has to pay regardless. Nowhere does Clause 133 say that. It says that the scheme rules will have to set this out. As to whether it is human-rights compliant, I am the human rights Minister: it is my job to ensure, certainly within my own department, that it is compliant. It is.</p>
	<p pid="a.1281.3/4">The critical point is that the clause does not say what has been implied, and there is therefore an unfounded concern in your Lordships' House. It is possible that the OLC, having considered representations made&mdash;and having read the deliberations of your Lordships' House&mdash;will decide that it would be unfair to charge a fee for complaints that are not upheld. There are other circumstances&mdash;as noble Lords have indicated at Second Reading and in Committee, and repeated today&mdash;where it might also be deemed unfair to charge a fee. My argument is simple: the Office for Legal Complaints should take a view on the circumstances in which fees should and should not apply, based on appropriate oversight and the consultation required under the clauses I have indicated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1281.3/5">We cannot argue that the rules are unfair, because they have not been made. Nothing in the Bill suggests that there must be a blanket charge for any lawyer, whether or not they have fulfilled their obligations under an in-house complaints system, or have been taken to the Office for Legal Complaints in a vexatious way. Quite the opposite: the Office for Legal Complaints must draw up rules and, in doing so, consult the professions and the Legal Services Board, and consult and deal with the noble and learned Lord the Lord Chancellor. There are currently no rules, and it is important that we let the Office for Legal Complaints design the rules within the process and constraints I have identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.1281.3/6">On the case-handling fee being disproportionately high, nowhere in Parts 6 or 7 does the Bill say what the split will be between the levy and charges. Nowhere does it give any indication of how that will be calculated. Parts 6 and 7 say that the Legal Services Board and the Office for Legal Complaints should decide what the split should be between the levy and the charges under Clause 133. In the absence of their having made that decision, we cannot speculate on what the case handling fee would be. The truth is that until they have decided we will not know what the split will be. Until the OLC has had its rules approved we will not know what the case handling fee is.</p>
	<p pid="a.1281.3/7">In conclusion, I am arguing for flexibility; let the Office for Legal Complaints make the decisions within its constraints. It will take into account not only your Lordships' words, but also its consultation with the professions. On that basis and with my assurances, noble Lords will see that there is nothing in Clause 133 that says that any lawyer has to pay regardless. It says that there should be rules that set out the circumstances in which lawyers should pay or not pay.</p>

	<p pid="a.1283.1/1">My Lords, throughout this legislation we have debated the issues of fairness, proportionality and the regulatory objectives. I completely understand the concerns that have been raised. Having looked at the Bill, it is my view that those issues with which noble Lords are concerned are inherent within it in the context of people behaving in a proportionate and fair manner. That is a critically important part of the way that the OLC would operate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1283.1/2">The issue before us is that there is nothing in the Bill that does what noble Lords fear. There is everything in the Bill that says that the OLC must make rules and identify those who should pay and not pay. I understand noble Lords' concerns that those that have been brought in a vexatious way should have that recognised by the OLC and I agree with them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1288.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100352" speakername="Lord Kingsland" colon=":" colnum="1288"  time="016:19:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0005.htm#07050816000027">
	<p pid="a.1288.1/1">My Lords, Amendments Nos. 383, 392 and 393 provide for the delegation of complaints handling to an approved regulator by a direction of the Legal Services Board. Where such a direction is given, the approved regulator would be empowered to award redress to the complainant, which Clause 154 currently prohibits. The Legal Services Board would have power subsequently to vary or withdraw a direction. In deciding whether to give, vary or withdraw a direction, the Legal Services Board would be bound by Clause 3 to act compatibly with the regulatory objectives and the other regulatory principles of the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1288.1/2">Part 6 establishes the OLC, the resolution body, for those who consider that their complaints have not satisfactorily been dealt with by the in-house arrangements of the relevant legal service provider. Under the Bill, the OLC will investigate service complaints itself but will refer complaints about misconduct to an approved regulator for resolution. However, approved regulators will no longer have the power to award redress to complainants.</p>
	<p pid="a.1288.1/3">The Law Society, representing 116,000 solicitors, received more than 17,000 new complaints against it in 2004-05, accounting for about 86 per cent of the total costs of legal complaints handling. By contrast, the Bar Standards Board, the regulatory arm of the Bar Council&mdash;the governing body for 14,000 barristers&mdash;deals with less than 1,000 complaints each year. The Bar Standards Board estimates that about 3 per cent of cases referred to the OLC will derive from the Bar.</p>
	<p pid="a.1288.1/4">As we saw in Committee, about 70 per cent of complaints against barristers involve allegations that, if true, would require both compensation for inadequate professional service and proceedings for misconduct. The approved regulator, where appropriate, should be in a position to deal with both aspects. It is both inconvenient and confusing for consumers to have to deal with two different bodies about different aspects of their complaints, especially if one body accepts the facts to which the complaint relates but the other does not. There is also likely to be duplication of work and therefore unnecessary expense. Moreover, the approved regulator has a range of powers, including powers to award redress, which are far wider than those proposed for the OLC. This enables it to ensure that the most appropriate remedy or sanction is provided through a single procedure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1288.1/5">By contrast, the proposed new complaints-handling system will involve decision making by salaried non-lawyers who are unlikely to be able to supply the level of analysis and expertise currently provided free of charge. It is one of the,</p>
	<p pid="a.1288.1/6" class="indent">&quot;many advantages that have been provided by the Bar's handling of complaints&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2006-12-06.1186"><I>Official Report</I>, 6/12/06; col. 1186</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1288.1/7">That should not be lost by the Bill, as the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, a former director of the Office of Fair Trading, warned us at Second Reading.</p>
	<p pid="a.1288.1/8">As we saw in Committee, the Bar Council has established a body of expertise and maintained a complaints-handling service that is widely acknowledged to be of an extremely high standard. As we saw in Committee, the Legal Services Ombudsman has consistently given high marks to the Bar Standards Board for the speed and quality of its complaints service. Robert Behrens, the Bar Standards Board's independent complaints commissioner, has said that there is a strong case for the Bar Standards Board to have delegated jurisdiction over complaints about poor service.</p>
	<p pid="a.1288.1/9">Clause 154 creates inflexibility in complaints handling and adds massively to its costs. We have concluded that the Bill as drafted is certain to offer a poorer service to consumers at vastly greater cost&mdash;at least as far as the Bar is concerned. The Bar Standards Board, the approved regulator for the Bar, is an independent, ring-fenced, regulatory authority. It already deals with both service and conduct complaints. It already has a significant lay element, and its decisions are subject to a lay veto. This is emphatically not a case of lawyers deciding on complaints against lawyers. The independent Legal Services Ombudsman has repeatedly said that the Bar Standards Board does outstanding work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1288.1/10">We had hoped that the experience and expertise that barristers and lay members bring to providing a professional, cost-effective approach to complaints handling would, in the interests of consumers, be recognised in the Bill. Instead, the Government are persisting with a scheme which will provide a sub-optimal service to consumers at a colossal cost to the service providers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1288.1/11">The Government's proposals for amending complaints handling, and in particular the new clause inserted after Clause 154 by Amendment No. 395 and the new clauses after Clause 159 by Amendments Nos. 403 to 405, involve a voluntary scheme as an add-on to the main statutory one. However, the amendments do not address the problems that we have identified in the legislation. Nor do they answer our objections to the complete exclusion of approved regulators, with all their expertise from the ombudsman process. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.1290.1/1">My Lords, for many years now, there have been independent reviews of the complaints system run in respect of solicitors and the complaints system run in respect of the Bar. Up to now, independent reviews, especially those conducted by the ombudsman, have, year in and year out, unanimously condemned the Law Society's complaints schemes as defective, deficient and inadequate, whereas the system run by the Bar up to now has been praised as modest in charges and in price&mdash;taking advantage of the barristers' willingness to do this kind of work free of charge&mdash;and has received a tremendous amount of praise. In the Bill as it stands, complaints about both solicitors and barristers are wrapped up together and given to a new statutory body, which will of course be quite expensive. The new system does not take into account the difference between the complaints systems of the two branches of the profession, which I have just mentioned.</p>
	<p pid="a.1290.1/2">The Bar Standards Board, to which the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, referred, has a lay chairman and other lay members, as well as lawyers and barristers. Both kinds of people are helpful to one another, as I understand it. The Bar Standards Board can hardly be regarded as simply a lawyer's charade. The only case the Government have for wrapping up together the complaints systems for both solicitors and barristers is that it is &quot;tidy&quot; and, as it were, fair to both branches of the profession.</p>
	<p pid="a.1290.1/3">The Law Society, in its briefing to me&mdash;and, no doubt, to other noble Lords&mdash;has admitted that its own schemes have been deficient. It does not pretend that its history is as good as the Bar's in handling complaints. This amendment&mdash;or something likeit, if I may put it that way to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland&mdash;is surely desirable to modify the Government's approach, to allow some flexibility which the history of complaints against the legal profession surely justifies.</p>

	<p pid="a.1291.0/1">My Lords, the speech we have just heard from the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, came as music to my ears; his arguments were extremely compelling. Uniformity does not necessarily mean that we will have a more efficient or effective scheme. The underlying concern about the basic thrust of the Government's proposals is that they risk creating a rather bureaucratic monster which is not apt to deal any better with complaints that would previously have been handled by the Bar Council.</p>
	<p pid="a.1291.0/2">The issue of cost remains extremely important. It is clear that the Bar Council's existing arrangements for handling complaints have been of great benefit tothe consumer. We have not heard anything in the discussion of costs that has led us to believe that this problem will go away under the Government's new legislation. It is time to draw a line and say firmly to the representatives of the consumer lobby, who have expressed a preference for uniformity of treatment, that this does not necessarily work to the advantage of those whom they represent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1291.0/3">I have found it increasingly distasteful in the course of these debates to hear opinions which almost suggest that lawyers are the enemy of consumers. That is a complete travesty of the truth. Lawyers are very often necessary to ensure that remedies are obtained. Their skills as advocates, and in some cases their selfless preparedness to investigate allegations, are worthy of commendation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1291.0/4">A brief from <I>Which?</I> which was passed to some Members of this House said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1291.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Consumers will not trust a regulatory system that allows lawyers to judge their own&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1291.0/6">That is simply a misrepresentation of the position of the Bar Council. Significantly, its conduct committee has 10 lay members whose decisions are subject to a lay veto, as the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, stated. If that is the best argument that can be produced in favour of this inflexibility, it is a bad argument which ought to be roundly rejected by the Government.</p>

	<p pid="a.1292.0/1">My Lords, the noble Lord is very gracious in the way in which he puts forward his comments. Noble Lords have made strong arguments about the role of the Bar and I hope that they will agree that at no point in our deliberations have I indicated anything other than the highest regard for the way in which the Bar handles complaints. On the work going on with the Law Society and its regulatory body, I read out its latest report on its quality and success in handling complaints. Although I do not have the figures with me, I think that noble Lords will agree that it is being done in a better way than previously. I do not begin for one second to suggest that we are bringing it together to suggest in any way the wrapping up of all the regulators orthat they are failing, or that taking complaints away is a form of punishment. That is absolutely not the objective.</p>
	<p pid="a.1292.0/2">We have approached this issue from a different perspective. We know that there is an issue of public confidence. It may be more perception than reality in the context of the Bar. I did not know how the Bar handled its complaints procedure until I was involved in this job. It is not really surprising if the public do not know about the way in which the Bar handles complaints. None the less, whether it is right or wrong, there is an issue about perception in public confidence and the way in which complaints generally are handled.</p>
	<p pid="a.1292.0/3">Inevitably, there is an inconsistency in the way that the various complaint handling arrangements work. Among some people who wish to bring forward complaints, there is some confusion about where to take them. That is probably particularly important where, for example, a solicitor may have instructed a barrister and the consumer has to try to determine where the fault lies and to whom to complain. Noble Lords may not like it, but there is an issue about independence&mdash;real or perceived&mdash;of complaintsabout lawyers being handled by their own professional bodies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1292.0/4">The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, read out part of a letter, which I think that noble Lords have received. The letter is addressed to me, dated <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-04">4 May</phrase>, from the National Consumer Council, Citizens Advice and Which?. The noble Lord may argue that they do not necessarily represent appropriately the people whom they seek to, but they are the most prestigious bodies we have for consumer affairs. Therefore, noble Lords would expect me to take note of what they said. As the noble Lord said, the letter states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1292.0/5" class="indent">&quot;Consumers will not trust a regulatory system that allows lawyers to judge their own&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1292.0/6">It continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.1292.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Independence is the single most critical principle in any redress system. Separating the regulatory and representative functions of the professional bodies will be insufficient to command consumer confidence in this respect, especially given the relevant governance and complaint committees will continue to have professional majorities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1292.0/8">That may be inaccurate in the context of the Bar, but that is what they say. They go on:</p>
	<p pid="a.1292.0/9" class="indent">&quot;The Bar can be reassured that the Office of Legal Complaints will be, and must be, an entirely new body. The emergence of alternative business structures will further blur the boundaries between the legal professions. In this new world, consumers should not be left to navigate a regulatory maze to resolve their disputes&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1292.0/10">Noble Lords will have seen the letter. I shall make sure there is a copy in the Library of your Lordships' House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1292.0/11">As I have said, because we are also introducing alternative business structures, there will be opportunities for solicitors and barristers to work together in other ways. As the letter points out, this will add to the potential confusion for those who seek to complain. We believe it is more sensible in creating a new system to have one body that handles complaints about all legal professionals. That is clearer and more consistent; the system is straightforward, people know where to go and it can be dealt with properly. The most clear and consistent message since Sir David Clementi's report, and before that, is to make sure that we deal with any perceived or real loss of confidence in the way that legal professional bodies have dealt with consumer complaints about their members.</p>
	<p pid="a.1292.0/12">I have had the privilege of talking to the Bar Council and to Geoffrey Vos, who has passionately and straightforwardly put the concerns of the Bar. One issue has been to make sure that the expertise and experience that could be available to the Office for Legal Complaints is not lost. I have indicated to Geoffrey Vos that we have looked carefully at Schedule 15(15), because that allows the OLC to enter into arrangements with regulators to provide itwith assistance as it sees fit. There is no question that the ultimate decision-making must rest with the ombudsman&mdash;it must be an independent process. Yet I would expect the OLC to be in discussion withthe regulators, and to think about what expertise might be available that it could usefully use while retaining the independent system. The Bar and other regulators may well assist under the new arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1292.0/13">The key difference between this and what the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, proposed is that, in line with Sir David's philosophy, the OLC can make the best of existing arrangements by drawing on the Bar's or any other bodies' expertise, rather than completely delegating the responsibility it has to the public to ensure quick and fair redress. Within that context, I hope the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1293.0/1">My Lords, it really pains me to stand up at the Opposition Dispatch Box and once again take issue with what the noble Baroness says, especially as she has spoken in such measured and conciliatory tones. Yet she must know by now, having had these exchanges not only at Second Reading but also in Committee, that what she has said simply will not wash.</p>
	<p pid="a.1293.0/2">I find it difficult to understand how the noble Baroness can in one breath say that she absolutely accepts everything that has been said about the high quality of the Bar Standards Board and the way the Bar deals with complaints, and yet, in another breath, say that, even if in reality these standards are high, the public have doubts&mdash;that there is a public perception that somehow these standards, which she knows are met, are not being met. Where does this perception come from? What evidence does the noble Baroness have that there is a public perception that, despite all the evidence, the Bar Standards Board falls below requirements that have been tested over a long period? There is no such perception.</p>
	<p pid="a.1293.0/3">Then the noble Baroness says that there is concern that it is lawyers judging lawyers. The noble Lord, Lord Maclennan, had the complete answer to that; there are 10 lay members on the Bar Standards Board. The ultimate say on whether a Bar Standards Board decision stands is made by a lay person.</p>
	<p pid="a.1293.0/4">Why does the noble Baroness think that the Legal Services Board has nothing to do with the law? There will be lawyers on the board. Further, why is sheso convinced that the Legal Services Board is independent, whereas the Bar Standards Board is not? Did not your Lordships pass an amendment requiring the Lord Chancellor to have concurrent advice from the Lord Chief Justice precisely because the House does not believe that, as presently structured under this Bill, the Legal Services Board is independent?</p>
	<p pid="a.1293.0/5">I know how hard the noble Baroness has striven to resolve this particular problem in the Bill; but I have to say to her, most disappointingly, that I cannot accept her arguments as a satisfactory substitute for these amendments, and therefore again I wish to test the opinion of the House.</p>

	<p pid="a.1297.1/1">My Lords, with the leave of the House, I would like to repeat a Statement given by my right honourable friend Douglas Alexander in the other place. The Statement is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.1297.1/2">&quot;A great deal of wholly legitimate public concern has been expressed over certain aspects of last Thursday's election. I entirely share these concerns. They focus mainly on three areas: the arrangements for the administration of postal ballots; the operation of e-counting machines; and the significant number of spoilt ballot papers.&quot;Mr Speaker, when it became apparent in the early hours of Friday morning that difficulties were emerging, I contacted Professor Sir Neil McIntosh, the Scottish Electoral Commissioner. I expressed to him my concern that these issues be addressedas part of the statutory review of the Scottish elections that the commission is obliged to undertake, as a matter of urgency. Sir Neil was able to offer me this reassurance and this investigation is indeed now under way.&quot;The Electoral Commission has a statutory duty to report on the Scottish parliamentary elections. At the request of the Scottish Executive it will also be reporting on the local government elections. The commission is an independent body and is committed to ensuring a full and independent review of the Scottish elections. &quot;In those areas where the commission itself has an operational involvement&mdash;for example, in its statutory duty to promote public awareness of electoral systems&mdash;the commission will ensure independent evaluation of its own work, as it has in previous statutory reports. The commission is currently finalising the scope and timescale of the review, but intends to publish a report in the summer.&quot;A focus of public concern has been the adoption of a single ballot paper for the Scottish elections and the holding of those elections on the same day as the local government election. The poll for the Scottish Parliament elections is set in the Scotland Act. It has a predetermined cycle that Parliament at the time supported fully. I am not aware of any calls to change that. The decision to hold the local government elections on the same day was entirely a decision for Scottish Executive Ministers. It was enshrined in legislation whichwas fully debated and passed by the Scottish Parliament in 2001.&quot;Without wishing to prejudice the findings of this inquiry I should like to set out to the House the sequence of recommendations, consultations and decisions that led to the adoption of a single ballot paper for both elements of the Scottish Parliament elections, which are matters for which the Government have legislative responsibility.&quot;On <phrase class="date" code="2004-05-25">25 May 2004</phrase>, my predecessor as Secretary of State, my right honourable friend the Member for Edinburgh Central, announced the creation of a commission under the chairmanship of Sir John Arbuthnott to examine the implications of Scotland having four different voting systems. This commission was independent and included nominations from political parties. The commission issued a consultation paper in January 2005 and spent 12 months gathering evidence and carrying out a wide-ranging and extensive inquiry.&quot;The Arbuthnott commission issued its report jointly to my predecessor and the Scottish First Minister on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-19">19 January 2006</phrase>. The report contained a series of recommendations and suggestions&mdash;some to the Electoral Commission concerning voter education; some to the Scottish Executive, such as a recommendation to move the date of the local government elections; and several recommendations to the Government.&quot;My right honourable friend made it clear that it was unlikely that we would be in a position to implement those recommendations from the report which would require primary legislation in time for the 2007 Scottish elections.&quot;However, there was one matter that could be progressed without the need for primary legislation&mdash;the suggestion that the two ballot papers for the regional list and constituency member be combined into one, with the regional list on the left-hand column, based on the example of the New Zealand paper.&quot;In the light of the views of the Arbuthnott commission I decided to proceed with a wider public consultation in order to test whetherthe suggested move to a single ballot paper commanded more general support, and to explore the appropriate design of such a ballot paper.&quot;The Scotland Office launched this consultation on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-09">9 June 2006</phrase>. In addition, my honourable friend the Parliamentary Under-Secretary met a range of interested parties, including representatives from disability rights groups, to explore these issues. There was a significant level of support for a single ballot paper. Of 29 respondents, the Scottish Senior Citizens Unity Party, the Liberal party of Scotland, Enable Scotland and Capability Scotland were not in favour of a combined ballot paper. I have requested that all responses to this consultation are placed in the Library of the House.&quot;The major political parties that expressed a view were largely in favour: Derek Barrie, chief of staff, on behalf of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, responded on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-15">15 June</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1297.1/3" class="indent">'The Scottish Liberal Democrats warmly welcome and fully endorse the proposal to have one ballot paper only for the next diet of Scottish Parliament elections in May 2007. This is one recommendation of Arbuthnott that we fully agree with'.</p>
	<p pid="a.1297.1/4">&quot;Peter Murrell, chief executive of the Scottish National Party, responded on <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-16">16 August 2006</phrase>:</p>
	<p pid="a.1297.1/5" class="indent">'The Scottish National Party is in support of the proposed move to a single ballot paper for both votes in the Scottish Parliament elections. We believe that this will aid understanding of both elements of the voting system and, in particular, remove any misunderstanding that the regional vote is somehow a second preference vote'.</p>
	<p pid="a.1297.1/6">&quot;Lesley Quinn, the General Secretary of the Scottish Labour Party, responded:</p>
	<p pid="a.1297.1/7" class="indent">'The Scottish Labour Party strongly supports a single ballot paper, as this will simplify voting, counting, voter awareness and understanding. A single ballot paper will reduce the potential for voter confusion and be easier for people to use'.</p>
	<p pid="a.1297.1/8">No response to the consultation was received from the Scottish Conservative Party.</p>
	<p pid="a.1297.1/9">&quot;Beyond the political parties, the Electoral Reform Society responded:</p>
	<p pid="a.1297.1/10" class="indent">'The Electoral Reform Society supports the use of a single ballot paper for the Scottish Parliament elections'.</p>
	<p pid="a.1297.1/11">SOLAR&mdash;the Society of Local Authority Lawyers and Administrators in Scotland&mdash;responded:</p>
	<p pid="a.1297.1/12" class="indent">'The SOLAR elections working group unanimously agreed to support the proposal that both Scottish Parliament contests be contained on one ballot paper'.</p>
	<p pid="a.1297.1/13">&quot;In order to further explore those issues in advance of a decision as part of the consultation, the Scotland Office also requested the Electoral Commission to research with voters the impactof any possible change to the ballot paper format. On <phrase class="date" code="2006-08-04">4 August 2006</phrase>, Sir Neil McIntosh wroteto the Parliamentary Under-Secretary, enclosingthe findings of that research, which involvedfocus groups carried out in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Inverness and Dundee. A copy of the research has been placed in the Library of the House, together with the covering letter from the Electoral Commission. In that covering letter, Sir Neil McIntosh wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.1297.1/14" class="indent">'As you can see, the research draws a number of clear conclusions for the design of the Scottish Parliamentary Ballot Paper. These conclusions point to the interests of the voter best being served by: A design of ballot paper that incorporates both the regional and constituency ballot papers alongside each other on a single sheet of paper'.</p>
	<p pid="a.1297.1/15">The findings of the focus groups supported the move to a single ballot paper, with a significant majority of respondents agreeing, with the overall preference in favour of a single combined ballot paper rather than two separate papers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1297.1/16">&quot;Only after that extensive consultation involving the widest possible range of stakeholders, the support of the main political parties that expressed a preference, the research received indicating the best interest of the voter being served by a single ballot paper, and clear official advice, was a decision taken to proceed with a single ballot paper for the Scottish parliamentary elections.&quot;There is also the issue of delays in the administration of postal ballots. The handlingof postal votes is increasingly of public interest and concern, which is why we already have stiff penalties in legislation to prevent fraud. The use of postal votes in higher numbers than before makes that all the more important. When it became clear that such delays were occurring in the days prior to polling day, I instructed my officials to contact the Electoral Commission to ensure that these matters would be fully investigated. &quot;However, the process at local level for the preparation and delivery of postal votes is for returning officers and their staff. They make the contractual arrangements that they judge appropriate for their area. They are well aware of the tight timescales involved in getting out the papers to voters. When the Electoral Commission reports, I will of course examine whether there are steps that the Government can take to help ensure that the postal vote problems that certainly beset regions such as the Highlands, Dumfries and Galloway, among others, do not happen again.&quot;Finally, I will turn to the issue of e-counting. In 2005, the Scottish Executive approached the Scotland Office to discuss the option of using e-counting at the combined poll. That arose mainly because of the benefits of handling a count of ballots under the single transferable vote method. Manual counting of STV would take many days and be highly complex. My predecessor as Secretary of State, after careful assessment of advice, gave an agreement in principle to the option, but stressed the need for systematic testing and evaluation of the equipment and software.&quot;That took place through late 2005 and into 2006, up to the final procurement decisions. Many tests and demonstrations were held for electoral administrators, political parties, special interest groups and others. Various contingencies were tested, including power failures and ballot papers that had been creased or folded. The process was led by a steering group comprising officials from the Scotland Office, the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament, as well as representatives from Convention of Scottish Local Authorities, the Association of Electoral Administrators, the Society of Local Authority Lawyers and Administrators, the Scottish Assessors Association and the Society of Local Authority Chief Executives. I am advised that none of these simulations gave any evidence of the kind or scale of problems we saw in some centres on Thursday night and Friday morning. Clearly, this is an issue which will be absolutely central to the Electoral Commission's report.&quot;Mr Speaker, there are clearly a number of issues that need to be explored in relation to the problems encountered in the conduct of these elections. The Electoral Commission must now be allowed to undertake its statutory review which, as I have said before, will be available by the summer. I will, of course, update the House at that stage, in the light of their conclusions&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1297.1/17">My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>

	<p pid="a.1300.0/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement made in another place. Speaking of the Scottish elections, it would be remiss of me not to congratulate the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes of Cumnock, who is unfortunately not in his place, on his successful election to the Scottish Parliament. His only sadness must be that it looks as though he is to be denied the opportunity of asking the same kind of congratulatory questions of government Ministers there as he was able to do in this place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1300.0/2">Scotland has been wished four different voting systems. That has been a source of confusion for a start. The Government were warned by no less an authority than the Electoral Commission, and equally by the Arbuthnott commission, of the dangers of trying to hold an election for two different systems on the same day. The Labour and Liberal Democrat Members of the Scottish Parliament were likewise warned by the Scottish Conservative Members of the dangers of combining the local government elections with the Scottish parliamentary ones. Still they persisted. Does this not bring to mind the fiasco that we have all witnessed over the single farm payments in England, where an arrogant belief in a rational and intellectual but complicated system runs completely foul of reality?</p>
	<p pid="a.1300.0/3">The outcome is causing anger and dismay across Scotland. Noble Lords will be aware that in one constituency, Shettleston, there were over 2,000 spoilt ballots. A small country that thought that it was being offered the chance of a higher profile on the world stage has been turned into a laughing stock. I notice that it was claimed in another place that all the spoilt ballots from a few constituencies are not known. Can the Minister tell us how many spoilt ballots are known?</p>
	<p pid="a.1300.0/4">The final legislation for both elements of these elections was passed through this House after a Grand Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-07">7 March</phrase>. The Statement highlights the problems of postal ballots. There have been stories of postal ballots being delivered on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-02">2 May</phrase> for an election on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-03">3 May</phrase>, or not at all. Can the Minister say why so little time was given to the returning officers to complete their tasks? The Statement talks of the tests and demonstrations of the machines for the electronic counting systems. Was the lateness in finalising the design of the ballot papers a factor in the electronic counting fiasco? What proportion of the votes was subject to recounting? In particular, did they have to be recounted manually as a result of the e-counting malfunction?</p>
	<p pid="a.1300.0/5">The Minister is a good and decent man. In his heart of hearts he will be as dismayed as the rest of us by the mess that the Secretary of State has created; yet another example of the consequences of the Government's constant tinkering and messing about with our tried and trusted voting system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1300.0/6">If the Prime Minister is looking for a legacy, he need look no further than the complicating and discrediting of a voting system once unquestioned anywhere. Once we sent out the international election inspectors and advisers; now they are heading to Holyrood to find out why Scottish electors are being robbed of their votes in their tens of thousands. What a shambles and a disgrace.</p>
	<p pid="a.1300.0/7">Is the Minister aware that in 11 general elections from 1964 the proportion of spoilt ballots was never more than 0.38 per cent, and usually below 0.2 per cent? In the first round of the recent French election, with 12 candidates and 37 million voters, spoilt ballots were only 1.4 per cent. By contrast, does he recall the fiasco of the London elections in 2004, the closest parallel to these events? Several voting systems were run in parallel on the same day and over 500,000 Londoners saw their votes spoilt; 3 per cent of mayoral votes and nearly 7 per cent of the assembly votes were rejected. What was said then? The senior returning officer said that the legislation was not passed in time. The Electoral Reform Society said that the problems were foreseen but ignored. The Government said that they would learn the lessons. The shameful reality is that they did not listen then and they did not learn. As a direct result, Scotland has suffered a similar fiasco.</p>
	<p pid="a.1300.0/8">It is all very well the Electoral Commission and the Government promising an inquiry now and the Liberal Democrats calling for one, but they have all been complicit in creating the debacle. The most obvious place to look for solutions is not from those who presided over the debacle in the first place. I do not consider that the appointment of an inquiry into this fiasco, while necessary, is enough to absolve the Government of all responsibility.</p>

	<p pid="a.1302.0/1">My Lords, I join in thanking the Minister for repeating the Statement of the Secretary of State. Dismay at the outcome ofthe elections held on the same day is widely felt throughout Scotland. In passing, I note that the Scottish Conservative Party was not among those that gave advice about the process of having a double ballot on one paper. Some of us would prefer not to jump to conclusions as to which of the novelties was responsible for what appears to have been a catastrophically mismanaged election.</p>
	<p pid="a.1302.0/2">We welcome the Electoral Commission's decision to put in hand the inquiry into the spoilt ballots, the postal voting and electronic counting; all of them had novel features and appeared to have contributed in some measure to denying perhaps as many as one in 20 of the Scottish electors the opportunity of contributing to the outcome of the election, as they believed they had done. There have been instances of voting for two authorities on the same day in the United Kingdom, including Northern Ireland in 2005. There was a warning issued by the Electoral Commission at that time. In the report on that election it stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1302.0/3" class="indent">'If combined elections are to become the norm then much more needs to be done ... to ensure the electorate understands the different voting systems'.</p>
	<p pid="a.1302.0/4">I think that it is fair to say that not much had been done in Scotland prior to the elections last Thursday. The Minister's Statement indicated that the Government considered that there was not a sufficient gap between the decisions and the election to introduce legislation. Is legislation is really necessary to enable the education of the electorate to take place?</p>
	<p pid="a.1302.0/5">The problem has unquestionably vitiated the authority of those democratic elections. With such a high proportion of spoilt ballots, there must be great grievances in particular constituencies. It is extremely difficult for individuals who may have suffered from this to pursue their cause through an election court, particularly as there are so few precedents to guide the returning officers on what was appropriate behaviour and to enable the court to decide what would be unreasonable. I hope that, in considering these matters, the Electoral Commission will give thought to the possibility of manually checking e-ballots where the voter's mind was not able to be read. The old system of manual checking was regarded as being effective and pretty accurate by and large.</p>
	<p pid="a.1302.0/6">My final point is on the review. In so far as there may be questions about whether the Electoral Commission conducted all the necessary preliminary inquiries and took the necessary steps, and given that it is, in a sense, involved in the outcome of this election, the Government will have to give some thought to whether further independent consideration needs to be given to those matters where it might be invidious for the commission to pronounce on its own performance.</p>

	<p pid="a.1303.0/1">My Lords, I thank the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, for his kind words about my noble friend Lord Foulkes. We on this side will miss him, and I personally will miss him a great deal, as he has been a breath of fresh air.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.0/2">I disagree with the noble Duke's point that this mess was created by the Secretary of State. That is a good political point, but if he listened to the Statement, as I am sure he did, he will know that the Scottish Executive made a number of decisions and local returning officers were responsible for many of the activities that resulted in the problems that he is laying at the feet of the Government. As I said, that is a good debating point, but it is not particularly fair.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.0/3">The import of my right honourable friend's Statement is that a number of things have gone wrong. He and the Government are determined to find out what went wrong. We have asked the Electoral Commission&mdash;an independent body with a statutory right and duty to look into these matters&mdash;to look into all aspects and report back. As my right honourable friend said a few minutes ago in another place, if, as a result of the Electoral Commission's report, there is a need for further matters to be inquired into, we will not hesitate to do that. The intention is there; we are not avoiding any issue. That is an important point for all noble Lords to take on board.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.0/4">Let me answer some of the specific points that the noble Duke, the Duke of Montrose, raised. The poll has been criticised, but the Scottish Parliament has, under the Scotland Act, the duty to come to those decisions. The local government elections are for Scottish Executive Ministers, not London, to decide on. There has been great discussion and concern about spoilt papers. As I have said, and as my right honourable friend said in another place, although that is a matter for the returning officers we think it would be unwise to comment upon it until we have the final tally. I am absolutely prepared to give an undertaking that these figures will be released once we have that tally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.0/5">On criticism of the Government about postal votes, and for not allowing enough time for those to be sent out effectively, their timetable is set by local returning officers. E-counting has clearly not gone as smoothly as anyone would have wished; that will also be an important aspect of the Electoral Commission's report.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.0/6">Again, we cannot give precise figures at the moment on the spoilt ballot papers. There is a figure of 100,000 going around, but there is just a feeling&mdash;one to be confirmed or otherwise by the Electoral Commission&mdash;that that is rather high. We have no details yet of the local government ballot papers, so again it is best to wait to see what the actual figures are. On the high incidence of spoilt papers, I must underline that the Electoral Commission is impartial and can get an independent element into the review if so needed. If there is concern about the Electoral Commission, I should say that it can and will get independent, impartial advice within its review.</p>
	<p pid="a.1303.0/7">I turn to the points made by the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan. The combined poll issue will form partof the Electoral Commission's review, and the Government will consider carefully what is said on all points once that is available. I am afraid that we cannot comment on individual poll results, as there may be the possibility of further action. I hope that answers the major points that have been raised.</p>

	<p pid="a.1305.2/2">Things have gone wrong. We are determined to find out why, and we feel that the Electoral Commission will do that for us. If there is the need for further inquiries after that then, as I have said, we will put those in place. I feel that the noble Lord is being most unfair to my right honourable friend in another place who, in my view, gave a Statement that accurately describes what has happened and said what was going to be done about it.

	<p pid="a.1306.2/1">My Lords, I begin by joining in the congratulations to the noble Lord, Lord Foulkes, on his election to the Scottish Parliament. There were three of us from this House in the first Parliament; he is now the only one. We wish him well, although we will miss his habitual trenchant criticism of Her Majesty's Government in this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1306.2/2">Seriously, my criticism of the Statement is that its tone did not seem to echo the gravity of what people feel went wrong in Scotland. I have spent considerable time in my retirement advising Parliaments and political parties and monitoring elections overseas. I do not know how I will be able to show my face in Africa in future, where I have seen counts conducted with chalk on the floor of a village school with much greater efficiency and accuracy than happened with our sophisticated system in Scotland. It is an acute embarrassment and a matter of public anger that so many votes were discounted. The tone of the Statement did not reflect that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1306.2/3">I also appeal for a proper, quick, independent inquiry into what went wrong for two reasons: not just because, as my noble friend said, some of those matters were the responsibility of the Electoral Commission but also because some of them were not. They fell outside its remit. The fact that the two elections were held together was not its responsibility.</p>
	<p pid="a.1306.2/4">Postal votes were decided by returning officers, not by the Electoral Commission. The Minister may want to know that my noble friend Lord Kirkwood was one of the many people who got a postal ballot paper for the wrong ward. Why was that allowed to be contracted out to firms that did not know the local geography? That is extraordinary. It was not the decision of the Electoral Commission; nor was the introduction of the counting machines. There is a compelling case for having a proper, genuinely independent inquiry, whatever the Electoral Commission may do internally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1306.2/5">The Minister said that he does not know the actual number of spoilt ballot papers although, as the noble Lord, Lord Forsyth, said, we all heard them announced constituency by constituency. We have not yet been told how many spoilt papers there were in the local government ballot. It is a paradox that under the single transferable vote system for local government, there were far fewer spoilt papers than in the firstpast the post ballot papers for the Scottish Parliament. As the ballot papers were modelled on those in New Zealand, I wonder whether we have any information about the number of spoilt ballot papers there. I suspect that it is more to do with the design of the ballot paper than the compilation of the paper in principle.</p>
	<p pid="a.1306.2/6">My fundamental point is that there must be a proper, independent inquiry and the Government must accept that.</p>

	<p pid="a.1309.3/1">My Lords, from what I have derived from last Thursday's events, an all elected House of Lords is rather less likely than it might have been beforehand. More seriously, I shall attempt to bridge the divide that is going to open up between the Government's view that this should be left to the Electoral Commission and the cries for a fully independent commission. Surely we can bridge that divide by instructing the Electoral Commission to include some non-executive directors&mdash;some independent members. That would, to some extent, disarm the criticism that they are the guards looking after themselves.</p>

	<p pid="a.1309.10/1">My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 385 and 386. These amendments relate to the important provisionsin Clause 141 on information-sharing. Similar amendments were raised in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, and my noble friend Lady Henig on behalf of the Law Society. Although I felt at the time that the wording of the amendment raised at that stage was not appropriate for the Bill, I was persuaded by the importance of the intended effect. As a result, we have worked closely with the Law Society to return with these amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.1309.10/2">I am happy to report that they represent a solution that both the Law Society and the Government are satisfied with. I hope that noble Lords too will be satisfied. It is of vital importance to the regulatory and complaints-handling framework that approved regulators and the OLC work in co-operation. I am confident that these amendments will facilitate that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1309.10/3">Amendments Nos. 384 and 385 will strengthen the LSB's duties when specifying the requirements which the OLC and approved regulators must meet when drawing up their rules on information-sharing. The LSB will now have to have regard to the need to ensure, as far as reasonably practicable, that the OLC and approved regulators, in sharing information, assist one another to perform their function. This elevation of &quot;desirability&quot; to &quot;need&quot; seems more appropriately to reflect the importance of the consideration that the LSB should give to these arrangements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1309.10/4">Amendment No. 386 will require the OLC and approved regulators to consult each other prior to submission of rules or arrangements for LSB approval and to require that if there are unresolved disagreements, these are reported to LSB when the rules or regulatory arrangements are submitted for approval. This reflects the particular relevance of these matters to the relationship between the OLC and approved regulators and will encourage the OLC and approved regulators to reach a consensus on what information should be shared and how, and will therefore further facilitate a co-operative relationship.</p>
	<p pid="a.1309.10/5">Amendment No. 386 covers much the same ground as Amendment No. 387, tabled in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. Given the Law Society's agreement on Amendment No. 386, the noble Lord may want to reflect on that when we get to his group of amendments. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.1313.0/1">My Lords, by virtue of Clause 137(4), an ombudsman's determination becomes final and binding if accepted by a complainant. This is one of the cornerstones of the new scheme that we are putting in place. It provides complainants and respondents with the certainty that they are entitled to&mdash;a clear end to the complaints process. If the amendments to allow for an independent review were accepted, an ombudsman's determination would no longer be final, and neither complainants nor respondents would have the necessary certainty. This is not only our view, but the view of the British and Irish Ombudsman Association. As we, and it, have said, complainants do not have to accept the determination of the ombudsman. They are always free to reject that decision and to institute court proceedings. It would therefore be wrong to have an independent reviewer able to second-guess the ombudsman.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/2">As explained in Committee, we envisage that there will be several internal reviews of a complaint before it is passed to an ombudsman for a final determination. In Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, said that the amendments arose because the Government had,</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/3" class="indent">&quot;failed to replace the position of the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner and of the Legal Services Ombudsman&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2007-02-21.1164"><I>Official Report</I>, 21/2/07; col. 1164</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/4">However, although of course the Legal Services Complaints Commissioner and the Legal Services Ombudsman fulfil a valuable role under the present system, there is no need to create these roles under the new system that we are putting in place. At present, consumers need there to be some independent oversight of the way in which the professional bodies handle complaints. This is because those consuming the services do not necessarily have confidence in a profession that is seen to be judging itself. That is not, however, the system that we are creating.</p>
	<p pid="a.1313.0/5">The amendments assume that the ombudsman scheme will work in the same way as the current complaints handling system, and so would require an appeals mechanism to an independent person. I hope it is clear, however, that the Office for Legal Complaints and the ombudsman are independent. The chairman of the OLC is a lay person, as is the chief ombudsman. Other ombudsmen cannot be practising lawyers, and every ombudsman is explicitly required to be appointed under terms that will guarantee independence. Ombudsmen's decisions should be final. If there were appeals, the certainty that we are seeking to create would be lost. That would not be good for consumers or the professions. We are creating a system that we hope is quick and fair and that, crucially, has a certain conclusion to the process. It is a new system, and so does not work like the current one. There is therefore no need to recreate the roles that we had before. I ask that these amendments are withdrawn.</p>

	<p pid="a.1314.3/1">My Lords, Amendments Nos. 400 and 401 have been brought back from Committee. They would impose a general duty on the Legal Services Board to consult&mdash;a duty that, as your Lordships are aware, is otherwise absent from the Bill. In our brief exchange on this matter in March, the Minister agreed that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1314.3/2" class="indent">&quot;it is essential that the board consults on important points of policy and the framework under which it operates&quot;.&mdash;[<phrase class="offrep" id="lords/2007-03-06.148"><I>Official Report</I>, 6/3/07; col. 148-49</phrase>.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1314.3/3">She concluded that it was an unnecessary amendment as the Bill already imposed enough specific duties to consult. At least part of her justification for her approach was that Clauses 8 to 11 already require the board to consult consumers, while her affirmation that she had accepted in principle what was then Amendment No. 38 meant that there would be a similar requirement to consider representations from approved regulators.</p>
	<p pid="a.1314.3/4">Her acceptance in principle has unfortunately not translated into acceptance on paper, so the Bill imposes no general obligation on the board to consider representations from the professional bodies. This is just one of the reasons why the overarching duty to consult proposed by Amendment No. 400 would be so desirable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1314.3/5">Nevertheless, the other important arguments still remain. Accepting the amendments would add to some of the changes that noble Lords have already made to the Bill by reaffirming the board's role as a light-touch regulator by ensuring that the regulators would still have as much of a say as possible and by listening to the recommendations of Sir David Clementi. The Minister was reasonably receptive to these arguments in Committee. As what was Amendment No. 38 now looks unlikely to find its way into the Bill, perhaps she might consider these amendments more warmly. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.1316.0/1">My Lords, I think the noble Lord knows that there are specific requirements in different parts of the Bill which mean that consultation is necessary on particular issues. I cannot win on this. The Government bring forward amendments in order to respond; indeed, a number of amendments are specifically designed to support issues raised by the Law Society. A lot of them are very small, technical changes, but none the less important. That is why there appear to be many more amendments than usual.</p>
	<p pid="a.1316.0/2">Noble Lords will, I have no doubt, return to this issue at Third Reading, but that is my explanation. I shall deal with one particular point raised in the amendments. I have indicated that there are sufficient opportunities. Clause 3 specifically requires the board to have regard to key principles, including any other principle that appears to represent the best regulatory practice. In line with best regulatory practice&mdash;for example, the Better Regulation Executive's code of practice on consultation&mdash;the board should consider representations made, especially if they come from those affected by its function. The code of practice does not require us to set out consultation provisions in legislation, but it sets out a number of principles of best practice. They include: identifying the relevant interested parties and those likely to be affected by the policy; providing feedback on responses and how they have influenced the policy; paying particular attention to representative bodies, such as business associations and trade unions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1316.0/3">Given the requirement that the board follows best practice in respect of consultation, we should not have to set out in legislation practice which could become outdated and irrelevant as we move forward and become more detailed about the kind of consultation we wish to see. I do not want to narrow the focus of the board's consultation, which I fear the amendment might if we were to limit the board's consultation to the extent that its general policies and practice are consistent with its duty under Section 3, or the degree to which the board's proposed activities are appropriately targeted, and whether or not the proposed programme of work is proportionate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1316.0/4">Instead, I submit that the combination of Clause 3 and the provisions that must be followed in respect of representation is the best approach. This would include the requirement for the board to have regard to any representations made to it in respect of policy statements, covered by Clause 49, rules made under the Bill, covered by Clause 195, and ensure that consumers and the profession have the opportunity to influence decisions by the board. The principles that I have outlined would also apply to any work plan, but it is not necessary to put a duty in the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1316.0/5">The board is also under a duty, in Clause 3, to ensure that its activities are targeted and used only where appropriate and necessary. This, along with the duty for the board's accounts to be laid before Parliament, provides sufficient financial accountability. I hope this explanation suffices and that the noble Lord is able to withdraw his amendment.</p>

In our discussion on that earlier in the Report stage, I asserted that the noble Baroness had given an unequivocal undertaking to incorporate Amendment No. 38 into the Bill. The noble Baroness begged to differ and was going to look at the matter and come back to the House at Third Reading. Of course, we still await her explanation of what she has decided to do about the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1317.0/2">The purpose behind Amendment No. 38 has some influence over the amendment that we are discussing now. From what the noble Baroness says, I understand that she is reluctant to place Amendment No. 400 in the Bill. Nevertheless, her explanation for not wishing to do so appears to be that, in effect, the Bill already says what Amendment No. 400 states. Can I therefore take it that the Minister's interpretation of the Bill is that the board is obliged to make and maintain effective arrangements for consulting representatives of practitioners and consumers, on the extent to which its general policies and practices are consistent with its duty under Section 3?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1323.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100063" speakername="Lord Borrie" colon=":" colnum="1323"  time="018:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0010.htm#07050830000084">
	<p pid="a.1323.0/1">My Lords, during the 20th century the legal profession, particularly the solicitors, came more and more into direct contact with the masses of the population as distinct from merely the better off, the commercial enterprises and so on. That was encouraged by the Legal Aid and Advice Act which the Labour Government brought in soon after World War 2. The legal profession, and I mean both parts of it, has always professed that it must have in mind the interests of the public&mdash;citizens in general&mdash;and not just their clients. Its behaviour, codes of practice and professional conduct require that that should be so. As we know, however, the legal profession has not always in practice come up to the high standards professed in the codes of professional conduct and the codes that, at annual meetings and so on, it maintains that it has.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/2">I know that opposition parties do not agree fully with every aspect of the Bill but, bearing in mind the professions' deficiencies in dealing with complaints,it is difficult for them to suggest that the Bill's surveillance elements regarding the Legal Services Board are not required. The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, distinguishes between the front-line regulators&mdash;which, as he would say, are properly paid for by the professions&mdash;and the Legal Services Board, which, on behalf of the public, ensures that it does a good job, or at least that is what it is meant to do. That is not a strong distinction. They are all needed. The surveillance of the Legal Services Board is needed because of the professions' recent history. It is in the public interest to ensure that the professional standards which the professions have maintained and stated they believe in over so many years are in fact and in practice maintained.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/3">It is rather difficult to argue that the people who use the services of lawyers should not pay for the work of the Legal Services Board as well as for the front-line regulators. I certainly do not see as a matter of principle the distinction drawn by noble Lords opposite on this matter. I recall certain connections with the regulation of the accountancy profession. I do not see any objection in principle to the fact that it does it by means of the Financial Reporting Council, as mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. There is a split, and some sort of split is desirable. I know that Sir David Clementi thought that that might be suitable in the legal profession.</p>
	<p pid="a.1323.0/4">I stress that the Government's proposals are not out of the question or unprincipled in suggesting that those who need and have to pay for the services of lawyers should also pay, rather than the general taxpayer, for the provision of the surveillance of the Legal Services Board as well as for the front-line regulators.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1324.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="1324"  time="018:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0010.htm#07050830000092">
	<p pid="a.1324.0/1">My Lords, I have not had any conversations with the Treasury. I do have the word &quot;Resist&quot; written on my brief, but it is not from the Treasury. Indeed, we have been in consultation with the Treasury to do precisely what the noble Lord has invited me to do, which is to give an update on the costs. Noble Lords will recall that when we considered this issue on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-16">16 April</phrase>, I said that I was concerned to look at the figures reported by Francis Gibb in the <I>Times</I>, as well as to consider the further analysis undertaken with the Law Society and the Bar Council. Rather helpfully, those with whom we shared the figures raised different points that they wished us to reconsider, which I duly asked officials to do. I also asked my officials to give me figures that I could use this evening in order to set out for noble Lords the position as it currently stands.</p>
	<p pid="a.1324.0/2">We have been looking to refine the implementation plans and to consider the amendments that have been made to the Bill, so it is absolutely right to reflectthe current position by updating the costs. Noble Lords will recall that the original forecast by PricewaterhouseCoopers was &pound;26.8 million. Following our further analysis, the figure now stands at&pound;32 million, which takes into account inflation&mdash;that is, the costs are restated at 2007-08 prices&mdash;and includes VAT. It also reflects other adjustments which have led to decreases in costs in some areas and increases in others. In addition, in relation to the Office for Legal Complaints, we have assumed a year-on-year increase in the volume of complaints. That is based on an analysis of the compound annual growth rate of Law Society complaints, which account for approximately 96 per cent of the total annual volume of complaints. Building in this annual growth rate has impacted on both implementation and running costs, with the result that it is predicted that in 2007-08 the running costs are now predicted to be &pound;19.9 million compared with the PricewaterhouseCoopers estimate of &pound;16.8 million. The noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral, specifically asked me for that figure. However, the revisedfigure still represents a saving on the currentcomplaints handling arrangements, costed byPricewaterhouseCoopers at &pound;32.5 million in 2005.</p>
	<p pid="a.1324.0/3">While the analysis we have carried out is robust and based on sound assumptions, any operation of this size involves risks, no matter how carefully planned and managed it may be, so we have put together a risk register. It is therefore prudent to build in a margin for unforeseen costs, and I have suggested that we build in a margin of 15 per cent, which is approximately &pound;5 million. That is based on an analysis of the risks associated with the reform process and the costs that may accompany those risks. It is right and proper to cite a figure that takes into account all the risks of change. Although I do not anticipate the risks, they could include problems such as not being able to find appropriate premises. These are risks that we do not believe will be realised, but none the less have to be taken into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.1324.0/4">We have also looked at the possibility of a spike in complaints volumes occurring two to three years after the introduction of the new scheme. We have analysed what has happened in comparable sectors and the evidence suggests a tendency towards a spike two to three years in. However, I emphasise that our forecasts already take into account a year-on-year increase, and of course the experience of different sectors does not necessarily read across. In addition, in practice we would expect to see economies of scale and a decrease in cost per complaint.</p>
	<p pid="a.1324.0/5">It is obviously crucial that noble Lords and the legal professions have confidence in these figures, so I should like to emphasise that the adjustments which have been made are based on a robust analysis. What is more, I can confirm that the revised figure will now form the basis of the implementation budget for the new organisations when responsibility is handed to the new boards; that is, it will be the budget that they are given.</p>

	<p pid="a.1328.1/1">My Lords, the quality of the debate on the amendment has been high even by the standards of the debates we have had on previous amendments throughout the course of the Bill. I was particularly thankful to the noble Lord, Lord Maclennan of Rogart, who made an exceptionally fine and demanding&mdash;from the Minister's point of view&mdash;intervention on behalf of our amendments. Although the noble Lord, Lord Borrie, sought to disagree with me he was at his most eloquent and my noble friend Lord Hunt has always found a certain amount of liquid in even the driest of water courses. I am most grateful to all of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1328.1/2">The noble Lord, Lord Borrie, rightly said thatwe should look at the role of the Legal Services Board in a context wider than that of the regulationof complaints. We on these Benches accept the establishment of the Legal Services Board but at no stage in the Bill's course have sought to amend it so as to remove the board. We also accept that there are certain functions of the board in supervising the complaints system that should legitimately be financed by the professions. But the functions of the Legal Services Board go way beyond the complaints arena. My noble friend Lord Hunt dealt particularly vividly with the wider public interest. A number of other public regulatory organisations have both their start-up and their running costs supported by the Government. I can think of no public regulator of the sort that the Legal Services Board purports to be that is not in some form or other supported by the Government. Moreover, the authorised persons will have no control whatever over the number of additional functions that might be heaped on the board for which they will have to pay. There is nothing in the Bill that controls that process on their behalf.</p>
	<p pid="a.1328.1/3">Moreover, a range of existing functions currently financed by the taxpayer will now be transferred and become a financial burden on the authorised users. The Government are a net beneficiary of that process. The legal profession will carry burdens in future that were formerly carried by the taxpayer. Given the scale of the costs that the profession is about to meet, that is, in my respectful submission, entirely unacceptable. Despite the noble Baroness's attempt at calming words, I find the situation entirely unacceptable. At this late hour we would probably be imprudent on both sides of the House to vote, but nevertheless I will give the noble Baroness a week longer to consider the position. Meanwhile, I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1330.0/1">My Lords, I appreciate that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has brought this issue back again. I have already indicated that we have talked to the smaller regulators, because I understand their concerns. I said as well that I would look at what else we might be able to do on this issue to give them clarity and comfort about the situation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1330.0/2">I said during the debate in Committee that the board must be satisfied that the apportionment of the levy would be in accordance with fair principles before making the rules, and I still firmly believe that that, rather than a list in the Bill of what would inevitably be a prescriptive list of factors, is the appropriate provision. Noble Lords will know that I have a general aversion to lists as they can never be exhaustive, and often they could preclude a factor that we do not think of at the time but could subsequently become important&mdash;perhaps more important than other factors. I do not wish to do that because it is important to enable the philosophy of proportionality to be interpreted with the factors at the time, depending on the circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.1330.0/3">I recognise that the list sets out what the board should consider inter alia, so other matters should be considered too, but any list puts pressure on the board to consider those matters before anything else for fear of being reviewed, and that would restrict the flexibility of the board, something the Institute of Trade Mark Attorneys and the Chartered Institute of Patent Attorneys have said they do not want. They do not want a one-size-fits-all approach. I agree, and we would argue that flexibility is exactly what is needed to prevent that. Reducing that flexibility through a predetermined list could ultimately be to their detriment, and none of wish to see that happen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1330.0/4">I do not want to set out the principles. Inour thinking we have followed the approach inSection 2(3) of the Legislative and Regulatory ReformAct, which establishes that regulatory activities should be carried out in a way that is transparent, accountable, proportionate and consistent, and that regulatory activities should be targeted only at cases in which action is needed. We believe that the terminology set out in the Bill in respect of proportionality and fair principles has a natural meaning that is widely accepted and widely understood, but it gives the flexibility to provide for the smaller regulatory bodies, which I know are concerned about this. I hope, as we continue to discuss this with them&mdash;we will certainly do so&mdash;that they will feel increasingly reassured that there is no question that one-size-fits-all would be highly inappropriate in the context of ensuring the smaller regulatory bodies are well catered for. We are all in agreement on what we are seeking to do; our contention is that we have achieved it within the Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1330.0/5">On Amendment No. 433, we would generally expect money owed in respect of the levy to be paid from practising fee income, and Clause 50(4)(b) provides that it can be. I do not want to set out in the Bill that that is the only source of funds that could be used to meet a debt to the board, simply because we do not want to restrict the flexibility of the regulators to meet debt in the way best suited to their own financial arrangements. To do so could force an approved regulator to divert practising fee income away from essential regulatory functions in order to pay the board, when it might judge that it was less damaging to use some other asset or source of income. It is unusual for legislation to restrict the way in which money owed may be recovered and to fetter the court's ability to enforce payment of debts. We consider that the standard procedures that apply to the recovery of debt should apply in this case. It is a question of allowing flexibility for the regulatory bodies for circumstances we cannot foresee, where it might be in their best interests to provide for that money in other ways than simply using the practising fee. I hope that on that basis the noble Lord will feel he has some shreds of comfort, and will withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1331.1/1">My Lords, I am not willing to commit to say that we will make this into formal guidance. I am sure, however, that, in the discussions I have mentioned with the smaller regulatory bodies, their concerns, which are reflected in some of the issues raised by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, need to be properly dealt with. I am prepared to commit that we will continue the dialogue with them. It is our shared objective to ensure that they are treated properly and fairly. In legislative terms we have achieved that; in practical terms, it will be for the bodies concerned to make sure it happens.</p>

	<p pid="a.1331.2/1">My Lords, I am most grateful to the Minister for her response. What she said about Amendment No. 417 will have gone some way to appeasing the concerns of the two small regulators who were really behind the promotion of the amendment. I recognise that she is against an amendment that specifies the component parts of proportionality; indeed, having heard the cogent way she has argued the point, I have some sympathy for her.</p>
	<p pid="a.1331.2/2">On Amendment No. 433, as the Minister will be aware, there is a specific difficulty for the patent and trademark regulators because of their relationship with their own members. There would be nothing to prevent the patent and trademark attorneys leaving their societies but, unlike the case of barristers and solicitors, continuing to practise as patent and trademark attorneys. That is likely to happen unless the terms of the amendment are what happens in practice. I accept entirely that the Minister hopes that the practice by the Legal Services Board will be as set out in Amendment No. 433. Nevertheless, there is no compulsion, and, were it to be the case that the board went beyond the stipulations she has laid down, that could have an extremely adverse on those two small regulators. Still, I am aware that the Minister has strained to provide me with the answers I hoped to get, and in those circumstances I beg leave to withdraw the amendment.</p>

	<p pid="a.1334.6/1">I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 436A to 497, 499 and 500, 502 to 504, 506 to 517A and 519 to 563.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334.6/2">During the final day of Committee, the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, tabled a number of amendments which my noble friend Lady Ashton agreed to take away and consider properly before returning to the issue, as suggested by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334.6/3">Having now had that opportunity to consider those amendments further, including discussing in considerable detail with the Law Society, we now bring forward these amendments which we believe address the issues raised during Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334.6/4">As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, noted during Committee, these amendments are both numerous and technical in nature, and I shall therefore resist addressing each one in detail. Their intention is to amend Schedule 16 of the Bill, in turn amending the Solicitors Act 1974, the Administration of JusticeAct 1985 and the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990, which relate to solicitors, recognised bodies and foreign lawyers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334.6/5">We agree there is a need to update those provisions further to ensure that they are consistent with practice among other legal professions&mdash;we seek to make the Solicitors Act 1974 more flexible in order to do so&mdash;to remove any anomalous provisions, to facilitate more competitive working practices between business and solicitors and to update legislation so that it reflects advances in current practice.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334.6/6">This is one of a number of large groups of government amendments which make changes to existing legislation under which the legal professional bodies, and principally the Law Society, regulate their members. The amendments are largely inspired by the Law Society, and are intended to enable the society to more effectively regulate the profession. We believe that they achieve what is sought.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334.6/7">In Committee my noble friend Lady Ashton confirmed to the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, that the Government intended to bring forward these amendments. However, I should draw to the attention of noble Lords that amendments in the next group relating to the Law Society's powers to rebuke and reprimand, and enhanced regulatory powers in relation to sole practices as well as the power to require information have not, as yet, been tabled by the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334.6/8">We want to make it plain that this is not because the Government do not support the principle, nor that there is anything between the Government and the Law Society in this regard. The reason for not bringing forward these amendments at this stage is simply because the issues are complex, and we need to do further work with the Law Society to ensure that the amendments we bring forward properly deliver the outcome both the Government and the Law Society want.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334.6/9">I know that noble Lords will understand the amount of work that has been involved in bringing forward such a large number of amendments, which for the most part relate to the existing regulatory regime. But I hope that they will agree the value of these amendments and will indulge me in seeking a little more time to ensure that we get the remaining few amendments right.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334.6/10">We will be able bring forward amendments to the Law Society's power to require information at Third Reading, and I am confident that the Government will be in a position to bring forward amendments in the other two areas at a later stage in the Bill's passage. However, I hope that noble Lords may take further reassurance from the fact that it would be possible to make these amendments under an order that could be made under the proposed amendment to Schedule 22&mdash;Amendment No. 648.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334.6/11">The amendment, which responds to one made in Committee by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, provides a transitory power to modify the functions of bodies. Should it not prove possible to bring forward amendments during the passage of the Bill, I confirm that the Government would make these amendments a high priority for any Schedule 22 order.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334.6/12">Although this group deals with amendments to Schedule 16, there is a matter under Schedule 17, tabled under a later group, which I would also like to address. We have endeavoured to table an amendment giving the Council for Licensed Conveyancers a power to charge in specific circumstances for carrying out an investigation into allegations made against a licensed conveyancer. That is the only outstanding issue for the council, and one with which we entirely agree. However, there are still some unresolved issues surrounding exactly how that power should be drafted to give effect to such an amendment, but we recognise the desirability of giving the council that power.</p>
	<p pid="a.1334.6/13">As I said earlier in relation to the Law Society's requested powers, we are trying to see whether it is possible to bring forward an amendment that is mutually agreeable at a later stage in the Bill. However, if that is not possible, such an amendment would again be given a high priority under the list of modifications sought under a Schedule 22 order. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.1337.3/1" pwmotiontext="asked">asked Her Majesty's Government what plans they have to develop the education of young people in custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337.3/2" pwmotiontext="asked">The noble Baroness said : My Lords, I am happy to have secured this debate and such a distinguished array of speakers. I am particularly looking forward to the maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, whose expertise will contribute greatly to this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337.3/3" pwmotiontext="asked">The education of young people in custody is an issue that troubles me, and I want to share some of my concerns and pose some questions to the Minister. A good touchstone for how we deal with young people is the <I>Every Child Matters</I> agenda, with its outcomes of the right of the child to economic well-being, health, safety, enjoyment, achievement and making a positive contribution. The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child states that the welfare of the child is paramount. The same conditions set out in <I>Every Child Matters</I> and the UNCRC should apply to children in custody but often do not. I know that those young people have sometimes done terrible things; I am not saying that there should not be punishment. But for many young people, punishment simply does not work; punishment is just more of the same. Some 80 per cent of those leaving custody reoffend. Many of those young people have suffered cruelty, abuse, deprivation, lack of stimulus and rejection, and they are left with no aspirations. They are damaged children, and it does not help society or them to impose further damage. This morning, I spoke with the Children's Commissioner for England, who expressed his disquiet at the criminalisation of children. He told me that Canada has achieved a reduction of 60 per cent of children in custody since 2003 and a 6 per cent decrease in youth crime. Maybe we should look for examples of good practice further afield.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337.3/4" pwmotiontext="asked">The education that these children need is not just about literacy and numeracy, important though they are, but about social skills, health education and skills for life, including the ability to get a job or further education. We need to be visionary about this. Of course, custody should be the last resort, but once in custody, gaining education and skills is important. I welcome the first edition of the National Children's Bureau <I>Healthier Inside</I> magazine, which gives news and examples of good practice taking place across secure settings and themed around <I>Every Child Matters</I>. I highly recommend it to your Lordships.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337.3/5" pwmotiontext="asked">The Learning and Skills Council, which has responsibility for education provision in young offender institutions, states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1337.3/6" class="indent" pwmotiontext="asked">&quot;The majority of 15 year olds in juvenile establishments have had little or no formal education or training. As well as low levels of basic skills, many of them will have particular learning difficulties that need additional support&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337.3/7" pwmotiontext="asked">I have a few statistics. The Youth Justice Board reports that around 150,000 children and young people under the age of 18 enter the youth justice system each year, and about 70,000 of those are of compulsory school age. About half are underachievers, a third need help with literacy and numeracy, and 15 per cent have a special educational needs statement, in comparison to 3 per cent of the general population. Some 60 per cent have difficulties with communication, 83 per cent of boys had been excluded from school and 41 per cent were aged 14 or under when they were last in school. That set of facts presents a challenge for any system of education, and I am aware that there are dedicated people who are attempting to better the lot of young people in custody, but those damaged youngsters need intensive efforts and urgent help.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337.3/8" pwmotiontext="asked">The Youth Justice Board has prioritised the provision of education and training, health and mental healthcare and support in finding accommodation after release from custody. But the way in which the secure regime works makes it difficult to provide consistent and relevant education. Sentences tend to be short&mdash;on average four months&mdash;and transfers between institutions are frequent. It appears that educational establishments are reluctant to admit young people who have recently served a custodial sentence. Indeed, Section 562 of the Education Act 1996 exempts local education authorities from having to provide education to children who are detained under a court order. The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has expressed particular concern about the lack of a statutory right to education for young people in custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337.3/9" pwmotiontext="asked">The DfES has identified many of the problems through responses to its consultation paper <I>Reducing Re-offending through Skills and Employment</I>. Those problems include negative experiences of learning; lack of continuity between school and offender provision; exclusion from school; transfer between agencies, which disrupts learning; the need for records of achievement; and the need for vocational options. What has happened to those recommendations?</p>
	<p pid="a.1337.3/10" pwmotiontext="asked">A recent Youth Justice Board Report published research findings on the barriers faced by young people in the youth justice system when trying to access education, training and employment. The issues identified included low attainment, detachment from school&mdash;sometimes due to bullying&mdash;pupil/teacher relations, size of class, and disruption of education by being in custody. Youth justice practitioners see complex rules on benefits and allowances, lack of continuity of education between custody and the community, lack of support for special educational needs, and inability to access education because of being in the youth justice system. Strategic barriers included educationalists' lack of knowledge of the youth justice system, confused responsibilities and lines of accountability&mdash;such as whether the YOT worker, the school, college or Connexions adviser is responsible for the young person&mdash;and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337.3/11" pwmotiontext="asked">I am aware that the DfES published a consultation paper on education and training for young peoplein the youth justice system in April. It looks at four areas: transition from custody to community, the delivery of a personalised curriculum, workforce development, and clarifying accountability for the education of young offenders. What will happen to this consultation and in what timescale? The problem is urgent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337.3/12" pwmotiontext="asked">Young offenders should be a priority for LEAs, schools, FE colleges and training providers, otherwise we risk a cycle of deprivation, disengagement with society and ensuing reoffending. Guidance is urgently needed for LEAs, as well as training for staff in how the youth justice system works, designated staff in schools and colleges with responsibility for these young people, appropriate education delivered in a consistent way, local schools admissions policies for young people in the criminal justice system, and access to special educational needs co-ordinators for secure training centres and youth offender institutions. An educational plan should be tailored to individual young offenders and should follow the young person. Resettlement planning should have a specific education and training element, agreed with all partners. What joint work is there on young offenders between the Minister's department and other relevant government departments, particularly those with some responsibility for offender management and communities? Partnership and collaboration is essential at both government and local level to secure a better future for young offenders and for society. I would not wish to see <I>Every Child Matters</I> become simple rhetoric.</p>
	<p pid="a.1337.3/13" pwmotiontext="asked">I am delighted that the Minister for Education is responding to this debate, stressing education as opposed to criminality. I know that he has a broad view of the importance of education and is genuinely concerned about this issue. I hope that he will be able to tell us that young people in custody will have a better future than they now do.</p>

	<p pid="a.1340.0/1">My Lords, it is just as well that the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, is listening to us today. If it was a Minister from the Home Office, it would be on their last day and there would not be much point in talking to them. I hope that he has a slightly longer timescale in mind. We wish him well with the new Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.1340.0/2">I am grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, for giving me the chance to talk on this subject, albeit briefly. I will address a couple of points. One is the curriculum in custody. It currently appears to be very much at the LSC's level of thinking&mdash;courses designed basically for people out there in the community. For a lot of these kids, we need to reach much deeper. We must get right back to the level of socialisation&mdash;equipping them with the underlying human skills necessary to tackle life and education. We should start by creating a structure where they can develop a trusting relationship with staff. A lot of these children do not have any experience of that kind of relationship or, if they have, it has broken down. Once that is in place, we should work from there to offer a real experience of teamwork, getting on with people, giving and taking orders, and learning how to exist in relationships.</p>
	<p pid="a.1340.0/3">If kids are only in for four months, that sort of thing might be achieved in that timescale. We must focus everything on that set of achievements. We must do away with things like 24-hour in-cell TV, which is immensely disruptive of any attempt to build relationships. Kids just hide themselves away in their cells, and do not need to engage with the outside. We must really concentrate on having a proper PSHE programme. You cannot learn anything unless you know the basics of PSHE; I do not mean the condom-on-a-banana sort of PSHE, but the kind of programme that is really well developed in schools like Wellington and others which are really taking this forward. We need a big emphasis on the sort of activities where you can really appreciate teamwork, such as team sports and others, which kids can really involve themselves in. Once a kid is becoming socialised, you want to reintroduce them to education. That requires giving them a hook&mdash;something that they can hang on to as a real motivation to get involved in education. Whether it be art, music or practical work, that must be the emphasis, and not some precipitate rush back into the academic curriculum which these kids have rejected, or which has rejected them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1340.0/4">We can do a lot more to make these institutions educational institutions. We want to see the teachers in these places having a real career structure, with training at the bottom. I know that the Government want to see proper training, but it must be prison-specific. Teachers need to learn how to deal with extremely manipulative young men. They need to learn prison craft and how to build relationships in a way which is just not necessary for teachers outside; they are required to give that sort of one-on-one support. They need a career structure which leads upwards. It ought to be possible. I cannot see why a teacher should not aspire to become the number one governor of a YOI. That would give education a real status within the Prison Service. These institutions ought to have much better links with pupil referral units and the other educational institutions outside, which these children will be going on to. I see no reason why that should not be possible. Teachers run boarding schools. There is not an awful lot of difference.</p>

	<p pid="a.1341.0/1">My Lords, the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, has raised an important issue. I will concentrate my remarks on the education of juveniles&mdash;offenders aged 18 or under&mdash;in young offender institutions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/2">Education is crucial to the prospects of diverting young people from crime on release. Most young offenders in custody have been permanently excluded or have persistently truanted from school. A third of those entering custody have had no education at all in the previous six months. Youth Justice Board studies have shown that, when they are released, educational underachievement is one of the strongest factors associated with reoffending.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/3">The Government deserve some credit. Provision for the education of juveniles in custody has improved considerably since the establishment of the Youth Justice Board and the resulting injection of greater resources into custodial regimes for this age group, but there are some serious problems. All too often, juveniles in custody do not receive the minimum amount of education prescribed by the Youth Justice Board. The YJB requires a minimum of 25 hours in young offender institutions, and that this should be achieved for90 per cent of young people. Against that, the reality is that 40 per cent of juveniles in young offender institutions were receiving less than 20 hours of education a week. At two establishments, over half the young people were receiving less than 15 hours. There is a gap between what is required and what really happens.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/4">The Offenders Learning and Skills Service and the Youth Justice Board require one-third of programmes to comprise basic skills education, one-third academic or vocational subjects, and one-third physical education, arts, IT and personal, social and health education. What is the reality? The range of vocational courses in many young offender institutions is far too narrow, restricting young people's ability to gain skills that will help them to gain employment or enter further training on release.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/5">What are the difficulties? The first is attracting teachers to work in young offender institutions and retaining them. Secondly, because education must be delivered for 50 weeks a year in custody, teachers do not benefit from school holidays in the same way as teachers in the community. Thirdly, the statutory probation year for a newly qualified teacher cannot be completed by working in custody, so staff often leave to complete the year in mainstream education and do not return. Fourthly, many do not feel that they are valued or rewarded for working with particularly difficult young people. Finally, there is no clear career structure comparable to the mainstream education system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/6">For the short period which most young offenders spend in custody, 92 per cent of juveniles sentenced receive detention and training orders. These range from four months to two years, of which half is spent in custody and the other half under post-release supervision. Many young people are in custody for a few weeks or months, which makes it difficult for them to complete externally organised qualifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.1341.0/7">How do we alleviate the problem? There is a need for streamlined arrangements so that young offenders may continue their education on release. However, we can expect that, even where young people have made educational progress, it will often break down quickly when they leave custody. A recent audit for the Youth Justice Board found that over half of young offenders had no arrangements for education, training or employment a month after being released. Only 6 per cent of youth offending teams said that young people were able to continue the education and training received in custody after release. In 2004-05, under60 per cent of young people being supervised by youth offending teams following release were in suitable full-time education, training or employment. This compares with 74 per cent of all those supervised by youth offending teams now. There are many important aspects but time is short. I will pass my further notes to the Minister so that he can adequately deal with the questions that I wish to raise.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1342.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100949" speakername="Baroness Coussins" colon=":" colnum="1342"  time="019:41:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0013.htm#07050836000025">
	<p pid="a.1342.0/1">My Lords, I am glad to have the opportunity to make my maiden speech on such an important topic. I would like to see the DfES consultation lead to a new and explicit commitment to include alcohol education for young people in custody. This aspect of education is often completely overlooked or tacked on as an afterthoughtto substance misuse programmes which focus on drugs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1342.0/2">I should first declare various interests. Until March this year I was a trustee of the Alcohol Education and Research Council, and until September 2006 was the chief executive of the Portman Group, an industry-funded body encouraging responsible behaviour by consumers and drinks producers. The Portman Group's then charitable arm, the Drinkaware Trust, funded a project at Winchester prison where alcohol education sessions were run by the charity Alcohol Concern. The Drinkaware Trust is now wholly independent from the Portman Group, and is still funded by the industry but not controlled by it, which is the right arrangement and I was very pleased to have been associated with that development.</p>
	<p pid="a.1342.0/3">Young people in custody need a better understanding of how alcohol affects their behaviour, because it could help to prevent them reoffending. We do not know how many young people are in custody because of alcohol-related offences. It is reasonableto assume that many of them would not be there if they had not committed offences while under the influence. The youth lifestyles survey found a strong relationship between drunkenness and offending, albeit not a causal one. A much higher proportion of offenders aged 12 to 17 were found to be frequent drinkers than non-offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1342.0/4">Alcohol-related crime costs this country &pound;7.3 billion a year. If alcohol education could help reduce the level of reoffending, those costs would begin to come down. The second reason why these young people need alcohol education, whatever their offence, is that they are likely to have missed out on it at school. It is part of the national curriculum. However, as we have already heard, one survey found that 83 per cent of boys in youth offender institutions had been excluded from school.</p>
	<p pid="a.1342.0/5">Alcohol education is not by itself a magic solution, but it can play a vital part in helping to inform and motivate personal responsibility. The Drinkaware Trust publishes an excellent resource called <I>Streetwise</I>, and I understand that tentative discussions are under way to adapt it for a youth offender audience. I encourage the Department for Education and Skills to get involved in this project.</p>
	<p pid="a.1342.0/6">My final point is that interventions on alcohol need to be specifically identified, with dedicated resources. A survey in Winchester prison revealedthat although 49 per cent said that they would like to make use of an alcohol counselling service, amazingly 37 per cent of that group were not eligible for it because they did not also have a drug problem. Alcohol misuse alone did not qualify for help. Similarly, in the school curriculum there is sometimes a tendency in PSHE lessons to concentrate on illegal drugs and forget about alcohol. &quot;Substance misuse&quot; is often interpreted as meaning drugs not including alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="a.1342.0/7">The pendulum should not swing the other way and give alcohol undue prominence or blame. Alcohol is legal, drinking is normal and in moderation can even be beneficial. But young people in custody are more likely to come from disadvantaged backgrounds, including those with alcohol problems. Like over90 per cent of adults in this country, they too will drink, so must be given the opportunity to learn how to do so without causing harm to themselves or others.</p>
	<p pid="a.1342.0/8">The average time that a young person remains in custody is four months. That is surely enough time for them to benefit from some alcohol education. I hope that the review by the Department for Education and Skills will take this issue on board.</p>

	<p pid="a.1344.0/1">My Lords, it is a great privilege to follow the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, in her maiden speech. It was refreshingly direct and well informed. I am sure that it augurs well for her contributions in the future. I am just sorry that she only had four minutes; I would have liked to listen to her for longer. Her wider experience in corporate responsibility and self-regulation are badly needed in much of our deliberations. We look forward to all that she will have to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.1344.0/2">My noble friend Lady Massey of Darwen is also to be warmly thanked for giving us the opportunity for even a brief word on this important subject. She was right to emphasise that many in young offender institutions have been failed by society and we must face that reality. The reasons that they have been failed are complex; there is a matrix. There are many things to be tackled in society itself. The challenge is to have fewer people falling into crime rather than discussing how we help those who have fallen.</p>
	<p pid="a.1344.0/3">In the midst of all that we must never forget the issue of mental illness which is a highly relevant but very difficult issue. Many people in young offender institutions and prisons should not be there at all because they need more specialist support, analysis and help from professionals than can possibly be provided by dedicated staff in the institutions which basically provide custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.1344.0/4">Rehabilitation, as I never tire of saying in these debates, must be the top priority in our penal system. Not to have rehabilitation as the top priority is madness: it fails the young; it fails the prisoners; it leads to more wasted, and continued wasted, lives;it is economic nonsense because of the cost of reoffending later. If we are to make rehabilitation the key priority and mean it, then education is central to that; and if education is to be central, then it must be not only formal education, certainly, but also skills education and wider social education, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, sensibly argued.</p>
	<p pid="a.1344.0/5">I was president of the YMCA in England. The YMCA works with young offenders in young offender institutions. I was fascinated by that work. It brought home to me how serious the lack of education is among many of those who end up in this situation. It also brought home how much could be done. With education we have the living evidence&mdash;people who have gone on to make a success of their lives. Indeed, they have gone on to become university graduates and postgraduates, having been given the opportunity to release their talent and put it to good use.</p>
	<p pid="a.1344.0/6">I commend the Government for the interdepartmental work that they are undertaking in recognition of the matrix. I am glad that my noble friend Lord Adonis is replying tonight; I just wish that his department had the lead responsibility for ensuring that education happens in all our penal institutions. He will forgive me for making this point, but I never understood why in the last Act we did not endorse that principle. Our approach to young offenders has seen far too much emphasis put on punitive attitudes and policy. The challenge is to rebuild with the young people themselves their lives and to turn those young people into positive citizens. If we want to do that, resources are essential.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1345.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100375" speakername="The Earl of Listowel" colon=":" colnum="1345"  time="019:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0013.htm#07050841000007">
	<p pid="a.1345.0/1">My Lords, I congratulate Her Majesty's Government on their significant investment in the education of young people in custody. I regret that there is not time now to acknowledge in detail what has been achieved. Much more needs to be done, of course. Edmund in Shakespeare's &quot;King Lear&quot; says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1345.0/2" class="indent">&quot;Now, gods, stand up for bastards!&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1345.0/3">I should like to concentrate on how we educate young people in custody about relationships. Those young people have often never had the experience of being cared for. It is hard to follow the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, on this, but I shall try.</p>
	<p pid="a.1345.0/4">Academic and vocational attainments are vital, as we have heard, but the other side of the coin is a young person's social education, or what the continentals contain in their discipline of pedagogy&mdash;education in the widest sense. Custody officers need to model good relationships to their young offenders, as the Carlile report emphasised. While most sentences are brief, many young people will return on several occasions. Each time, their relationship with their personal officer and the wider officer community should be an educative experience. That is one reason why improvements in training and continual professional development for custody officers are so essential, as we have heard. To be consistent models and to effectively engage, officers need a theoretical foundation for their work, appropriate supervision, and consultation with expert practitioners and mental health professionals. The same should go for teachers working in these environments. Officer retention and stability in the workforce must be aimed for.</p>
	<p pid="a.1345.0/5">A separate point is that, with the recognition of the need for the secure estate, probation, social services, the health service and youth offending teams to work together to achieve reductions in reoffending, Her Majesty's Government should accelerate their programme of workforce development in the secure estate. That young people leaving custody too often walk off the face of a cliff serves no one's interests. Professional partnership requires parity of professional status.</p>
	<p pid="a.1345.0/6">A documentary recording the life of a young boy growing up in care shows him learning about relationships. Throughout his childhood in care, we hear on several occasions&mdash;in the run-ups to Christmas and to his birthdays&mdash;how much he is looking forward to seeing his father. On each occasion, the father simply does not turn up.</p>
	<p pid="a.1345.0/7">Many of the young men and women in custodyare already parents. I recognise the important achievements of the Government in investment and staff development, but it is vital to go far further in developing officers and residential care workers. The personal officer/worker role must be thoroughly embedded and developed, but too many inspections point to its neglect. If we wish to prevent reoffending and break the cycle of low-achieving families, more attention needs to be paid to the social education of young offenders. Personal officers should be consistent, should take an interest in the welfare and progress of their young offenders and should keep their undertakings. They need to be trained and supported to do so. That is how the young men and women may have their first experience of a positive parental figure and how they may begin to learn how they might be consistent towards, take an interest in and keep their undertakings to their children. We need to stand up for, so to speak, bastards&mdash;children in whom parents have not invested themselves. Otherwise we should not say,</p>
	<p pid="a.1345.0/8" class="indent">&quot;How sharper than a serpent's tooth ... is ... a thankless child&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1345.0/9">but rather,</p>
	<p pid="a.1345.0/10" class="indent">&quot;As we sow, so shall we reap&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.1346.0/1">My Lords, I thank my noble friend Lady Massey of Darwen for instigating this short but important debate. Education is a vital part of our social and cultural being. If this is denied us, we lose both the cement of valuable relationships and the bricks on which many of us build our future lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.1346.0/2">In my short contribution, I want to pay tribute to the teachers who teach young offenders in custody. It is not easy for any worker to work in a prison andfor teachers there is a need for special patience and expertise. The 2004 report by the Esm&eacute;e Fairbairn Foundation, <I>Rethinking Crime &amp; Punishment</I>, contains a fascinating quotation from the <I>Times</I> of 1867. It asks the question:</p>
	<p pid="a.1346.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Which is best, to pay for the policeman or the schoolmaster&mdash;the prison or the school?&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1346.0/4">Although I value our police force tremendously, in the context of this debate I would opt for the schoolteacher. As long as young offenders are in custody, we as a society have a major responsibility to provide the right education for them. For this, we need the expertise and specialisms of dedicated teaching staff. There can surely be no better dedication than to want to help children who are, for whatever reason, serving a custodial sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1346.0/5">I first became interested in this specialist teaching when a relative of mine left teaching in a school in Essex to teach young offenders in a nearby young persons unit. It was a bold step and she had to learn quickly about what often already damaged children were capable of and what their complex requirements were. Despite some traumas in the beginning, she ultimately found her experience both satisfying and rewarding. Some of her pupils on leaving the establishment in which she taught kept in touch with her. Some reoffended, but others did not. She took a certain satisfaction in hoping that she had helped them when they most needed it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1346.0/6">To find out the situation facing teachers working in custodial establishments today, I spoke to members of the National Union of Teachers who work in this area. They made two key points. First, the mainaim of teachers working in secure education establishments is to ensure that they play a major role in the pupil's overall progress. They want to be a key part of the throughcare that is provided by all the professionals working together. They want to ensure that they have a place in the investment and commitment that enable the young people to become stronger and less insecure, to function socially and to catch up academically. I know that your Lordships will agree that this is a worthy aim and I know that the Minister will do all that he can to help them to achieve it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1346.0/7">The second issue is the age of teachers working in custodial care. At present, 70 per cent of the NUT teachers working in this area are between 40 and 60 and a further 11 per cent are over 60. Younger teachers are not considering working in the secure units or the local authority children's homes. Those already teaching there are rightly worried that their younger counterparts are not joining them. One of the main reasons appears to be that there is no career structure for those who choose to educate young people in custody, as the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, outlined. My noble friend the Minister may wish to consider this problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.1346.0/8">Providing sound education must be one of the better ways in which we as a society can help in preventing reoffending. To teach young offenders takes special, caring, talented and motivated individuals, and we should pay tribute to them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1347.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100840" speakername="Lord Ramsbotham" colon=":" colnum="1347"  time="019:59:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0014.htm#07050841000018">
	<p pid="a.1347.0/1">My Lords, I join those who have thanked the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, for securing the debate and I congratulate my noble friend Lady Coussins on her stimulating maiden speech. In that spirit, I also thank the noble Lord, Lord Adonis, for sending those taking part in this debate a copy of the consultation document, which I had not seen before. I read it with a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave; vu, because, 10 years ago, as Chief Inspector of Prisons, I started taking Ofsted with me into young offender establishments, writing reports giving all the details that I recognise here and making a whole stream of recommendations about what should happen. I find it rather galling that, 10 years later, we are saying exactly the same thing again.</p>
	<p pid="a.1347.0/2">The advantage of these short debates is that people have to concentrate on one subject. I hope that the aggregation of the separate subjects will add up to fuel and ammunition for the Minister to cope with and take forward. I shall concentrate on one specific issue. While this report rightly concentrates on the delivery of education and what should be there, it has to be based on assessment. As the report itself says, assessment is one of the weakest aspects in what has happened so far because it is patchy. There is not enough information about a young person's learning progress and personal educational needs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1347.0/3">As I have said in the House before, the only time that I discovered in any prison someone who was able to reach 100 per cent of all young offenders was when I was introduced in a young offender establishment, in Polmont, to a speech and language therapist. The governor said to me that if he had to get rid of all his staff, the last one out of the gate would be that therapist. When I asked why, he explained that she was able to unlock all the needs of all the young offenders&mdash;in education, healthcare, behaviour and discipline&mdash;because she enabled them to communicate. Only through that communication could they tell the people what was actually required. Importantly, this communication helped them to build the relationships that the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, and my noble friend Lord Listowel have mentioned as being so critical here.</p>
	<p pid="a.1347.0/4">I have mentioned this many times before in this House and in reports as Chief Inspector of Prisons from 2000 onwards. Lady Helen Hamlyn funded speech and language therapists in two young offender establishments for two years and it was academically evaluated by a professor from the University of Surrey. The evaluation proved conclusively that these therapists were essential to the proper understanding of what these young people needed so that resources could be deployed to best effect. Still nothing has happened. Why? Apparently primary care trusts are responsible for speech and language therapists and they have to come in health plans. The Department for Education and Skills says that it is not up to it even though communication skills are essential. The Home Office consistently refuses to fund assessment. The Minister for Social Exclusion, to whom I have spoken about this, says that nothing is more socially exclusive than the failure to communicate and that communication is the scourge of the 21st century.</p>
	<p pid="a.1347.0/5">Tomorrow sees the launch of a new Ministry which did not appear in the list talked about in the House: the Ministry of Justice. Could I hope that, on day one, the Ministry of Justice will realise that for several years what everyone knows is essential for so many of our young people has been denied, and get these therapists in to assess what can be done to make certain that young people who end up in custody get the education and the other things that they so badly need?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1348.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100667" speakername="Baroness Walmsley" colon=":" colnum="1348"  time="020:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0014.htm#07050841000023">
	<p pid="a.1348.0/1">My Lords, I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Massey, for introducing this important debate and in particular for her unequivocal statements about the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.</p>
	<p pid="a.1348.0/2">I think that all noble Lords who have spoken are agreed that one of the major factors that can be used to keep young people out of trouble is a good education. As we have heard, another major factor that young offenders have in common is their poor level of educational attainment. Many noble Lords have given us the horrifying statistics about attainment, and my noble friend Lord Dholakia has given us the horrible reality of education in prison. These are not the easiest of pupils to educate, as the noble Baroness, Lady Gibson of Market Rasen, emphasised. Many of them are in poor health due to a bad diet, smoking, drug and/or alcohol abuse. In her notable maiden speech, the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins, emphasised the point about alcohol. I believe that one of the prerequisites for addressing their education is addressing their health first, with nutritious foods, sensible exercise, drug or alcohol rehab and speech therapy where necessary. If the diet and health of ordinary children in school is the concern of educationalists, which it is, how much more attention needs to be paid to those matters when dealing with young offenders?</p>
	<p pid="a.1348.0/3">Another problem facing those who try to raise the educational and skills level of young offenders is their inability to concentrate for long. These are young people who have not been used to working hard at intellectual tasks; they need to learn to listen, speak and express their feelings just like a young child does. As the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, speech therapy is one of the things that these young people desperately need. The inability to express oneself leads to frustration and anger which often manifests itself in antisocial behaviour or criminality.</p>
	<p pid="a.1348.0/4">I have read the Next Steps document that follows on from <I>Reducing reoffending through skills and employment</I>. It contains much that is good and desirable. However, I detect a failing which I find rather concerning. Naturally, there is an emphasis on basic skills, which is right and understandable because no one can progress to other qualifications without basic literacy and numeracy. However, beyond that, I detect an emphasis entirely on skills which I believe is wrong. Of course the country needs a skilled workforce, and we have heard about the high percentage of jobs in the future that need skills. However, there is a tendency to assume that young offenders are fit for nothing but skilled labour. In fact, many young offenders are very bright with high IQs. They have been bored at school because the curriculum did not challenge or inspire them; so being bright and curious, they got into trouble. If only these young people could be inspired and challenged by a curriculum that met their needs in a learning environment that took account of their disadvantaged backgrounds, what might they achieve, not just in the direction of skills but, for some, academically?</p>
	<p pid="a.1348.0/5">As the noble Lords, Lord Lucas and Lord Listowel, said, many of these young people lack the social skills needed to work in groups. Many of them are emotionally very immature and have no idea how to resolve conflict by discussion and persuasion. In fact, many have been &quot;persuaded&quot; to do what their parents wanted through violent beatings, so they see violence as normal. Their backgrounds were not as enriched as those lucky cared-for children who were surrounded by books and toys from which they could learn, taken on trips to places of interest and had sports coaching and music lessons&mdash;the sorts of things that enrich all of our lives. In the short time allowed by the majority of sentences served by young offenders, it is impossible to address these problems. That is why, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, said, rapid diagnosis of need is essential, as is an action plan which can be commenced in custody and followed through in the community, at college and other places, after release.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1350.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100787" speakername="Baroness Morris of Bolton" colon=":" colnum="1350"  time="020:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0014.htm#07050840000002">
	<p pid="a.1350.0/1">My Lords, I am most grateful to the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, for giving the House the opportunity to debate this important topic. I also thank the Minister for sending copies of the Green Paper.</p>
	<p pid="a.1350.0/2">The debate has been marked by expert contributions and graced by the impressive maiden speech from the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins. There is no doubt that reoffending rates are increased by the insufficient provision of education and skills training for young people in custody. Although 46 per cent of the 150,000 children and young people under the age of 18 who enter the youth justice system each year are of compulsory school age, the average number of hours of education undertaken by prisoners held in young offender institutions is only 7.6 hours per prisoner per week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1350.0/3">We are not talking about well adjusted children in classes with other well adjusted children, who would probably make the most of a meagre 7.6 hours per week of teaching. When we talk about young people and children in custody, we are talking about some of the most disadvantaged in the country&mdash;the damaged children of whom the noble Baroness, Lady Massey of Darwen, spoke so powerfully. Eighty-five per cent of them have mental health problems. More thanhalf of them are addicted to drugs and alcohol. Half have spent time in care or under the supervision of social services and many have special educational needs. That is a bleak scene and I ask the Minister whether he considers that an acceptable level of educational provision for those children.</p>
	<p pid="a.1350.0/4">It is devastating that nine out of 10 juvenile offenders on the intensive supervision and surveillance programme are re-offenders. That can be due in no small part to the disruption caused to education in custody by custodial transfers. I was struck by the words of Ann Creighton of the Prisoners' Education Trust, who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1350.0/5" class="indent">&quot;what's really needed is a scheme where prisoners are not transferred at all while they are on courses. This is critical but no one is grasping that nettle&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1350.0/6">It is surprising that the Government have so far failed to implement their recommendation that there should be an electronic transfer of individual learning records. That would at least ensure continuity. In the interests of future planning, can the Minister inform us how many young offenders of compulsory school age are transferred each year?</p>
	<p pid="a.1350.0/7">One of the pleasures of my enforced rest during the past three weeks has been watching daytime television. Last week, I was moved by an interview with Mark Johnson. Mike is a drug addict who has been in prison and lived rough on the streets. His history is heart-rending and heart-warming. With the help of the Prince's Trust and great inner strength, he has turned his life around and is now helping others. He has written a book. But for every Mark Johnson, there are countless others who slip through the system.</p>
	<p pid="a.1350.0/8">The education of young people in custody is an essential component of their rehabilitation. It is vital to the prevention of re-offending. The provision of education and skills, the equipping with underlying social and communication skills so rightly identified by my noble friend Lord Lucas and the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and mentoring on leaving prison, will help to enable young offenders to rely on their achievements and not a culture of crime. That can only be good for them and for the whole of society.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1351.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100839" speakername="Lord Adonis" colon=":" colnum="1351"  time="020:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0014.htm#07050840000009">
	<p pid="a.1351.0/1">My Lords, I think that I speak on behalf of the House when I say how delighted we are that the noble Baroness is back in her place this evening. I also say how grateful we are to my noble friend Lady Massey for securing the debate on education for young people in custody and for introducing it with her customary insight and legitimate concern. We were especially glad to hear the impressive maiden speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Coussins. She brings to the House great expertise&mdash;in particular, on alcohol abuse and education&mdash;and we look forward to her future participation in our debates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/2">I begin by stating unequivocally that custody should always be a last resort for children and young people. The criminal justice system is intended to do all that it can to keep young people from custody whenever there is a viable alternative.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/3">The best antidote to youth crime is, of course, a caring family home and a good education. Better family support and better schools are at the heart of government policy. Sure Start children's centres have steadily increased the support available for disadvantaged families, assisting parents with children in theirearly education, and we have recently announced a &pound;30 million grant to create a new National Academy for Parenting Practitioners.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/4">Extended schools are offering a broader range of services, including after-school provision for older children. A new and better relationship is being built up between crime prevention agencies and schools. Safer Schools Partnerships, for example, place specially trained police officers in schools in areas of high crime to promote respect, responsibility and a safer learning environment. I have visited many such schools and have been very impressed with the work and the warm welcome that the schools give to those specially trained police officers. Evaluations show that those partnerships have had a beneficial impact, improving behaviour and attendance and building a better understanding about the role of the police and better links between the police and community. Since January, local authorities have been required to provide positive activities for young people, including those at risk of social exclusion, throughout the school year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/5">In terms of criminal justice, the police and the courts deal with approximately 150,000 young people each year, of which only 3 to 4 per cent receive a custodial sentence lasting an average of four months. It is the Government's duty to ensure that young offender institutions provide appropriate support to meet these young people's needs, which are often complex, as my noble friend Lord Judd rightly emphasised. Up to 40 per cent of young people entering custody have mental health problems; more than 80 per cent have tried drugs and are likely to bear the effects of substance misuse; alcohol misuse is common and a high proportion have special educational needs, which are often unidentified.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/6">Education plays a critical role in both rehabilitation and reducing re-offending, not least by making young offenders employable after release. Our aim is to give young people the practical and social skills to pursue crime-free lives at the end of their sentences. Yet, unsurprisingly, many in custody have had poor experiences of school. Young offendersare 20 times more likely to be regular truants thanthe general school-age population&mdash;hence often the failure to diagnose and address special educational needs. Forty-two per cent of young offenders underachieve in school; most lacking basic literacy and numeracy skills.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/7">When we created the Youth Justice Board in 1998, one of its main aims was to ensure that young offenders receive a good education in custody. The same aim underpinned our decision to transfer responsibility for offender education from the Home Office to the DfES in 2001 and our subsequent decisions dramatically to increase both spending and minimum standards. I am glad to tell the House that the current chairman of the Youth Justice Board, Graham Robb, is a former head teacher and passionately committed to improving education for young offenders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/8">I was glad to hear the positive comments of the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, about the YJB's work. Although I fully accept that, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, has said, much remains to be done. However, I think that he would accept that the position is better than when he was writing his powerful reports a decade ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/9">Since the creation of the Youth Justice Board, we have seen significant improvements in educational provision. During 2005-06, the 17 young offender institutions delivered an average of 28.2 hours of education, training and personal development activity per individual per week. That is a fourfold increase compared to 2002. In the 15 secure children's homes and the four secure training centres, the percentage of young people receiving 30 hours or more education and training was 79.9 per centand 99.4 per centrespectively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/10">Government spending on young offender custodial education&mdash;in my experience, spending is alwaysthe prime indicator of whether a Government are committed to something or not&mdash;rose from &pound;5 million to &pound;20 million, a fourfold increase between 2002 and 2005, which has meant that more institutions can employ far more teachers. I echo the tribute that my noble friend Lady Gibson paid to the work of teachers in young offender institutions. That also means that they can employ more learning support assistants and arrange additional specialist services for young people under their care.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/11">From <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-31">31 July</phrase> last year, all young offender institutions became part of the new Offender Learning and Skills Service, whereby their education and training programmes are planned and funded by the Learning and Skills Council. This is creating a more co-ordinated and consistent service and represents an important first step towards integrating offender learning with mainstream education and skills training, which&mdash;and I say this in reply to my noble friend Lord Judd&mdash;is my department's guiding principle for action in this area. Although I accept that he wishes that we had been able to go further in the recent Learning and Skills Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/12">One of the Learning and Skills Council's duties is to monitor the qualifications achieved by all young offenders. In 2005-06, 42.5 per cent of those in young offender institutions improved by one skill level in literacy and numeracy. The fact that we now have this kind of data responds to the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham. There is far better tracking of individual offenders than used to be the case. Given the Learning and Skills Council's more recent involvement in this area, we would hope to see this figure rise in the next set of results and to see much better and consistent tracking of individual young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/13">From 2007-08, we have also improved access to education maintenance allowances for young people in custody. With immediate effect, young people can apply for EMAs while in custody, without the need to submit evidence of financial income. That means that they will receive the EMA when they enrol on a valid learning programme. Such measures are simplifying the application process for offenders and are avital incentive to engage in education or training immediately upon release. Another step we are taking is to review the local authority funding formula for Connexions services aimed at young people in custody, to help ease their transition back into community life. So we are making progress.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/14">The noble Baroness, Lady Morris, asked if we are satisfied with the status quo. I can tell her absolutely straightforwardly that we are not. We believe that much more needs to be done, while accepting that transforming the prospects of young offenders is extremely difficult, not least when, as the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, so rightly noted, some have serious behavioural problems, refuse to attend classes, or are distracted by other worries. Our concern is systematically to raise the availability and quality of provision, to reduce variations in the quality of teaching and support between institutions, and to gain a more accurate picture of performance in each as a spur to further improvements.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/15">My noble friend Lady Massey asked about intergovernmental working. I am glad to be able to tell her that to bring about further improvements following the Green Paper in 2005, we created a new policy team in my department to work closely with the Home Office, the Department for Work and Pensions, the Youth Justice Board and the Learning and Skills Council on reviewing provision. There is now an inter-ministerial group on reducing reoffending, including representation from the Department for Communities and Local Government. In our recent <I>Next Steps</I> document, which was published last December and which I circulated to noble Lords before the debate, we have encouraged children's trusts, local authorities and the new local partnerships to develop vocational education for 14 to 19 year-olds and to pay greater attention to education services for young offenders. Many local authorities had, in fact, already set their own targets. Kensington and Chelsea, for example, is focusing on the percentage of 16 to 18 year-olds leaving custody who then participate in full-time education, training or employment. We would like more local authorities to follow that lead.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/16">We are now in the middle of a public consultation on the <I>Next Steps</I> document, which runs until <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-04">4 July</phrase>. It covers all young people in England aged between10 and 17 who are supervised by the youth justice system, both in custody and in the community, with a particular focus on offenders of compulsory school age. It includes consideration of all three types of secure establishment: young offender institutions, secure training centres, and secure children's homes. Responses to our consultation will play a key role in how we prioritise the issues and develop policy, and the Government are encouraged by the input from many working in the youth justice and voluntary sectors. In reply to the direct question asked by my noble friend Lady Massey, I can tell her that we are committed to publishing further plans by the end of this year in response to that consultation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/17">I shall briefly highlight four key areas covered by the <I>Next Steps</I> document, which are of direct relevance to today's debate. First, we are exploring ways of ensuring that custodial regimes are organised to best promote participation in education. For some young people, the structured environment of a custodial institution is conducive to education. For others with poor memories of school, however, other incentives are needed to engage them in learning. In particular, we recognise the high incidence of special educational needs among young offenders. Issues under consideration include the prompt sharing of information from existing SEN statements, and ensuring that the additional support identified in those statements is provided in youth custody.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/18">Secondly, as the noble Lord, Lord Lucas, rightly highlighted, we need a curriculum that is well suited to the needs of young offenders. Programmes should make teaching basic literacy and numeracy a priority, but they must also go on to equip young people with wider skills&mdash;including PSHE, social skills, and relationship skills, which the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, mentioned&mdash;which young people need both to apply for jobs and to become better citizens when they leave their custodial settings. This means identifying the means to provide consistent learning programmes across the secure estate, as transfers between establishments are sometimes unavoidable, and spanning the period before and after custody. It also requires the recognition that many young offenders in custody do not respond well to a traditional classroom environment. We are therefore considering how the current reforms to the 14-to-19 curriculum, including the introduction of new vocational diplomas, can be applied to young offenders. The transition from custody back to community is an especially critical point for young people. The supervision and support provided in custody must continue on release. This requires planning for education, training or employment early in a young person's sentence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/19">The third area to highlight is workforce development, rightly mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Dholakia, the noble Earl, Lord Listowel, and my noble friend Lady Gibson. A set of questions and points were raised in the contributions and I will respond to them in writing. Suffice it to say that we recognise the need for considerably greater attention to workforce development in this area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/20">The fourth area that we are examining is the accountability framework for custodial education. During the Committee stage of the Education and Inspections Bill, some noble Lords argued that local authorities should have greater responsibility in this area; we are looking at this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1351.0/21">I hope I have been able to demonstrate the extreme seriousness with which we in the Youth Justice Board take this issue. When we say &quot;every child matters&quot;, that includes every child in custody. We will continue to improve the educational welfare of young offenders. We are very grateful for all the comments made in today's debate; I hope that they will help us to forge better policy in this area.</p>

	<p pid="a.1374.4/1">I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 566 to 586, 587A to 596 and 651. These are minor and consequential amendments that address a number of anomalies which have arisen as a result of amendments to the Administration of Justice Act 1985 and the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990. For example, we have brought forward amendments to remove references to &quot;complaints&quot; in both Acts, avoiding confusion with Part 6 of the Bill. We have also discussed with the Council for Licensed Conveyancers the amendments tabled by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, in Committee. These amendments give the council additional powers to allow it to delegate its functions further, to directly reprimand a recognised body and to remove the requirement for an accountant's report to be prepared by a person qualified as company auditor under the Companies Act 1989 in favour of allowing those accounts to be audited by an accountant. We are persuaded that these powers are necessary to ensure that the council can effectively and efficiently discharge its regulatory functions, so this group of amendments also covers those matters. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.1384.2/1">My Lords, the amendment enables employees of certain housing management organisations to exercise rights to conduct litigation and rights of audience in relation to specified housing-related proceedings, in particular where anti-social behaviour is an issue. Many of the bodies' employees are former local authority housing officers who on transferring to the new housing management bodies lost the ability to exercise their rights of appeal as local authority employees. I know from our discussions with stakeholders that some concerns about the supervision of those employees and to whom they will be accountable if something goes wrong when they are exercising those rights have been raised. There are safeguards that will address those concerns. The right of audience and rights to conduct litigation will be exercisable only by employees of housing management bodies that have an agreement with a local housing authority under Section 27 of the Housing Act 1985. Those agreements regulate the activities of the housing management bodies and state what they can and cannot do on behalf of the local authority and must be approved by the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384.2/2">In approving any Section 27 agreement the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government will clearly need to be satisfied that there is adequate supervision in respect of any exercise of those rights by the staff of the housing body concerned. As a result of those safeguards I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1388.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100352" speakername="Lord Kingsland" colon=":" colnum="1388"  time="020:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0020.htm#07050910000009">
	<p pid="a.1388.1/1">My Lords, this amendment, which was discussed at an earlier stage, is intended to remove the exemption from the need to hold a practising certificate which applies to solicitors in government service. At present all solicitors providing legal services in private practice are required to hold a practising certificate, and thus to contribute towards the costs of regulation. Solicitors in commerce and industry and in local government are also required to hold a practising certificate if they undertake reserved activities or if they are held out as solicitors. Government solicitors are wholly exempt from the need to hold such a certificate. Incidentally, there is no similar exemption for government solicitors in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.1388.1/2">The Government have recognised the indefensibility of the present exemption in other contexts. When the Crown Prosecution Service was created in the 1980s, prosecuting solicitors who had formerly worked in local government and were required to hold practising certificates transferred to a central government department. The Government recognised that it would be unjustified for that change of employer to remove the need for them to hold a practising certificate, so the Prosecution of Offences Act specifically provided for solicitors employed in the CPS to hold a practising certificate. Similarly, when the Bar Council's practising certificate fees became enforceable as a result of the Access to Justice Act 1999, there was no provision excluding government barristers from the need to hold a practising certificate. The result is to create a quite discriminatory situation. Government solicitors are exempt from the need to hold a practising certificate while government barristers must pay.</p>
	<p pid="a.1388.1/3">The position might be understandable if government solicitors were regarded in some way as second-class lawyers not requiring the same qualifications and not subject to the same regulatory requirements as their colleagues in private practice; but this, of course, is not the case. Government solicitors are treated as being equally professional and equally subject to professional discipline.</p>
	<p pid="a.1388.1/4">Your Lordships may recall that, in Committee, discussion took place on this amendment and the Minister suggested that because government solicitors did not hold client money, they did not pose any regulatory risk. That argument is wholly misconceived. Regulation of the solicitors' profession is not simply about the arrangements for holding clients' money or for dealing with lay clients. It also encompasses establishing qualification requirements to become a solicitor, establishing the continuing professional development requirements, establishing the rules of conduct and monitoring and enforcing compliance with the rules of conduct. All those issues are as applicable to government solicitors as they are to those in private practice. Government solicitors frequently have to advise on the lawfulness of particular action where the wishes of their Minister may not be lawfully achieved. It is essential that those advising in such circumstances are subject to professional duties, including duties to the court, to help ensure that they give independent legal advice rather than simply the advice that the Minister wishes to hear.</p>
	<p pid="a.1388.1/5">We recognise that it is inappropriate for practising certificate fees to be the same for all sectors when there are significant differences in the extent to which different sectors require the use of regulatory resources. In the case of government lawyers and lawyers in commerce, industry and local government, the cost of practising certificate fees should be less than for solicitors in private practice because they do not hold client money. The apparatus to guard against mishandling of client money is not relevant to their sector. For those reasons, the fees for solicitors employed in government and in commerce and industry should be substantially less than those in private practice; but that does not mean that they should be exempt.</p>
	<p pid="a.1388.1/6">The present legislation does not allow the Law Society to charge differential fees in that way. However, amendments to the Solicitors Act, which are already incorporated in the Bill, will give that power to the Law Society in the future. Accordingly, a requirement to hold a practising certificate will not lead to an unfair burden being put on government lawyers or on their departments, which will in practice meet the cost of their practising certificates. It will simply ensure that government solicitors are no longer unfairly exempted from the requirement to contribute an appropriate amount towards the cost of regulating solicitors. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.1392.4/1">My Lords, your Lordships may recall that we debated this matter in Committee. It concerns two issues; first, the Government have established a system&mdash;both imaginatively and correctly, in my view&mdash;whereby cost awards may be made, in future, to the successful litigant who has pro bono representation. The second issue is: what happens to the money that flows from the cost awards? The Government have established a system under the Bill whereby it will be managed by a prescribed charity. The terms of reference of that charity, and the manner in which it is to be established, have yet to be decided&mdash;but it will, of course, be a creature of charities legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1392.4/2">In Committee, our concern was for those individuals who might have views about how the cost award ought to be distributed which conflicted with the charitable scope of the prescribed charity. At the end of the debate, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, kindly suggested that I might take the time to look into the intended terms of reference of that charity, to satisfy myself that its objectives conformed with those of which, during the debate, I had said I approved. I have done so, and I am entirely satisfied about them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1392.4/3">However, there might be circumstances in which a pro bono representative has strong views about the destination of the moneys, even within the terms laid down in the charitable objectives of the prescribed charity. Amendment No. 616A is intended to require the prescribed charity to have regard to the wishes of the legal representative of the party with respect to the distribution of the award made to that party.</p>
	<p pid="a.1392.4/4">I have been much influenced by the discussions that I have had with various lawyers, in particularMr Robin Knowles, who have spent a great deal of time, entirely at the service of the general public, to ensure that the idea behind the clause gets off the ground. I applaud the work that he has done. Indeed, I would like to say to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Goldsmith, how much I admire everything that he has done for the pro bono movement. Since the early seeds were sown, it has gone from strength to strength. The fact that he is prepared to put his shoulder so firmly behind it is one of the main reasons for its success.</p>
	<p pid="a.1392.4/5">So in tabling the amendment, I do not want the noble and learned Lord to think that I am in any way trying to undermine his objectives. I am simply trying to ensure that those who do the pro bono work can, if they wish, have some say in the ultimate destination of the money. I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1393.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100245" speakername="Lord Goldsmith" colon=":" colnum="1393"  time="021:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0021.htm#07050910000041">
	<p pid="a.1393.0/1">My Lords, I start by thanking the noble Lord for three things: first, for having taken the trouble and time&mdash;he is very heavily committed on this Bill so he will have had a great deal else to do&mdash;to consider the issue and to discuss it with those whom he has mentioned. I entirely share his view on the work that they have done and I, too, pay tribute toMr Robin Knowles and others. Secondly, I thank him, as a result, for having withdrawn his previous amendment and tabled one focused on the point that he identified. Thirdly, I thank him for the very generous remarks he made at the end of his speech moving the amendment. I very much appreciate what he said.</p>
	<p pid="a.1393.0/2">I declare my interests, as I did responding to the amendments in Committee, both as president&mdash;it carries no executive responsibility&mdash;of the Bar Pro Bono Unit and as chairman of the Attorney-General's National Pro Bono Co-Ordinating Committee. I repeat those declarations.</p>
	<p pid="a.1393.0/3">I also thank my noble friend for allowing me the opportunity to propose what I regard as this important, if small, amendment to the Bill. I am grateful for the overall support that it has been given by the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. As he knows and has explained, the structure of the single charity envisaged under the clause was the subject of study by a working party set up under the auspices of the co-ordinating committee to which I referred. The membership of that working party was drawn from across the profession and the working sector. The report of the working party was fully endorsed by the full co-ordinating committee. I know that the noble Lord has seen that report.</p>
	<p pid="a.1393.0/4">The report contemplates that among the factors to which the single prescribed charity would have regard&mdash;probably through principles rather than as a constitutional fetter&mdash;when making decisions about distribution of money received, would be any expression of preference by the legal representatives who have acted pro bono. The report emphasises that such expression of preference could not be determinative, otherwise much of the advantage of strategic perspective that the use of a single prescribed charity offers would be lost. Those who wish to express a preference would be free to do so. I can see that proper regard to such expressions of preference would be helpful in ensuring confidence in the use of the prescribed charity. But, again, as the working party report emphasises, there must be a balance between having regard to preferences expressed and ensuring fair and strategic disbursement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1393.0/5">It is intended that the single charity, which is referred to and which will be prescribed under Clause 185, will have the feature that I have just described. I hope that the noble Lord will take the view that that is sufficient to meet his concerns, without his amendment being moved. He will not be surprised to hear that I would have some difficulties with the amendment as it stands. For example, it identifies only one factor and does not mention that the charity can have regard to the others. That always creates a difficulty in the statute&mdash;there are others, but I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, has taken my point.</p>
	<p pid="a.1393.0/6">Without, I hope, adding any sour note to what has been a constructive discussion, I do not share the view expressed by some to the noble Lord, that the enthusiasm of those who do pro bono work will be dampened by thinking that money might not go to their favourite or prescribed charity. I have confidence in them, have had the privilege of seeing them at work and know that they do that work because they want to help those people who receive legal advice and assistance. For those reasons, I hope that the noble Lord will feel able to withdraw the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1393.0/7">I note that, since I spoke to the associated amendment in Committee, the Department for Constitutional Affairs has issued a consultation paper on the clause which invites comments on all aspects of the clause's implementation. I hope that that will result in constructive suggestions from many quarters.</p>

	<p pid="a.1395.1/1">My Lords, the amendment will allow the court to consider making a pro bono costs order in proceedings commenced before the clause comes into force but in relation to costs incurred after the clause comes into force. If passed, the amendment will give the court the discretion to make a costs order in a successful pro bono case, even though the case had started before the clause came into force. That might mean that in long running cases&mdash;perhaps those on their way to the Court of Appeal or even to the Judicial Committee of this House, or those that have reached only their early stages at the commencement of this legislation&mdash;the court could still make an order for pro bono costs if it considered it appropriate. That will have the benefit of expanding the proceedings in which this new power can be used. I underline that the court could not make an order in relation to costs incurred, or to work carried out, before the clause comes into force. That would be retrospective, and is not what the Government seek to do. I add that this will mean that ongoing cases are in the same position as those that have started after the clause comes into effect, so far as work done after the commencement of the legislation is concerned. It will, I hope, have the benefit of producing additional funds for the prescribed charity, which in turn may use those funds to assist the further provision of free advice. For those reasons, I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.1395.4/1">My Lords, the amendment would ensure that non-solicitors can be appointed members of the Council of the Law Society of Scotland. The governing body of the Law Society of Scotland is its council, which is currently composed exclusively of solicitors, although it has four non-solicitor observers. I have been in touch, and had correspondence, with Michael Clancy, the director of the Law Society of Scotland, who explains that he and his colleagues would very much like this provision to be made. I am also now aware that the Scottish Consumer Council is backing the move by the Law Society of Scotland to appoint non-solicitors to its governing council for the first time in history. I warmly applaud this move, and I very much hope that the Government will support it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1395.4/2">Schedule 20 is interesting because it deals with a whole range of issues relating to devolved and non-devolved matters. I do not know whether the Minister will explain whether we require a legislative consent Motion, although it would undoubtedly be difficult to require one, given the Scottish Executive's present situation. On balance, it is probably not necessary, given the other matters that are repealed in this part. As the Minister is showing an interest in this issue, I shall explain that, as I understand it, many of the repeals in Schedule 23 deal with a range of devolved issues surrounding the discharge of functions of the council. The repeals involve Section 3A, on the discharge of the functions of the Council of the Law Society; Section 20, on the council's duty to supply a list of solicitors holding practising certificates; Section 24C, on the discretion of the council in special cases;Section 34(4), on the rules of professional practice conduct and discipline; and Sections 38, 39, 42A and 42B, which all relate to council powers where dishonesty is alleged. The list of sections is considerable, and I need mention no more, except to say that, in the light of that, it is not necessary for a legislative consent Motion to be passed by the Scottish Parliament. I therefore hope that the Minister will accept the amendment. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.1397.0/1">My Lords, I listed a series of the present enactments, which surely fall within the same bracket. Is the Minister confident that the repeals that I set out do not require a legislative consent Motion? The amendment that I am moving seems very much on a par with what is already provided for within this schedule.</p>

	<p pid="a.1402.4/1">My Lords, I shall speak also to Amendments Nos. 638A to 647, and 655A to 719. As noble Lords will note, these consequential amendments are numerous and technical, so I do not propose to address each one in detail. The current regulatory framework is established under a number of provisions in existing legislation, primarily the Solicitors Act 1974, the Administration of JusticeAct 1985, the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 and the Access to Justice Act 1999. Amendments to the Solicitors Act have in the main been dealt with in Schedule 16. Those Acts variously deal with the regulation, education and training applying to the provision of advocacy, litigation, conveyancing and probate services. They also set out the persons who have a role in regulating those services, such as the Master of the Rolls, the Lord Chief Justice, the Secretary of State&mdash;the Lord Chancellor&mdash;the Legal Services Consultative Panel and the Office of Fair Trading.</p>
	<p pid="a.1402.4/2">As noble Lords will know, the Bill simplifies this model by placing the board as the single oversight regulator, sweeping away the maze of existing regulators who have overlapping responsibilities. It also sets out the board's duties in designating approved regulators in considering regulatory arrangements and ensuring compliance with the regulatory objectives. Further, a large number of existing statutory provisions refer to lawyers of a named description or certain types of legal professions. For example, many statutory provisions refer to services provided by solicitors and barristers. Under the Bill, legal services are services provided by persons authorised in respect of reserved legal activities irrespective of title. It will be possible for persons other than those with titles such as &quot;barrister&quot; or &quot;solicitor&quot; to carry out those reserved activities, so it is important that existing legislation is updated to reflect the position, covering all persons who are or may become so authorised.</p>
	<p pid="a.1402.4/3">Given the scale of these changes, it is clearly essential to repeal a number of existing provisions to the current regime, or where appropriate to amend them so that they are consistent with the regulatory framework established under the Bill. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.1405.3/1">My Lords, I declare an interest as a practising member of the Bar, a former member of the Bar Council and sometime chairman of the Bar. This is a plea by me with support from other Members of the House that we should be told more by Government about Part 5 and about alternative business structures before we allow it to be put into operation or before we allow the Legal Services Board to take steps to implement those provisions. My plea is based on the degree of ignorance we have about the alternative business structures. My primary concern is about access to justice: what is going to happen to the small firms of solicitors; and what will be the consequences on the ground of implementing Part 5 in the real world? Secondly, I have a deep query about who is going to invest in the big partnerships and what their motivation will be. Thirdly, I am concerned about the degree of our ignorance about what is happening in other countries in this area. What about the common law countries and the civil law countries, particularly in the European Union? Are we going to find ourselves in a pariah status as lawyers? At the moment the legal profession is widely admired for its integrity and independence and we need to reflect and have information before we move forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405.3/2">I will keep this discussion as brief as possible; the hour is late, but it is a serious matter. I turn to access to justice. When I spoke on the sixth day in Committee I went through the testimony that had gradually been built up in earlier debates to show how worried senior lawyers were about the state of solicitors, by which I mean the economic stability and their chances of survival in various parts of the country. The starkest warning was from the former Lord Chief Justice, the noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf. I shall not read out again what he said, but it was particularly striking, because he said he was in the position of someone whose duty it was to travel around the United Kingdom and take note of what was happening to legal practices and the state of solicitors. He found that concern was expressed countrywide, as your Lordships will find in <I>Hansard</I> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-23">23 January</phrase> this year at col. 1057.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405.3/3">On the same day the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, expressed his concern about Wales and the position of solicitors there, from close personal knowledge&mdash;his earlier practice in law was there, of course. With regard to Yorkshire and Cumbria, the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, spoke of his worry and his knowledge of the anxieties in those areas on <phrase class="date" code="2007-02-06">6 February</phrase>, and on the same day the noble and learned Baroness, Lady Butler-Sloss, spoke about the West Country, with which she is very familiar. On an earlier occasion&mdash;I have not recorded the date here&mdash;the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, stated that he was particularly concerned about the position in rural areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405.3/4">There is a feeling of concern about just how strong and stable these medium, small and very small solicitors' firms throughout the country are, and we are interested in finding out what the effect will be of the establishment of these new forms of practice. That needs to be looked at. We want to have some evidence-based conclusions that are up to date. Merely citing what Sir John Vickers may have written in 2001 in the Office of Fair Trading report will not do; in my submission, we have to have a serious study now. In a moment I will mention the literature the Minister sent me, but I have not found that it directly addresses the concerns I have in this field.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405.3/5">My second point, which is perhaps smaller, is the astonishing lack of information we have about who will come forward and fund these big partnerships. I should have mentioned that I was on the Joint Committee under the excellent chairmanship of the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Wirral. I think I am right in saying that the Co-operative Legal Services said they were enthusiastic about going down this route and supporting law firms by putting a financial stake in, but I believe that is the only bit of evidence we had.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405.3/6">I have asked this question before, but I shall repeat it: are we going to have law firms bought and sold like football clubs? Will they end up being quoted on the Stock Exchange? I believe that is just about to be developed in New South Wales. What is happening in other countries? Do we find models for these proposals working in other countries? I stated last time, and no one has contradicted me, that the United States of America has been firmly against this sort of financial participation, the ownership of firms by outside interests.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405.3/7">The only Commonwealth area about which the Minister has supplied evidence is New South Wales. I shall say a word about that because this is new material that I have not seen before. I base this all on an article written by the Legal Services Commissioner in New South Wales, a Mr Steven Mark, and his co-author, Georgina Cowdroy, the senior legal and policy officer in the commission. It appeared on page 671 of the <I>Penn State International Law Review </I>in volume 22, part 4, in 2004, and I am indebted to the Minister for kindly letting me see the article. The current position is that there are now in New South Wales some 300 incorporated legal practices. I am unable to say how many of those are multi-disciplinary, because we are not told that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405.3/8">The commissioner makes a rather interesting statement:</p>
	<p pid="a.1405.3/9" class="indent">&quot;The Law Society's records indicate that at present, there are almost 300 ILPs in NSW. The vast majority of these ILPs were previously sole practitioners or small partnerships, which changed their ownership structures to obtain the perceived benefits of incorporation. However, aside from having to comply with the ILP legislation, such practices have experienced little change in their daily management and operation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405.3/10">So they have taken on a corporate structure to derive a benefit for themselves with no thought of what good it will confer on consumers. The commissioner says elsewhere in the article that this may be disadvantageous because the limited liability obtained by the partners means that not so many purses can be pursued by the dissatisfied claimant. As I say, there are 300 of these bodies, none of which has yet become a public listed company. It is open to them to do that. Under the Legal Profession Act the solicitor's duty is paramount and duties to shareholders come second. However, it is pretty clear that the commissioner,who has had experience of these incorporated partnerships, does not really believe that. He says that despite the assurances that the legal duty to maintain professional standards is paramount,</p>
	<p pid="a.1405.3/11" class="indent">&quot;my tentative view is that where an ILP becomes publicly listed, the duty of an ILP solicitor director to the court and to clients will inevitably conflict with the duty of a solicitor director to the ILP and its shareholders. Furthermore, I believe that such conflict is irreconcilable. While the perceived conflict between professional ethics and profit is an ongoing concern in the regulation of at least some present partnerships, in publicly listed ILPs, shareholder pressure for commercial gain will introduce a dynamic for solicitor directors which was non-existent in partnership structures&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405.3/12">In other words, the profit motive is likely to become dominant and possibly irresistible, notwithstanding the fine words in the statute.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405.3/13">The other aspect that I mentioned briefly previously is that we are still in the same state of ignorance about the position regarding the civil law in European countries. The only country that we know anything about is Germany. All the members of its association equivalent of a combined Bar Council and Law Society belong to an organisation, the abbreviation of which is BRAK. It is quite obvious from the evidence that it sent to our committee that it regards our proposals as an abomination because in Germany the independence of the lawyer is enshrined in constitutional provisions of law and the notions that we are considering here would be completely impossible. In the type of structure that is contemplated here you could not have a German partner coming in as a shareholder and owning a firm. A German lawyer can have a stake but he has to be part of the firm and subject to the professional ethic. What about the position in other countries in Europe? We do not have the faintest idea what is happening in France, Sweden or Ireland. As I thought about this today it struck me what an incredibly insular approach we are taking. We are ploughing on with these proposals without making any inquiry about what happens in the rest of the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1405.3/14">My amendment would require the Government to put before us proper targeted information. I do not believe that would cause any delay. Nothing will come into force immediately. A document I was sent by one of the interested parties stated that we are looking at 2010 before the Legal Services Board will really get into action. That leaves plenty of time for a bit of decent research to come back to us within 12 months. I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-05-08a.1408.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100352" speakername="Lord Kingsland" colon=":" colnum="1408"  time="022:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70508-0023.htm#07050910000140">
	<p pid="a.1408.0/1">My Lords, we are extremely grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, for tabling the amendment. If Part 5 is to succeed, three things will be needed: rigorous procedures to ensure that those who own law firms are fit and proper persons, a guarantee that the same consumer protections will apply to externally owned law firms as well as to other law firms and the assurance that proper attention is given to the impact on access to justice before licensing decisions are taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1408.0/2">Two of those issues are dealt with satisfactorily by the Bill, which provides a comprehensive framework to ensure that external owners will be fit and proper persons. Furthermore, regulators of ABS firms will be able to ensure that the bodies that they license are subject to the same conduct of business rules and other consumer and public protection requirements as apply to existing law firms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1408.0/3">However, the Bill does not ensure proper consideration of the impact on access to justice. It is highly likely that the impact of these new providers on access to justice will vary considerably in different parts of the country. In urban areas, it may well be that externally-owned law firms would simply provide desirable extra competition without any significant consumer detriment. The position may well be different in rural areas where the existing network of law firms is already thinly spread and under considerable economic pressure. In those areas, it is entirely possible that a new provider, concentrating on easily delivered routine legal services, might flourish, but only at the expense of making existing law firms unviable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1408.0/4">That could be damaging in two separate ways. First, there is a significant risk that large new providers would not be readily accessible to disadvantaged consumers, particularly if they operated from out of town sites, as many supermarkets are. Secondly, many essential but less remunerative services may become unavailable. Existing law firms fold because the new providers are highly unlikely to offer the services concerned. Those services might include advice to parents whose children are involved in care proceedings, or help for the elderly having difficulties in relation to a care home; and they might simply become unavailable in large swathes throughout the country. Once services of that sort are lost, it will be exceedingly difficult to replace them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1408.0/5">It is imperative therefore that the Government should analyse the likely impact of ABSs before implementing this part of the Bill. Research carried out, as the noble Lord, Lord Neill of Bladen, indicated, prior to implementation of the provisions cannot be definitive; it will simply be a prediction based on economic analysis. The fact that it may not be perfect is no reason to proceed without it. Research on these lines could be particularly useful in highlighting especial risks and in suggesting what safeguards could be introduced to mitigate them.</p>
