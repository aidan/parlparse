<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-27a.592.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100804" speakername="Lord Dykes" colon=":" colnum="592"  time="017:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61127-0007.htm#0611276000026">
	<p pid="a.592.0/1">My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Wade, has combined traditional northern common sense with a very distinguished career in business and in politics. I am sure Members of the House were listening very carefully to his wise advice. He has been a very distinguished chairman of Midas. It is also a pleasure to record thanks to others who have taken part in this interesting debate, which has not ranged over too many subjects but has concentrated on very interesting ones, such as the relationship between government and business, which is an important matter for all Governments.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/2">First, I have pleasure in congratulating the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, on his arrival on the government Benches. For some time, we were both members of European Union Sub-Committee C. I deliberately embarrass him by saying that when he made his many contributions in that committee, I guessed that it would not be long before he was on the government Benches, making contributions such as that made today. We thank him for his remarks. Equally, I am sure that the noble Lord, Lord McKenzie, in reply will concentrate on the many important matters that have been raised in the debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/3">Of course, the greatest pleasure, as already recorded by a number of noble Lords, is to thank our two maiden speakers, the noble Lords, Lord Bilimoria and Lord Rowe-Beddoe. The passion of both was very extraordinary indeed and it was a great privilege for us to hear their speeches. I do not want to embarrass or annoy the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, by constructing a totally artificial and false connection, but it was marvellous to hear him in the House today. He mentioned with pride his antecedents as a Parsi. That coincides with Julian Barnes' excellent book about the son of a Parsi vicar. The vicar was Parsi by birth but became a Church of England vicar in Staffordshire and his son was cruelly, wrongfully and illegally imprisoned for crimes he did not commit in Staffordshire in the first part of the 20th century. Although there is absolutely no connection, it is wonderful to see the progress of the Parsi tradition. I hope he takes that in the spirit in which I offer it. I wish him well in his career in this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/4">The noble Lord, Lord Rowe-Beddoe, showed all the passion for Wales that we expect from our colleague, my noble friend Lord Roberts, when he is in his place. He too is well known for that passion. We wish him great success.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/5">It is worth repeating that the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury, made a great contribution as Minister and I am sure we all hope that he will continue to be a very active Member of this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/6">Considering the Queen's Speech, the contributions made today and people's thoughts on the economy, business, future progress and the huge problem of climate change, a number of themes emerge. What a contrast to the sad and terrible disaster in Iraq and the mess in the Middle East which is partly the responsibility of the US&mdash;and Britain in following the US unwisely down paths which I am sure the Government now regret. That has also been a personal tragedy for the Prime Minister who has been a very competent Prime Minister in many other ways. There is an extraordinary contrast between that failure overseas which commands so many column inches now in British newspapers&mdash;quite rightly as the mess continues and everyone wonders how we will get out of it&mdash;and the extraordinary competent success of the Government on the British economy. I believe that, since 1997, the Government are entitled to claim full credit for a number of significant achievements, especially after the years of stop-go, which were referred to when Ministers first took office after the 1997 election.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/7">Against a background of higher than usual economic growth and lowish interest rates&mdash;not as low as they could be perhaps&mdash;until the recent rise from the Bank of England to 5 per cent, and substantial new public sector and private sector capital formation, the UK has been judged to be doing very well in recent years, with a spectacular growth in earnings from some invisibles and an excellent record in foreign direct investment. As ever was, there is always a price to pay for those tangible achievements. Pollution and damage to the environment from consumer and corporate excess has become alarming in a small national territory where thinking people feel increasingly vulnerable to congestion, traffic chaos and even overshopping, including on Sundays. Some people remain opposed to that concept but we have had to accept it, although&mdash;increasingly as time goes on&mdash;it may not be to people's liking. The house price boom has added its own pressures, not all on the plus side.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/8">At the same time the UK is, as ever, a curate's egg economy if ever there was one. Our output base remains fundamentally small and truncated, as the noble Lord, Lord Brookman, said, particularly in relation to manufacturing. While we have many individual examples of highly successful companies&mdash;entrepreneurial companies, very impressive companies not only in retailing and clothing and those obvious sectors but also elsewhere, and in financial services too&mdash;sadly, for some reason, we cannot shake off our perpetual chronic trade deficit, except temporarily when the United Kingdom, post-war, has from time to time devalued. This deficit has to be propped up, as do our long-term debts, by interest rates that are often double the euro-land figures.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/9">In other words, in contrast to very successful trading corporations of all sizes in Britain and small companies, the United Kingdom and its economy is like someone who is perpetually in debt and who cannot get out of it. Our investment rates in new assets as well as our savings ratios remain stubbornly low relative to other like nations, except for recent years' big rises in public sector investment. Furthermore, the huge mistake of not joining the euro earlier has added millions of often uncalculated extra costs to companies and consumers alike in onerous exchange and bank transfer rip-off costs. Meanwhile the consumer debt ratio has rocketed to an unacceptable level in Britain. The noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, referred to that with some concern, which I share.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/10">There is increasing concern about a large number of households' viability. As a ratio of GDP the figure recently had risen to 17.4 per cent compared with 8.5 per cent in France, 7.5 per cent in Germany and 3.4 per cent in Italy. With the size of our excess imports, including of course finished durable goods, it means the public are now almost uncontrollably locked into massive unsecured debts with bank and credit card real interest rates of 30 per cent or more, and the Government do nothing about that at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/11">The comics called newspapers in the UK are now up to 350 pages of weekly or daily rubbish in huge supplements urging people to buy things they do not even need. It always amuses me how the right-wing neo-con economic fanatics and journalists such as Anatole Kaletsky castigate Germany and Japan for having low rates of domestic consumption, very high savings ratios and massive trade and export surpluses. How sinful can they get?</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/12">In many ways, Japan has the reverse syndrome to our own economy. It has high output, massive exports and a large manufacturing and processing base, but more backward farming systems shielded from competition and quite old fashioned service structures in some areas. As the noble Lord, Lord Brookman, said, we have a pitifully small manufacturing and industrial base, perpetual deficits in visible trade and too much private debt, but highly efficient agriculture&mdash;notwithstanding the problems of the common agricultural policy&mdash;and highly organised and impressive service sectors in many fields. As my noble friend Lord Lee mentioned, tourism is an important area of success and achievement.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/13">Perhaps the best blend of the two examples of the more virtuous dual economy in Europe is therefore to be found in Germany, despite the huge on-costs of East Germany it is currently bearing. However, the UK will benefit from the recent rises in FDI I referred to&mdash;presumably in terms of output and some job creation, at least&mdash;which was $165 billion in 2005. That is well ahead of the US at just under $l00 billion and, successively, the People's Republic of China, France and then, interestingly for a small country, the Netherlands. I hasten to add that the UK figure is, however, overwhelmingly dominated by mergers and acquisitions activity. Indeed, one transaction, Royal Dutch/Shell merging with Shell Transport (UK), accounted for $74 billion of the total. So the right-wing economists should not get too excited about magic new developments appearing here, there and everywhere.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/14">In the last full period, incidentally, the number of production industry workforce jobs fell by 47,000 and the number in service industries rose by 256,000&mdash;an illustration of the changing trends in the British economy. The largest fall and the lowest rate of unemployment were in the West Country at 9 per cent down and now at 3.4 per cent, while the London region showed 8.4 per cent jobless. I was glad that the noble Baroness, Lady Noakes, reminded the House that the real unemployment figure is well over 5 million, adding back those on long-term benefit who the Government are trying to persuade to get out of that situation as fast as possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/15">While house prices are fuelling inflation pressures, things like transport costs are exerting downward pressure, especially for personal transport costs. It is sad to note that the biggest upward boost to the annual inflation figures came from the rise in university tuition fees. I am sure there will be many future cases of students in financial difficulty because of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/16">I hope the Minister will have time today to deal with a number of queries. Can he clarify the Government's future intentions on the further penalising of the anti-social, polluting, gas-guzzling 4x4s hinted at by the Chancellor? That follows the excellent example in Liberal Democrat-controlled Richmond, and Mayor Livingstone's commitment to deal with Chelsea tractors outside Chelsea as well. A sharp fall in second-hand prices of these obnoxious vehicles, particularly the civilian version of the American Hummer&mdash;I do not know how many Lords have seen the civilian Hummer, but it is grotesque and right in your face&mdash;will concentrate the minds of these selfish motorists. Indeed, it should be happening already.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/17">Secondly, will the Government help the EU Commission in its battles to control outrageous mobile phone roaming costs and excessive bank and credit card transfer charges across national borders from <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2007</phrase>? This is an important matter for the Government to watch carefully, ensuring that the Commission succeeds in reducing those excessive costs. They should now be single market transactions, rather than across national frontiers. Consumers also need to be helped to get out of the debt I referred to earlier, when a chronic case of family disutility arises.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/18">Finally, can the Minister confirm that the programme of reform in the public services&mdash;here we usually mean mainly hospitals, other NHS entities and schools&mdash;will of course continue, but on a rational basis? Will it have heed to the urgent necessity of restoring morale to the operatives at all levels in both sectors, who feel increasingly battered after so much government spin and tampering in recent years? Although the debt figures of some NHS trusts need tackling, the deficit figure remains minuscule in relation to the total of NHS activity, and no hysteria engendered in the media about this is necessary. Economic achievements have to be tempered with social well-being and the avoidance of gratuitous alienation.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-27a.604.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100416" speakername="Lord Marlesford" colon=":" colnum="604"  time="018:32:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61127-0009.htm#06112716000014">
	<p pid="a.604.0/1">My Lords, I believe that the capitalist system has developed and spread in such a way that it now has the potential to deliver unparalleled benefits to the peoples of all the continents of the world. Based on advances in technology and techniques of both government economic management and business practice, we seem to have found a way forward without the problems of world trade cycles which caused such misery in the 1930s and led eventually to world war. Even the long stagnation of Japan, the world's second largest economy, was sustained with barely a few blips in the economies of the United States and Europe, while at the same time China and now India have been able to embark upon their amazing economic growth. This change is based at least in part on the Thatcherite revolution which has now become a consensus, one which Mr Blair as Prime Minister has tried, in part successfully, to maintain over the past nine years.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/2">I am quite often asked, especially by members of the business community on the other side of the Atlantic, whether the general economic strategy in Britain will change under a Gordon Brown Government. I do not know whether Gordon Brown was one of the early believers, but I think that his nine years in No. 11 and as Chancellor of the Exchequer have probably made him someone who does believe in the sort of economy which the Government appear to be trying to run. So when I reply to that question, I usually quote a response made by President Deng Xiaoping to the late Lord MacLehose who as Governor of Hong Kong inquired in 1979 about the future of Hong Kong after the Chinese takeover in 1997:</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Set your hearts at ease&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/4">I am also asked what a Cameron Government would look like. In response to that question I say&mdash;without any great inside knowledge, but perhaps in hope&mdash;that a Conservative Government will hold fast to the essentials of economic Thatcherism, avoid the mistakes made over the past 10 years, and try to correct some of them.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/5">I should like to refer to some of the specific issues which could be significant over the next two years to the leaders of all three political parties. The first is that I believe passionately in free trade, on which all economic progress and prosperity in the world must be based. In that context, as members of the European Union we are entitled to look at other major countries within the Union. I want particularly to talk about France, where what I can see augurs ill, regardless of the result of the next presidential election. Sadly, France seeks to be the nanny of Europe and is still suffering from the curse of 1789. It has long been a very difficult country to govern.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/6">I do not know how many of your Lordships read the interview given on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-13">13 November</phrase> by Mr Sarkozy to <I>Les Echoes</I>&mdash;which noble Lords will know is the French equivalent of the <I>Financial Times</I>&mdash;during which he set out an extremely clear and strong protectionist programme. He declared himself to be against globalisation and that the main objective of companies should be to employ people rather than try to make profits. He said that he believed in the differentiation of taxation between home-produced and imported products, and that neither EU preference nor protectionism were ugly words. He went on to say that he believed in progressive taxation and both in toughening wealth tax&mdash;which we avoided in this country 30 years ago&mdash;and inheritance tax. He also wanted to toughen up taxation on both second homes and all chattels. Of course he may not become the next president in April because I suspect that the French will find it hard to resist voting for the delightful Madame Royal. But in an interview through one of her people reported in the <I>Daily Telegraph</I> on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-20">20 November</phrase> said that the French will insist on a new treaty for Europe, saying that if the British do not sign up to it they will have to go it alone. She says that she will get a new deal, along with Germany, Spain and Italy. That treaty would opt for widespread protection and convergence of tax rates. So this Government and the next, which I hope will be a Conservative one, will need to resist firmly.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/7">I move on to public spending. The most important thing about public spending is that it should be efficient. I believe that there is a moral imperative not to use public money to help those who do not need help at the expense of those who do. The noble Lord, Lord Truscott, said that he praised particularly the winter fuel payment. That universal payment to all pensioners is not taxable and is, in my view, one of the worst possible uses of public money. It gives many Members of your Lordships' House, including myself, untaxed money which we do not need at the expense of those who do need it. We need to look very carefully at spending on programmes such as the winter fuel payment.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/8">That brings me to the question of poverty. There has been much discussion recently about relative and absolute poverty. I believe that absolute poverty should always have the priority. Relative poverty is a somewhat meaningless concept on the basis that, by definition, we can never bring everyone to the average and yet it is easy to describe relative poverty as relative in relation to the average. We must focus on the needs of those at the bottom, whether they are there through bad luck or inadequacy, or whether they are victims of structural changes in the economy. Whatever the reason, if they need a helping hand, that is where we should focus our efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/9">I am sorry that the noble Lord, Lord Barnett, is not in his place because I particularly enjoyed his remarks about taxation and inflation&mdash;not only because I share the general affection in which the noble Lord is held in this House but also because he played a very important part in the running of the economy of this country. He was the Chief Secretary of the Treasury between 1974 and 1979, when his noble friend Lord Healey was the Chancellor of the Exchequer. That, of course, was a period when taxation and inflation were very interesting. Taxation reached the level of 98 per cent&mdash;if you adjust the threshold at which it reached 98 per cent to today's money it is about &pound;76,000&mdash;and inflation reached 25 per cent. The noble Lord referred to the functions of the Monetary Policy Committee and said that it should not worry about a change in inflation of 1 or 2 per cent but, of course, in 1975 and 1976 inflation was running at 25 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/10">It is useful for us to recollect some of those changes. When my noble friend Lord Lawson in his 1988 Budget cut the top rate of taxation to 40 per cent, for the first time ever during a Budget speech the House of Commons had to be suspended in disorder such was the outrage expressed from some of the Labour Benches. It is much to the credit of Prime Minister Blair and Chancellor Brown that we still have that 40 per cent top tax rate. I believe that it has made a significant contribution to the economic performance of this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/11">Deregulation was referred to by the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, as a great aspiration but it is hellish difficult to achieve; all the forces are against it. The only government Minister in whom I would have confidence to tackle it is the noble Lord, Lord Rooker, because he is a tough guy; he could and he would. If I were Prime Minister, I would put him in charge of deregulation. The need for deregulation has been emphasised by many speakers in the debate today. It is a crucial point.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/12">Perhaps I may raise a couple of other points which are of great importance to this or any other Government. First, probably the biggest single structural change needed to keep the economy balanced between the working and the retired population is to raise the age level of retirement. The efforts of the Government in this respect have so far been pathetic.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/13">Secondly, the City of London has been a major contributor to the economy. It is taking over from New York and took over from Tokyo a long time ago. It has made a tremendous contribution to the prosperity of this country. It has no competitor in Europe and probably no competitor in the world. If it is involved in mergers and acquisitions, I do not mind. It is bringing prosperity to this country and therefore must be encouraged.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/14">Let me say a word about the Monetary Policy Committee. I believe strongly in an interest rate policy; it is a valuable instrument for managing an economy. But, of course, to do so, you must be able to raise and lower interest rates. As a general rough rule, it is desirable that real interest rates should either be around the long-term growth rate of an economy or around 3 per cent, which are often quite close together. If you want a demonstration of the importance of being able to move interest rates you only have to look at Japan, where 10 years of stagnation with zero nominal interest rates meant that it was unable to use monetary policy to stimulate the economy. I was very worried when the Fed reduced interest rates to 1 per cent. I am glad they are now at a healthy 5-plus per cent. I believe that the current level of interest rates in Britain is about right.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/15">Finally, the highest industrial priority we should have, which is of crucial importance, is that we should make a real effort to go for nuclear power. This is not only because of global warming, although, of course, it meets the demands for controlling it. When the noble Lord, Lord Sainsbury&mdash;an extremely effective science Minister in this House&mdash;had the courage to say that nuclear power is indeed a renewable, many people did not like it. But he said that from the Front Bench. We need to save hydrocarbons, not only because of the Middle East situation but also because of Mr Putin, in whom we perhaps have diminishing confidence. We must meet future energy demand through nuclear power.</p>
	<p pid="a.604.0/16">Big developments are taking place throughout the world. Interestingly, the thorium reactor has been introduced in India instead of uranium. Thorium is a new technology invented by the Indians and has the great advantage that it does not produce plutonium. The Chinese are busily increasing their output of nuclear power and the United States at last&mdash;after 35 years of stagnation in a field where it once led the world&mdash;is also turning in that direction. I hope very much that Her Majesty's Government will do the same and that my party will support them.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-27a.630.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100684" speakername="Baroness Wilcox" colon=":" colnum="630"  time="020:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61127-0012.htm#06112721000079">
	<p pid="a.630.0/1">My Lords, we have had an excellent insight into the broad remit of the debate this afternoon. We have had two wonderful maiden speeches. In the noble Lord, Lord Bilimoria, I welcome our first Parsi. He is an entrepreneur&mdash;how terrific&mdash;and, better than that, he makes Cobra beer, which is the only beer I have ever been able to drink. It is absolutely delicious, and I am delighted that he is here. The noble Lord, Lord Rowe-Beddoe, who comes from the Welsh Development Agency, has brought to us a tremendous depth of knowledge. We will benefit from having these two Members on the Cross Benches to add to the wisdom of this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/2">Today I have the opportunity to stand up for the first time with my DTI hat on and to greet the noble Lord, Lord Truscott, who has taken the DTI portfolio for the Government. We are both from Devon&mdash;we are only half an hour away from each other&mdash;so we will at least understand each other's language, even if we do not always agree with each other on what we say.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/3">I thank my noble friend Lady Noakes for her superb overview of the state of the economy and her insight into the workings of the Treasury. The gracious Speech has given noble Lords the opportunity to reflect on an eventful 18 months in your Lordships' House. It seems a long time since the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, moved this Motion with his witty speech at State Opening. Since then, we have been debating the many and varied Bills that the Government are putting before us this Session.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/4">It is clear that it will be another busy Session; already, noble Lords have taken a day out from the debate to pass the first Bill, on Northern Ireland. Today, we have heard not only from my noble friend Lady Noakes but also from the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, my noble friend Lord Jenkin of Roding, and the noble Lords, Lord Peston and Lord Moser, on the new &quot;enhanced confidence&quot; statistics Bill. From these Benches we will listen with great care to what the noble Lord, Lord Moser, has to say, with all his wisdom and experience. My noble friend Lord De Mauley is the new Cabinet Office Minister, and I am sure that he will be particularly interested to hear everyone support the idea that this should all be going to the Cabinet Office instead of to the Treasury.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/5">In the following months we look forward to debating Conservative Bills. We can expect a Climate Change Bill, which is a Conservative proposal. The Treasury has been forced to make the provision of statistics independent&mdash;again a Conservative proposal. What is more, the Government have seen the sense of a Conservative manifesto commitment to link the basic state pension to earnings and have even borrowed the idea for their own policy. I am delighted to see those proposals on the timetable for the coming year. I sincerely hope that they will be proper Bills and not watered-down versions of what might have been.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/6">The House defeated the Government no fewer than 62 times in the past year. That is a sad state of affairs. It is not really what should happen. Legislation that we can support should be proposed. I am delighted to say that there is some that we certainly shall be able to support in the coming months. I add my support for the Government spending transparency Bill that my noble friend Lady Noakes will introduce in your Lordships' House. It will allow taxpayers to Google their tax through a powerful search engine.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/7">The Consumers, Estate Agents and Redress Bill has the potential to be a very welcome step towards improving consumer information. As a former chairman of the National Consumer Council and now president of the National Consumer Federation, I work to improve consumer confidence and believe that we should do everything in our power to do so. The National Consumer Council has been providing world-class policy on consumer issues for the past 32 years. It is unique in the world. It has been fully funded by successive Governments yet it has always been allowed to be independent, to choose its own agenda and to write the policy papers that have been taken up all over the world. I am proud to say that this low-cost, guerrilla force has had the British consumer at the forefront of consumer representation.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/8">That is why I am extremely concerned that the National Consumer Council is to be quangoised. Its great strength has been that it is a market leader in consumer affairs and now it is set to become yet another government mouthpiece. Consumer Voice, as the NCC will come to be known, will be nothing more than a signposting organisation. I have heard the noble Lord, Lord Whitty, speak today. He is the new chairman of the National Consumer Council and he seems more confident of the proposal so far than I am. I shall listen to him carefully because in the midst of what he was saying I could hear him going as native as I did when I took that post at the National Consumer Council. Who knows what he may decide at the end of the day.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/9">These matters may not arouse as much passion in your Lordships' House as foreign affairs did, but they are crucial to the great majority of consumers&mdash;we are all consumers. Buying a house is the biggest financial commitment that most people make, so I welcome the redress scheme for homebuyers yet I fear that we have before us a watered-down version of what might have been. I am concerned that redress will not provide an incentive strong enough to discourage rogue trading. I hope that the Minister can explain how effective a deterrent he expects the redress scheme to be, how many redress schemes there will be and whether redress will be available for those who did not buy their property through an estate agent. I recognise the importance of strengthening the position of the consumer and I wholly support the deregulatory principle of the Bill based on the Hamilton review. The Minister said today that the Government seek to reduce costs for and pressures on consumers, but consumers are picking up the tab for this Government's crippling burdens on business.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/10">This Government just cannot stop issuing regulations. We can see at a glance the impact that that has had on business. Regulations are costing businesses more than &pound;50 billion, with more than 14 new regulations issued every day. Business investment is at the lowest point on record, at a mere 9.5 per cent of GDP. Since 2000, we have consistently averaged lower than France, Germany and the United States. Even the deputy governor of the Bank of England has said that he is &quot;puzzled&quot; by the lack of investment. I was disappointed, but not surprised, to read the CBI's report this morning stating that burdens on businesses are higher than ever before; 95 per cent of business people have said that the tax system is just too complex and should be simplified. What is more, over one fifth of firms, 22 per cent, have been forced to relocate activities overseas. Almost a fifth of businesses have considered moving their headquarters overseas. These are not the symptoms of incentive, but of a stultified economy. We heard today from my noble friend Lord Wade, passionately talking for his rising stars: the small technology businesses. We also heard from my noble friend Lord Sanderson, who spoke from his public company and small business experience.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/11">It is not only business that is suffering. Before 1997, Britain enjoyed a surplus on trade and goods but has suffered a deficit since January 1998, with a record high in 2005 of &pound;44 billion. This does not just affect us at home; we have heard often today that Britain has dropped from being the seventh most competitive economy in the world in 1997 right down to 13th in 2005. The Minister mentioned a &pound;3.5 billion spend on science and technology, so I hope he will explain why, according to the Institution of Engineering and Technology, 40 per cent of British businesses are unable to recruit enough engineering graduates and apprentices.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/12">The story of standstill goes on. As my noble friend Lady Noakes has already said, official unemployment is at its highest for seven years, with 1.71 million people out of a job. That does not account for the real unemployment, however. In real terms, almost 5 million people are out of work and on benefits in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/13">In the first three months of this year insolvency was greater than in the whole of 1997. I come back to a vital point raised by my noble friend Lady Noakes. My noble friend and my party held a summit on personal debt on <phrase class="date" code="2006-11-20">20 November</phrase>. This issue affects every aspect of people's lives, particularly the consumer, who is vulnerable to aggressive marketing from all sectors and to aggressive persuasion to accept a bankruptcy status. What sort of society is this for Britain? Between July and September this year, 27,644 people went bankrupt or entered into individual voluntary arrangements. These instruments are viable, but the problem lies in IVAs often being aggressively marketed. My party has called for a more vigorous enforcement of the rules governing the marketing of IVAs. I hope the Minister can tonight assure noble Lords that this is also a priority of his Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/14">I look forward to examining in more detail the DTI's simplification plan that the Minister so briefly described. If I understand it correctly, the DTI will seek to reduce the complexity of DTI regulations. I hope the Minister's department will seek to reduce the amount of regulation as well, if possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/15">We support those measures proposing what is for the common good. There are some important opportunities to look forward to in this Session. We will have the opportunity to change our impact on the environment. Energy and climate change is an issue close to the heart of your Lordships' House. As my noble friend Lady Miller of Hendon, who so ably led from these Benches both as a government Whip for the DTI and opposition spokesperson, stated during the passing of the Energy Act 2004, that Act was a missed opportunity for the Government to take the bull by the horns.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/16">The Stern report was a wake-up call for us all, and not before time. Concern over energy increases, and the record of Her Majesty's Government over the past nine years is dispiriting. The Government promised to reduce emissions by 20 per cent by 2010, a target set independently by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution. Yet, three manifesto commitments later, Her Majesty's Government have rewritten the rules. The target has been dropped. It was already in deficit, emissions having risen consistently since 1997. In spite of promises to tax the bads not the goods, green taxation has fallen from 7.7 per cent of total tax in 1997 to 6.2 per cent this year. I await with bated breath the Government's White Paper on energy in the spring and the proposals in the Climate Change Bill, but agree with many others that it is all taking too long.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/17">The Minister mentioned increasing the use of renewables to a fifth of all energy by 2020. I hope noble Lords will forgive my scepticism in asking the Minister whether he can detail the plans for this reduction, and what safeguards will be in place to ensure that the targets are met. Without the safeguard of independent targets, the Government have shown a propensity for shifting the goalposts.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/18">Can the Minister inform noble Lords whether energy provisions will be accounted for in the Climate Change Bill? Can he reassure us that his Government will bring in a Bill with real teeth and real ambition? I wonder whether he can give that commitment today.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/19">I hope that the Minister will agree with me that it is essential that we focus on reducing carbon emissions and setting the right framework so that industry can develop a broad energy mix to guarantee security of affordable supply. Annual, independently set targets and stocktaking of emissions are essential to provide real accountability and progress with no rewriting of the rules. Decisions on future energy provision must be agreed by us all and must not be made on a political whim. Where the Government see nuclear power as the first choice, under our framework it would be a last resort. Where the Liberal Democrats rule out nuclear power, we rule out subsidies and special favours for nuclear power. Let us be responsible, not argumentative, about energy provision. We must view energy provision globally, in every sense of the word. Carbon reduction and security of energy supply are priorities, but hand in hand with green energy not to its detriment. We do not believe in special favours for nuclear power; we believe in a level playing field for all types of energy. We need to effect an entire culture change by deregulating business, simplifying taxes and revolutionising green energy.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/20">This has been a long debate at the start of a busy Session. I welcome many of the opportunities and challenges that we face in the Session to come and can reassure the Minister that noble Lords on these Benches will ensure that those opportunities are realised to their fullest potential. My noble friends and I will do our best, as always, to scrutinise all the Bills promised in the gracious Speech. Some we will criticise and others we will support, as my noble friends have said over the past six days' debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.630.0/21">We wholeheartedly support the Motion moved by the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, and seconded by the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan of Drefelin. Her Majesty deserves our thanks, not only for the gracious Speech, but for the way she continues to do her duty and set an example to us all.</p>
