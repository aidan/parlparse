	<p pid="a.1601.3/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister for that reassuring response, which omitted any question of &quot;but&quot;; namely, that the consultation period on the Secretary of State's September letter ends this coming Friday. The Minister will recall that, in the vigorous debate last night, there was nigh unanimous support throughout the House for the Government to take a different stand from that proposed by the Secretary of State. How does he propose to respond to the representations made on behalf of Birkbeck, the OU and many other providers, which are protesting about the proposals in the Secretary of State's <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-07">7 September</phrase> letter?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-04a.1648.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100012" speakername="Lord Alton of Liverpool" colon=":" colnum="1648"  time="017:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71204-0007.htm#07120468000099">
	<p pid="a.1648.5/1">There is a typographical error in Amendment No. 39. It says &quot;Page 56, line 3&quot; but should read &quot;Page 56, line 30&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/2">The cumulative effect of Amendments Nos. 32, 32A, 33, 34, 39, 40 and 41 would be to block tissue typing for the purposes of selecting an embryo that is an immune match to an existing child, to prevent children being used for organ donation after tissue typing for any purpose, to prevent the law being extended to allow children to be created to be organ and tissue donors, to limit the circumstances in which the creation of children as organ donors can take place, and to make the creation of children as organ donors a procedure of last resort.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/3">I was struck by the prescience and acuity of a comment in the <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-25">25 August</phrase> edition of <I>New Scientist</I>. It is worth listening to an extract from the article in question:</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/4" class="indent">&quot;It is excellent news that parents in the UK will probably be allowed to have sibling saviours to save children with 'serious' rather than merely life-threatening diseases ... Perhaps legislators should now seize the opportunity not only to permit this far-sighted approach, but also to solve the donor organ crisis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/5" class="indent">It should be possible to ensure that all children born to a couple are immunologically compatible so that, were one of the family to suffer a catastrophic organ failure, siblings would be on hand to provide another. Naturally, the elected saviour sibling would be required to provide the organ, although since the issue of consent does not arise with saviours at present, there is no need to suppose that this will be a problem in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/6" class="indent">The scheme would, of course, work best for kidneys, as the saviours could rely on their spare to see them through; half a liver could also be donated without too much worry. A heart and/or lungs would be trickier, but it does not stretch the imagination to suppose that our brave scientists and legislators will be able to see a way around this inconvenience&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/7">Let us first dispose of the casuistry that saviour siblings are donors. There is clearly something of a contradiction in using the word &quot;donor&quot;, as a donor has to give consent, and that is manifestly impossible in what is proposed. Personal organ donation is often a generous and altruistic act, and many Members of your Lordships' House will carry donor cards, but it is always an act freely entered into. It is an act of autonomy and personal choice but clearly a baby or a young child does not have any say in this momentous decision. Furthermore, reducing the present hurdle for permitting such an extraordinary presumption from &quot;life-threatening&quot; to &quot;serious&quot; conditions&mdash;which, as we know in another context, may mean a cleft palate or webbed fingers&mdash;should not be allowed to happen without deep and fundamental debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/8">The Bill proposes that an embryo can be tested to see whether it is an immune match for an existing sibling if the existing child suffers from a serious medical condition which can be treated by,</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/9" class="indent">&quot;umbilical cord blood stem cells, bone marrow or other tissue of any resulting child&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/10">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-21">21 November</phrase>, I asked the noble Lord, Lord Darzi, what the words &quot;or other tissue&quot; meant. He left the House in no doubt that it included organs, including organs from non-consenting children who are too young to give consent. He stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/11" class="indent">&quot;The Bill does not limit which tissue can be used in the treatment of a sibling ... and the Human Tissue Authority must approve any transplants involving organs from living donors and for children who are too young to give consent&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/11/07; col. 869.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/12">Therefore, if the embryo is found to be an immune match, it will be implanted deliberately to become a source of spare parts for an existing child&mdash;its sibling&mdash;even when it is too young to give consent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/13">My Amendment No. 32 goes to the heart of this matter. Many of your Lordships may not be too unhappy about permitting a child to be created to provide tissue from the umbilical cord, but the difficulty is that, once an embryo is tissue-typed and is known to be an immune match for an existing child, it will be available to provide any tissue or organ after birth, even if ostensibly it had been created only to provide umbilical cord blood. I shall say more about this later but I am proposing Amendment No. 32 in order to bring about a complete ban on tissue typing to produce a saviour sibling.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/14">Amendment No. 32A deals with the issue of life-threatening conditions. The Bill proposes that a saviour sibling can be created to provide tissue and organs for diseases in an existing child that are not even life-threatening but merely serious. When the Minister was asked why the Government have changed the criterion from &quot;life-threatening&quot; to &quot;serious&quot;, he replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/15" class="indent">&quot;The pre-legislative scrutiny committee recommended that the Bill should not be limited to life-threatening conditions but should also include serious conditions&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 21/11/07; col. 869.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/16">As I said at Second Reading, autism has already been suggested by the chairman of the Joint Committee scrutinising the Bill as one of the disorders for which a saviour sibling could be treated to provide tissue. In an interview with the <I>Daily Telegraph</I>, he said that saviour siblings cannot currently be used to help children with autism but it was an example of the kind of serious condition that the committee believed should be tackled by the technique. It is hard to see what kind of tissue could help to overcome autism. However, if a child could be created to help with autism in an existing child, what else could be classified as serious? That is why I am proposing Amendment No. 32A.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/17">In Amendments Nos. 33 and 34 I propose that saviour siblings may be created only to obtain umbilical cord blood and that the disease that these stem cells can be proposed to treat has to be capable of being treated effectively by umbilical cord blood. As the Bill stands, the term &quot;treated by umbilical cord blood&quot; is very open to interpretation. It would seem not to matter how effectively the cord blood, or indeed any tissue or organ, could help the existing sibling. As the Bill stands, even if there was only a small chance of success in treating the disease, the saviour sibling could be created. That also raises the issue that if a child is created ostensibly only for umbilical cord blood and if the umbilical cord blood was not effective in treating the disease, subsequently any tissue or organ could be used to treat the existing child to see whether that would be more effective. It would be known that the child was an immune match for the existing sibling, as it had undergone deliberate tissue typing as an embryo to ensure that it was an immune match. Therefore any tissue or organ would be compatible. Thus to those of your Lordships who are concerned about the use of any tissue other than umbilical cord blood, both limiting tissue typing of saviour siblings to obtain umbilical cord blood, and inserting the phrase &quot;treated effectively&quot;, should ensure that taking other tissues or organs after birth need not occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/18">Amendment No. 40 would permit a saviour sibling to be made only if there is no alternative treatment available, including umbilical cord blood from other donors. Amendment No. 41 deals with offences relating to harming saviour siblings, or taking tissue from them. The first paragraph of Amendment No. 41 proposes that it would be a criminal offence to take organs or bone marrow from a saviour sibling, or to subject it to any intrusive medical procedure in order to treat the existing child. Sub-paragraph (5) in Amendment No. 41 proposes that it would be a criminal offence to take organs from a saviour sibling, while permitting the taking of bone marrow. Sub-paragraph (6) of Amendment No. 41 proposes that it would be a criminal offence to cause harm to a child through any intrusive medical intervention in order to treat the existing child.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/19">Such amendments are necessary to avoid a saviour sibling being created ostensibly for umbilical cord blood, or for cord blood and bone marrow, but then used for organs or other tissues after birth. Using other organs would be possible if there are no safeguards in place, since it would have been implanted, following tissue typing, to be an immune match. I emphasise that this is not similar to using organs from a child created normally, or by IVF, without tissue typing. Saviour siblings are the result of deliberate intervention, involving an optional stage of tissue typing following IVF, to create a child to be a tissue or even organ donor for an existing child. The saviour sibling's entire existence would be lived with the sentence of knowing that it had been created to be a tissue or organ donor.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/20">As this Bill is currently drafted, we are being asked to legislate in favour of the creation of embryos whose tissue type is a match for a sick sibling. The intention is to carry such embryos through pregnancy in order to harvest the cord blood or bone marrow or other tissues&mdash;perhaps a liver or kidney; who knows?&mdash;later on in an attempt to cure the child already in existence.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/21">Any parent who has had a sick child&mdash;most of us in this House will have been in that position at some time&mdash;and certainly any parent caring for a seriously ill child will understandably search desperately for cures, and nothing is more likely to evoke compassion in the hearts of the nation than a plea for help from such parents. We do have a duty as a caring society to offer the services of the very best medicine, and to continue the search for new and successful cures. Medicine, however, cannot function in a moral vacuum and many ethical considerations need to be taken on board, even when dealing with relatively simple issues, let alone a dilemma as complex as this one.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/22">At first instance, this may well seem an heroic solution, an acceptable way to cure a seriously ill child. On the other hand, we may have a gut feeling that something is not right about this procedure. Gut feelings are absolutely valid and often represent the greatest wisdom. Our compassion for the welfare of existing sick children does not legitimise a trade off with our legal responsibilities for the welfare of children, including those created by assisted reproduction. There is no reason why criminal law prohibitions on battery or abusive behaviour towards children should not apply as much to children created by IVF as to everybody else. In the current legal realm, how could any invasive medical intervention performed on a child not for its own benefit, when it could not possibly give consent, not be argued in law to be an assault against the bodily integrity and right to autonomy of that innocent child?</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/23">No child should be created specifically for the benefit of a third party, no matter how pressing the anguish of the parents. That is the absolute principle at stake here, but it must also be added that the therapeutic benefits of creating tissue-matching babies have been inaccurately portrayed to the public as an easy procedure with guaranteed success. It is also usually argued that this is the only, or ideal, therapeutic route. In reality, the chances of the matching baby being created successfully are limited. IVF has a low success rate. Pregnancies do not always go to term. There is no guarantee, even in the case simply of cord blood, that there will be sufficient blood harvested, or that any subsequent transplant will be successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/24">The medical team awaiting the birth of a tissue-matching child to provide therapy is placed in an unenviable position, with a significant risk that best practice in pregnancy may be hijacked by the interests of the sick sibling. Worsening of the sick child could inspire thoughts of provoking a premature delivery. Such a response has already been recorded. What if the cord is around the neck of the new baby and needs to be sacrificed in the interests of good obstetric practice? Another reality is that, in order to create the matching baby, many unwanted embryos will be discarded in the process, including those diagnosed as carrying genetic disease and those who are disease-free. It is very much a hit or miss technology and it is criticised for some of the eugenics practices associated with embryo selection in the first place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/25">And what happens if the donation is not successful or&mdash;a rare but real likelihood&mdash;if the donation itself causes the death of the recipient, or the recipient dies anyway? Sadly, even when the tissue matches come from uncontentious sources&mdash;cord blood banks, unrelated donors and so on&mdash;the recipient is not always cured. What burden will that place on the designed baby? It is often recorded that children feel an irrational responsibility for the death of their parents or siblings. The psychological burden put on a tissue-matching child must not be dismissed in a rose-coloured enthusiasm for the benefits that might accrue to a third party. When the Minister replies, perhaps she will say what research has been done on the psychological impact of being a saviour sibling.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/26">Are there any other ways to provide the cures in question? Thankfully, yes, and there is a middle ground here, to which the Committee should give deep and serious consideration, especially between now and Report. The lottery of trying to design a saviour sibling is a lengthy and unreliable process at best, making it immensely impractical and never likely to be universally practised. Instead, we should explore less controversial routes to the desired cures and in particular, we should support the collection of stem cells from cord blood and invest seriously in this non-controversial and exciting source of transplant material.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/27">Colin McGuckin, the professor of regenerative medicine at Newcastle University, in evidence submitted to the Joint Committee on the Human Tissue and Embryos (Draft) Bill, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/28" class="indent">&quot;Cord blood stem cells, which we specialise in, already treat 85 clinical diseases&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1648.5/29">But it was said in a meeting that I organised in the Moses Room of your Lordships' House by Dr Peter Hollands, a senior scientist specialising in this area, that 98 per cent of cord blood produced in this country is routinely destroyed. There are, I understand&mdash;no doubt the Minister will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;only four NHS facilities in this country at the moment that do that collection. Contrast that with the situation in the United States. If we were to store the cord blood from every baby born in this country, we would have a bank of stem cells of infinite value, and if this was practised internationally on the largest possible scale, the therapeutic potential would be extraordinary.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-04a.1657.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100693" speakername="The Lord Bishop of Winchester" colon=":" colnum="1657"  time="018:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71204-0008.htm#07120474000004">
	<p pid="a.1657.0/1">I am grateful for the speeches we have heard, in particular, for those of the noble Lord, Lord Alton, and the noble Earl, Lord Howe. I want to go the whole way with the noble Lord, Lord Alton, in his amendments. I regret not being able to be present at Second Reading or yesterday, but that has given me the opportunity of reading the Second Reading debate, yesterday's debate and the preparatory material all at one go. That prepared me to speak now.</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.0/2">I am not convinced by my friend the noble and right reverend Lord, Lord Harries, who turned the question about instrumentality upside down. That seemed not subtler than I could follow but subtler than is acceptable, but he and I have found ourselves in that position before and he will not be surprised at that reaction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.0/3">On asking the Government for clarity about &quot;other tissue&quot;, it seems to me that the phrase is precisely designed not to be clear but to be broadly inclusive. I should be surprised if the Minister is able to offer us any clarity about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.0/4">The noble Lord, Lord Alton, spoke about gut feelings. I want to put those into words, as the noble Lord, Lord Alton, would have been able to do, but he had much else to say. Those gut feelings are very widely held. Noble Lords will, like me, have had a lot correspondence on this issue and will know that this is one of the points on which gut feelings have been widely expressed. The view held by the high-church atheists mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord Patten, is widely held whether by those of Christian or other faiths or none, but I shall put it in Christian terms.</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.0/5">At least from the implantation of a fertilised embryo we are a unique character for others, for society, for our maturing, enjoyment and fulfilment, and for God. We grow into the fullness of that unique character in the context of our parents, which is relevant to some of the later clauses in the Bill about fathers, and then under an ever-widening range of influences throughout our lives and, I should say, beyond. It is an archetypal human right that we are that unique character for those purposes. It is our responsibility first as parents to defend that right around our children and for them, then it is society's responsibility to do so and society, in this context, includes Parliament and the medical professions. If that picture of what it is to be human and of humankind's responsibility for human individuals is valid, the picture of saviour siblings as imagined in the aspects of the Bill that the noble Lord, Lord Alton, is seeking to remove, or to amend if removal fails, is fundamentally at odds with the picture I have painted.</p>
	<p pid="a.1657.0/6">Enabling the collusion of parents&mdash;whom I have suggested have major responsibilities to defend and sucker the growth of the infant into maturity&mdash;in making this individual an instrument, making legal the engagement of the medical professions in such a creation of instrumentality and the lack of choice in being a donor but being an instrument, is a fundamentally serious thing to be doing, and, in my judgment, a wrong thing to be doing. I say that understanding, to the extent that outside the situation one can understand it, the urgent desire of parents with a desperately, chronically, perhaps even terminally sick child to find any means of approaching this situation, and the perfectly respectable and laudable wish of clinicians, if they may possibly, to assist them to do it. It still seems to me that Parliament would be wrong to allow that. For that reason I support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Alton.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-04a.1677.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100469" speakername="Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay" colon="" colnum="1677"  time="019:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71204-0011.htm#07120487000047">
	<p pid="a.1677.1/1" pwmotiontext="asked">asked Her Majesty's Government what assessment they have made of the progress of the Government of Kenya in meeting the challenges on poverty reduction and the war on corruption set out in the Department for International Development's 2004&mdash;07 country assistance plan.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/2">My Lords, I am looking forward to debating with the Minister. It is the first time that I have had the pleasure of doing so, but I hope that it will not be the last and I hope that she will not be put off by the remarks that we have just heard from the noble Lord, Lord Davies. I am not asking her for any predictions. I am just asking her, from her great experience of east Africa, to tell me how she assesses progress on corruption and poverty reduction.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/3">I welcome this opportunity to press the Government on these matters at this crucial point in Kenya's history. I apologise on behalf of my noble friend Lord Steel of Aikwood, who is very sad not to be able to be here today. We decided to press for this debate together, but the date unfortunately came up when he is in Darfur. I know that he will follow the debate with great interest.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/4">In almost half a century since independence, Kenya has had only three presidents&mdash;Jomo Kenyatta, Daniel arap Moi and now Mwai Kibaki. In just over three weeks' time on <phrase class="date" code="">27 December</phrase>, Kenya's 14 million registered voters will decide whether to move onto a fourth. As the leader of the EU observer team, Alexander Graf Lambsdorff pointed out in Nairobi only last week, Kenya set a high standard for the region with its elections in 2002. I know, because I was there. I took my family to visit a polling station in Coast Province and was moved by the welcome and openness of the election officials and agents and quiet hope of the stream of voters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/5">The count was unusually clean as well. But as the EU team now says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/6" class="indent">&quot;It is important that people can exercise their right to vote freely and that candidates are able to campaign in a peaceful, secure environment in which there is a level laying field&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/7">Does the Minister believe that hope has been fulfilled so far in these elections? What steps are our Government taking to impress on the authorities in Kenya the overwhelming need for free and fair elections if development is to proceed, and Britain's major commitment as Kenya's second largest bilateral donor with it?</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/8">I give a little background. My first job at the age of 21, just weeks after I left Oxford, was an an economist statistician in Kenya's Ministry of Economic Planning and Development. There was a houseful of us. We were called Overseas Development Institute Nuffield fellows in those days. I took over my bed from my honourable friend Vince Cable when he left. My Minister was Tom Mboya, a brilliant leader in the independence movement; at least he was until he was shot one Saturday lunchtime in Nairobi in 1969 just down the street after we had finished work. That produced a turbulent and violent run-up to elections with &quot;oathing&quot; and tribal clashes at which President Kenyatta, Vice-President Moi and Mwai Kibaki, as the Minister of Commerce and Industry defeated Oginga Odinga, the father of today's leading opposition candidate, Raila Odinga. With Uhuru Kenyatta, the president's son, the losing presidential candidate in 2002, your Lordships will see that the hereditary principle is proving much longer lasting in Kenyan politics than in our own.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/9">My job taught me all about poverty in Kenya. I was put in charge of Kenya's rudimentary cost of living statistics, and ran a household income and expenditure survey in Kenya's three main towns, Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu. I recruited a team of 40 enumerators, each of whom had to visit every household that was on the sample every day for a month and note down every cent and shilling that they spent. Many people had low-paid jobs and a desperate struggle to last until the end of the month, with many mouths feeding off the one person in work. Many more had no regular job at all and survived on a bit of hawking perhaps, casual labour for a few hours or days, existing possibly even on the fringes of crime. Now there is a much larger and better educated middle class, but for most people in Kenyan towns that struggle to survive goes on in much the same way as it did then.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/10">There was small-scale corruption in my day. For instance, I had to put my foot down when all the people that were sent to me for jobs as enumerators seemed to have similar names beginning with &quot;Ki&quot; or &quot;Mu&quot;. I pointed out that I wanted some whose names included an &quot;O&quot; or a &quot;Wa&quot;. There was that sort of small-scale corruption. It was corruption in a sense but I learnt that it was based on family and tribal loyalty. However, in those day there was nothing like the large-scale, high profile cases involving hundreds of millions of dollars which have scandalised ordinary Kenyans and Kenya's friends abroad over the past decade. Corruption is especially vile in a poor country where water, food or medicine are literally snatched from the mouths of the most vulnerable when corrupt officials divert funds. What action is the Fraud Response Unit within DfID taking to avoid repetition of the four cases of misappropriation of donors' funds in Kenya over the past two years revealed in Hilary Benn's parliamentary Answer at col. 1984 of Commons <I>Hansard</I> of <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-21">21 June</phrase>?</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/11">My noble friend Lord Avebury will cover, among other things, the Kroll report but does either of the non-Nigerian cases on which the International Corruption Group of the City of London police has started work relate to Kenya? DfID's October 2007 publication, <I>Reducing Poverty in Africa</I>, states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/12" class="indent">&quot;Thanks to DFID funding (&pound;6 million over 3 years) to the International Corruption Group, the City of London and Metropolitan Police Forces now have 16 additional police officers&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/13">Is not Kenya an obvious place for the Proceeds of Corruption Unit&mdash;which has reinforced efforts to combat money laundering by &quot;Politically Exposed Persons&quot;, as the report puts it&mdash;to focus its efforts, especially in the light of widespread and persistent reports of very large sums held in London bank accounts by retired and serving Kenyan MPs and their families? Just because Britain's own recent record on transparency and party funding leaves so much to be desired, we must not turn a blind eye to corruption elsewhere, especially if British taxpayers' money has effectively been recycled through corrupt fat cats abroad back to British bank accounts in London.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/14">A year ago Kim Howells, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister, said that &quot;graft&quot; was rampant at virtually every level of Kenyan society and government. He said after a visit to Mombasa:</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/15" class="indent">&quot;People can be bought, right from the person who works at the docks to the Government. The weakness has been recognised by drug traffickers and probably by terrorists, too&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/16">A few weeks after he said that, the head of Mombasa's CID was shot dead because he was making too much progress in clearing up corruption at the docks. Mr Howells also noted that pledges from the Government of President Kibaki, elected in 2003 on a reform platform to clean up corruption had not been met. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/17" class="indent">&quot;Almost nothing has resulted from that. There is clearly complicity at very high levels in terms of arrests&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/18">He also said that ordinary Kenyans he had spoken to during his trip had expressed a &quot;huge sense of disappointment&quot; with the lack of progress in addressing corruption. He added:</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/19" class="indent">&quot;We have not seen significant arrests or legal action&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/20">Is that still the Government's view, and what are they doing about it? Widespread corruption in a society breeds cynicism and despair. The 2004-07 country plan contained a very interesting analysis pointing to a culture of political and economic patronage as the root of widespread corruption. It exploited ethnicity. The capacity of Kenya's public institutions&mdash;the civil service, public sector banks, the police and the judiciary&mdash;was seriously and systematically undermined over many years and became progressively less able to provide the checks and balances necessary to limit the spread of corrupt practice. Rather than Kenyans' taxes being collected fairly and spent efficiently on the basis of need, they have often been collected arbitrarily and spent for private gain. How do the Government assess the position today?</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/21">Despite this difficult background, the Kenyan economy has been showing healthy overall economic growth over the past three years. But GDP growth rates of 5 or 6 per cent are not as impressive as they sound when rapid population growth means that the economy has to grow by at least 3 per cent a year just to stand still in terms of average income per head. Kenya is a fertile country but population growth has to come down if a fixed amount of land is to feed the 70 per cent of the population who still make their living from agriculture, and to slow the torrent of people going into the towns and cities in a desperate search for work or income of any sort.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/22">The 2004-07 plan pointed out that accurate and detailed information on Kenya is in very short supply but available data suggest that the number of people living below the national poverty line has risen from about 11 million&mdash;48 per cent of the population&mdash;in 1990 to around 17 million&mdash;56 per cent of the population&mdash;in 2001. What is the Government's latest estimate of the number and percentage of the population living below the national poverty line?</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/23">The House of Commons International Development Committee report on the 2004-07 country assistance plan concluded:</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/24" class="indent">&quot;DFID must be able to assess whether sufficiently speedy progress is being made towards agreed objectives. DFID must be able to monitor Kenya's progress towards the MDGs, and to evaluate the effectiveness of its assistance ... Well-designed processes for poverty reduction and development assistance are crucial, but they must be judged by whether or not they deliver the outcomes required in an agreed timescale&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/25">I would be interested to hear the Government's response to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1677.1/26">Kenya is a country with enormous potential. Its people are far better educated than 10 or 20 years ago. It has wonderful natural advantages, a free press, a basically sound infrastructure and businessmen and women with great entrepreneurial flair. But too many of its best brains have concentrated on enriching themselves rather than their country and their fellow citizens in recent decades. Other countries in Africa have worse divisions between rich and poor, a lower standard of living and more brutal and repressive regimes. But ordinary Kenyans' high hopes of the new Government they elected five years ago have been dashed. I trust that the Minister can tell me how our country's resources and influence, which, as she knows, are still very great in east Africa, can be brought to bear to help Kenya find prosperity with equity and accountability in the years ahead.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-04a.1683.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100029" speakername="Lord Avebury" colon=":" colnum="1683"  time="019:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71204-0012.htm#07120489000001">
	<p pid="a.1683.0/1">My Lords, I congratulate my noble friend on getting this debate at such a critical moment in Kenya's affairs and on the way in which he has deployed his extensive knowledge and experience this evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.0/2">Corruption did not begin with President Mwai Kibaki but, as he came into office pledged to stamp it out, it was a bitter disappointment that under his Government it was business as usual. My noble friend has quoted Kim Howells's vivid description of the corruption epidemic last year, and before that our then High Commissioner, Sir Edward Clay, had accused corrupt Ministers of, &quot;vomiting on the shoes&quot; of donors.</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.0/3">The Foreign Office has said that we were never asked for help in freezing assets stashed in the UK during the Moi presidency by corrupt politicians, including his sons and two close allies. One offshore account was said to contain $300 million, but the cash was moved after a tip-off from Kenya. Other alleged assets said to have belonged to the Mois and their cronies included a flat in Lowndes Square and houses in Surrey.</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.0/4">The Kroll report, mentioned by my noble friend, on assets embezzled from the people of Kenya, has been swept under the carpet by President Kibaki; but fortunately the text is available on the website &quot;Wikileaks&quot;, which is to be warmly commended for exposing the details of the multi-billion pound scam. I ask the Minister whether the Government have studied this report, whether the police are considering the evidence it provides of criminal activities and whether there is power to sequestrate the many properties in the UK mentioned in the report as having been acquired through corrupt transactions. Since we protested to the authorities in Kenya at the end of August about the false accusation by Nairobi's spokesman that the UK had refused to help their inquiries into theft by the Moi gang, what further attempts have we made to persuade the authorities to follow up the Kroll report, particularly to nail the currently serving MPs it mentions, including one Minister?</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.0/5">It has been mentioned that Britain is the second largest bilateral donor to Kenya and DfID says that in 2007-08 it is providing &pound;50 million in aid, 80 per cent of it for health, education, humanitarian assistance and social protection. The remaining 20 per cent supports improved governance, a private-sector development and investment climate, financial sector reform, land and agricultural reform and improved statistics. We provide no poverty budget support at present and DfID says this is because not enough progress has been made in dealing with corruption. The IMF did approve Kenya's PRSP, which was to run for three years from March 2004, and it would be useful to know whether DfID has evaluated the outcomes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.0/6">The UNDP has a country plan running for five years to the end of 2008, which included employment creation in labour-intensive projects such as roads and flood prevention. Has it found that corruption was a significant impediment in its operations, and does it find it necessary, as we do, to channel aid through reliable financial management agents or earmarked accounts, or direct to civil society? A key objective of our country plan was to co-ordinate donors in supporting the ERS, and I was glad to note the draft joint assistance strategy for the next five years, which provides for unified assistance by a number of agencies. Can the noble Baroness say whether that has been finalised and whether it includes robust procedures for ensuring that direct aid is not embezzled by politicians or officials?</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.0/7">In spite of Kenya's healthy growth rate in the past five years, which was mentioned by both noble Lords, and particularly during the years of DfID's country assistance plan, Kenya remains one of the poorest countries in Africa. As my noble friend pointed out, that is partly because of its high population growth and poor access to reproductive healthcare. US restrictions on its aid to family planning decreed by George Bush were a contributory factor in making the situation even worse. Those cuts led to reductions in the provision of contraceptive care and advice, the closure of clinics, staff redundancies and programme cuts. Have we done anything to make up those deficiencies?</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.0/8">Kenya is near the bottom of Transparency International's corruption perceptions index and in the UNDP's human development index it ranks 148 out of the 177 countries reporting. This shows a decline since the turn of the century, during which most other states have made progress, particularly sub-Saharan Africa, and is evidence of the connection between endemic corruption, with the blatant and obscene misdistribution of wealth that we have seen in Kenya, and the appalling poverty which afflicts the broad mass of the population. The UNDP identified gross abuse of public office and incorrigible tolerance of mediocrity as factors leading to the misappropriation of productive resources and the undermining of economic development and human rights.</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.0/9">Kenya also faces huge problems which are not of its own making. HIV/AIDS affects 2 million people and was responsible for a reduction in life expectancy from 60 in 1990 to 45 in 2002. Although infection rates are levelling off, far more needs to be done. DfID was funding the supply of ARVs to half the 120,000 people who needed them by the end of 2006 and it would be useful to have an update on that programme since the end of last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.0/10">Land degradation and desertification mean that 10 million people living in the affected areas suffer from acute poverty. Global warming will make the situation far worse. A 1 metre rise in sea level would mean the loss of $500 million of crops in coastal areas, and the environment Minister told a UN conference in Nairobi that climate change was already threatening Kenya's poverty reduction programme. Barack Obama, whose paternal family was from Kenya and who may be the next US President, may wish to reconsider his country's attitude to international agreements on climate change prevention in the light of the disproportionate burden imposed on Africa by America's profligate use of energy. I hope we may draw those facts to his attention.</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.0/11">Kenya faced a new influx of 40,000 refugees fleeing the renewed fighting in Somalia at the turn of last year before the border was closed, and is now host to 200,000 Somalis in three camps in Dadaab. Save the Children is working to protect the 70,000 children there and it would be good to know whether DfID has provided any resources to help cope with the increased numbers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.0/12">Britain is committed to the achievement of the millennium development goals and the Government response to the International Development Select Committee report said that we were working with Kenya and our partners to ensure that information on progress was available to all, and would be used for monitoring progress. Almost all the indicators that we have, apart from attendance in primary education, mentioned by the noble Lord, Lord St John, were negative. The slum population has doubled since 1990, under-five and infant mortality rates worsened between 2000 and 2005, TB is on the increase and the proportion of infants immunised against measles has deteriorated. It is true, as it was at the start of our country development plan in January 2004, that Kenya will fail to meet the majority of the MDGs and we need to identify the reasons. Kenya applied to join the international alliance to vaccinate children against pneumococcal diseases, which kill a million children a year, but did not meet the criteria. Why was that and can we help them to qualify?</p>
	<p pid="a.1683.0/13">In three weeks, the voters in Kenya are going to decide whether President Kibaki or the opposition headed by Mr Raila Odinga is best qualified to deal with these formidable challenges. Unfortunately, there are signs of trouble. An opposition candidate has been murdered by gunmen; an opinion poll has been accused of manipulating the results in favour of the Government; language that incites ethnic hatred is being used on some radio stations; and the UNDP has accused TV and radio of favouring Mr Kibaki. The chief election commissioner's term of office having expired on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-02">2 December</phrase>, it was renewed for another five years by President Kibaki, contrary to the advice of the EU mission at the 2002 election that renewal should not occur close to an election. In deciding how to assist the Kenyan people, DfID and other international donors will no doubt consider whether they have truly chosen their Government in free and fair elections.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-04a.1688.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100958" speakername="Baroness Vadera" colon=":" colnum="1688"  time="020:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71204-0013.htm#07120497000018">
	<p pid="a.1688.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, for initiating this debate 23 days before Kenya's general election. This time five years ago, expectations of the last elections ran high. Kenyans looked forward to change, growth, jobs, free primary education and zero tolerance for corruption. This time, perhaps, disappointment has tempered hope.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/2">Ethnicity and patronage are still important determinants of the outcome of elections and a career in politics is still one of the quickest ways of accumulating wealth. The incumbents and the opposition are mostly cut from the same cloth. So it is with sadness for the country of my mother that I say, in response to the remarks of noble Lords, that I fear that, whatever the outcome of this election, we cannot expect a dramatic step-change in governance and corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/3">Nevertheless, issues of substance are being increasingly discussed and the electorate are showing interest in the progress, or lack of it, that this Government have recorded. What looks like a close election has created at least the possibility of a democratic moment, to break the hereditary principle that the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, talked of&mdash;an election in which both incumbent and opposition have equal chances. The results of the parliamentary primaries on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-16">16 November</phrase> suggest that two-thirds of the Members of Parliament are likely to be new faces.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/4">As the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, indicated, there is a track record of managing election days, and there will again be a number of international observer missions from the EU, the AU, the US and others. But the acid test will not be just whether elections are free on the day but whether they are fair during the campaign in the use of government resources. We continue to monitor, and to press for a level playing field.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/5">Alan Greenspan says that there is only one difference between a developed and a developing country&mdash;and that is the rule of law. Thirty years ago Kenya was a prosperous middle-income country. But from the 1970s to the turn of the century, we witnessed the economy contract, life expectancy fall from 62 years to 49 and poverty increase from 48 per cent to 56 per cent. As the analysis of our country assistance plan shows, at the heart of much of this decline lie deep-rooted structures of economic and political patronage and corrosion of the very system of checks and balances designed to deal with corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/6">Corruption is more than the loss of income from a series&mdash;however relentless&mdash;of headline-grabbing scandals. I cannot comment on the individual cases which noble Lords have raised except to say that we urge a successful prosecution, however difficult, as the clearest indicator that the Government of Kenya are serious about removing the culture of impunity among the political elite. Corruption is one of the biggest hurdles in the fight against poverty. Every day, ordinary Kenyans must bribe to get a job, to operate a business or to build a house. The police are widely regarded not as a source of law and order but as an informal tax on the poor. One national survey showed that 25 per cent of Kenyans face frequent demands for payment in their efforts to obtain the healthcare to which they are entitled.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/7">This year, Kenya, with help from DfID, has been one of the world's top reformers in the &quot;Doing Business&quot; indicators. But while the private sector is reviving, businesses still name corruption as one of the main barriers to accelerated growth. There are also serious problems with human rights. We urge the Government of Kenya to investigate the alleged killings associated with the Mungiki gangs.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/8">Some have argued that the mere presence of donors such as DfID creates a moral hazard, props up corrupt Governments and even adds to the incentives for corruption, and that donors should walk away. It would be an easy thing to do and, for some, not without a sense of personal moral satisfaction. But the problem with these arguments is that they offer no alternative solutions and no evidence to show that disengagement leads to change. They ignore not only the sheer human cost of punishing the poor for the sins of their Government but the opportunity of empowering, with human development, a generation of Kenyans to bring about change in their lives and the governance of their country.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/9">Our approach to fighting corruption, as set out in our governance White Paper, focuses on the long-term political drivers of change. Corruption is a symptom of weak governance, poor political accountability and inadequate systems. So, first and foremost, we protect UK taxpayers' funds. We give no budget support in Kenya but use financial management agents and civil society to deliver aid directly. Secondly, to help protect Kenyans' funds, since the last election we have had programmes to strengthen governmental systems of public finance management, procurement and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, said, public sector reform.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/10">Thirdly, we work with local civil societies to strengthen their voice in holding their own Government to account. We fund one of the most active Transparency International chapters in Africa which produces a bribery index, naming and shaming organisations, and we have just funded the start-up of a national taxpayers' association.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/11">Fourthly, we have supported the introduction of extensive anti-corruption legislation which, for example, makes bribes a criminal offence, protects witnesses, and requires public officers to declare their wealth. We are also awaiting legislation on money laundering and whistleblower protection. In response to the question from the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, although there was an attempt to change legislation to undermine the powers of the anti-corruption commission, the President has used his veto and it has not been enacted. Fifthly, we work in-country and internationally to trace and recover stolen assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/12">I refute the comparison of the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, to party funding issues. In response to the noble Lord's question, I can confirm that we have not been asked by the Government of Kenya to investigate the Kroll report or any assets in any bank accounts or other cases. As to any action we can initiate, I can neither confirm nor deny whether investigations are ongoing or being considered, as this would negatively impact on police operations. I can say, however, that we actively support the International Corruption Group and my officials work closely with the Serious Fraud Office. Lastly, we exercise targeted visa bans for those involved with corruption, including government Ministers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/13">However, in the spirit of balance which the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, evoked in his thought-provoking remarks, our country assistance plan also recognises the potential and opportunities for Kenya, and the catalytic role that it could play in east Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/14">A one-sided representation of Kenya would be inaccurate. There are some changes. The economy has seen three years of positive per capita growth and, showing a glimmer of what is possible with capable government leadership, the introduction of free primary education in 2003 was an overnight success. Accompanied by school feeding, teacher training, rehabilitated classrooms and strong donor support, it has led to 1.8 million more children in school. Gender parity is at 96 per cent and, as the noble Baroness, Lady Verma, points out, more needs to be done to reach orphans, vulnerable children and those in remote areas. Nevertheless, Kenya is on track to meet the second MDG to get every boy and girl into primary school.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/15">There have been innovative approaches to deal with local accountability and corruption. DfID's early leadership in the education sector meant that each of the 18,500 public primary schools has an individual bank account controlled by a school committee of parents and teachers. Government and donor funds are directly deposited into these accounts. Each school publicly displays its receipts and expenses on blackboards for the public and parents to see, as I saw for myself at the Olympic primary school in Kibera. Showing that successful development can shape political debate, all three major parties have announced that they will from January 2008 meet all tuition fees for secondary school, which would make Kenya one of the first countries in Africa to make secondary education accessible to all.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/16">There has been success in the fight against malaria and HIV/AIDS, which are the largest and second largest causes of deaths. DfID has supported the distribution and use of more than 12 million bed nets since 2004 and, as part of a comprehensive package of prevention and better treatment, that is leading to real epidemiological changes and a dramatic 44 per cent reduction in mortality in sentinel areas in just two years. As many noble Lords remarked, HIV/AIDS prevalence is an issue, but it has dropped by half to 5 per cent as a result of concerted efforts to change behaviour, lower incidence levels and, unfortunately, higher death rates. Half of those in need receive anti-retroviral treatment, averting 57,000 deaths from AIDS by 2006. That reflects the multi-sector donor approach and our commitment to universal access to ARVs by 2010.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/17">However, overall Kenya, like the rest of the continent, is off-track in meeting the health-related MDGs. Child and maternal mortality rates are the most powerful indicators of the effectiveness of an underlying health system. Infant, child and maternal mortality has increased rather than deceased in Kenya over the years so Kenya was picked as one of the eight first-wave countries in the international health partnership launched by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister in September. Its purpose is to ensure that donors co-ordinate and back country plans to provide sustainable, comprehensive and universal healthcare beyond the focus on individual diseases. That is why half of DfID's programme focuses on healthcare.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/18">The proportion of those living in poverty has reversed to 46 per cent since the publication of our country assistance plan, but the impact of growth has been uneven. Only 50,000 of the 500,000 jobs have been created, and 16 million people, mainly in the arid or semi-arid lands, live on the edge of survival. The cycles of droughts, floods, disease and even conflict have taken their toll. At the height of the 2005 drought, 10 per cent of the population needed emergency humanitarian assistance. So DfID is pioneering a new programme to protect the assets of the most vulnerable, to keep children in school and to break the cycle of dependence during emergences.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/19">As the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, rightly points out, poor governance is not the only serious threat to poverty reduction. There is clear and consistent evidence in the IPCC climate model that Kenya, especially northern Kenya, will get warmer and wetter and experience more severe droughts in coming decades. We are therefore conducting a climate change risk assessment and developing adaptation options for all our programmes, including water. We are also working along the lines of the Stern review to analyse the risks of climate change to growth and poverty reduction in Kenya.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/20">In response to specific questions of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, the IMF has recently approved its final review of the poverty reduction growth facility, and the Kenyan joint assistance strategy was approved by 17 donors and provides a robust basis for a stand against corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/21">I am proud of what DfID has achieved in Kenya. Our work on terrorism, working with the Government, does not affect our evaluation of our own work in DfID. An independent country programme evaluation published this year states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/22" class="indent">&quot;The Kenya country programme has in large part been successful in delivering what it set out to achieve. This is a good outcome in a difficult governance environment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/23">It goes on to state:</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/24" class="indent">&quot;DfID has made a positive contribution to political accountability and a relatively peaceful election and political transition with examples of effective public information, civic education and advocacy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/25">In addition to governance, poverty and climate change we know that the challenges of migration, urbanisation, exclusion, radicalisation, terrorism and regional integration will all play out in Kenya.</p>
	<p pid="a.1688.0/26">There are many in Kenya who deserve our support through these challenges&mdash;the Nobel peace prize winner Wangari Mathai, the world renowned anti-corruption activist John Githongo, dedicated teachers, health workers, civil servants and civil society. We will remain committed beyond this election to the people of Kenya, to its vocal activists and its many silent heroes.</p>
