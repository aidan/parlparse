	<p pid="a.924.6/1">My Lords, we on these Benches share in the condolences expressed for the two soldiers killed in the helicopter crash. I should declare a geographical interest in that Menwith Hill is an American enclave on British soil and is very close to Saltaire. I pass by it frequently.</p>
	<p pid="a.924.6/2">In the past two weeks I had an interesting discussion with a visiting Czech Minister about the Czech Government's regular involvement in, or at least briefing by the Americans on, the bilateral negotiations. Similarly, I have read about the Polish Government's comments on them. Are the British Government not being well informed about these negotiations, or are they being informed but are not telling the British Parliament? In February, the last Prime Minister promised the then Leader of my party that the Government would &quot;regularly keep Parliament informed&quot; of developments in missile defence. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-25">25 July</phrase>, just as we broke for the summer, they issued a Written Statement. The Government are not keeping Parliament informed about this important issue.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-22a.940.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100850" speakername="Lord Chidgey" colon=":" colnum="940"  time="012:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71122-0003.htm#07112238000122">
	<p pid="a.940.0/1">My Lords, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, has made a telling contribution to this debate based on the wisdom of his own experience, on which we should dwell throughout the hours to come. I am sure that your Lordships' House will want me to pass on good wishes for the speedy recovery of my noble friend Lord Lee of Trafford, while he recuperates in hospital. He will be disappointed not to be here today to follow the speech that he made in the debate on the gracious Address when he focused on the key issues, as appears to be well known.</p>
	<p pid="a.940.0/2">From almost every quarter in the defence and security world, whether from defence analysts, think tanks and institutes or military personnel, warning bells are ringing. There are growing concerns that our Armed Forces are unable to sustain the tasks required of them to respond to government policy. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, made the point that the covenant with the Armed Forces is an essential part of our relationship with them. If we choose to have Armed Forces that are prepared to engage in this difficult, tough and challenging campaign&mdash;to be war fighters as well as peace makers&mdash;then, in recognising that this is a new situation for our Armed Forces, we must recognise that new commitments are necessary to make it work and to make it fair. The covenant between the Armed Forces, the Government and the people must be renewed. For our part, in government, our former Prime Minister said that it will mean increased expenditure on equipment, personnel and the conditions of our Armed Forces&mdash;not in the short run, but for the long term.</p>
	<p pid="a.940.0/3">That is the nub of the debate today: whether the commitment made by our Government on behalf of the nation, and subsequently endorsed by both the former and current Prime Ministers is being met in reality. An increasing body of informed and expert opinion is telling us that it is not. British forces are now suffering critical overstretch due to the mismatch between resources, capabilities and commitments. They were suffering even before the Iraq war and, we are told by many, are now stretched to breaking point. For example, General Sir Richard Dannatt said in July:</p>
	<p pid="a.940.0/4" class="indent">&quot;The enduring nature and scale of current operations continues to stretch people ... we now have almost no capability to react to the unexpected&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.940.0/5">and that reinforcements for emergencies or operations in Iraq and Afghanistan are now &quot;almost non-existent&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.940.0/6">That was in late July, and of course the Government may well now claim that the situation has moved on, with troops being withdrawn from Iraq and reinforcements being deployed in Afghanistan and so on. But the bald facts, according to the RUSI Acquisition Focus of spring 2007, are that the Government's defence planning assumptions, on which the defence budget is based, have been exceeded for at least the past seven years. Experts will of course tell us that it does not matter too much if we exceed the planning expectations for maybe one or two years. But this has been a continual problem for at least seven years, which suggests that our lack of capacity to react to the unexpected or emergencies is not just a one-off but is becoming systemic and endemic.</p>
	<p pid="a.940.0/7">It is almost 10 years since the Strategic Defence Review in 1998 set out the Government's vision for the future. Since then, global security has changed significantly, particularly following the terrorist attacks of 2001, the resulting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan against the Taliban, and the campaigns against Osama bin Laden and al-Qaeda across the region. Those are in addition to our continuing roles in the Balkans, Bosnia, Africa and Sierra Leone and, more widely&mdash;as the noble Baroness who introduced this debate said&mdash;working with the EU, the UN and AU peacekeeping efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.940.0/8">Although the SDR was largely welcomed at the time, the global security situation has moved on; added to which, many of the problems that the SDR was supposed to solve&mdash;a posture more suited to the Cold War, undermanning and overstretch&mdash;remain a major concern today. The SDR set broad benchmarks that visualised, for example, either a response to a major international crisis that might require a military effort and combat operations of a similar scale and duration to the Gulf War&mdash;I am advised that, in broad terms, that means deploying an armoured division, 26 major warships and more than 80 combat aircraft&mdash;or undertaking a more extended overseas deployment on a lesser scale, as in Bosnia, for example, while retaining the ability to mount a second substantial deployment, probably involving a combat brigade and appropriate naval and air forces, if this were made necessary by a second crisis. The SDR did not, however, expect both deployments to involve war fighting, or to be maintained simultaneously for longer than six months.</p>
	<p pid="a.940.0/9">In that context, it is worth emphasising the point made by my noble friend Lord Ashdown in a recent article, that only one twenty-fifth of the troop numbers and one fiftieth of the amount of aid is being put into Afghanistan per head of population than we put into Bosnia and Kosovo. Yet the war in Afghanistan is seen as the conflict in which we must succeed if we are to contain and defeat international fundamentalists launching their terrorist campaigns across the world. It is therefore worrying to see reports in our national papers that, according to the MoD's own performance report, almost half of Britain's forces are ill prepared to be sent on operations because of equipment shortages; this in spite of the MoD's previous rebuttals of claims from the military that even troops training for Iraq or Afghanistan have inadequate equipment.</p>
	<p pid="a.940.0/10">I hope that the Minister will address the claims that paratroopers preparing to go to Afghanistan in April have only half the required number of Challenger tanks and Land Rovers fitted with machine guns available for training. Will she respond to claims that the report states that 42 per cent of UK forces have critical or serious weaknesses in their ability to be ready to deploy and that 35 per cent stated that they could not even be certain of meeting their basic peacetime requirements?</p>
	<p pid="a.940.0/11">A further concern has to be that, in spite of reassurances from NATO Secretary-General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer, the tensions between members over the mission in Afghanistan have not been resolved and still threaten progress. It transpires that at a recent meeting of NATO defence Ministers in Holland, up to nine nations might have offered to increase their contributions to the mission in response to US pressure, but there were no responses to the call from the US for major reinforcements. In fact, the possible offers appear to be of more soldiers to help train the Afghan national army, not of troops to take on the war-fighting aspects of the mission. Countries such as Germany, France, Italy and Spain continue to be constrained by what are called national caveats, which restrict their forces to non-combatant roles away from the war-fighting zones. These are political decisions that they should surely find increasingly difficult to sustain, particularly when time is running out to get the mission right and when reconstruction is progressing more slowly than hoped and the Taliban are regaining some hold in the south, in parts that the Afghan national army is as yet unable to protect.</p>
	<p pid="a.940.0/12">Reports from the British American Security Information Council&mdash;BASIC&mdash;last week reinforce that view. They record that, after the NATO chiefs of staff meeting on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-14">14 November</phrase>, General Ray Henault, the chairman of the alliance's military committee, confirmed that shortfalls in troop levels have slowed progress in Afghanistan. He added that even though forces have grown by 8,500 troops, military commanders are still in need of helicopters and other resources. We need to be reassured that all NATO members are still agreed that the mission in Afghanistan cannot be allowed to fail. It cannot be allowed to fail because not just the future of Afghanistan but also the credibility of NATO is on the line. NATO members must be prepared to provide the means and not just to wish for the outcome. I hope that the Minister can confirm that the Government are sending to our allies the message that all members have an individual responsibility to provide the means to achieve a successful outcome for the good of the alliance, their citizens and the success of the campaign against international terrorism, and that the burden has to be shared or it will become unsustainable.</p>
	<p pid="a.940.0/13">In the mean time, our Armed Forces continue to suffer overstretch from unsustainable commitments, inadequate resources, inappropriate equipment and insufficient trained personnel. In that context, the Armed Forces' continuous attitude surveys record that overstretch and frequency of operational tours are now cited as major reasons for service personnel of all ranks deciding to leave the forces. Not surprisingly, there are now acute shortages of qualified personnel in key areas, in particular in military medical services. For example, we have less than 65 per cent of the nurses needed, less than 50 per cent of the surgeons and only 20 per cent of the radiologists. I speak from experience as one who has had every reason to be grateful for the level of healthcare provided by military medical services at Haslar hospital, now sadly closed, and at Frimley Park Hospital in Surrey. I feel very strongly about the need to maintain the morale and capabilities of our Army, Navy and Air Force medical services.</p>
	<p pid="a.940.0/14">The impact on the Armed Forces is aggravated by the number of personnel exceeding the harmony guidelines meant to ensure a reasonable lifestyle for our troops. The figure given by the MoD to the Public Accounts Committee in July this year was still around 12 per cent&mdash;one in eight&mdash;of Army personnel. We would like to hear from the Minister where the statistics are today and how the Government intend to respond more urgently to the eventual loss of these and other key personnel and to restore the covenant with the Armed Forces that is clearly so close to foundering.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-22a.958.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100416" speakername="Lord Marlesford" colon=":" colnum="958"  time="013:17:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71122-0006.htm#07112238000194">
	<p pid="a.958.0/1">My Lords, any speech from my noble friend Lady Park is based on considerable wisdom and experience, and always gives much to our debate. We owe her a deep debt for this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/2">It suddenly occurred to me that it would have been nice if the Secretary of State for Scotland had felt that he could spend a little time sitting on the steps of the Throne to listen to this debate, but that perhaps would have been asking too much of his imagination.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/3">I start from the simple premise that is central to the philosophy not just of my party but of many British people who are wholly apolitical: defence of the realm is the first priority of government. The second and overall aim can be neatly encapsulated by a recent Chinese slogan: the creation of a harmonious society. The third aim must be for Britain to do as much good in the world as it can. We are still a great power in many ways, not least as a veto member of the Security Council. The world needs our values, our skills and our experience; not least, it needs our Armed Forces. The means of achieving these noble aims is sound economic management to generate stability and prosperity at home and the resources to play our part in world affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/4">We are today engaged in two wars, yet the Government's defence policy has been and remains deplorable for one key reason: it has not matched resources to commitments. This has cost lives. A significant number of recent deaths in action and in accidents have been a result of inadequate supplies or quality of equipment. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce, made that point in the most telling way. This failure on defence is one of the main reasons why I would like to see a change of government.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/5">I shall start at the top and expand a little on what my noble friend Lord King said about the ministerial team. We all have our own views on what makes for an effective Defence Secretary. The qualities that do so can be very variable, as I shall illustrate with just three names. The intellect and the war experience of the noble Lord, Lord Healey, made him an extremely effective Secretary of State from 1964 to 1970. The stature, integrity, war record and previous ministerial experience at the MoD of my noble friend Lord Carrington made him an outstanding steward of our Armed Forces from 1970 to 1974. The political skills of my noble friend Lord Heseltine enabled him to repel those political groups on the left that sought to undermine our role in NATO's nuclear shield at a crucial period of the Cold War, between 1983 and 1986. When we look at the team today, what a different picture we can see.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/6">The Secretary of State, Mr Des Browne, has been in place only since May 2006. He had no defence experience known to me before he was appointed and he is not by any stretch of the imagination a political heavyweight. I note that my noble friend Lord Tebbit has been trying, in a Question for Written Answer tabled on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-09">9 October</phrase> but still unanswered, to discover the apportionment of Mr Browne's time between defence and Scotland. The fact that he occupies both posts reflects ill on him, as it certainly does on the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/7">The Minister for the Armed Forces, Mr Bob Ainsworth, has been in post only since <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-29">29 June</phrase>. He, too, seems to have had no previous relevant experience. The noble Baroness, Lady Taylor, the Minister of State for Defence Equipment and Support, who we are delighted will reply to our debate, has been in post for only two weeks. She was for nearly 30 years a much respected member of the other place, where she occupied high ministerial office. For a year she was PPS to Fred Mulley when he was Defence Secretary, and she chaired the Intelligence and Security Committee. I am sure that her well demonstrated talents will make her a considerable addition to the department and, of course, to the government Front Bench here.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/8">Mr Derek Twigg has for just one year been a junior Minister and Minister for Veterans. For 19 years he was a junior civil servant at the then Department of Education and Science, and again he appears to have no relevant previous defence experience. For all their virtues as individuals, this must be one of the least experienced and most thinly spread ministerial teams ever at a time when the demands on our Armed Forces are as great as at any time since 1945.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/9">We recently lost the services of the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, who had a considerable reputation in the House. He resigned suddenly and quite unexpectedly two weeks ago. The reason given was that he wanted to continue his pastime of motor racing, but I believe that the noble Lord was much too great a patriot to have abandoned ship for such a reason. It would have been more straightforward had we been told the real reason, which I gather was a dispute with the Treasury over the very large and important procurement programme for the future rapid effect system vehicles, known as FRES.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/10">I shall comment on one other key position at the Ministry of Defence&mdash;that of the Permanent Secretary, head of the whole MoD Civil Service. We all have our views on who were the most distinguished holders of that post. Of the two whom I would nominate from my time, the first is Sir Frank Cooper, an RAF war pilot, who between 1976 and 1982 ensured that the department got the resources that it needed to perform its tasks and who was responsible for the introduction, under Sir Derek Rayner, of new procurement systems. The other is Sir Michael Quinlan, who ran the department from 1988 to 1992. Thought by many to have been one of the cleverest men ever to work in Whitehall, he was responsible for putting together the intellectual case for upgrading our nuclear capability into the Trident system which has served us so well.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/11">Today the Permanent Secretary is Mr Bill Jeffrey. His previous post, from 2002 to 2005, was as director-general of the Home Office Immigration and Nationality Department, the organisation that was memorably denounced by the then Home Secretary, Mr John Reid, as &quot;not fit for purpose&quot;. Is Mr Jeffrey really the best that today's Civil Service could produce for this crucial position?</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/12">I have one further point on people. Your Lordships' House is well endowed with military experience, as witnessed by the six distinguished former commanders taking part today and the two former Secretaries of State who have already spoken. The House of Commons is rapidly running out of any military experience. Twenty MPs have served in the regular Army, 18 of them Conservatives, two Labour and no Lib Dems; 11 have served in the TA, all of them Conservatives; nine have served in the RAF, including five Labour, three Conservatives and one independent, with no Lib Dems; and four have served in the Royal Navy, all Conservatives, no Lib Dems. Political parties should make a real effort to persuade those with former military careers to enter the House of Commons. I agree that that might not be a very attractive proposition nowadays, since this Government have so devalued that House. Nevertheless, it is crucial if we are to continue to monitor and understand the needs of defence policy in this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/13">We have had some very successful military operations under this Government, including Bosnia, when the UN white paint was replaced with NATO green, Kosovo and Sierra Leone. But the tasks that we now face in Iraq and Afghanistan are daunting indeed. I believe that we have done all that we can in Iraq and that it is time for us to leave it. Iraq will sink or swim, whether or not we are there; its future will not depend on our presence. Afghanistan is another matter. It is crucial. We entered it ill prepared for what we would find. How could the MoD have sent the Northern Ireland Snatch Land Rovers for that campaign? Our forces have done incredibly well, but they are overextended and sadly unable to hold the territory that they have captured through gallant and effective fighting.</p>
	<p pid="a.958.0/14">Our Prime Minister must adjust our military commitments to the resources that he is prepared to make available. That probably means having a rundown in many theatres&mdash;in Northern Ireland, Germany and Cyprus, for example. A European defence dimension is not a substitute for NATO. At the moment we are wasting a good deal of money on things such as Galileo. The Prime Minister must demonstrate that he regards the overseas operations that we do undertake as having the highest priority. He must regard the men and women who serve in our Armed Forces as our most valuable national asset.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-22a.988.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100004" speakername="Lord Addington" colon=":" colnum="988"  time="015:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71122-0010.htm#07112243000100">
	<p pid="a.988.0/1">My Lords, I am extremely nervous about summing up a debate that has featured quite so much expertise. One thing that has become apparent is that we as a political class are only just starting to wake up to the reality of the fact that we are involved in two wars which could last for many years, indeed possibly even for decades. Our forces are deployed to a level that was never planned for, and that is a historical problem which has affected all Governments for the past couple of decades. We did not expect this to happen and we have not planned for it. Moreover, we do not have enough intelligence&mdash;I use the word in the sense of information gathering&mdash;to enable us to decide what we can do successfully. We do not know how long these things may go on for, and that is the backdrop to the entire debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/2">We have to square up to the fact that these wars we have chosen to become involved in have to be fought and won. That is certainly the case in Afghanistan, but I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Attlee, that I do not think we should have gone into Iraq in the first place and that we could probably leave without affecting the outcome. Unless we back up our forces with sufficient resources and political capital, we risk encouraging the groups we have set out to confront. We have to ensure that we are there for the long haul. This, however, will lead to considerable attention being drawn to the way in which we have planned, the way in which we are prepared to spend money and the priorities that we in the political world give to this expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/3">The case for a new Strategic Defence Review has become overwhelming. It has already been said that the attempt to take a peace dividend at the end of the Cold War has led to our Armed Forces being, if not cut, slightly whittled away and allowed to wither. We did not think that there would be any great long-term commitments so we became slightly more adventurous and thought that we could make interventions at a lower level. Ultimately, this policy has led to our troops being greatly stretched.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/4">As to the covenant, I thank the Minister for replying to the questions I raised in the debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-07">7 November</phrase>. I am afraid I have not studied his reply in any great depth as I picked it up at two o'clock today. I have covered the situation of our troops at home. The second part of the covenant is to make sure that troops in the field have what is required to win a conflict with the minimum casualties. However, as has been proved, casualties will be an ongoing factor for the foreseeable future. Not only must we make sure that our troops have the right weapons in the field but&mdash;as has been pointed out by people who, if they do not know, no one does&mdash;the right training and equipment properly to prepare them to take the right action. This will in turn enhance the chances of a successful outcome and cut down on casualties. Our troops in the field should have this backing, this logistical support, and sufficient colleagues to call on to meet the challenges in front of them. It would be a positive note if we could have an assurance that this Administration will never undertake another military operation unless that back-up and support can be made available to those involved. These are wars of choice. We are not defending our own borders or those of our allies; we chose to take part in the action.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/5">What options would be available to us if there were to be a Strategic Defence Review? We could carry on as we are, looking at the budget and trying to find a little more money to maintain a general cross-capacity; or we could pump more money in to make sure that we can do all the things we have traditionally tried to do. We could consider what is to be the role of the Armed Forces in the future. Do we have the capacity to fight the kind of war we are fighting in Afghanistan, the capacity to fight an armoured rapid movement war, the capacity successfully to deploy a fleet with the ability to wage war by itself&mdash;or do we withdraw from such operations? Do we decide that there are things we cannot do that we have previously said we should do? Do we decide publicly to admit that we can no longer take independent action?</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/6">These decisions would be enhanced if we could achieve a political consensus by opening up the discussion to those involved. This would require a degree of political courage by all concerned. Are we going to say, for instance, that we will take certain types of action only in conjunction with our primary ally, the United States? This is not an easy decision to make, especially for those on these Benches who have not liked the political decisions of the United States. However, it is a decision we have to take.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/7">What are we going to do in the future? At the moment, the deployed forces are stretched and we are in danger of starving of resources the branches of the Armed Forces which are not under the spotlight at the moment. This may affect their capacity to engage in the future. We should not even contemplate leaving our Armed Forces exposed in this way and still give consideration to the possibility of future deployments.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/8">We must remember the covenant. These are our service personnel. They are potentially not only in danger but that danger is enhanced and defeat may well be inevitable. We must grab hold of this problem. We have heard from all around the House that if we do not take a grip on this situation we will simply muddle on and through, constantly undermining and endangering our personnel. We must look at what is required to support them.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/9">I turn to the matter of the covenant. Are we going to continue to ensure that not only do our Armed Forces personnel have sufficient personal resources to keep them involved and interested in the forces, but that it remains an attractive career in the future? The noble Baroness, Lady Dean, said that it was not just a question of pay. I have recently spoken to senior serving officers who said that their soldiers, on coming back from operations and covering for firefighters during the recent dispute, had said what an easy job it was and how much better paid firefighters were. There is a perception that they are undervalued compared with, for example, policemen. It does not matter that they are comparing chalk and cheese&mdash;and indeed a firefighter may have a distinct opinion on exactly how good a job the soldiers did&mdash;but the fact that they feel that way is the most important thing. It is not just a question of pay, but if your accommodation is not right, you are doing more service without the chance to do the right training, your wives and girlfriends&mdash;this is predominantly from a male perspective&mdash;are saying, &quot;It's either me or your job&quot; and your children are not getting the right education or are having to move schools, the issue of pay will certainly be one of your grievances.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/10">The idea that you are being undervalued is probably as important as any one action. The idea that you are held in esteem has historically attracted people to the armed services, and we should be prepared to take action that enhances that feeling. I forget exactly who mentioned it, but merely saying, &quot;Aren't our Armed Forces wonderful?&quot; does not really cut it. There are only so many times a man can be put into a dress uniform and paraded around while people say, &quot;Isn't he wonderful?&quot; before he starts wondering about his pay packet and his housing.</p>
	<p pid="a.988.0/11">We have to try to address the situation. We have to admit that we are fighting a war and asking our servicemen, when they don a uniform and go on operations, to risk their lives as the direct result of someone else wanting to kill them. We cannot get by on the policy that was described to me as &quot;jogging along&quot; as we did during the Cold War. We have to take more assertive action, such as identifying targets and establishing what the Government think are the minimum standards of support for servicemen. Unless we achieve these two things and marry them together, we will have a failure at some level. It may not be this time around and it will probably not be dramatic or even obvious at the time, but we will build up a great probability of failure at some point in the future.</p>

	<p pid="a.993.0/1">My Lords, I congratulate the noble Baroness on securing the debate. I am sure that she is very gratified by the number and quality of the speeches that we have had and by the serious way in which this debate has been addressed. I was very pleased that she put her concerns in context and acknowledged that there have been problems for a very long time, including under her Government. We should not forget that many of the problems that we are addressing are historic in nature, as is a great deal of the problem that we have on defence expenditure.</p>
	<p pid="a.993.0/2">The contributions that we have had have been serious and informed. I respect the views of those who have spoken, even if I cannot accept them all. I will endeavour to respond to much of what has been said, but it would be impossible to respond to every detail. Where people have asked me to write, I will. I hope to respond to some of the themes that have run through the speeches, because certain key areas concern many Members of the House.</p>
	<p pid="a.993.0/3">I start by stating this Government's gratitude&mdash;the debt of gratitude that we all have&mdash;to the members of the Armed Forces and those who support them around the world, in particular the service men and women who are based in Iraq and in Afghanistan and who are playing an indispensable role, despite very difficult and dangerous circumstances. They can be justifiably proud of what they have done to help the security and stability of those two countries and, along with many who have spoken this afternoon, I pay tribute to their professionalism and commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.993.0/4">I will say a few words about Iraq to start with. The noble Lords, Lord Chidgey and Lord Astor, talked about the extra contributions that we would like to make in different places. We are working in Iraq with a very significant commitment, which we hope will decline in the not-too-distant future. There have been problems, as the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, mentioned. He asked me about paratroopers and the availability of Challengers for training. I am told that 318 are available for training, so that should not be the problem that was indicated to him. He is welcome to come back to me with any other aspect of that matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.993.0/5">We have now handed over three of the provinces to Iraqi control. Iraqi forces have now taken on the primary role of providing security in Basra city. As the Prime Minister of Iraq confirmed on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-29">29 October</phrase>, the transfer of Basra province to Iraqi control will take place in December. That will be the last province within the British-led area to transition. This is a very significant achievement and we should be proud of what has happened there, even though our Armed Forces are still facing a difficult job in training and mentoring the Iraqi security force.</p>
	<p pid="a.993.0/6">Adjustments to the number of UK forces in Iraq are based on conditions and not on arbitrary timetables, as other Ministers have said in the past. This approach has allowed us to reduce the number of our forces in Iraq and gives us hope that we can further reduce our force levels in southern Iraq to around 2,500 from spring 2008. But we still have an important job to do. We will honour the commitment that we have made and remain in Iraq until we, the Iraqi Government and our coalition partners are confident that the Iraqi security forces can operate without our support.</p>
	<p pid="a.993.0/7">Several noble Lords mentioned the situation in Afghanistan, where we are deployed in support of a UN-authorised, NATO-led mission: the International Security Assistance Force. ISAF is there to support the Government of Afghanistan as they seek to extend their authority across the entire country, which is necessary to improve security and facilitate development and reconstruction. Our Armed Forces have already contributed significantly to moving the country from a pariah state that harboured international terrorism to one that is making progress in development. The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, asked about the relationship between anti-terrorism activity and rebuilding a country. From our point of view, it is clear that in order to combat terrorism developed in that country, you have to help in reconstruction. The two go hand in hand. We acknowledge that it is a long-term commitment but we are determined that Afghanistan should not be allowed to become a failed state again. The noble Lords, Lord Astor and Lord Chidgey, mentioned that it would be helpful&mdash;and, I think, only reasonable&mdash;if other countries undertook their fair share of that burden, because that has not necessarily been the case in the past.</p>
	<p pid="a.993.0/8">A great deal of this debate has concentrated on spending and the defence budget. I was advised in a very friendly way not to mention the settlement, but I have to confirm that it was 1.5 per cent in real terms. I mention it because I need to point out that this is the longest period of sustained real-terms growth in planned defence expenditure since the 1980s. That is no mean achievement and something that we should not dismiss. Noble Lords may want us to spend more but they must recognise that there has been a very significant increase in the recent past. This new spending allows us to proceed with two new aircraft carriers. They will not be built in France, as the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, suggested, although we will discuss the matter with the French because they have an interest in having a similar facility. We are also investing a great deal in issues that concern families, as many noble Lords mentioned in terms of the covenant. I will say a word about&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.1001.2/1">My Lords, I had little thought when I put down this Prayer that we would be debating a second failure by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs within a week. Rather than the loss of a disc of the financial records of 25 million people, this social security statutory instrument reveals a joint failure by HMRC and the Department for Work and Pensions, a department whose care and attention to detail has been slipping woefully under this Government. As recently as <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-25">25 October</phrase>, I complained about this when we discussed the Housing Benefit (Loss of Benefit) (Pilot Scheme) (Supplementary) Regulations 2007, saying that the department's predecessor department, that of social security, was considerably more efficient.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/2">These regulations, which came into effect on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-01">1 October</phrase>, have been made to correct the overpayment of benefits&mdash;jobseeker's allowance, incapacity benefit, bereavement benefit and the state pension. As the Explanatory Memorandum states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/3" class="indent">&quot;The changes ensure that earnings ... which were erroneously awarded ... will still count towards the satisfaction of the contribution conditions&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/4">for those benefits. They also mean that decisions will not be revised, and ensure that certain classes of contributions will be treated as being paid on time, whether they actually were or not. In other words, they provide an amnesty for benefit claimants who have been overpaid due to, we are told, a mismatch of data between two computer programs&mdash;the DWP's pensions strategy computer system and the NIRS2 computer run by Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs. There are, we are told, 90,000 such cases of overpayment. Lucky recipients; they are clearly doing rather well out of this exercise.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/5">Not only that, on the other side of the equation it is estimated that 30,000 claimants have been underpaid. The Explanatory Memorandum states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/6" class="indent">&quot;The decision has been made to make good the underpayments&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/7">How gracious can you be? Were such sentiments to appear on a public paper over which I, as a Minister, had control, they would certainly not appear like that. The noble Lord must be heartily relieved that few, if any, benefit recipients will read the Explanatory Memorandum. Unsurprisingly, I would be much ruder if such a decision had not been made, and we certainly would not be debating this matter late on a Thursday.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/8">This mismatch of computer systems has been going on since 1998. While we are told that the period in question finished in 2006, the regulations are of a much wider scope, with a start date of the financial year 1993-94, ending in 2007-08. Why this very long period? How, too, can we be assured that this is the end of the matter?</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/9">I observe from the 31st report of your Lordships' estimable Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee that:</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/10" class="indent">&quot;The flaw in Her Majesty's Customs and Revenue NIRS 2 computer has been identified and is believed&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/11">I underline that word&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/12" class="indent">&quot;to have been operating correctly since November 2005&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/13">&quot;Believed&quot; is a very odd word in the circumstances. If it has been working correctly since then, there should be no new cases of overpayments since then or, indeed, of underpayments. Why then does this statutory instrument extend the amnesty for another 16 months until April 2008? That belief cannot be very strong. If it is ill founded, will we not find another order next year to do exactly the same job? Was that computer program, NIRS2, created by the same firm&mdash;EDS, I believe&mdash;that programmed the one dealing with the Treasury's tax and pension credits? Are they perhaps even the same computer?</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/14">I have never heard that there has been an amnesty for overpayments in the tax credits areas since the Government introduced it. We have heard screams of rage from people who have been overpaid and have had to pay the money back. It is hardly surprising when people on low incomes suffer very badly from an irregular income stream. It seems that there is a division of opinion between the DWP and the Treasury about what should happen in these cases. Did the DWP need Treasury approval before laying the regulations, or did it do so off its own bat? My party has decried this creeping control of social security by the Treasury on a number of occasions. Is it not high time that the Government sorted themselves out and the Treasury did what it is good at&mdash;collecting money&mdash;and the DWP paid out pensions and benefits, which is what it is good at? Then we would not have the nonsense of tax and pensions credits being overpaid and having to be clawed back.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/15">Although I do not like it, I have to accept that we are where we are and that this statutory instrument seeks to sort out yet another mess of the Government's making. Why is it that every time the Government go out to tender on a computer program, it hardly ever delivers what is required and yet more taxpayers' money needs to be thrown at consultants to sort it out? In the summer of 2005, we learnt that the Office of Government Commerce&mdash;ironically to be found in the Treasury&mdash;revealed that of 254 computer projects, one-third had skipped the first two stages of evaluation, which include an assessment of whether the new computer system is,</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/16" class="indent">&quot;feasible, affordable and likely to achieve value for money&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/17">Furthermore, while 57 projects were awarded a green-light rating, 127 had amber warnings and 70 had red warnings, meaning respectively that the project could continue only provided certain alternations were made and that immediate remedial action was needed. Eight projects were given double red warnings that prompted letters to the relevant Permanent Secretaries stating that the project had very serious problems.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/18">I have a pet theory to put to the Minister. It is that the team in the department&mdash;any department&mdash;that arranged the original contract is not the one that receives the finished product, because big computer programs take longer to develop than civil servants remain in any particular job. Each new team will have its own ideas about what should go into the program, hence more delay and cost. My theory is backed up by a question I put to the noble and learned Lord, Lord Falconer of Thoroton, when, as Lord Chancellor, he was answering a Starred Question about a project being commissioned at the time for which his department was responsible. I asked him for a guarantee that there would be no changes to a contract under discussion before delivery of the finished product. He failed to give me that assurance. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/19" class="indent">&quot;We will do our level best to ensure that all the requirements are provided at the earliest possible stage. I cannot guarantee that we will get it absolutely right but, plainly, the noble Lord's point is a good one&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 15/3/04; col. 7.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/20">How long did it take for NIRS2 to be developed? When was it delivered? How many civil servants who commissioned it were in post to run through it when it was finally delivered? The only way to mitigate the problem of computer failures is, as a Select Committee of another place so wisely suggested, to nominate a civil servant to oversee a computer project from the original specification to final delivery. Have Ministers in the Department for Work and Pensions had discussions on this with their Permanent Secretary? Indeed, does the Minister know of any department that has held such discussion? I hope that he will be able to answer the first question today; I should be more than happy to have an answer to the second question in writing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/21">Your Lordships' Merits Committee zeroed in on the waste of taxpayers' money, which of course also concerns me. Up to &pound;300 million, covering possibly 90,000 awards of benefit, is to be written off. I say &quot;up to&quot; as it appears that no one knows how many claims have been overpaid or to what value, and in the circumstances it appears that it is not worth the trouble and expense of finding out. Are discussions going on regarding the possible suing of the computer company, as they are about the program dealing with tax and pensions credits?</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/22">Whichever, this &pound;300 million is the beginning of the cost to the taxpayer. There is another &pound;65 million or so of underpayments to be made good from the department's administrative budget. This amount of money sloshing around in the administrative budget does not smack to me of tight fiscal control. Add those two unexpected sums together and you get &pound;365 million, more or less. You would expect that that would solve the major part of the problem&mdash;unfortunately, not a bit of it. There is still the little matter of correcting the computer fault. Additional computer costs are believed to be &pound;0.7 million, shared between the DWP and HMRC, with suggested HMRC staff costs of &pound;1.3 million. Knowing that computer specialists command more in an hour than your Lordships' expenses allowances command in a day, I am not surprised by the first figure, but what on earth are the enormous HMRC costs for?</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/23">This has been yet another very sorry story, to which I would like the explanations for which I have asked. In essence, I am concerned at the Government's very loose control over the public purse and their abject failure in anything to do with computers. I beg to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.1001.2/24">Moved, That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the regulations laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-07">7 September</phrase> be annulled (SI 2007/2582). <I>31st Report from the Merits Committee, Session 2006-07.</I>&mdash;(<I>Lord Skelmersdale</I>.)</p>

	<p pid="a.1004.0/1">My Lords, the House should be grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, for moving this Motion. It involves a series of very important points. The noble Lord made a very effective speech and I concur with much, if not all, of what he said. I shall ask some questions. If the Minister cannot answer them this afternoon, perhaps we could share correspondence which might shed light on some of these matters to the benefit of everyone involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004.0/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-15">15 November</phrase>, Mr James Plaskitt announced in the House of Commons that there were 4,000 duplicate payments in the Pensions Service and the Disability and Carers Service as well as ex gratia payments. Is that part of the same problem, or is it something else altogether that is embedded in the Disability and Carers Service? Is it part of the pattern? The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, made the important point that the national insurance recording system is the basis on which contributory benefits are calculated. If they are wrong, everything downstream of that is, almost by definition, likely to become wrong. So the integrity of the whole contributory system requires that the 70 million records currently held on NIRS2, as it is known by acronym, are an essential part of the integrity of payments of benefits of a contributory kind.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004.0/3">There are 152 or more incoming streams of data into NIRS2. That is not an easy project. It enjoyed a very troubled birth. I think that Andersen Consulting went bankrupt as a result of putting the thing into place, EDS tried to take it over, and it is now in the hands of the Aspire Group of contractors. Perhaps the Minister can confirm that that is indeed the case. It is a process that is very difficult to amend because it is live all the time. You cannot switch it off overnight to clean up data. An important question to which the House needs an answer is: what mismatch went wrong? A mismatch of data is a description of a symptom of a mistake in the process. What we want to know is: what was the mistake in the process? Are the data corrupt on both platforms? Are the data identified as being corrupt on one or other of the two systems? They are entirely different bases of software. They were not designed to run together, so they could both have problems unique to themselves, or it could be a problem of the integration of the two. It is important to understand precisely what went wrong so that we can understand whether the process has been rectified.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004.0/4">Further, although the scanning was obviously necessary to pick up the problem, will the fix be a software fix or will some of it need to be done manually? Some recipients of overpayment or underpayment will have to be contacted individually, so there is obviously going to be an element of manual handling, but will the debugging of the interface between the two different bits of software be done electronically, or will members of staff in the DWP have to turn their hands to some of the record cleaning by themselves as a desktop exercise?</p>
	<p pid="a.1004.0/5">One thing that has a direct bearing on that is the very, very tight departmental expenditure limit for the next three years just announced in the Comprehensive Spending Review. That will put great pressure on the head count, because the head count is separate and distinct and will have to fall, never mind the fact that the money in the DEL is being reduced over the next three years. To what extent has the overpayment been provoked by the fact that the department may not even have the staff to do that in any other way? Of course the overpayments are welcome, because it is no fault of the claimants of those benefits that the mistake has been made. To what extent has the tight envelope that the Department for Work and Pensions been facing been a contributory factor in working out how to fix the problem?</p>
	<p pid="a.1004.0/6">What has the National Audit Office and the Comptroller and Auditor-General to say about all that? This is one of the principal reasons that the department's accounts have been qualified endlessly for the past seven, eight or more years. Until we get the reconciliation of data streams organised in a way with which the Comptroller and Auditor-General is satisfied, the department's accounts will continue to be qualified. To any kind of business outside the public service, that would be an almost fatal blow to its credibility in the marketplace. That is a serious issue and a key element in why the accounts continue to be qualified.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004.0/7">What exactly were the communications between the Social Security Advisory Committee and the department? We are told in the Explanatory Memorandum that, at the end of the day, the SSAC was satisfied with the instrument and let it proceed, but because the Inland Revenue&mdash;the HMRC&mdash;is involved, we cannot see, as we could if it were an entirely DWP issue, exactly what the SSAC had to say. It would publish memoranda, reports and everything that involved it directly if the instrument were referenced by the department to the Social Security Advisory Committee. I am prepared to believe that, at the end of the day, it was content to let the instrument proceed, but were there communications between the committee and the department that we cannot see because of the involvement of HMRC, the Inland Revenue, that would cast some light on any concerns that the committee originally had? This is a very technical business, and I for one would have been a lot more content if any communications between the department and the SSAC, and indeed between the department and the Comptroller and Auditor-General, about these matters, had been published. I would certainly have been an awful lot more confident that the thing was being done in the best way possible.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004.0/8">Finally, I am very uneasy. I know that we have to do this and I understand the need to protect the claimants, but the regulations are creating a unique class of 130,000 claimants at law. Apart from anything else, that does not help to deal with the complexity; it simply creates extra layers of things that people have to pay attention to when implementing the rules as they stand. It is a worrying precedent to find that there has been an error in the department. It is good that the department has owned up to it. This has been going on for a long while. One might have thought it possible to fix it earlier, but we are where we are, as the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, says, and we must accept that no one is suffering financially as a result. However, creating a completely separate class of people at law is a worrying precedent. Indeed, is it a precedent? I believe that the regulations are time-limited, but having been through this procedure, can we take it as read that, if there are mismatches between NIRS2 and the pension service computer system in future and it goes wrong again, there is something to which we can resort in the future? This is the first time to my knowledge that the regulations have been changed to protect the claimants in the way in which the Government have sought to protect them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1004.0/9">The noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, is absolutely right that there is much at stake in the regulations. This is not only about the lack of competence and the complexity but about the difficulty in trying to use the meagre resources available to the department to handle some of these very sophisticated IT systems in a way that guarantees that no one suffers at the end of the day. Although these people have been picked up, others in the system might not and might be suffering as a direct result of the complexity of the IT systems.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-22a.1006.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100802" speakername="Lord McKenzie of Luton" colon=":" colnum="1006"  time="016:16:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71122-0012.htm#07112243000191">
	<p pid="a.1006.0/1">My Lords, I thank the noble Lords, Lord Skelmersdale and Lord Kirkwood, for their contributions today. I understand that the mechanism of the prayer is to be able to debate the issue rather than to seek seriously to disrupt the regulations. I hope that that is the case. I shall start by putting matters into context. Without being complacent about the issue that has arisen, there are 65 million active national insurance accounts, 11.7 million customers who receive the state pension, and 2.7 million individuals who receive incapacity benefits and credits. That is the scale of the DWP's customer base.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006.0/2">I have listened to all the points made on the Motion to annul the regulations, which among things legitimise certain payments of the state pension, incapacity benefits, jobseeker's allowance, bereavement benefits and widow's benefits. These benefits are invariably paid to vulnerable people or to people with a limited income. The 31st report from the Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee has drawn the regulations to the attention of the House on the grounds that they give rise to issues of public policy likely to be of interest to the House, and that it may wish to probe the cost of the flawed computer system to the public purse and how the error came about; exactly the issues that have been raised this afternoon.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006.0/3">The reason for the incorrect calculation of these benefits is the mismatch of data about the period of incapacity and the award of national insurance credits. The DWP is responsible for administering claims for incapacity benefit for which national insurance credits are awarded for the period in which the person cannot work. The DWP computer records the period of incapacity, and the HMRC computer records the awards of the credits. It became clear that discrepancies existed between the data held on these two computer systems, and this was picked up by the National Audit Office in its report on the National Insurance Fund for 2004-05.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006.0/4">The error arose, a point pressed by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood, as a result of the conversion of data held on the first national insurance recording system, NIRS1, to the second system, NIRS2, in 1998. The IT fault was exaggerated by a breakdown in the supporting business processes intended to resolve discrepancies between data held on the DWP computer and the NIRS2 system. I apologise for the error and its ensuing consequences. The DWP has worked with HMRC to resolve both the IT and business processes, and I can assure the House that the IT problem has been resolved since November 2005. New instructions have been issued to DWP staff setting out the actions that must be taken to rectify customers' records when mismatches occur. The House will be aware that a Written Ministerial Statement was made by my honourable friend James Plaskitt on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-23">23 July</phrase> explaining the background and setting out how the Government intended to correct the affected cases, both of overpayment and underpayment. It was clear that the underpaid cases would have to be corrected, but we have to consider carefully how we deal with the overpaid cases, a point again pressed by the noble Lord, Lord Kirkwood.</p>
	<p pid="a.1006.0/5">The sole reason for the overpayment was the mismatch of the data recorded on two government computers. This can and should be classified as official error and therefore in this instance it would have been inappropriate to seek to recover any of these overpayments. I should say to the noble Lord, Lord Skelmersdale, that this is a completely different situation from tax credits where, as we have debated before, what are labelled as overpayments come about as a consequence of how the calculation proceeds under the rules.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-22a.1012.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100469" speakername="Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay" colon=":" colnum="1012"  time="016:56:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71122-0013.htm#07112243000220">
	<p pid="a.1012.2/1">My Lords, following the analogy that we heard when discussing the previous regulations, I make it clear that we are not trying to wave a red flag at these regulations, although we certainly wish to wave a few amber flags around, raise some questions and get some answers from the Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/2">I make it clear that we welcome the evidence from the nine pathfinder areas that direct payments have risen to 84 per cent from an average of about 45 per cent before local housing allowance was introduced. We support the Government's ambition to encourage financial responsibility and we recognise the evidence that financial inclusion is an important step towards finding employment and getting off benefits. However, we are not convinced that the local housing allowance policy will achieve these objectives when it is rolled out nationally and that proper provisions are yet in place to protect vulnerable individuals.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/3">The DWP <I>Housing Benefit Local Housing Allowance Guidance Manual</I>, for use by local authority housing benefit officers, states very clearly:</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/4" class="indent">&quot;You will not be expected to be pro-active in identifying someone as potentially an unlikely payer&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/5">Vulnerable individuals are therefore responsible for presenting themselves as likely rent defaulters. How can that be right for mentally impaired people, illiterate people, those who cannot speak English or those who are tackling drinking or gambling addictions? Cases can be referred also by landlords, friends or families, but these people may after all have their own agendas. As part of the purpose of the reform is to remove the stigma associated with housing benefit, how will landlords know that tenants are receiving LHA and be in a position to raise the alarm about non-payment? Cases can be referred also by advice, welfare or social services.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/6">As my noble friend Lord Addington proposed in Committee, we should assume that these vulnerable groups will struggle to handle their financial affairs. Changes to direct payments should therefore take place only once an assessment has been made that they can cope. In its current form, payment to landlords and a case assessment are not automatically triggered until rent has fallen into eight weeks of arrears. That is a long time for money to be misspent and for relations between landlord and tenant perhaps to break down.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/7">In some pathfinder projects, benefit officers were keen to intervene early in cases where rent went unpaid, rarely waiting for the eight weeks of arrears before triggering an investigation. Is there not a danger that sharp landlords will spot that, by alleging rent arrears, they can get their income guaranteed? Evidence from the pathfinders suggests that there is a problem with the appeal system being clogged with allegations of arrears.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/8">Housing benefit officers are encouraged to become proactive only once direct payments have been suspended. The DWP guidance manual states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/9" class="indent">&quot;If you decide that direct payments are appropriate, you should set a diary date in order to conduct a review of your decision, not exceeding 12 months, to look again at the decision&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/10">That review process is expected to be repeated annually. For the most vulnerable individuals, for whom direct payments will never be appropriate, that can represent an annual ordeal of uncertainty. For LHA to prove effective, a more reliable and proactive system is required to identify vulnerability. The objectives of the reform may be admirable, but the assumption that direct payment is suitable in all but the most extreme cases is wildly overoptimistic.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/11">Why do the Government assume that this change to LHA will represent a major lifting of the administrative burden? Some aspects of the reforms are genuinely simpler, such as calculating rent levels from local median estimates, for example, rather than the actual rent paid. Other parts are hideously complicated, as when HB officers are expected to take account of other income received by the tenant and the impact of other people living in the household, for example. The conclusion from the pathfinder evaluation is, I am bound to say, very carefully worded. It says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/12" class="indent">&quot;On balance the net effect administratively of the LHA ... in the longer run ... ignoring set up costs and some specific implementation difficulties, is probably positive, but it is unlikely that this constitutes a 'substantial' advantage to HB administration and delivery&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/13">That is not exactly what I would call a glowing reference.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/14">We simply cannot make fundamental reforms of this flawed system on the cheap. Any reform of housing benefit delivery must be properly resourced and take account of large numbers of vulnerable cases requiring sensitive handling. The more complicated estimates of rent settlements, which in most cases increase income, such as the impact on others living in the house, will be overlooked&mdash;or there is a danger of it&mdash;if we do not put enough resources into reforms. The evidence by one HB officer to the pathfinder evaluation made the point well. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/15" class="indent">&quot;Dealing with claimant vulnerability has ... frequently proved to be difficult, time-consuming and resource intensive, and significant efforts have had to be made to set up and maintain arrangements with other departments and agencies in order to adequately fulfil this function&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/16">What assessment have the Government made of the extra burdens that they are placing on our already strained advice services? The LHA guidance manual instructs local authorities to refer cases to advice services for almost any problem. If direct payment has been suspended, advice services will work with individuals so that it can be restored. If vulnerability has been identified, local authorities are instructed to refer to advice services and, if clients require a bank account to begin direct payment, they are advised to call advice services&mdash;and advice services are one of the bodies expected to identify potential vulnerability. The burden laid on them hardly bears thinking about.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/17">The experience in pathfinder areas has been largely positive, to be fair, with local authorities and welfare and advice services working together so far. However, it is wishful thinking to presume that that will be repeated everywhere after national rollout. As Citizens Advice said in its submission to the evaluation, it is,</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/18" class="indent">&quot;worth noting that all the pathfinder authorities had made a choice to take part in this pilot, and were also well resourced and supported by DWP. They were therefore highly committed to making it work. These conditions will not be present in national roll out&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/19">Indeed, wider Citizens Advice and Shelter evidence on delivery across the country,</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/20" class="indent">&quot;leads us to believe that it is very unlikely that this level of activity and commitment will voluntarily be undertaken by every HB department&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/21">That is Citizens Advice&mdash;and if that organisation does not know what it is talking about, I do not know who does.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/22">We on these Benches have warned the Government time and again that advice services funding is hampered by ring-fencing of funds and reliance on a plethora of different forms of funding, in some cases almost in penny packets. We have had this same problem come up under the whole question of generic debt advice and pensions. Individuals who are most likely to struggle under the LHA provisions are also most likely to need additional advice, whether on debt, disability, welfare, employment or immigration. Can the Minister assure me that increased funding for advice services will incorporate provisions for general advice as well as specific housing benefit advice?</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/23">This is a missed opportunity to reform the arbitrary unfairness experienced by people under the age of 25, as we discussed in debates on the Welfare Reform Bill. The room rates for single people, who are statistically far more likely to be in poverty already, and the most vulnerable to drugs and homelessness, are simply inadequate. The pathfinder evaluation reported that across the nation the rate at which the LHA is set is generally considered fair and adequate to meet housing needs, except the rate set for shared rooms, which is the rate to which under-25s are constrained.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/24">Citizens Advice found that 87 per cent of single-room rent claimants have faced a shortfall between housing benefit received and the rent levels that they pay. The research says that this inevitably,</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/25" class="indent">&quot;puts young people at greater risk of social and financial exclusion, making it more difficult for them to find and sustain employment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/26">How can it be right that local housing allowance fails to help young people at their most vulnerable when they are starting their careers and living away from their families? I beg to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.1012.2/27">Moved, That an humble Address be presented to Her Majesty praying that the regulations laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-08">8 October</phrase> be annulled (SI 2007/2868).&mdash;(<I>Lord Oakeshott of Seagrove Bay.</I>)</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-22a.1015.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100597" speakername="Lord Skelmersdale" colon=":" colnum="1015"  time="017:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71122-0013.htm#07112243000236">
	<p pid="a.1015.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, for bringing these orders on the new local housing allowance to our attention this evening. I certainly do not agree with him, as he knows well, on the last point that he made in his introductory speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015.0/2">I noticed that all the orders were made on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-02">2 October</phrase> this year. My first question is rather technical but, given my interest in statutory instruments, it is this: we have one Explanatory Memorandum covering all four instruments. Why then were four instruments required in the first place, especially as Nos. 2868 and 2869 have exactly the same title? Surely, these and the consequential amendment regulations could have been combined. In other words, we could have had not four in one, but three plus one.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015.0/3">To turn to the nuts and bolts of the orders, my party's position on local housing allowance was set out in Grand Committee on the Welfare Reform Bill by my noble friend Lord Taylor of Holbeach. Pilots&mdash;I do not like the word Pathfinders&mdash;were already in existence when that debate was held on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-01">1 March</phrase> and our concerns revolved around the Government's intention to allow housing benefit claimants to handle their own housing benefit rather than having it paid direct to the landlord.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015.0/4">We felt and still feel that, even though the pilots have shown, for a limited period anyway, that double the number of self-handlers were capable of paying rent subsidy and indeed did&mdash;rent subsidy is housing benefit&mdash;there would be those customers who, for many reasons, do not hand the benefit to the landlord. I understand that that figure is about 16 per cent of all housing benefit recipients.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015.0/5">At the time, I was pleased to hear the noble Baroness, Lady Morgan, say that funding to support the financial advice services had been set aside for the national rollout of local housing allowance. Set aside is one thing, but will the Minister say whether this money is now in place or whether it will be on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-07">7 April</phrase> next year? I was also reassured by her statement that regulations will ensure that payments can be made to the landlord where customers are known to have difficulty managing their financial affairs. However, as the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott, has said, housing departments are not expected to be proactive in this matter. Indeed, they seem to be almost prohibited by the guidance. Waiting for non-payment for eight weeks will only mean that the private rented sector will dwindle more and more for housing benefit recipients&mdash;a point that I made back in March.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015.0/6">I was therefore alarmed to read in paragraph 7.2 of the Explanatory Memorandum:</p>
	<p pid="a.1015.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Unlike the current system customers will not be able to elect for payments to be made to their landlord&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015.0/8">Although I accept that customer election does not preclude payments to landlords direct from the local housing authority, how does the Minister square those two statements? What authority remains to allow such direct payments? Where can I find the information in the orders&mdash;I looked, I searched and combed through them and failed to find it. Perhaps the Minister can do better for me.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015.0/9">My other concern about these orders lies in the apparent untoward speed with which they have been made. Prompted by the comments by your Lordship's Merits of Statutory Instruments Committee earlier this week, I looked at the department's website in general and housing benefits/LHA/evaluation in particular. I was alarmed to find only remarks on how and when the evaluation was to be conducted. There was nothing about the completion of such evaluation. Eventually, with further searching, I discovered report No. 10 dated <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-05">5 October 2006</phrase>, which I assume is the most recent report and is headed in part &quot;final evaluation&quot;. I would not describe it as an evaluation at all. It is a press release giving a rather gloomy summary, especially as it concludes with a bullet point saying the following:</p>
	<p pid="a.1015.0/10" class="indent">&quot;On balance the net effect, after allowing for set up costs and some specific implementation difficulties, is positive, but not considered a 'substantial advantage to housing benefits administration and delivery'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015.0/11">Why, then, is the department rushing these regulations for a national rollout through, or has something happened since October last that the department has not revealed, in which case will the Minister kindly reveal it now?</p>
	<p pid="a.1015.0/12">Talking of revelations, the paper <I>Evaluating the Local Housing Allowance Pathfinders</I>, referred to an independent consortium of the universities of Birmingham, Loughborough and York, along with the National Centre for Social Research,</p>
	<p pid="a.1015.0/13" class="indent">&quot;being commissioned to carry out the evaluation&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1015.0/14">I failed to find any references to that evaluation. Has it reported and what, in essence, did it say?</p>
	<p pid="a.1015.0/15">We are being asked to approve these regulations on what I regard as the flimsiest of evidence. I agree with the noble Lord, Lord Oakeshott&mdash;although he did not quite put it this way&mdash;that it simply is not good enough.</p>
