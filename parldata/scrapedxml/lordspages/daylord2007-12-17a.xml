<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-17a.482.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="482"  time="015:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71217-0003.htm#0712172000116">
	<p pid="a.482.0/1">I make it clear at the outset that we are not afraid of being held accountable for each year of progress that we seek to make. Furthermore, the Government have absolutely no control over about 50 per cent of emissions from the UK economy, yet nobody seems to take any account of that in how we are to measure these things and to be accountable.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/2">In reply to the noble Earl, Lord Caithness, the point that my noble friend referred to on 11th December was that references to binding annual targets were not suitable. I am not arguing about what any of the scrutiny committees have said, but none of them came forward to require such targets. However, they looked at other aspects of this important issue, and we do not seek to run away from it. We think that the Bill has strong mechanisms&mdash;we will come to them in Clauses 28 and 29&mdash;to make sure that the government of the day are, importantly, annually held accountable to Parliament, on the basis of the expert and independent assessment of the Committee on Climate Change. The independent scrutiny that that will provide, on an annual basis, will strengthen the accountability for achieving emission reductions each year in every five-year budget. Therefore, we are not seeking to have the issue swept away for five years with no scrutiny and nothing done about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/3">If the Committee on Climate Change reports that, in its expert view, the UK is not on track to meet the budget, we would expect the Government to do everything possible to get back on track so as to satisfy the committee&mdash;and, moreover, to be under intense pressure in Parliament and in the court of public opinion. That is absolutely crucial. Annual scrutiny will help raise expectations that concerted action will be taken throughout each budget and, it is hoped, increase the confidence that the budgets will be met. We remain opposed to annual milestones or targets because we do not think that they would work in practice. I want to give four reasons and some detail as to why that is the case, because it is important for the next stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/4">First, there are annual natural fluctuations. Emissions go up or down by a small amount each year, depending on the weather. The noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, recognised that point in moving the amendment. During a five-year budget period, the fluctuations will, or are expected to, average out. We also have to ask ourselves whether proposals for annual milestones or targets will help the credibility of the system that we are setting up under the Bill. Would it help to have a debate each year on why the UK was, say, 0.2 per cent above or below its annual milestones and whether this was because the Government were doing well or because the weather was abnormally warm or cold that year? Such a debate would be irrelevant.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/5">Secondly, annual milestones and the political pressure to meet them could lead to huge pressures to rush through costly policies in a year, or particularly late in a year, with the aim of achieving short-term emissions reductions to ensure that targets were met. However, those policies might not be sensible from the economic, social or environmental points of view and could prove to be a distraction from the long-term decisions that need to be taken to put us on a trajectory to the 2020 targets and beyond. For example, would the Government of the day be expected to put up the cost of heating fuel in October to help to meet our annual targets? If not, what alternative measures could be taken late in a year to try to meet the milestones? One has to look at this from the practical point of view of the sequence of when information on which to judge performance becomes available. This would be the case even if there were no obligations on the Government to meet annual targets&mdash;in other words, if the targets were merely indicative. The same argument would apply regardless of whether the targets were set milestones or were legally binding.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/6">Thirdly, even if the Government of the day wanted to set annual milestones, they would simply not have enough information on which to base a decision. Even with the best will in the world, definitive information on emissions in a given year is not available until well after the year ends, as I think noble Lords will accept. The Government of the day would learn that they were off track for a given year only when it was already too late to do anything about it, unless it were the Government's intention to buy credits each year. I am sure that such an issue would be controversial, bearing in mind the reference to it during our first day in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/7">Finally, as I pointed out, proposals for annual milestones do not recognise that the Government have no control of the annual emissions from 50 per cent of the UK economy. The European Union Emissions Trading Scheme covers half the UK's CO2 emissions, including sectors that are more responsive to price signals. However, within the European trading system, companies are completely free to phase their emissions however they like during the five-year period. It is simply not possible for the Government to influence this and decisions will be based more on the carbon price across Europe. Again, how would that be taken into account in assessing our progress against the milestones?</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/8">These are not intellectually stunning arguments against the principle; each one is a practical concern if we are to legislate for scrutiny. Those who are scrutinising the Government, here or elsewhere, will want something that they can genuinely measure the Government's performance against. These are practical issues that I bring to the Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/9">Perhaps I may make a couple of points about other amendments in the group. Amendment No. 76 would require the Government to &quot;have regard to&quot; their annual statement of emissions, provided for in Clause 12, when setting the indicative annual targets. There would be a serious practical difficulty with that. Final emissions figures are available on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-15">15 January</phrase>&mdash;one year and 15 days after the end of the year in question. Final detailed figures are available on <phrase class="date" code="2007-03-15">15 March</phrase>. The information required would simply not be available in time. I realise that that is not an argument for doing nothing or for not having annual scrutiny, but I am making a practical point about how you change what has happened in one year and how you account for it.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/10">I have a couple of paragraphs on the amendment tabled by the noble Lord, Lord May, which I think are worth using, even though the noble Lord is not here. Obviously colleagues will take this away and have a look at it for Report. Amendment No. 31 would help by providing additional information on the causes of any fluctuations in annual emissions. We sympathise with the noble Lord in his efforts to address a problem that is not addressed in the Liberal Democrat proposals or in the group of Conservative ones to which we shall come shortly. However, we are not convinced that the proposals of the noble Lord, Lord May, would entirely address the problems. They would help but they would not entirely address them. There might simply be a new debate about the accuracy of the methodology used in adjusting emissions to take account of temperature fluctuations. The amendment would also not address the other, practical problems of the annual milestones that I have set out.</p>
	<p pid="a.482.0/11">As I said, we are not at all afraid of being held accountable for each year of progress, but that has to be done in a practical way. Those who are checking on the Government need a target or a figure or a means of scrutinising, so that it is not just a case of them saying each year, &quot;We wish you had done better&quot;, and the Government saying, &quot;Haven't we done really well?&quot;. They have to be measured against something. That cannot be done in the way proposed by this group of amendments.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-17a.487.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="487"  time="015:54:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71217-0003.htm#0712172000144">
	<p pid="a.487.3/1">My Lords, with the leave of the House, I shall now repeat a Statement made in another place by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.3/2">&quot;With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement about the European Council held in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-14">14 December</phrase>, which focused on two major concerns: the reforms Europe must make to meet and master the global challenges we face for competitiveness, employment, secure energy and climate change and issues of security, in particular Kosovo, Iran and Burma, that we must confront together. &quot;I start with the most immediate concern facing the summit: the best way to bring about a satisfactory resolution to the status of Kosovo. Kosovo is the last remaining unresolved issue from the violent break-up of the former Yugoslavia. In the light of the recent failure by the parties in the troika process to find a negotiated way forward, the European Council accepted its responsibility for joint European action and agreed the importance of moving urgently towards a settlement. It is to the credit of all parties in the dispute that even when faced with conflicting positions, the region remains at peace. And, as the European Council conclusions noted, it is essential that this commitment to peace is maintained. &quot;The principles of our approach are, first, that Europe takes seriously its special responsibility for the stability and security of the Balkans region. Indeed, it is thanks to the sustained efforts of NATO troops and the diplomacy of the United Nations and the European Union that a safe and secure environment has been maintained. But, secondly, we were agreed that the status quo was unsustainable and that we needed to move forward towards a settlement that ensures what we called a,</p>
	<p pid="a.487.3/3" class="indent">'stable, democratic, multi-ethnic Kosovo committed to the rule of law, and to the protection of minorities and of cultural and religious heritage'.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.3/4">And, thirdly, after a detailed discussion at the Council, we were also wholly united in agreeing that European engagement should move to a new level. We agreed in principle and stated our readiness to deploy a European Security and Defence Policy policing and rule-of-law mission to Kosovo. This will consist of a multinational mission of around 1,800 policemen and judicial officials. I can confirm that the UK will contribute around 80 of these, including its deputy head, Roy Reeve. European Foreign Ministers will confirm the detailed arrangements for this mission shortly. &quot;Fourthly, we also reaffirmed that a stable and prosperous Serbia fully integrated into Europe is important for the stability of the region. The Council encouraged Serbia to meet the necessary conditions to allow signature of its stabilisation and association agreement and expressed our confidence that Serbia has the capacity to make rapid progress subsequently towards candidate status. Indeed, the conclusions of the meeting of European Foreign Ministers last week reiterated the European Union's support for enlargement more generally, and we also look forward to recognising the progress made by both Croatia and Turkey at this week's accession conference in Brussels.&quot;The UN Security Council will discuss the issue of Kosovo with representatives from both Belgrade and Pristina on <phrase class="date" code="">19 December</phrase> with the aim of giving Russia an opportunity to accept a consensus on the way forward. If this proves impossible, we in Britain have always been clear that the comprehensive proposal put forward by the UN special envoy, Martti Ahtisaari, based around the concept of supervised independence for Kosovo, represents the best way forward. And while we are rightly focused on the immediate priority of bringing the status process through to completion in an orderly and managed way, the European Council agreed that it is also important that we address the longer-term challenge of ensuring Kosovo's future economic and political viability. I welcome the commitment made by the European Union to assist Kosovo's economic and political development. Planning is now under way for a donors' conference to follow shortly after a status settlement. &quot;The Council also discussed Iran and there was agreement on a united European approach. Here again, the power we wield working with all the EU is greater than if we acted on our own. As I have made clear repeatedly, Iran remains in breach of its international obligations. In September, Foreign Ministers from the E3+3 agreed that until there were positive outcomes from Javier Solana and the International Atomic Energy Agency's discussions with Iran, we would seek tougher sanctions at the United Nations. The latest E3+3 assessment is that sufficient progress has not been made. &quot;The European Council conclusions call on Iran to provide full, clear and credible answers to the IAEA and to resolve all questions concerning its nuclear activities. The European Council reiterated its support for a new UN resolution as soon as possible. In addition, we agreed to decide on new measures that the EU itself might take to help resolve this situation at the January meeting of Foreign Ministers. These should complement UN measures or substitute for them if the Security Council cannot reach agreement.&quot;Iran has a choice&mdash;confrontation with the international community leading to a tightening of sanctions or, if it changes its approach, a transformed relationship with the world from which all would benefit.&quot;As set out in the Council's conclusions, the EU also reaffirmed its deep concern about the unacceptable situation in Burma, and makes clear that if there is no change in the Burmese regime's approach to political negotiations and basic political freedoms, we stand ready to review, amend and&mdash;if necessary&mdash;further reinforce restrictive measures against the Burmese Government. The Council also reaffirmed the important role of China, India and the Association of South-East Asian Nations in actively supporting the UN's efforts to establish an inclusive political process leading to genuine national reconciliation.&quot;For our part, we believe that the forthcoming visit of the UN envoy&mdash;Professor Gambari&mdash;is critical. It is essential that the Burmese Government meet the demands set out in the UN Security Council statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-11">11 October</phrase> to: release all political prisoners; create the conditions for political dialogue, including relaxation of restrictions on Aung San Suu Kyi; allow full co-operation with Professor Gambari; address human rights concerns; and begin a genuine and inclusive process of dialogue and national reconciliation with the opposition.&quot;In particular, the regime should respond to the constructive statement of Aung San Suu Kyi of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-08">8 November</phrase> and open a 'meaningful and timebound dialogue' with the opposition and the country's ethnic groups.&quot;The Council also agreed that a key part of the EU's external agenda is how we can&mdash;by working together&mdash;maximise our influence in tackling global poverty. The Council agreed that the European Commission should report by April next year&mdash;half way to 2015&mdash;on how the European Union is meeting its commitments to the millennium development goals, and how we can accelerate our progress. &quot;In addition to these issues of international security and development, the Council conclusions and the special declaration on globalisation also set out the challenges that the European Union must now address on globalisation.&quot;First, we agreed to maintain our focus on economic reform, with a renewed focus on modernising the single market so it enhances the European Union's ability to compete in the global economy. We must have full implementation of the services directive by 2009 and we must continue to work together towards further liberalisation in the energy, post and telecoms markets&mdash;where market openings could generate between &euro;75 billion and &euro;95 billion of potential extra economic benefits and create up to 360,000 new jobs. Investment in research, innovation and education&mdash;and removing barriers to enterprise&mdash;are also essential.&quot;Secondly, we confirmed our commitment to free trade and openness. The priority is securing a successful outcome to the Doha trade round, which would deliver gains to the global economy approaching $200 billion by 2015, equivalent to 0.6 per cent of global income and bringing significant benefits to rich and poor countries alike. We will also promote better EU-US trade links.&quot;Thirdly, we agreed to do more to develop mechanisms for co-operation within the European Union and with countries across the world to tackle security challenges like terrorism, illegal immigration and organised crime. We renewed our commitment to the EU counterterrorism strategy and to co-operate on counter-radicalisation work.&quot;Fourthly, we will work together to deliver our commitments to tackle climate change, including the target of reducing emissions by 20 per cent by 2020, or 30 per cent as part of an international agreement. And building on the significant progress made last week in Bali&mdash;an agreement on which the Environment Secretary will report to this House tomorrow&mdash;we must help negotiate an ambitious post-2012 international climate change agreement. And Europe must also now step up funding, including through the World Bank, to help the developing world shift to lower carbon growth and adapt to climate change.&quot;It was agreed at the last Council meeting that the presidency would bring forward a proposal for a new reflection group. This was announced in October. At this later meeting, the Council invited Mr Felipe Gonz&aacute;lez M&aacute;rquez, assisted by two vice-chairs, Mrs Vaira Vike-Freiberga and Mr Jorma Ollila, chairman of Shell and Nokia, to,</p>
	<p pid="a.487.3/5" class="indent">'identify the key issues and developments which the Union is likely to face in 2020 or 2030 and to analyse how these might be addressed'.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.3/6">The remit specifically states that,</p>
	<p pid="a.487.3/7" class="indent">'it shall not discuss institutional matters. Nor should its analysis constitute a review of current policies or address the Union's next financial framework'.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.3/8">It will report back to the Council, which will decide how to follow up its recommendations. &quot;I can also tell the House that today we are publishing the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, which contains the institutional changes to accommodate a Europe of 27 members and will include the safeguards that we have negotiated to protect the British national interest: the legally binding protocol that ensures that nothing in the Charter of Fundamental Rights challenges or undermines the rights already set out in UK law and that nothing in the charter extends the ability of any court&mdash;European or national&mdash;to strike down UK law; legally binding protocols that prescribe in detail our sovereign right to opt in on individual justice and home affairs measures, where we consider it to be in the British interest to do so, or alternatively to remain outside if that is in our interest; a declaration that expressly states that nothing in the new treaty affects the existing powers of member states to formulate and conduct their foreign policy, and that the basis of foreign and security policies will remain intergovernmental, a matter for Governments to decide on the basis of unanimity; and an effective veto power on any proposals for important changes on social security, so that when we, Britain, determine that any proposal would impact on an important aspect of our social security system, including its scope, cost or financial structure, we can insist on taking any proposal to the European Council under unanimity.&quot;With the publication of the Bill that legislates for the amendments to the European Communities Act, Parliament will now have the opportunity to debate this amending treaty in detail and to decide whether to implement it. We will ensure sufficient time for debate on the Floor of the House, so that the Bill is examined in the fullest of detail and all points of view can be heard. That will give the House the full opportunity to consider this treaty, and the deal secured for the UK, before ratification.&quot;In addition, I can tell the House that we have built into the legislation further safeguards to ensure proper parliamentary oversight and accountability. To ensure that no Government can agree, without Parliament's approval, to any change in European rules that could in any way alter the constitutional balance of power between Britain and the European Union, there is a provision in the Bill that any proposal to activate the mechanisms in the treaty that provide for further moves to qualified majority voting, but which require unanimity&mdash;the so-called passerelles&mdash;would have to be subject to a prior vote by the House. In the event of a negative vote, the Government would refuse to allow the use of the passerelle. The Bill also includes a statutory obligation that any future EU amending treaty, including one that provided for any increase in the EU's competence, would have to be ratified through an Act of Parliament. So Parliament would have absolute security that no future change could be made against its wishes.&quot;I said in October that I would oppose any further institutional change in the relationship between the European Union and its member states, not just for this Parliament but for the next. I stand by that commitment. This is now also the settled consensus of the European Union. All 27 member states agreed at the Council&mdash;as expressly set out in the conclusions&mdash;that this amending treaty provides the Union with a stable and lasting institutional framework and that it completes the process of institutional reform for the foreseeable future. The conclusions of the Council state specifically that the amending treaty,</p>
	<p pid="a.487.3/9" class="indent">'provides the Union with a stable and lasting institutional framework. We expect no change in the foreseeable future'.</p>
	<p pid="a.487.3/10">&quot;Finally, let me conclude with the discussion on the most immediate economic issues: concerns about the economic consequences of the global financial turbulence that started in America in August. The Government's first priority in the coming weeks is to ensure the stability of the economy and to have the strength to take the difficult long-term decisions necessary. The Council agreed that the whole of the European Union must now turn its attention both to the immediate measures necessary and the long-term strengthening of international capacity to secure greater financial stability. The announcement made earlier this week by central banks in the major financial centres that they will provide liquidity to ease tension in the financial markets must now be built upon. As we agreed, supervisory authorities in different countries need to co-operate effectively across borders in exchanging information and in the management of crises and contagion.&quot;The European Council conclusions emphasised that macroeconomic fundamentals in the EU are strong and that sustained economic growth is expected. But we concluded that continued monitoring of financial markets and the economy is crucial, as uncertainties remain. The Council underlined the importance of work being taken forward both within the EU and with our international partners to improve transparency for investors, markets and regulators; to improve valuation standards; to improve the prudential framework, risk management and supervision in the financial sector; and to review the functioning of markets, including the role of credit-rating agencies. &quot;The European Council will discuss these issues at its spring 2008 meeting on the basis of a progress report by the Finance Ministers Council and by consideration of the financial stability forum's work to date. As agreed by Chancellor Merkel, President Sarkozy and myself in October, the progress report should examine whether regulatory or other action is necessary. I have invited Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy to London so that we can discuss the proposals in the paper we agreed and issued a few weeks ago. The measures are important to strengthening the international community's role in addressing financial turbulence across the world, showing the importance we attach to taking the tough long-term decisions to ensure, in testing times, the stability of the economy. &quot;Mr Speaker, the conclusions of the Council state specifically that in the institutional framework we expect no change 'for the foreseeable future'. The protections that have been agreed in the amending treaty defend the British national interest. In the Bill introduced today, we are legislating for new protections and new procedures to lock in our protection of these interests. Europe is now moving to a new agenda, one that focuses on the changes needed to meet the challenges of the global era. I commend the Statement to the House.&quot;.My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-17a.502.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100164" speakername="Lord Davies of Oldham" colon=":" colnum="502"  time="016:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71217-0005.htm#0712172000200">
	<p pid="a.502.5/1">My Lords, I beg leave to repeat a Statement made by my right honourable friend the Chancellor of the Exchequer in another place. The Statement is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.502.5/2">&quot;Mr Speaker, with your permission I should like to make a Statement on the progress report by Kieran Poynter, chairman and senior partner of PricewaterhouseCoopers, into the loss of child benefit records at HM Revenue and Customs. Before I turn to that, I can confirm that the police investigation continues. While the searches are drawing to a close, their inquiry is not yet complete. However, the police have reiterated that they have no information or intelligence that the data have fallen into wrong hands. They will keep that under review. &quot;The banks, too, say that they have found no evidence of any activities suggesting fraud arising from this incident. They continue to monitor closely the accounts concerned so that they can see immediately if there is any unusual or irregular activity. As I have told the House previously, the majority of accounts into which child benefit payments are made are with a small number of banks and these banks have checked them back to <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-18">18 October</phrase>, the date the missing data were posted. There are no reports of any activities suggesting increased fraud attempts deriving from the incident. &quot;I deliberately gave Mr Poynter wide-ranging terms of reference because of the seriousness of this loss, together with my concern about previous losses of data which I referred to in my statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-20">20 November</phrase>. Mr Poynter started his review on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-23">23 November</phrase>, just three weeks ago, and as he says his work is far from complete and his conclusions will develop as that work progresses. Inevitably, therefore, this report is short, but I said last month that I would return to the House when it became available. A copy has been placed in the Vote Office in the usual way. &quot;Kieran Poynter sets out the work he has put in hand. He says that he has given priority to the immediate steps Revenue and Customs must take to protect data security. Revenue and Customs has already put in place a number of measures. Mr Poynter says that these are measures that he would have recommended, and which his report sets out. As Mr Hartnett, the acting head of Revenue and Customs, said to the Treasury Select Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2007-12-05">5 December</phrase>, they include the imposition of a complete ban on the transfer of bulk data without adequate security protection such as encryption, as well as measures to prevent the downloading of data without adequate security safeguards. In addition, Revenue and Customs disabled all the personal and laptop computers it uses to prevent the downloading of data onto removable media. Those computers will only be reactivated at the approval of a senior manager for a specific business-critical purpose. &quot;Mr Poynter has also begun his investigation into exactly what happened in relation to the loss, but he makes the point that there are more inquiries to be made, more interviews to be carried out and greater examination of the evidence available. As he says, it would be wholly inappropriate for him to draw final conclusions until his work is completed. &quot;Mr Poynter also draws attention to the general responsibilities and accountability in HM Revenue and Customs. These issues are also referred to in the capability review into HM Revenue and Customs carried out by an independent panel overseen by the Cabinet Secretary. The House will be aware that this review was commissioned as part of a general review, announced in July 2006, of the strengths and weaknesses of all government departments. The Revenue and Customs review is published today, along with that for the Treasury and updates for four other departments. I am also publishing Revenue and Customs' autumn performance report. &quot;The capability review identifies a number of important strengths of Revenue and Customs, including a proven ability to bring in the money to fund public services while driving down its own costs and delivering greater efficiency. It refers to committed people with honesty and integrity, and with clear desires to transform and improve. The review also highlights a number of areas where improvements are needed, including the necessity to set up a simpler structure and clearer accountability, improving confidence and strengthening management information. The acting chairman agrees, and is announcing proposals to put in place a simpler organisational structure with clearer accountabilities which, as Mr Poynter says, will make it easier to implement recommendations on data security as his review progresses. &quot;I said in my Statement that the Prime Minister had asked the Cabinet Secretary to ensure that every government department checked its procedures for the storage and use of data, and to make recommendations on how to improve data handling procedures across government. His interim report is also published today, alongside a Written Ministerial Statement by the Minister for the Cabinet Office. &quot;The Prime Minister has already announced that the Information Commissioner will have the power to conduct spot checks on departments. There will now also be new sanctions under the Data Protection Act for the most serious breaches of its principles, which will take account of the need not only to provide high levels of data security but to ensure that sensible data-sharing practices can be conducted with legal certainty. We will consult early in the New Year on how that can best be done. The report also sets out a range of other measures. &quot;Revenue and Customs and, before it, the Inland Revenue and Customs and Excise have served successive Governments well. Their staff are dedicated and hard working. However, the loss of this data was extremely serious and should not have happened; again, I apologise to everyone who has been affected. &quot;As I told the House in November, the loss of this data together with losses in previous incidents mean that a wide-ranging review is necessary so that lessons could be learnt, procedures tightened and security improved.&quot;Mr Poynter tells me he expects to conclude his work in the first half of next year and I shall report back to the House when I have his final report. I commend the Statement to the House&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.502.5/3">My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-17a.551.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100030" speakername="Lord Bach" colon=":" colnum="551"  time="019:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71217-0012.htm#07121724000033">
	<p pid="a.551.0/1">My Lords, I thank all noble Lords who have taken part in this short debate. I thank the noble Lords on the Front Bench for their overall support for these amendments. I am sorry that they do not agree with us about Regulation 7. There is room for proper debate and disagreement about the right course to take over the problem that has been identified.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.0/2">I am tempted by the invitation of the noble Lord, Lord Razzall, to go down the highways and byways of agency policy. Apart from saying that the Government continue to support the underlying principles of the EU draft directive&mdash;we want a directive that offers appropriate protection to agency workers, without damaging economic flexibility or closing off a valued route into employment for many people&mdash;it would be better not to go down that particular path tonight. The noble Lord knows that we have the thrill and excitement of the Employment Bill coming to this House for Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-07">7 January</phrase>. I suspect that he will find a number of opportunities to debate the very interesting subjects that he has referred to. I do not say that they are illegitimate subjects for tonight, but it is not practical to go down that particular path.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.0/3">As for Regulation 7 , I cannot do more than repeat what I said in opening, and what my honourable friend Mr McFadden said in debate with Mr Prisk last Monday when these matters were being discussed in another place. We thought carefully about what was the right thing to do but came to the view that the cooling-off period was the appropriate remedy. We did not want to jeopardise, as Mr McFadden said, legitimate publications, such as <I>The Stage</I> or <I>Spotlight</I> and others, which have been around for a long time and play a legitimate and valuable role in the industry.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.0/4">We want to tackle the hard-sell tactic of inviting people to attend a casting session, and trying to take money from them on the day, often on the promise of finding work or making bogus pledges to the effect that the young person has a great chance of success. We believe&mdash;and only time will tell&mdash;that the cooling-off period will have a significant impact by allowing people to think before taking a particular route. That is not to say that the payment of a fee for inclusion in a legitimate publication is always wrong. We accept that there may be a disagreement with our judgment on the matter, but that is how we came to our conclusions.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.0/5">All the representations that we received were considered, but in the matter of distinguishing between agencies and publications there was a question over whether this could be easily done in such a way as to prevent disreputable agencies producing publications of little value and abusing the distinction. We wanted to use the cooling-off period to give people time to think without putting in jeopardy&mdash;and this is really the nub of our argument&mdash;the legitimate promotion activity that is carried out by some very long-established publications. The Minister said that he was looking at one such publication, which has existed for 80 years and performs a legitimate role in the industry. We would not want to take action that goes too far.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.0/6">The noble Lord, Lord James, who has a particular interest in these matters, was good enough to let my department know what he intended to raise, and to talk to me today about these matters. As far as out-placement agencies are concerned, I repeat that the practice he described so well is already an offence, under the Employment Agencies Act 1973. We are also proposing measures in the Employment Bill, which will increase the penalties for this offence by making it eligible for trial in the Crown Court as well as a magistrates' court. Where offences were tried in the upper court, there would be no limit to the fine that could be imposed. I invite the noble Lord, who obviously has great experience in this field, to report to the Employment Agency Standards Inspectorate any agency he is aware of that is charging such fees. We would be most grateful. I am sure that will be in his mind anyway.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.0/7">As far as models are concerned, the noble Lord will know that the 2003 regulations contain a framework of minimum standards that clients&mdash;both workers, who in this case are models, and hirers&mdash;are entitled to expect. The regulations cover measures to protect workers, the contents of terms and conditions, and steps that agencies must take before supplying workers to a hirer. Additionally and importantly, the conduct regulations require the agency to take all reasonable practical steps for the protection of the worker. The noble Lord, Lord James, said that, for workers under the age of 18, agencies are required to obtain consent from a parent or guardian before supplying them for a position where they are required to live away from home. There may be some ignorance about that, but that parents or guardians of workers under that age are required to give that permission represents a significant control. Forcing people to give sexual favours against their will, or any assault&mdash;actual or aiding and abetting an assault&mdash;is a serious criminal offence and a matter for the police. That is true also of taking illegal drugs. While we do not for a moment contradict what the noble Lord said&mdash;it would be foolish to do so&mdash;we think that remedies already exist.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.0/8">The noble Lord mentioned a third area where he believes that more should be done. As far as that area, too, is concerned, if the wrongdoing involves forcing people to give sexual favours against their will, it is a matter for the criminal law and the police. Any cases of that which come to light should be dealt with harshly.</p>
	<p pid="a.551.0/9">I hope that I have dealt with the points that were made in this interesting debate. I am sorry that I do not have the support of the House for all the regulations; I must comfort myself with the thought that we have it for the majority of them.</p>
