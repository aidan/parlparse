<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-22c.900.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="900"  time="012:37:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060622/text/60622-07.htm#60622-07_spmin0">
	<p pid="c.900.1/1">My Lords, with the leave of the House I shall repeat a statement on the Rural Payments Agency made in another place earlier today by my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. The Statement is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="c.900.1/2">&quot;With permission, Mr Speaker, I would like to make a Statement on the Rural Payments Agency. In my Written Statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May</phrase>, I promised to keep the House informed on progress made by the Rural Payments Agency on the single payments scheme. At Oral Questions today, no Questions on the SPS were on the Order Paper. I therefore thought it right to give honourable Members the chance to raise the issue. In summary, there has been some progress, but the situation is far from satisfactory in a number of respects. As of <phrase class="date" code="">Tuesday 20 June</phrase>, some &pound;1.38 billion, representing over 90 per cent of the total fund, has now been paid to over 100,000 applicants; 82,571 claims have now been settled in full; and 18,785 applicants have received a partial payment and are awaiting their 'top-up' payment.</p>
	<p pid="c.900.1/3">&quot;On <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May</phrase> I said that the top priority for the Rural Payments Agency would be those claims of more than &euro;1,000 where no payment had been made. The number of such claimants in this category is now approximately 2,300. I recognise the hardship involved for them and deeply regret the distress caused. The Rural Payments Agency is taking further steps to pay those complex claims, including discussing issues direct with claimants and, where feasible, bringing parties together in cases of continuing disagreement. The Rural Payments Agency has written twice to all individuals concerned.</p>
	<p pid="c.900.1/4">&quot;I also recognise the importance of the unresolved hill farm allowance payments. Of the approximately 10,500 eligible HFA claims, 5,000 have been paid in full and a further 900 authorised for partial payments. Full and partial payments are continuing to be made.</p>
	<p pid="c.900.1/5">&quot;The European Union defined payment window for making 2005 single payment scheme payments runs from <phrase class="date" code="">1 December</phrase> until <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>. Work is continuing to pay as many claims as possible by <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>. However, farming leaders have made representations to me on behalf of any farmers who do not receive the full sum due to them within the payment window&mdash;that is, by Friday next week. I have therefore authorised the Rural Payments Agency to make interest payments of the London InterBank offered rates plus 1 per cent calculated from <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase>, in respect of any payments where responsibility for the delay rests with the Rural Payments Agency. This will be subject to a minimum interest payment level of &pound;50. Further details will be given on the timing of these payments once the Rural Payments Agency has assessed how they can be integrated most effectively into the existing payment schedule.</p>
	<p pid="c.900.1/6">&quot;Work on delivery of the 2006 single payments scheme is under way. As I said on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May</phrase>, the 2006 scheme year will be very challenging. The Rural Payment Agency's interim chief executive, Tony Cooper, has made an initial assessment of the task ahead. He has confirmed that in respect of customer service and management information there is no quick fix. Possible options for the 2007 scheme&mdash;for example, the use of a minimum payment level&mdash;are not available for 2006.</p>
	<p pid="c.900.1/7">&quot;Against this background, farming leaders have understandably called for partial payments to be made under the 2006 single payments scheme. I have both discussed the need for the necessary EU legislation to make partial payments with Commissioner Fisher-Boel and authorised the Rural Payments Agency to start work on necessary systems. However, until the RPA's chief executive has had an opportunity to make a realistic assessment of the prospects for full payments, I do not want to commit to a particular timetable or specify whether or when partial payments might be made. Initial validation of 2006 claims is under way and detailed validation should start next month. By the time the House returns after the Summer Recess, therefore, we should have a better understanding of the prospects for the 2006 scheme and I will make a further Statement then.</p>
	<p pid="c.900.1/8">&quot;Given the position on the 2006 scheme, I have decided to simplify to the maximum possible extent the arrangements for the incorporation into the single payments scheme of additional support arising from last November's landmark EU sugar reform. In practice, that means that &pound;52 million will be added entirely to entitlements held by sugar beet producers who meet defined criteria, rather than some of the funds being used to increase the flat rate value of all entitlements. Further details, including on arrangements for 2007, will be announced in due course.</p>
	<p pid="c.900.1/9">&quot;I can also report that an EU regulation has been adopted which provides for all 2006 single payments scheme claims to be accepted without penalty until <phrase class="date" code="">15 June</phrase>. This extra time, above and beyond the extension to <phrase class="date" code="">31 May</phrase> I referred to in my Statement on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-09">9 May</phrase>, will mean that around 4,000 farmers will not now be penalised. I am grateful to the European Commission for its understanding on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="c.900.1/10">&quot;The fundamental review of the Rural Payments Agency that my right honourable friend the Member for Derby South set in train earlier this year will be important for the future of the Rural Payments Agency when it reports at the end of this year. In the mean time, I know that this year's problems have caused real distress and I repeat the apology to farmers I have made before. I can assure the House that the Rural Payments Agency chief executive, with the support of the department, will be looking to take interim steps to aid the recovery process and improve the experience of farmers dealing with the agency to the maximum possible extent. I will keep the House informed as matters progress&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.900.1/11">My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-22c.902.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100176" speakername="Lord Dixon-Smith" colon=":" colnum="902"  time="012:44:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060622/text/60622-08.htm#60622-08_spnew0">
	<p pid="c.902.0/1">My Lords, I declare an interest as an eligible farmer who, the noble Lord will be interested and pleased to hear, is fortunate to have received his full 2005 payment, for which I am immensely grateful.</p>
	<p pid="c.902.0/2">I thank the Minister for repeating this Statement today, the more so since I am well aware that he has a particularly busy and crowded day, and putting this in has not been easy for him. He also has my sympathy for the bed of nails on which he finds himself. That said, as the Minister acknowledged, the Statement is about a situation that should not exist. The best that can be said of it is that it has moved from intolerable to bad. That is the reality. It is not comfortable for anybody in the department, the Minister's colleagues or for all those involved in the agricultural industry, particularly those adversely affected by not having received the payments they expected months ago.</p>
	<p pid="c.902.0/3">I was at an agricultural show yesterday, where I spoke to bankers about these problems. Although they were immensely sympathetic and doing all they could to help affected farmers, they made clear that it was as difficult for them as for farmers who have not received their payments. A lot of work has been done by the banks and the agricultural industry to set up temporary loans arrangements to carry matters forward and keep farmers afloat. While on the subject of bankers, I say to the Minister with some gratitude that the prospect of interest payments for outstanding sums after <phrase class="date" code="">1 July</phrase> is very welcome. I hope he will forgive me the rather acid comment that my understanding is that 1 per cent over LIBOR is generally less than a farmer could borrow at commercial rates from a bank. None the less, it is a very welcome move in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="c.902.0/4">I also welcome the Minister's remarks on sugar payments funding. Sugar beet growers will be particularly grateful for that statement.</p>
	<p pid="c.902.0/5">What is the European Commission's attitude to this particular hiatus? The Statement says that we are moving towards the <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> payments deadline. We still apparently have some &pound;13.8 million outstanding. There is another week to go, so presumably that figure will go down. At <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> it is possible, as I understand it, for the Commission to impose penalties for failure to pay. It would be interesting to know whether the Government can indicate yet what the likely cost to the Treasury will be of that.</p>
	<p pid="c.902.0/6">I welcome the extension, to <phrase class="date" code="">15 June</phrase>, of the period in which 2006 applications for single farm payments can be made without penalty. That date has now passed. According to replies given in another place, it looked as though application numbers were dropping. Has the Minister any idea how many applications might have missed that deadline? I imagine that, based on past applications, he will be able to give that figure. More importantly, is he aware of any reason why that situation should have arisen? I always regarded filling in these application forms as about the best-value-for-money task I had on my farm in any year. Any farmer who does not take that view has his priorities seriously adrift, and I cannot believe there are any farmers like that in the country.</p>
	<p pid="c.902.0/7">I know the Minister is doing all he can to sort this system out, and I hope that he succeeds, as does the whole industry. Yet it would have been better if we did not have to be here at all.</p>

	<p pid="c.904.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful for the response from the noble Lords, Lord Dixon-Smith and Lord Livsey. I made absolutely clear that 2006 will be a difficult year, and the tone of the Statement indicates this, leaving aside what has happened in the past. I am interested in what has happened in the past from a technical viewpoint, but my main priority is the present and the future. That has been what David Miliband and I have concentrated on in the past few weeks. We will not be talking up 2006 because, as the Statement says, we are limited in what we can actually do. 2006 has already started and 2007 applications are only nine months away. We really must be careful about making fundamental changes to a system that has not delivered.</p>
	<p pid="c.904.0/2">To answer the specific questions, I am grateful for the welcome of the Statement on interest payments. There will never be enough done, but we do not know how much will be paid until <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>, because we cannot measure them until then. Some days after that date we will know how much has been paid out. The Statement was made today for the reasons I explained. There were Defra Questions in the other place, but there was none on the single payment scheme. We wanted to update the House as soon as possible. I also welcome the response on the sugar payments. It was bad enough seeing what had happened, but major changes on sugar for 2006 had already been agreed. Paying them separately is an advantage to the sugar beet producers for this one year, because the money stays within the family.</p>
	<p pid="c.904.0/3">I will be more attuned to respond on the EU attitude to penalties after <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>. There will be an opportunity to answer the question then because the House will still be sitting. We are moving heaven and earth to pay as much out as possible before then. I appreciate that the extension date of <phrase class="date" code="">15 June</phrase> for applications for 2006 has already passed. The deadline was originally the middle of May, extended to <phrase class="date" code="">31 May</phrase>. By <phrase class="date" code="">15 June</phrase> we had received more than 4,000 applications which would have been subject to a penalty because they had missed the deadline of <phrase class="date" code="">31 May</phrase>. We are grateful to the Commission for this, as some 4,000 farmers will now not be subject to the penalty. I was then asked whether any applications had come in since. Yes, the latest figure I had was some 60 plus, and they are still trickling in.</p>
	<p pid="c.904.0/4">I will use&mdash;with his permission, although it is in <i>Hansard</i>&mdash;the words of Farmer Dixon-Smith, that the best value-for-money job he ever did as a farmer was filling in the forms. Filling in forms means you get money. That is what I have tried to put across. It helps to sign the forms when you have filled them in. The number of forms we receive without a signature is frankly unbelievable, but it does happen. As I say, it is now a trickle so we do not expect many people to be subject to a penalty next year. I cannot be tied to exact figures, but we have received some 110,000 plus out of the 118,000 that were requested. That 110,000 includes the 4,000 that came in after <phrase class="date" code="">31 May</phrase> but before <phrase class="date" code="">15 June</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="c.904.0/5">Of the 4,000 hill-farm payments that have not been made, priority is being given to making full or partial payments for the hill-farm allowance. The RPA set up a dedicated unit. That is the question I was asked, though I do not have the answer. The implication is that they cannot have the hill-farm allowance until the single payment is paid. That is one of the problems. Some of the 4,000 may have had a partial single payment but not the hill-farm allowance.</p>
	<p pid="c.904.0/6">Before I sit down later, having answered other questions, I will try to have a more specific answer. I do not know anything about any ombudsman's inquiry but, given the scale of the letters that I keep signing to Members of the other place I would not be at all surprised if there had been applications to the ombudsman on the grounds of maladministration. I know of no payments made by hand. I regret that I did not see the story in the <i>Farmers Guardian</i>; I missed that; it was not drawn to my attention.</p>
	<p pid="c.904.0/7">We are trying to use the system to make the payments. It is true that we have said that, if push comes to shove at the end of next week, we will do what we can, possibly including bypassing the system. We are very reluctant to do that because that in itself will create problems closing down the 2005 computer framework. Nevertheless, there are other ways to do that if we cannot get the payments out. I understand that there are two more payment windows before next Friday, so we will have a better view of the position by the middle of next week, but we have put in hand processes to try to maximise the payments to farmers.</p>
	<p pid="c.904.0/8">I cannot be certain about the date of the 2006 payment. The first time that anyone will get a date from me about 2006 payments is when I know that the first one has been made. Given what happened earlier this year, we will be very reluctant to make promises, because we will not be believed. Therefore, we will under-promise and over-deliver. Either way, I have already had a complaint from some stakeholders that we did not tell them that 841 partial payments were to be made last week&mdash;I think that they were to hill farmers. Until the buttons were pressed, we were not certain that they had gone through the system, so we were not going to say, &quot;By the way, we expect to make those payments&quot;, because we could not be certain. As I said, there are two more payment windows before <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> and I cannot be certain how many will be covered. I know estimates of what may be covered but they are not promises that I can share with the House.</p>
	<p pid="c.904.0/9">Finally, it is worth mentioning again that our top priority is those owed more than &euro;1,000. Of course, there is a considerable number of people who have not had a penny whose claim will deliver less than &euro;1,000&mdash;about 12,000 of them. They cannot be a priority. I know that it is important for some of them; &pound;600 or &euro;1000 is a lot of money if your total income is only five grand. I understand that, but they are not the top priority; the top priority is those owed more than that&mdash;the last 2,000-plus who have not had a bean and whose claim is more than that. Some sums owed are very substantial&mdash;into six figures, I understand. That is our top priority.</p>

	<p pid="c.907.0/1">My Lords, first, it is not &pound;1,000; it is &euro;1,000, so we are talking about approximately &pound;600. We have not stopped those payments, but the priority is those claiming more than &euro;1,000. When the RPA staff are dealing with those payments and come up against queries because the system does not work, they do not then stop and twiddle their thumbs waiting for the next tranche of work to come through the computer, they then work on claims below &euro;1,000. The fact is that they are not the priority; the priority is claims over that figure. That does not mean to say that the others are not being paid. We intend to get all the payments out as quickly as possible before or on <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> and, if we miss any, as quickly as possible after <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>. The initial priority for the workflow of the RPA staff must be those bigger claims.</p>

	<p pid="c.908.0/1">My Lords, I shall ask the Minister some elementary questions. I first declare an interest in that I have been involved in agriculture. We all greatly appreciate the position in which the Minister finds himself. There are one or two things that I do not understand at all. The first is that Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have managed to pay their people; why have we not? Is it just that the computer has gone phut; is the system too complicated; or are the civil servants finding difficulty with it? Or is it that people have not sent in their applications? I think that the Minister said that there are not many of those. I just do not understand how we can have got into that position. If he could give us a brief reason, I would be grateful.</p>
	<p pid="c.908.0/2">When the Minister says that he is doing his best to get all the payments out by <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>, what is the inhibiting factor? Is it that the machine does not say what is the amount to be paid or that the figures are not available? If they are available, what is likely to be unpaid by <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase>?</p>
	<p pid="c.908.0/3">British agriculture is facing its biggest crisis since the 1930s. It is a terrible thing that this system, which is so deeply complicated, should be imposed on British agriculture. Is there any way that the Minister or the European Union can make the system easier, because it seems a perfectly absurd thing to land on the industry?</p>

	<p pid="c.909.3/1">No, my Lords, I could only make wild guesses at the moment because the legal payment window was from last December to the end of June. We are still in the legal payment window. We have let down those who say they should have been paid earlier in the year, because we gave them a specific promise and did not pay them. But until the legal payment window ends on <phrase class="date" code="">30 June</phrase> we will have no idea of the possible interest payments, how many big claims are left and the other complaints that, clearly, we will get. Making partial, top-up payments can be complicated, which is why we prefer to make full payments if possible.</p>

	<p pid="c.931.0/1">My Lords, I congratulate the noble Baronesses, Lady Kingsmill and Lady Thomas of Winchester, on their most excellent maiden speeches. We all hope to hear them often. It was clever of them to join this important debate, initiated so well by the noble Baroness, Lady Gale, which comes at an opportune time, for two reasons. First, it comes so soon after the Work and Families Bill, which has played a part in nearly everyone's speeches today, and, among other things, is about,</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/2" class="indent">&quot;statutory rights to leave and pay in connection with the birth or adoption of children&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/3">and dealing with carers, and the important subject of flexible working. The Bill adds substantially to the rights of fathers to additional paternity leave and pay. This comes at a time when modern fathers take an increasing share in ordinary household duties, including the routine of bringing up their children.</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/4">The second reason why this debate is opportune is that in two major speeches in the past month, my right honourable friend the Leader of the Opposition has set out his own personal views on,</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/5" class="indent">&quot;improving society's sense of well being&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/6">and on family life. It is possible that these personal views will play a part in formulating the policies to be adopted by the Conservative Party before the next election. The committees that are looking into all these things have not yet completed their work.</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/7">This debate is about work/life balance, and I would like to talk first about &quot;work&quot;, and then about &quot;life balance&quot;&mdash;although I agree with the noble Lords, Lord Giddens, Lord Sawyer and Lord Newby, that work is a very important part of your life balance. Those of us who have been fortunate enough to enjoy our work know that.</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/8">On <phrase class="date" code="2004-07-02">2 July 2004</phrase>, we debated the working time directive with reference to the report of the committee chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Williamson of Horton. The report concluded that UK workers should retain the right to opt out of the 48-hour week provision. He stated that it was particularly suitable for British circumstances and that it preserved the rights of those who wanted to or needed to work. We endorse that conclusion because it is an unfortunate fact of life that if you want more material things you have to work for them.</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/9">British people are anxious to own rather than rent their homes, which is why we have so many more home owners than renters and a vastly higher number of people paying mortgages than is the norm on the Continent. It is quite different. With all due modesty, I wish to quote what I said during the debate on the working time directive:</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/10" class="indent">&quot;In a free society there is no reason why those with personal ambition to progress in their field of work or to acquire more for themselves and their families, or for whatever reason, should be prevented from doing so&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 2/8/04; col. 498.]</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/11">As the Leader of the Opposition pointed out in his speech to the Google Zeitgeist Conference only the other day:</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/12" class="indent">&quot;It's time we focussed not just on GDP, but on GWB&mdash;general well being&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/13">I do not say GDP too often now, I say GWB. That was the phrase that caught the media's attention but a few sentences later he said:</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/14" class="indent">&quot;Politicians should not dictate how people should live their lives . . . I believe in trusting people&mdash;that if you let people make their own decisions, they and society will grow stronger&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/15">Returning to that theme in his speech on <phrase class="date" code="">20 June</phrase>, the Leader of the Opposition stated:</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/16" class="indent">&quot;Enlarging the political culture to include discussion of the family is one thing. The government stepping in with its battalions is quite another&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/17">He also stated:</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/18" class="indent">&quot;So on the most important element&mdash;family life&mdash;of the most important social challenge of our day&mdash;general well-being&mdash;politicians need to be involved, without being coercive&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/19">Since, to quote the poet, we,</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/20" class="indent">&quot;expect to pass through this world but once&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/21">we should live it as we choose as far as lies within our personal power and within the boundaries of legality and, importantly, socially accepted norms. Those socially accepted norms are undoubtedly changing. Couples living together, families divided by divorce, single parents and unmarried mothers are now far from rare and are, quite rightly, no longer stigmatised. Civil partnerships represent a new element that has just been introduced into the social equation. They, too, require the same tolerance and lack of discrimination as must be accorded to all the other departures from what was the accepted norm in our parents' generation. So much has changed.</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/22">David Cameron seeks this tolerance from the public. As has been repeatedly emphasised, in the end children's interests must be paramount. No one would disagree that the ideal situation for children is to grow up with two loving parents in a conflict-free home, but that ideal is not always achievable. Children inevitably have to settle for whichever of those elements is available to them. Sometimes, what exists of those elements will still provide a happy and stable home life for the children. We should all be pleased when that is so, for the sake of the children.</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/23">The Conservatives are currently not making any spending commitments, because we are not in a position to do so and are still some few years away from taking power from the present Government. However, we have said that we will revise the tax regime which, at present, in the form of tax credits, is complex, unfair and a cause of distress to many people. Because of its bureaucratic form, it swallows up money which would be better spent on the families who really need it. We must help parents who wish or need to work, by making more allowances for childcare. As David Cameron pointed out, it is offensive that the head of a public company can get an allowance for his chauffeur but a working woman cannot get one for someone who looks after her child. Transferable tax benefits, which we are also examining, will undoubtedly help some couples, but not those who are paying little or no tax anyway, so we will look at a cocktail of solutions.</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/24">I have felt somewhat under attack during this debate. The noble Lord, Lord Haskel, had the courtesy to tell me in advance what he intended to ask me. The idea that we think that a single merciless market is the way shows that the noble Lord has misinterpreted. I believe it was Lord Shaftesbury who started the idea of Factory Acts, and many Acts since then. As we read only a few days ago, Loughborough is closing and all the work is being moved to China. There was a whole big thing about it. Markets and circumstances change, something we must all live with. The noble Baroness, Lady Prosser, seemed to think it quite wrong for David Cameron to speak about certain things that he approved of which he had previously voted against. If the noble Baroness thinks that politicians do not change their mind on serious matters from time to time, she should look at the big change that the Prime Minister made, from being a member of CND to supporting nuclear. I make those points only to show that politicians change their minds.</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/25">I cannot believe that the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, is criticising noble Lords for taking the day off to go to Ascot today, when we are talking about work/life balance. No doubt many people went to Ascot from all sides of the House. Good luck to them; I hope they won plenty of money.</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/26">In summary, to have a population that is well paid and happy in its work&mdash;a matter brought up by the noble Lords, Lord Giddens and Lord Sawyer&mdash;able to enjoy its leisure time and have a happy life is an ideal that we should all strive for. I believe that my noble friend Lord Selsdon has somehow achieved it; we all enjoyed his speech. In the real world, achieving four out of four of those objectives is regrettably not realistic for a large part of the population. The responsibility of the state is to help not to hinder, to support not to direct, the ideal work/life balance that this debate calls for.</p>
	<p pid="c.931.0/27">In my own defence, I applaud the women who were able to go to work early. Although I stayed at home, as soon as my children were old enough I went to work. I have had a long working life. I have not retired; I am on the Front Bench here. I look after my 98 year-old mother, who lives with me. I have enjoyed this debate very much.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-22c.955.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100307" speakername="Baroness Howe of Idlicote" colon=":" colnum="955"  time="016:07:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060622/text/60622-19.htm#60622-19_spnew1">
	<p pid="c.955.0/1">My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, for this opportunity to share views on these issues. It is certainly right to acknowledge the considerable number of children who have been lifted out of the current definition of &quot;poverty&quot;, so I congratulate the Government on that.</p>
	<p pid="c.955.0/2">Like, I suspect, many of your Lordships, I have spent a fair proportion of my life involved in voluntary work&mdash;in my case, mainly in London's East End, both as a chairman of the juvenile court and in local schools working with deprived families. I also served as a school governor or manager of a number of local schools. So, as your Lordships will appreciate, I need convincing neither of the importance of this whole subject nor of the long-term damage that poverty, in its broadest sense, can inflict on children's long-term life chances.</p>
	<p pid="c.955.0/3">Alas, the cycle of deprivation is as alive today as when Sir Keith Joseph, in November 1974, first uttered those words to a rather sceptical, I gather, Birmingham audience. Of course, the cycle can be broken in individual cases but, sadly, there will always be new reasons why children from previously well functioning families enter poverty, an obvious example being the relatively new phenomenon of drug-addicted parents.</p>
	<p pid="c.955.0/4">Above all, that is why we need to be realistic about the future. Child poverty is inevitably a long-term project. So, given the politician's inevitably short-term, five-year agenda, it is crucial to achieve political consensus on how these problems are to be tackled. I would like to think that we are getting closer to that point.</p>
	<p pid="c.955.0/5">The Social Exclusion Unit's report <i>Breaking the Cycle</i> cites five key areas for action. The area on which I want to concentrate, although they are all important, is the first of these: inequalities in education.</p>
	<p pid="c.955.0/6">Despite education being the No. 1 priority, we know from the Department for Education and Skills that half of all five year-olds have failed to achieve what it calls a &quot;good level of development&quot;. Between one-third and one-quarter of 11 year-olds have difficulties with writing. The worst assessment of all by the National Audit Office last autumn was that most school leavers lack basic literacy and numeracy skills.</p>
	<p pid="c.955.0/7">Clearly the comprehensive education system is still failing to meet the education needs of a substantial percentage of our children. What we need to know&mdash;and I hope the Minister will be able to give the figures&mdash;is the percentage of those children assessed to be failing at each stage in the education process who fall within our broad definition of child poverty. If the education results of so-called looked-after children&mdash;in whom my noble friend Lord Listowel takes such an interest and for whom he has taken such action&mdash;the percentage will sadly be very high.</p>
	<p pid="c.955.0/8">The clue, of course, must be the proportion of five year-olds&mdash;half&mdash;who are already behind when they start compulsory full-time education. That is why it must remain the highest priority to direct whatever extra resources are possible towards very young children and their families. I agree very much with the noble Lord, Lord Parekh, that Sure Start was a brave initiative. It has been criticised for targeting deprived areas rather than families and thus not having reached a sufficiently low level of child poverty. Yet it was always going to be at least 20 years before its long-term benefits could be sensibly assessed. Above all, it involved parents, volunteers and professionals in deciding the priorities in each specific local area chosen.</p>
	<p pid="c.955.0/9">We can only hope that the children's trusts into which they have now moved will be as effective in supporting families early enough and will also fully involve parents and children in decisions about how resources are spent. I hope, too, that full use will be made of volunteers in giving practical help and encouragement. HomeStart is an excellent role model for this approach of mentoring and befriending children by individual volunteers. We should not forget either that the far healthier elderly of today, including grandparents, who have been mentioned, could play a vital role in what we all hope these plans will achieve.</p>
	<p pid="c.955.0/10">I want to stress two other aspects of education policy. The first is truancy. Once again, we need to know what percentage of those truanting&mdash;a clear area affecting life chances&mdash;fall into our definition of child poverty. Certainly, in my experience as a juvenile court chairman, they formed a high proportion of truants, many of whom had learning difficulties. The Education and Inspections Bill introduces further attempts to stem truancy, which continues to rise. There has been a degree of scepticism&mdash;we discussed the issue yesterday&mdash;about how effective the already somewhat punitive approach in the Bill is likely to be for truants and their families. But would the Minister agree that the one vital need is to tackle truancy the moment it is identified? If a truancy pattern becomes established it will be far more difficult to re-establish regular attendance. Will the Minister give the House some idea of the time gap between the discovery of the first signs of truancy and any subsequent action being taken? In my juvenile court days, sadly nothing like enough attention was paid to truancy. The inevitable result was that the vast majority of children who appeared in court for offences already had a well established truancy pattern&mdash;an ideal lifestyle for committing offences.</p>
	<p pid="c.955.0/11">I wish to applaud and further encourage the contacts that some universities, often with the help of current students, establish with schools which have bright pupils with no family history of university. I think this began under the noble Lord, Lord Giddens, in the LSE. The more these kinds of contacts are made, the more likely we are to see the individual life chances of children who would not have thought of taking education further being fulfilled. It must be a major human rights objective of the state to see that each child's potential is fulfilled. The bottom-line value to the community of minimising the number of difficult and, indeed, increasingly complex youngsters who subsequently spend their lives in and out of prison also needs to be recognised.</p>
	<p pid="c.955.0/12">The <i>British Journal of Psychiatry</i> says that bringing up a badly behaved child costs parents and society nearly &pound;6,000 a year more than a well behaved one&mdash;even more than the cost for a child with severe behavioural problems. I do not understand that, but it is apparently true.</p>
	<p pid="c.955.0/13">The Howard League's research, published on <phrase class="date" code="">31 May</phrase> of this year, on young men in prison points out that more than 1,000 young men are sent to prison at a cost of &pound;35,000 a year each. Nearly 70 per cent of those released from prison will be reconvicted within two years, and we know that that cycle continues.</p>
	<p pid="c.955.0/14">Far more needs to be done, as is planned, by dealing with offenders through community sentences. Much more could and should be done in prison itself to meet the education and training needs of those we have previously failed to divert to acceptable behaviour. But a far more important and constructive approach surely is to spend that necessary money and resources at the earliest possible age to compensate for the poverty of these children's lives&mdash;for their benefit, yes, but equally, indeed more so, for the benefit of our whole community.</p>

	<p pid="c.978.3/1" pwmotiontext="asked">rose to ask Her Majesty's Government what is their assessment of the prospects for peace and parliamentary democracy in Nepal.</p>
	<p pid="c.978.3/2">My Lords, I am grateful for this opportunity to speak about Nepal at a critical time in its history. It is encouraging to see in his place the Minister who has to look in many other directions; I take this as a sign that Her Majesty's Government are now giving Nepal more prominence that it usually gets on Mercator's projection. This is not a faraway mountain kingdom overlooking India, famous for its warriors and attracting our trekkers and tourists. It is a proud, diverse nation of about 28 million people that deserves much more from us in the way of assistance, diplomacy, and media and parliamentary time.</p>
	<p pid="c.978.3/3">The noble Baroness, Lady Northover, and I were there for five days in March with an all-party group led by Sir John Stanley, just before the popular uprising which, to everyone's relief, ended King Gyanendra's direct rule. I look forward to her analysis, and to the expert advice of my other noble friends.</p>
	<p pid="c.978.3/4">We all recognise that the people suffered a form of tyranny under King Gyanendra from which they were right to break free. Yet we cannot dismiss the king's seizure of power purely as an act of folly or personal aggrandisement. Nepal had seen a succession of prime ministers and governments incapable of containing the Maoists, who continue to enjoy a stranglehold over most of the country. It is easy to criticise a king who arrived in a crisis and was not born to rule. He failed to gain the respect earned by his brother not just because of his inexperience and incapacity but because of the enormous odds against his success. As our own embassy well knows, his direct rule has been a useful distraction from the more fundamental corruption inside government and the political parties, which are all still dominated by their leaders and central committees, and which urgently need internal reform. The focus must now be on the ability of the Seven Party Alliance under Mr Koirala to reclaim democracy and anticipate the intentions of the Maoists. The parties must maintain their unity in the absence of parliament and during the critical period leading up to the elections for a new constituent assembly.</p>
	<p pid="c.978.3/5">The SPA has taken a number of commendably bold steps forward, starting with the revised memorandum of understanding with the Maoists, the April uprising itself, and culminating in a series of talks bringing the Maoists into the centre and eventually into government. The Prime Minister's visit to India caused a stir, but he has shown considerable leadership given his state of health and uncertain mandate. His Friday summit with Chairman Prachanda has raised hopes of a peaceful transition, although intellectually there is a lot of ground to cover between the old parties and the new&mdash;the Maoists who seem to have hogged the limelight.</p>
	<p pid="c.978.3/6">On the ground, there is a lot of confusion. The Maoist threat remains in the provinces, with abductions and extortion still being reported by INSEC, the respected human rights agency. Rallies inside and outside the valley, not surprisingly after years of guerrilla war, show resentment at the continuing power of the establishment. The retention of the monarchy, even in a ceremonial form, will be a sticking point for the Maoists, for whom a republic is not just rhetoric. The decision of the CPN-UML, led by Mr M K Nepal and antis, such as Mr Bam Dev Gautum, will be critical. Yet it should not be at the top of the agenda while there is a more urgent need for a durable ceasefire, new elections, reform of the army and civil service, and a peaceful transition to a government which genuinely meets the people's needs and secures international assistance. We know from experience that decommissioning dependent on the degree of power-sharing can take many years, even with international supervision.</p>
	<p pid="c.978.3/7">The best hope for national unity, and for an administration which will soon include the Maoists, is a campaign for a more equal society in which poverty reduction becomes the most urgent priority. Nearly 30 per cent of the population live below the poverty line and primary healthcare and education, especially for girls, are desperately needed in rural areas. There are still around 1.5 million child labourers, and bonded labour is a huge problem. As in India, most of the poor are from the lowest castes, who represent about 22 per cent of the total population. Parliament made a start on <phrase class="date" code="">4 June</phrase> with a historic declaration tabled by the CPN-UML outlawing discrimination against Dalits and promising more educational opportunities. This progressive move towards equality and assistance to the poorest must not get lost in the scramble for power and the rise of a new bureaucracy.</p>
	<p pid="c.978.3/8">As Matthew Kahane, the UN resident representative, recently put it:</p>
	<p pid="c.978.3/9" class="indent">&quot;If Nepal is able to hold a constituent assembly process that is genuinely inclusive&mdash;with appropriate representation for women, Dalits, ethnic and other disadvantaged groups&mdash;the country can begin the structural transformation that will be needed to reverse the historical inequalities at the heart of the conflict&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="c.978.3/10">I recognise that that is a tall order against a background of extreme poverty and official neglect, but international agencies have brought a lot of experience. Our own DfID has built up a strong &pound;32 million programme, part of which we visited at Biratnaga.</p>
	<p pid="c.978.3/11">I hope that the Minister will confirm that all those development projects can now proceed, depending on improved security. I know that the British Gurkha programme remains intact, but its welfare service has been severely cut. The UK also has relevant human rights experience through the Global Conflict Prevention Pool, as the Minister said last week. That will presumably be of use during the current negotiations and I expect that the Minister will have more detail.</p>
	<p pid="c.978.3/12">There were unspeakable crimes on both sides during the civil war and the people are already demanding justice for the victims of atrocities by both the Maoists and the army. The army is tentatively conducting its own investigations, such as that into the disappearance of 49 the detainees in the Bhairavnath battalion case. The UN and Nepali human rights agencies have been active throughout the crisis. The High Commission for Human Rights, under Ian Martin, once formally invited&mdash;there is some doubt even now about that&mdash;will play a valuable part in the peace process. With UK and EU encouragement, it could very soon back up the process of army reform and Maoist demobilisation, with the latter apparently willing to place their weapons under international supervision.</p>
	<p pid="c.978.3/13">Can the Minister tell us whether the US embassy has now softened its position and confirm that the Indian Government, which has always been uneasy about UN involvement, is now more receptive to international intervention? I want the UK to take a more active role, but I congratulate our embassy, led by Keith Bloomfield, on its calming influence and positive background noise throughout the recent troubles. I look forward to meeting his successor, Andrew Hall, next week.</p>
	<p pid="c.978.3/14">With the king playing a purely formal role, the monarchy as an institution must surely become once again a force for stability. His Majesty the late King Birendra, whom I knew and greatly admired, accepted a new constitutional status in 1990 and is still remembered with affection even by some of the younger radical leaders. I see no reason why the present king should not come to accept a similar role. However, it is not for outsiders to influence that; it will all be in the hands of the new constituent assembly and the popular will.</p>
	<p pid="c.978.3/15">The Nepalese people have shown a remarkable characteristic tolerance and restraint throughout the recent violence and it is to be hoped that those great qualities will bring them through the coming period. There is an urgent need for peace and economic recovery. However, none of us should underestimate the difficulties that lie ahead.</p>
	<p pid="c.978.3/16">In summary, I hope that Her Majesty's Government will give even more priority to Nepal now that there is a real chance of multi-party democracy working towards better governance. Disillusionment can set in so easily and the worst outcome would be for the international community to point the finger at the earliest sign of failure. There will be mistakes and there will be suspicion. Our long friendship and mutual interests should enable our Government to take a more prominent role in assisting the process of reconciliation and the formation of a genuinely representative new Government.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-22c.993.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100817" speakername="Lord Triesman" colon=":" colnum="993"  time="018:27:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldhansrd/vo060622/text/60622-27.htm#60622-27_spmin0">
	<p pid="c.993.0/1">My Lords, I am very grateful to the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, for raising the important issue of peace and democracy in Nepal and to all noble Lords who have taken part in a very significant debate. I admire the noble Earl's first-hand knowledge and the penetrating analysis that he has provided, to which I listened with great care, as I did to the points that others have raised, to which I shall try to respond.</p>
	<p pid="c.993.0/2">Like a number of noble Lords, including the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, and the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, I share the sense of debt to Nepal, and in particular to the Gurkhas. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, referred to an historic obligation, and I echo those words. The links that our forces continue to have under the broad basis of the 1947 tripartite agreement are fundamental as a basis on which the Gurkhas can proceed in their relationship with us. I also share the right approach of the noble Lord, Lord Howell, in locating the geopolitical importance of the region and I make my remarks in that context.</p>
	<p pid="c.993.0/3">It is no understatement to say that Nepal is at a critical point in its history. Following the tumultuous events in April when the Nepalese people rose up against the King's failed attempt at direct rule, there is now a realistic prospect of a resolution of the 10 year-old conflict there, and a return to peace, stability and genuine multi-party democracy. But there are very serious challenges ahead. The King's restoration of Parliament on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-24">24 April</phrase> was a victory for the democratic aspirations of the Nepalese people. The United Kingdom and the wider international community, including India, worked over many months in support of these aspirations. The new Government representing the seven party alliance face major challenges in securing a fully functioning democracy. The internal situation remains fragile but, as the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, said, bold steps have already been taken towards peace and reconciliation.</p>
	<p pid="c.993.0/4">Implementation of a verifiable and sustainable ceasefire with the Maoists is essential to underpin a comprehensive peace process in which the Maoists must abandon violence and rejoin the democratic mainstream, however ill that sits with their tradition and philosophy. The three-month ceasefire agreed by the parties must be made permanent. The Nepalese army needs to be brought under effective civil control and made fully accountable to democratic authorities. Civil society also needs strengthening to participate fully in elections to a new constituent assembly.</p>
	<p pid="c.993.0/5">We welcome the Government's peace talks with the Maoists on <phrase class="date" code="">26 May</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="">15 June</phrase>, and the agreement to a 26-point code of conduct governing the ceasefire and paving the way for elections to the constituent assembly. Like the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, we also welcome the first talks on <phrase class="date" code="">16 June</phrase> between Prime Minister Koirala and the Maoist leaders Prachanda and Bhattarai that resulted in an eight-point agreement on interim arrangements leading up to the constituent assembly elections. We also applaud the work of the political parties in remaining united on a common government platform. I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, that it is imperative that this unity is preserved over the difficult weeks ahead. The restoration of Parliament and the steps taken towards the constituent assembly elections present huge opportunities for a return to peace, democracy and stability in Nepal. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, rightly described that as moving in the right direction.</p>
	<p pid="c.993.0/6">I shall add nothing to what I said only a few days ago about the monarchy&mdash;it is a matter for the people of Nepal to decide, as several noble Lords have said.</p>
	<p pid="c.993.0/7">I also take completely the point made by the noble Baroness, Lady Northover. There has been no focus on women's involvement and, therefore, on the inclusiveness for which she appeals, during this stage of the peace process. Both the Government and the Maoists have teams made up solely of men. Whatever proposals emerge for a future quota of 33 per cent of women in all public positions, there are only two women in the current Cabinet. However, women are more likely, we think, to be involved in the constituent assembly in the proposed second stage of the peace process. While we do not choose other people's representatives in any such bodies, the Department for International Development is considering funding a number of projects that specifically relate to women's inclusion in the democratic process.</p>
	<p pid="c.993.0/8">A number of noble Lords, particularly the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, and the noble Lord, Lord Howell, rightly raised concerns about Maoist intentions. We remain clear that the pursuit of political ends through violent means is absolutely unacceptable. For that reason, we need to proceed with great caution. The only way for the Maoists to gain acceptance as legitimate political actors is for them to take concrete steps towards a permanent end to the use of violence; there is no role for the gun in the pursuit of democracy. This will necessarily involve them laying down their arms for good, ceasing extortion, and working sincerely towards a durable peace process in which they become reintegrated into the democratic mainstream. The Maoists are well aware of our position from repeated public calls on them to renounce violence, to lay down their arms and to rejoin the democratic mainstream.</p>
	<p pid="c.993.0/9">The noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, asked about the United States' position, and I am not aware of any change in that. It continues to designate the Maoists as a terrorist group. The noble Lord, Lord Howell, rightly, made a point with great force about the relationship with India and its role in the region and Nepal. It has the greatest influence there and we have sought a continuous and close dialogue with it. We routinely share analysis and thoughts on the steps that can be taken towards a resolution of the crisis. We both have in view multi-party democracy and the Maoists being brought firmly into that purpose. Perhaps I may add that there has been no change in the policy whereby the British ambassador and his senior staff do not have official meetings with Maoists. But unlike the United States, the UK has not designated them as a terrorist group and has, therefore, not excluded their leadership from the UK. That might address one of the thoughts so tellingly offered to us by the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall.</p>
	<p pid="c.993.0/10">Regarding ministerial contacts with the new Government, the EU welcomed Nepal's Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Mr KP Oli, for talks in Brussels on <phrase class="date" code="">15 June</phrase>. My right honourable friend the Minister of State, Mr McCartney, also met Mr Oli in Geneva on <phrase class="date" code="">20 June</phrase>. Another right honourable friend, Dr Howells, expects to visit Nepal in the early autumn to continue discussions.</p>
	<p pid="c.993.0/11">It is clear that any elections held in Nepal, whether to a constituent assembly or to Parliament, will require international supervision. The Government of Nepal will need to decide what assistance they require from the international community in this respect. The UK itself will not be looking to take on this operation, but there may well be scope for the UK to volunteer election monitors as part of any internationally co-ordinated effort under the United Nations, or through the European Union.</p>
	<p pid="c.993.0/12">In order to cement the ceasefire and facilitate early elections, Nepal may want to take advantage of the assistance of an independent and credible external partner like the United Nations, whatever the reservations of some of its neighbours. In their talks on <phrase class="date" code="">16 June</phrase>, the seven party alliance and the Maoists agreed to request help from the United Nations in arms monitoring and management. We are pursuing with the Nepalese and our international partners, including India, how such external facilitation or monitoring could work. We know that India continues to have sensitivities in this regard which need to be addressed. But, as several noble Lords have remarked, the UN already plays a significant role in Nepal, including through the Kathmandu office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. I say to the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that, as a result of the <phrase class="date" code="">16 June</phrase> discussions and UN efforts, we are working with the Nepalese and all international partners on those objectives. I am not sure that a long menu of alternative ways of dealing with it would stimulate a rapid enough response, as people pondered them all, but I understand the intellectual integrity of the noble Lord's point.</p>
	<p pid="c.993.0/13">Several noble Lords&mdash;the noble Lord, Lord Howell, in particular mentioned it as an interest&mdash;raised UK assistance to the new Government, especially through DfID, as mentioned by the noble Baroness, Lady Northover. As I said in the House on <phrase class="date" code="">15 June</phrase>, my right honourable friend the Secretary of State for International Development is currently considering, with other donors and UK government departments, how best to respond to the new situation, including if and when to increase assistance to credible, accountable organisations. I agree with the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, that poverty reduction is an important priority. Consideration is also being given to financial and technical support to the peace process through the interdepartmental Global Conflict Prevention Pool. It is too early to make formal commitments. The total planned bilateral DfID assistance for 2006&ndash;07 is &pound;30 million.</p>
	<p pid="c.993.0/14">I shall raise the points of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, about funding for resettlement and other things. But in the spirit in which he made his point, I tell him that EU help for every shortfall may be beyond the EU's means. There are so many countries, with so many pressing demands. Any extension of work will require more money. It is worth arguing for, however, and I shall carry that point forward.</p>
	<p pid="c.993.0/15">The EU is also considering what peace-building support it can provide to Nepal, and the UK expects the European Commission to consider positively any requests by the Nepalese Government for assistance. Possibilities include support for elections, election observers, ceasefire monitoring and technical assistance with transitional justice. We are considering help with security sector reform, so that the security forces can be brought under effective civil control in a way which ensures their co-operation with the new Government. We will consider requests put to us by the new Government, but we are not aware that they are making any request for an extension of UN mandates at this time.</p>
	<p pid="c.993.0/16">In an accurate description of the human rights violations and those responsible, the noble Baroness, Lady D'Souza, recognised the engagement of the people in this process. She said that the people must be the drivers, and I strongly agree. Some noble Lords have rightly raised these human rights issues, which remain a cause of concern. Despite their commitment to human rights and multi-party democracy, the Maoists continue with abductions, extortion and other grave human rights abuses. The Nepal Army must also be fully accountable. Reports of illegal detentions and disappearances in 2003, as well as unlawful killings during the recent protests, must be fully investigated. We strongly support the work of the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Kathmandu. We will continue to encourage the new Government to deal seriously with human rights violations, and help them with capacity building to meet that challenge. It was said in the debate that that is simply a matter of justice, and I fully agree.</p>
	<p pid="c.993.0/17">There are better prospects for peace and democracy now in Nepal than there have been for many years, but there are also serious challenges ahead. The UK is a historic friend and partner of Nepal. I warmly welcome the resumption of interparliamentary contacts with Nepal, including the recent visit in which the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, and the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, participated. I also welcome their kind words about the positive role of our embassy and Ambassador Bloomfield during the recent troubles, and the support provided by the Department for International Development. We will continue to offer whatever assistance we can for the peace-building process and we will keep staffing and other resource levels under review. I urge all the actors to take advantage of the new opportunity to build a sustainable peace and a stable multi-party democracy. That was the burden of the requirement that the noble Baroness, Lady D'Souza, put to us. The people of Nepal have suffered much over the past 10 years; they deserve better and they deserve our help.</p>
