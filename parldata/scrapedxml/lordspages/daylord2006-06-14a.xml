<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-14a.215.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100222" speakername="Lord Fowler" colon=":" colnum="215"  time="015:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60614-04.htm#60614-04_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.215.1/1">My Lords, let me say at once that I am in no way challenging the recommendation of the Liaison Committee to set up an <i>ad hoc</i> committee on regulators. Even if my amendment were passed, it would have no effect whatever on that decision. Nor am I asking this afternoon that the House should decide whether to have a permanent committee on broadcasting, the media and communications. The purpose is to ask that the proposal for such a permanent Select Committee should be reconsidered by the Liaison Committee, and in doing this I raise what I believe is an issue of some principle which the House might want to consider.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/2">The history is that, as the report makes clear, I submitted a proposal for a permanent media Select Committee, and that was considered on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-08">8 May</phrase>. At the meeting, I was supported from the government Benches by the noble Lord, Lord Maxton, and from the Liberal Democrat Benches by the noble Baroness, Lady Bonham-Carter. I also had the strong support of the noble Baroness, Lady Howarth, the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Manchester and many others. Unknown to me or my colleagues, about 30 minutes before the meeting was due to start&mdash;in other words, at the very last moment&mdash;a letter was delivered to the chairman of the Liaison Committee. It was from the chairman of the House of Commons Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee, John Whittingdale, and it opposed the setting up of such a permanent committee by the Lords. I repeat: I had no notice of this, nor had my colleagues, nor indeed, I think, had the Liaison Committee either. Time was obviously very short. The outcome was that although the letter was circulated to the Liaison Committee, it was not shown to me or my colleagues. Nevertheless, when it came to the meeting I was questioned on it, and it appears as evidence in the report at page 8.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/3">Personally, I find it fairly extraordinary that a letter should have been submitted in this way. I find it fairly extraordinary that it should have been done without notice to anyone. My own submission was with the committee six weeks earlier. I find it extraordinary that anyone should have thought that this was a proper thing to do. I can imagine the reaction from the Commons had the roles been reversed. But what I think makes it so wrong is that, had I been given notice, I could have answered fully the charges made in the letter itself.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/4">I will not weary the House with a point-by-point rebuttal but I should like to take two examples. Mr Whittingdale, in his letter, fears duplication between the two Houses. But his view, it seems to me, is based on a misconception. His committee shadows the work of the Department for Culture and it is a departmental Select Committee. That is not our aim. We want to look at the media industries involved across departments, and, incidentally, they are very major industries. The difference in approach is shown in the inquiries carried out by the Commons over the past five years. They published 28 reports, only four of which related to broadcasting, and two to wider media matters. The others concerned issues that would be outside our remit in any event. Over the past five years, the Commons have published reports on the market for art, theatre, maritime heritage, public libraries, drugs in sport, dance, reform of the National Lottery, tourism, the London Olympic bid, National Gallery funding, gambling, the Wembley national stadium project, the Commonwealth Games, arts development, swimming and world athletics. None of those are issues that we want to look at at all. They are important issues, but they are not the ones we want to look at. That has been the bulk of their work, and none of that, as I say, would be covered by our Select Committee if it was ever approved.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/5">An even more suspect argument in the letter, which is set out in the report, is that the setting up of a committee might lead to &quot;pressure&quot; on the broadcasters; they might find it difficult to cope in giving evidence if there were two Select Committees. To be blunt, I think that that is nonsense. I later mentioned this argument to Charles Allen, the head of ITV, who on the contrary told me he would welcome such a committee. I have no doubt that Channel 4 would say exactly the same thing. I cannot believe that it is the view of the BBC, given that one of the arguments about the BBC is insufficient parliamentary scrutiny.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/6">I understand the issue of resources, but I think resources could be found. I believe that the BBC Select Committee, a Select Committee of this House, showed that such Select Committees can play an important part. I accept that we want to avoid duplication; we did so on the BBC Charter Review Committee and it is a perfectly common sense and easy thing to do. If we are to say that there is to be no overlap at all, a whole range of committees in the Lords are brought under question. In the area that we are proposing, there are wide open spaces such as the print media on which the Commons has done next to no work over the past five years, or publishing, where there are issues of competition. Above all, a Lords committee brings independent judgment to this area, and it brings also an experience that was well illustrated by the membership of the BBC Select Committee that I was fortunate enough to work with.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/7">We are not asking for the House to decide today whether it thinks that there should be a permanent committee, but we are asking simply for the opportunity to be heard again by the Liaison Committee with all the papers before us. We ask this in view of the entirely unsatisfactory background of the application. That is no criticism of the Lord Chairman. I accept that the Liaison Committee may come to the same conclusion. I obviously hope that it will not, and I will try to persuade it otherwise, but at least we would feel in that case that natural justice had been served and that last minute interventions designed to destroy our case will not be tolerated by this House. I beg to move.</p>
	<p pid="a.215.1/8">Moved, as an amendment to the Motion, at end to insert &quot;except that the proposal for a permanent Select Committee on broadcasting, the media, and communications, should be reconsidered by the Liaison Committee&quot;.&mdash;(<i>Lord Fowler</i>.)</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-14a.258.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100102" speakername="Lord Campbell of Alloway" colon=":" colnum="258"  time="018:26:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60614-14.htm#60614-14_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.258.0/1">My Lords, at the outset, I thank the Minister for the rather exceptional treatment that we have had in being able to discuss with an open mind how we could improve this Bill. That is greatly appreciated.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/2">I am concerned about whether some form of statutory safeguard is now requisite, as has been spoken to on so many occasions between <phrase class="date" code="2005-07-14">14 July 2005</phrase> and <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-16">16 February 2006</phrase> when this was discussed. Is it requisite to do something to avoid repetition of what happened not only to Trooper Williams but to Sergeant Roberts, after years of delay? I am very grateful to the noble Lord for the proposal to end delay and to my noble friend Lord Astor of Hever for trying to fit in another safeguard to avoid delay. Even with that, there still arises the question of what happens after a period of delay when you find that there is no quality of evidence to support the charge. Even if you reduce the delay, the situation for the member of the Armed Forces involved, on a charge where there is no quality of evidence, must be looked at with some care.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/3">In this context, the Bill makes no provision to inhibit resort to the process under which trials of cases in the civil courts is ordained by the Attorney-General, whether or not at the behest of the Director of Army Legal Services or what will become the DSP, for offences that otherwise could be dealt with at courts martial. Such ordnance is made <i>ex cathedra</i>, within the closet of absolute discretion, not subject to review by the judiciary, without notice, reasons or any means of objection. That is in defiance of the fundamental principles of justice. It remains a matter of current concern for the Armed Forces that now must be addressed, not only in the interests of justice, but under the new concept that justice has to reflect the provisions of the Human Rights Act. The purpose of my speech is merely to put down a marker for a probing amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/4">There is no need to deal with detail at Second Reading, but it is proposed to require the Attorney-General to apply to the High Court if he wishes to resort to the civil jurisdiction for the three serious offences of murder, manslaughter and breach of convention. The High Court would then adjudge whether that would be in the public interest. No one seems to imagine the truth, which is that you should transfer jurisdiction only in the public interest. I suggest that that is a matter not for the Attorney-General but for the court&mdash;totally objectively&mdash;to decide, as it should decide whether there is the quality of evidence to warrant a trial.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/5">In other, non-serious cases, the Attorney-General can make any dispensations or decisions, subject to the one qualification introduced by the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay of Clashfern, who said that there must be always some means of objection. In such cases, it is suggested that the qualification introduced by the noble and learned Lord should be met by regulations made under Clause 127(1). So although there is disparity of treatment, in all cases of a transfer from the court martial jurisdiction to the civil jurisdiction a reasoned decision has to be made. That is common to both categories. In the serious category, that decision must be made by the High Court. In the other category, the decision has to be made giving reasons&mdash;a totally unreasonable decision would be set aside on judicial review. So, there is a structure.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/6">This matter is approached on the basis that, as the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Bramall, has said on more than one occasion, in particular on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-16">16 February</phrase>, an armed serviceman's legitimate expectation is that he should be tried for these serious offences by a court martial, if the offence is committed in operational circumstances. That would mean that some of the people who sit in judgment have experience of lethal situations in which mistakes are apt to be made, because the rules of engagement are not readily understood and are sometimes not understandable. Specific orders on such urgent rescue missions as to free hostages and to avoid torture and death&mdash;for example, the operations in Sierra Leone and Basra&mdash;have to be regarded in a different light from murder in the streets of Manchester. Such matters have to be assessed by someone who has practical experience and knowledge of the situations that arise&mdash;and that will be incorporated into the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="a.258.0/7">I am anxious not to detain your Lordships a minute longer than I need to, because I have given you the broad structure of the amendment that I propose to table and, with the leave of the House, I will deal with the details on a subsequent occasion.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-14a.281.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100778" speakername="Lord Garden" colon=":" colnum="281"  time="020:02:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60614-20.htm#60614-20_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.281.1/1">My Lords, I am grateful to the noble and gallant Lord, but I still remain in slight disagreement with him. What happens when there are increasingly such situations is that justice is administered by two different commanding officers and it is not seen as fair to anybody involved in it or to those serving in the unit. I welcome the move towards a single system of military justice.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/2">Many noble Lords have said that the Minister, the Ministry of Defence and the Bill team have been absolutely punctilious in keeping us aware of how the Bill has been developing over time. It is a substantial and complex Bill and I thank the Minister for involving us. I should just correct the assertion made by the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, of 34 stars. We make it 35 from these Benches. They are in cahoots with the Conservative Front Bench and their researchers. I have to tell the Minister that three stars that sit on the Lib Dem Benches will be doing it independently. That may be a good thing or a bad thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/3">We are going to have a lot of detailed work to do in Committee. An Armed Forces Bill presents an opportunity to consider some other aspects of modern military service. I do not remind your Lordships and many have already said it&mdash;we expect an enormous amount from the dedicated men and women who serve their country in the Armed Forces. We also expect them to operate under a much more stringent legal framework than those in civilian employment. That is understandable as the state authorises military personnel to use lethal force, and we must be certain that we have a disciplined body to deploy such force. At the same time, the state also owes a duty of care to its military given the sacrifices that they make, both in their freedoms and perhaps even their lives. We have talked about the sorts of ways we should approach that, in terms of reducing delays of justice and putting time limits within the Bill. That is something that we will certainly want to look at in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/4">The Army's formulation of the military covenant expresses very well the approach we need to have in this, in that soldiers are expected to make personal sacrifices in the service of the nation. But the other half of that bargain is that British military personnel must always be able to expect fair treatment, to be valued and respected as individuals and they and their families will be sustained and rewarded by commensurate terms and conditions of service.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/5">It is therefore against both sides of the covenant that we must judge the Bill. We have talked mainly about the effect on the chain of command and the commanding officer; we also need to be thinking in Committee about the individuals who are subject to this law. In that respect, the report by Nicholas Blake into Deepcut is a remarkably useful document in one aspect&mdash;that is the training of young servicemen. But it does read across into other parts of the Bill. It was unfortunate that your Lordships did not have a chance yesterday as they did in another place, to debate the Statement that was made about the Ministry of Defence's response. That would have cleared some of the issues that we will have to talk about in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/6">The principles that I will be looking for in the way that the Bill goes forward is whether we are putting the right conditions for young men and women in the forces that are appropriate to the 21st century, rather than just an amalgamation of practices, some of which had their genesis in Victorian times.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/7">I turn now to the question of how the three Service Discipline Acts are to be merged as we have had some discussion on that. The Army and RAF elements are fairly closely aligned at the moment. We have heard why historically the Royal Navy gave its commanders greater powers and I add my congratulations to the Bill team for managing to get a good measure of agreement so that the three services can operate with a common list of offences. Those at Part 2 of Schedule 1, which require permission from the commanding officer are a good way to introduce the flexibility that we have talked about to meet different operational circumstances.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/8">We will need to consider in Committee maximum punishments and the detail of the offences which my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford addressed in his opening remarks. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, dealt in particular with Clause 8 on desertion, as did the noble Baroness, Lady Dean. That will need to be looked at, mainly because the punishment now is so disproportionate to the way people think that very few people are charged with desertion. It is also a question of making the Bill useful so that the various levels have practical utility. At the same time, the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, raised important issues about the definition of active service in respect of Clause 8.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/9">The main discussion, not unexpectedly, has been about the role of the commanding officer and whether the Bill diminishes it in some way. There is particular concern among a number of noble Lords about the inability of the CO to dismiss a charge for a Schedule 2 offence. I am not inclined to believe that the Bill diminishes the standing of the CO; it seems appropriate that if he cannot handle a particular offence, he ought not to be able to dismiss it.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/10">We have also discussed the new arrangement for having a director of service prosecutions instead of the individual service prosecuting authority. Again, in the context of the Bill that seems a reasonable way forward, but we will want to have deep discussions in Committee about how to define the experience level that is needed for the holder of this post. The arguments made by the Chiefs of the General Staff to the Select Committee on the Bill about the need for military experience supported by all noble and gallant Lords and noble Lords throughout the House seemed totally persuasive. We will need to look at how we can define that job specification to get the right person there.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/11">With regard to what the Bill does for the rights of individual service personnel, I shall want to look at a number of issues in Committee. On the key area of complaints and redress to which a number of noble Lords have referred, we have ample evidence&mdash;as the Minister confirmed in his opening remarks&mdash;that the system is flawed and not terribly well understood. Those who believe they have cause for complaint worry that complaining will have an adverse effect on their career, and their complaints are often not taken forward promptly by the chain of command. It is not new: Sir Michael Betts, in 1995, as well as Blake, recommended the need for an independent complaints system. My noble friend Lord Roper raised the issue, as did the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley. Such an independent commission, according to the Blake proposals, would be able to examine complaints of any nature from any member of the Armed Forces. Other nations, such as the United States and Australia, manage to operate a perfectly satisfactory military system with parallel independent systems.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/12">As my noble friend Lord Thomas of Gresford said, the Bill is very timid in this area. It offers the prospect of an independent member of the service complaint panel if the Secretary of State decides it is appropriate. Despite this morning's headlines in the newspapers about military ombudsmen, the Government response to Blake, issued yesterday, offers only a minor modification. It is not enough; we will need to know how we are to meet recommendation 26 of the Deepcut review. Perhaps the Minister could say whether he has had a reaction yet from Mr Blake about whether he feels that his that recommendation has been met.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/13">We will need to look at how to get a commissioner of military complaints who can look more closely at unresolved complaints concerning a wider field than just harassment and bullying. We will seek to amend the Bill to meet this need and will consider the government amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/14">There are many other aspects we will need to probe in Committee. The provisions relating to civilians has been mentioned by some; it is an area requiring consistent treatment. We have talked about the size of courts-martial panels; their service composition will be a matter for debate. I have less of a problem than many noble and gallant Lords and even my noble friend Lord Roper at the thought of having mixed services. If we are moving to a unified service discipline system, mixed courts-martial panels will have some advantages in terms of consistency of approach. We will doubtless discuss that in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/15">A great deal of detail is left to regulation. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Craig, the noble Baroness, Lady Dean, and my noble friend Lord Roper drew attention to the need for us to have some idea of what will be in the regulations. I have a suspicion that the Government have not yet thought that through, and we may have problems in getting enough of the information about the regulations in Committee. We need to see the context of the Bill, and someone in the MoD will have to burn the midnight oil for us to be able to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.281.1/16">Finally, I take this opportunity to say a few words about implementation. The noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce, spoke about the scale of the change. I know that the Ministry of Defence has thought about this, but it will nevertheless be a daunting task. Rather like the noble Viscount, Lord Slim, I built up my knowledge of Air Force law over many years&mdash;initial training, promotion exams, serving on courts martial and then various levels of command. That is the easy way, but it takes decades to do. Implementation in a couple of years will mean an extraordinarily steep learning curve for a large number of people, and a large training requirement for those who have to operate the new system. They must not make mistakes with it; we do not want that to happen because we have rushed this. I believe that a cautious approach should be taken. If it proves, as it may well do, more difficult than planned, sufficient time must be allowed.</p>

	<p pid="a.296.2/1">My Lords, I shall say a few words in support of the order. We have had a good debate this afternoon on the broad issues of the Armed Forces Bill. However, although it is less significant than the Bill, the order is crucially important.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.2/2">As noble Lords will know, in most years Parliament is asked to consider an order of this kind as part of the process by which the service discipline Acts are kept in force. The Armed Forces Acts form the main part of that process. They are passed every five years to allow the individual service discipline Acts to continue in force for a maximum of five years, subject to an annual Order in Council in each of the intervening years.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.2/3">The service discipline Acts provide the statutory basis for discipline in our Armed Forces. The order before us is critical to ensuring that those Acts remain in force. The most recent of these, the Armed Forces Act 2001, extended the provisions of the Army Act 1955, the Air Force Act 1955 and the Naval Discipline Act 1957 by a further five years. But that extension was subject to both Houses approving an order such as the one before us in each intervening year. The key difference this year is that we are reaching the end of this particular cycle. The current order continues the service discipline Acts in force until December 2006, beyond which they can be renewed only by primary legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.2/4">Having had its Second Reading today, the Government are confident that the Armed Forces Bill will by then have received Royal Assent. The Armed Forces Act 2006, as it will then be known, will provide for the arrangement to continue under that legislation.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.2/5">I shall make one more observation about the order. The Government have given an undertaking that Ministers moving instruments subject to the affirmative procedure will tell the House whether they are satisfied that the legislation is compatible with the rights provided in the European Convention on Human Rights. The order that we are considering today is a brief document that raises convention issues only in that it maintains in force three Acts that, as they have been amended over the years, reflect convention rights. It is no secret that, when it was introduced, the Armed Forces Bill did not require the five-yearly legislation to be renewed by Order in Council in each of the intervening years.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.2/6">It is true that we felt that there was no longer a need for parliamentary control to be exercised quite so closely in the 21st century. Indeed, this would have been the last such debate. In the event, we have heard Parliament's voice loud and clear. The Government amended the Bill in the other place to continue with annual renewal by Order in Council, not only of the existing Acts but also of the Armed Forces Bill, once brought into force. For some years now, these debates have provided an opportunity to give the House a progress report on the forthcoming Armed Forces Bill. There may be a few noble Lords who thought they would never see the Bill introduced to Parliament. I am delighted that we have proved them wrong. In future, I expect that these debates will provide a useful opportunity to keep the House informed of progress on the Bill's implementation, and I undertake to do that.</p>
	<p pid="a.296.2/7">In conclusion, I look forward to providing those updates and to discussing the renewal of a single system of service law for many years to come. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.298.2/1">My Lords, this order will be made under the Armed Forces Act 2001 and will amend the Courts-Martial Appeals Act 1968, which requires that it will follow the affirmative procedure, needing approval by both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/2">The Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced the right of the prosecution to appeal against terminating rulings by a Crown Court judge. That was brought into force in the civilian system last year. We believe that it is right and sensible that the same provisions should apply to the Armed Forces and that the service prosecuting authorities should be able to appeal against similar rulings by judge advocates at courts martial.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/3">However, the relevant part of the 2003 Act did not make specific provision for that right of appeal to apply to the services. The Armed Forces Act 2001 enables provisions to be made equivalent to those contained in any future criminal justice legislation, and it is intended to use this order-making power to make equivalent provision for the services with regard to prosecution appeals.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/4">As noble Lords will know, terminating rulings by a judge take the form of a stay of proceedings, a ruling of &quot;no case to answer&quot; or another ruling that is fatal to the prosecution case. That means that a judge's ruling stops the case so that it is terminated. It proceeds no further, and the accused is no longer subject to prosecution. For example, a judge may decide to stay the proceedings, which has the effect of stopping the case, or he could find that there has been an abuse of process such that the prosecution cannot be allowed to proceed. He could also find that there is no case to answer against the accused, which would generally be because of inherent weakness of the evidence against him. Approval of this order will mean that the service prosecuting authorities will be able to instigate appeals against terminating rulings by judge advocates at court martial through the Courts-Martial Appeal Court.</p>
	<p pid="a.298.2/5">While this right of appeal will apply to all courts martial, it is likely that such appeals will be rare as their use will be dependent on a terminating ruling by a judge advocate. However, it is right and proper that this provision be accessible within the military justice system as it is in the civilian courts. I commend the draft order to the House. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.299.5/1">My Lords, the regulations enable an authorised person to require any person who applies for entry clearance to provide a record of his fingerprints and a photograph of his face. The regulations also enable an authorised person to require any person who is in possession of a 1951 Refugee Convention travel document that is endorsed with an entry clearance and who seeks leave to enter the United Kingdom to provide a record of his fingerprints and a photograph of his face.

	<p pid="a.310.0/1">My Lords, I welcome this debate on a much under-scrutinised but delicate field. It is an area that Parliament ought to be allowed and encouraged to devote more attention to. However, I do not entirely agree with the sentiments expressed by the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, for reasons that the noble Lord, Lord King, has also stressed. The National Health Service, after all, is suffering badly from having been reorganised three times in the past nine years, and the Government's response is to propose a fourth major reorganisation. The police are about to go through a major reorganisation in this country for reasons that are not unconnected with what we are discussing, including the weakness of Special Branch agencies in some of our smaller forces. The risk of that is that we may lose some of the invaluable local links that our current police forces have. In the pursuit of level 2 or level 3 crime, we may lose the level 1 problems. I am therefore sceptical, like the noble Lord, Lord King, about reorganisation as such.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/2">We all must recognise how much the security context has been transformed in the past 15 years. However, as I was listening to the opening speeches, I was thinking that some of these things are not entirely new. As a junior lecturer, I used to help to train the Lancashire police and I was also candidate for Manchester Moss Side, an area with a substantial Irish Catholic community, and certainly a number of terrorists within that community. We know that because a house blew up one night when its inhabitants were trying to assemble a bomb and had not quite got it in the right place; happily they succeeded in destroying the worst part of Manchester city centre some years later, enabling Manchester to be rebuilt in a rather better way. The Special Branch had to be involved not just at the local level but also in understanding who went between Manchester and Ireland and what the IRA's connections were with Gibraltar, Libya and other areas.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/3">We now have a very different problem in some ways with a different community. I found myself after the Iraq war addressing extremely large groups of people in the north of England interested in my party's policy on Iraq and on Kashmir and learnt a great deal about all the delicacies within that community in Leeds, Bradford, Pendle and elsewhere. For that, we need local knowledge and local partnerships; we need police more than security services, and not just the local police but other elements of the local community from which one has to build. Surely the lesson of where we are now is that we need not just a national effort but a local and an international effort.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/4">I say to the noble Lord, Lord Hamilton, that my understanding is that the linkages between transnational crime, dealing in drugs, people-smuggling and terrorist activity do not allow for any neat cut-off points. Terrorism is funded by smuggling drugs. People are smuggled for all sorts of reasons, not just the trafficking of women. That suggests to me again that one needs co-ordination between a whole range of different services. That is the most important aspect.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/5">The problem is not unique to the United Kingdom; it exists in the United States, France, Germany and elsewhere. The experience of the United States is not entirely happy. An American friend of mine was appointed as a White House fellow to deal with the drugs issue some years ago. I remember him saying that one of his discoveries was that, when he arrived at the White House he thought that there were eight agencies dealing with the international problem of drugs in the United States, but by the time that he left he knew that there were 32. The United States Government, with or without the Department of Homeland Security, have their own built-in inefficiencies.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/6">We have adapted quite well over the past 15 years to the change in our security context. I have certainly been impressed by the way in which a domestic police force which had almost no international links until the late 1980s now has liaison officers in embassies all over Europe and beyond. It has very excellent links with police in the Caribbean and elsewhere, and it has learnt not only to value language proficiency among our police forces but also how these informal and formal links now move together. The transformation of the European context of British policing and of sharing intelligence has been remarkable, although the Government have done their best not to tell us anything about it.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/7">The flexibility of the Foreign Office and our Diplomatic Service in providing open intelligence has also been very valuable. If I were to mark something that concerns me greatly, it is that the next comprehensive spending round will cut back on overseas posts to the point where information about which countries have failing Governments and which countries therefore provide bases for potential radical criminal movements will not be provided, because there will no longer be British posts in those countries. We always have to remember that open intelligence&mdash;the sort of things that the Diplomatic Service proper does&mdash;is always absolutely invaluable. I recall sitting in on an American discussion about intelligence services in which one of the Americans present said, &quot;Part of our problem is that we have undervalued open sources. Because we thought that the secret sources were so much more interesting, we did not look at what was in front of our faces&quot;. British prisons as a source of recruitment are part of what we need to pull in, as are schools, which raises the question of education programmes at a local level.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/8">What concerns me in part is that I am not sure that the Government have a very clear sense of direction on this. I note in the annual report of the Intelligence and Security Committee for 2004&ndash;05 in paragraph 14 the comment that the Cabinet committee on the intelligence services has not met since December 2003, when it met for the first time in over seven years. The report says:</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/9" class="indent">&quot;This is a disappointment to us because our view is that it should meet regularly to enable collective discussion by Ministers of intelligence priorities and developments. At present, Ministers discuss intelligence only in the context of crisis or single-issue meetings&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/10">That is a damning comment from the Intelligence and Security Committee, and it is the sort of thing that the Government should be taking much more clearly into account.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/11">The last point that I want to make is about how the Government should be carrying the public, the opposition parties and, if possible, even the media with them. The Government response to the ISC report on the <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-07">7 July</phrase> bombings says:</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The Government agrees that greater transparency about the threat level and alert state system itself, and a managed process for communicating it to the public, will enhance its effectiveness and increase public confidence and vigilance&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/13">I strongly agree with that. The Government do not provide very much of the information that would help to build a degree of consensus. We all understand that this is an immensely delicate subject area. However, as someone who has worked professionally in international relations, I am struck when I look back by the fact that I have spent a great deal more time talking with people from the National Intelligence Council in the United States, which put in a number of people from other countries to argue with it about the changing nature of the threat, and with analysts from the German intelligence services than I&mdash;or people like me&mdash;have spent with the British intelligence services. There need to be analysts thinking about the longer-term threat. The current approach seems to be a mistake. It does not create a constituency that is sympathetic to the Government. It leaves the opposition parties&mdash;and, therefore, even more, the media&mdash;uninformed about what is happening.</p>
	<p pid="a.310.0/14">The ignorance of most members of the Conservative Party about the significance of European co-operation in justice and home affairs, and among police forces and intelligence agencies, is a prime example of what I am talking about. It is now vital to our national security that we have those links, yet our major opposition party is apparently almost unaware that they exist, let alone aware of their value. Therefore, we need greater flexibility in our response to all this&mdash;</p>
