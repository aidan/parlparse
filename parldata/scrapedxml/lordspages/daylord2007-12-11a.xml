	<p pid="a.121.9/1">The Climate Change Bill is the most important Bill in this Session of Parliament. It raises large issues on carbon reductions well into this century and a number of global issues, all of which have been subject to a great deal of discussion and debate, not just in the United Kingdom and Europe, but in the global community. However, a key area not covered by the Bill is why it exists and why we should have the various targets, measures and frameworks that it will bring into action.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.9/2">We all know that there is a consensus among the international community, climate change scientists and the political community that there is a considerable need to keep the temperature increase above pre-industrial levels to 2 degrees centigrade. If we do not have that in the Bill, I do not understand how the other major figures and items that we will come on to debate in Committee make sense. We from these Benches feel that it is very important that at the beginning of this Bill we have the objective that global warming should not be more than 2 degrees centigrade and that the United Kingdom should play its fair and equitable part in making sure that that objective is reached.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.9/3">I remind the Committee that the Defra statement of <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-19">19 November</phrase> on the post-2012 framework for tackling climate change said:</p>
	<p pid="a.121.9/4" class="indent">&quot;To avoid the dangerous impacts of global warming, global temperatures must rise no more than 2 degrees above those of pre-industrial times&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.9/5">If that is not authoritative enough, the Prime Minister said on the same day in what was seen as a keynote speech on the Government's climate change policy:</p>
	<p pid="a.121.9/6" class="indent">&quot;But our mission is in truth historic and it is world changing&mdash;to build over the next 50 years and beyond a global low carbon economy ... Our vision has one overriding claim: holding the rise in global temperatures to no more than 2 degrees centigrade&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.9/7">The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change makes it clear that if that objective is not achieved, among very many other consequences there is a risk of some 30 to 40 per cent of species becoming extinct&mdash;a risk, not a certainty, as in many of these areas of climate science.</p>
	<p pid="a.121.9/8">For those reasons we believe that the Bill should do exactly what the Government say it should do; it should lay out without doubt the context in which the Government and this nation will pursue the problem of climate change. This target should actually be in&mdash;</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-11a.153.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100104" speakername="Lord Campbell-Savours" colon=":" colnum="153"  time="017:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71211-0006.htm#07121147000047">
	<p pid="a.153.2/1">I draw the Committee's attention to the speech of the Prime Minister on climate change at the Foreign Press Association on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-27">27 November</phrase>, when he said:</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/2" class="indent">&quot;Every new policy will be examined for its impact on carbon emissions&mdash;not just those which reduce emissions, but those which increase them. And where emissions rise in one sector, we will have to achieve corresponding falls in another&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/3">That was a clear recognition of the fact that there is an inter-sectoral trade-off at the very heart of this legislation. The relationship between one department and another is critical to the Bill on an agenda which will probably dominate the next 100 years. I would have thought that any British Prime Minister would want to take on overall responsibility for seeing through this agenda, knowing that it is only the Prime Minister who can manage an inter-sectoral role interdepartmentally and also as regards wider policy governing various sectors. That paragraph of the speech continues:</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/4" class="indent">&quot;The legislation will enact our target of achieving a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions of at least 60 per cent by 2050 through domestic and international action&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.153.2/5">Again, inherent in that is the proposition that many of the great decisions on these issues will be taken at international conferences&mdash;probably summits in the end&mdash;when we hit crises. I argue that it is only a prime minister with a central co-ordinating role&mdash;the important role of seeing through this policy&mdash;who would have day-to-day contact with this moving agenda and would be able to represent fully the interests of the United Kingdom in those conditions. With that in mind, I strongly support the amendment, although I understand it is unique.</p>

	<p pid="a.156.1/1">No wonder. I cast no aspersions on the noble Earl; I had forgotten about that. There again, he went on about Defra more than anyone else. I will come to that point in a moment.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/2">The amendment would not be sending a signal. If we transfer the powers in the Bill from the Secretary of State to the Prime Minister, he would be required to deal with meeting the 2050 target, with setting and meeting the budgets and with laying the emissions statement for each budgetary period and for the year 2050 before Parliament. The practical effect of the amendment is, frankly, difficult to define. In reality, the Prime Minister could delegate the duty to deal with all those things to departments, led by Defra but along with others. The whole thing is preposterous, given the staff numbers in No. 10. There is not the capacity there. No. 10 might be very large compared to previous Governments, but it is nowhere near as large as the secretariat of most departments. It is simply not resourced to carry out those matters. Therefore, it would fall to the Secretaries of State in the various departments. There is a real problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/3">I understand the point about sending a signal. I thought that my noble friend Lord Campbell-Savours he was going to come to the exact opposite conclusion to the one that he reached. He made the point that the Prime Minister is taking the lead on this issue. He cited the <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-27">27 November</phrase> speech. Anyone who reads the <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-19">19 November</phrase> speech on the calls for changes relating to climate change covering the whole gamut of international and domestic policy in terms of targets and how the Government are operating under his leadership will see that he is taking a lead on this crucial issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.156.1/4">Therefore, we do not accept the unusuality, if I can use that word, of putting that in the legislation. There are bits of legislation where the Prime Minister is mentioned in making various appointments and in questions of national security. He cannot meaningfully take on the detailed responsibility, which is what is implied in the amendment. He would end up delegating it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-11a.159.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100099" speakername="The Earl of Caithness" colon=":" colnum="159"  time="017:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71211-0007.htm#07121151000025">
	<p pid="a.159.1/1">The amendment stands in my name and that of my noble friend Lord Crickhowell. My first duty is to send the apologies of my noble friend to the Committee&mdash;he is in Moscow with Sub-Committee C and not even he, in his brilliance, can be in two places at once.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/2">We come to an important part of the Bill, the first clause. Clause 1(1) reads:</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/3" class="indent">&quot;It is the duty of the Secretary of State to ensure that the net UK carbon account for the year 2050 is at least 60% lower than the 1990 baseline&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/4">The word that we wish to delete is &quot;ensure&quot;, replacing it with the words on the Marshalled List.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/5">The Joint Committee took evidence on this issue&mdash;our comments are in paragraphs 104 to 117 of our report. As said on many occasions and by the noble Lord, Lord Puttnam, who chaired the Committee, this is a unique Bill. When we questioned those who gave evidence on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-16">Wednesday 16 May</phrase> about this duty &quot;to ensure&quot;, we found that it is a unique clause, which has never been used in a Bill before. Mr Wilson, who is a director of Cambrensis and a barrister at its environmental law unit, told us that, in his opinion, the clause might add a little to public pressure and organise public opinion, but he went on to say that:</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/6" class="indent">&quot;it is difficult to enforce it in a conventional way&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/7">Professor Forsyth said that he was unaware of any other example of a Bill,</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/8" class="indent">&quot;concerned with the setting of targets&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/9">In considering our conclusions, the members of the committee discussed how we should try to strengthen the Bill and how we should impose a duty on the Secretary of State or the Prime Minister&mdash;it is still the Secretary of State now&mdash;in a way that is enforceable in law. In his evidence, my noble friend Lord Norton of Louth put it very well. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/10" class="indent">&quot;The problem is not one of target setting, nor of embodying a target in statute, but rather the imposition of a duty to meet a target, the fulfilment of which relies on circumstances beyond the control of the body vested with that duty&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/11">That is the nub of the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.159.1/12">We have a duty that binds the Secretary of State and future Secretaries of State, yet it is practically unenforceable. That is why my noble friend Lord Crickhowell and I have proposed our wording&mdash;in order to put some meat on this important bone. We do not want to dilute the importance of this clause or the importance of the Bill. We want wording that is as equally strong as the word &quot;ensure&quot;, but which also enables the Secretary of State to be held to account in a proper way, rather than through just public opinion or, as the Minister said, in a way that puts pressure on the civil servants through the <I>Ministerial Code</I> and the <I>Civil Service Code</I>. I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-11a.173.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100920" speakername="Lord Teverson" colon=":" colnum="173"  time="018:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71211-0009.htm#07121157000060">
	<p pid="a.173.3/1">We come to targets. The Joint Committee on the draft Bill was aware that the important thing at the end of the day is not to meet a 50, 60, 80 or 100 per cent carbon reduction by 2050 but to address the issue of all the tonnes of carbon that will be put into the atmosphere between now and 2050. That is what affects the climate, not meeting a 60 or 80 per cent carbon reduction by 2050. Although that issue is included in the Bill in terms of carbon budgets, it is very difficult to refer to thousands of tonnes of carbon being put into the atmosphere as a target within the Bill's objective.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/2">We agree that there should be targets but it is important that they should be realistic and that they fulfil the objectives of the legislation. I believe that the 60 per cent target was set by a Royal Commission some years ago. We are all aware that the climate change science and our understanding of how global warming works have progressed hugely since then, and, indeed, since the draft Bill was published earlier this year. The IPCC itself has said that to keep within the limit of 2 degrees centigrade on a global basis we shall probably have to reduce carbon emissions across all nations by some 50 per cent by 2050. We believe that to achieve a fair and equitable solution for developed nations that figure needs to be something in the order of 80 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/3">There are three ways of approaching the 60 per cent target in the Bill. Either we can decide to take out the target altogether and do what the Government suggest later in the Bill, which is to ask the committee to come back in a few months&mdash;I cannot remember the timescale&mdash;to give us a scientific, authoritative, well considered litmus test, as it were, of what we believe the target should be, so that we can agree to that target in due course. Alternatively, we can stay with 60 per cent. Frankly, that is the worst option. Putting in what everyone accepts is the wrong figure would be wrong not only for the United Kingdom but also for our position globally. The third option is for us to put in the figure that we feel is, given that this is not an exact science, most realistic and most likely.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/4">We believe that 80 per cent is the right figure to put in the Bill. To back up my arguments, I quote two prominent Labour Party members. The first is the Prime Minister, who said in his <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-19">19 November</phrase> speech that,</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/5" class="indent">&quot;the evidence now suggests that, as part of an international agreement, developed countries may have to reduce their emissions by up to 80 per cent&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/6">The other is the Mayor of London, who,</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/7" class="indent">&quot;supports an amendment to the Bill to reflect the 80 per cent 2050 target at the very outset&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/8">We believe that it is important to have a target. That target needs to be realistic and the best understanding at this time is that 80 per cent is such a target.</p>
	<p pid="a.173.3/9">The other concern&mdash;this is a correct theme of the Government&mdash;is that the business community, which has to deliver a huge proportion of this commitment, has to have a degree of certainty. However, there is almost a guarantee of uncertainty in the 60 per cent target. Keeping a target until the Committee on Climate Change has been appointed, considered the evidence and come back within the time constraints would actually delay a decision. There is much greater certainty if we go for a realistic and a best figure now. Again, I applaud the Government's wish to lead globally on the targets, but that lead can be preserved only if we have a target of 80 per cent in the Bill now. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.0/1">My Lords, Lord Justice Laws in the Court of Appeal case to which my noble friend Lord Carlile of Berriew has referred said that there had been,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/2" class="indent">&quot;a general and systemic legal failure&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/3">in the treatment of the current 3,000 IPP prisoners. That is a disgrace. I hope that the Minister will acknowledge that.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/4">In opening, my noble friend Lord Carlile said that these were unpredicted results. Indeed, I noted a Prison Reform Trust paper, published on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-31">31 July</phrase> of this year, which said:</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/5" class="indent">&quot;There was no significant debate about IPPs during the progress of the Criminal Justice Act 2003 in parliament. So, it is hard to know exactly what the government's intention was in creating the sentence&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/6">As usual, people have looked at what was said in the Commons. If they debated it at all, I would be surprised. However, it was raised and discussed in your Lordships' House. In particular, on <phrase class="date" code="2003-10-14">14 October 2003</phrase>, at col. 770, I referred to the high cost of the proposed method of dealing with people who had not been properly assessed. I said, first, that it required,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/7" class="indent">&quot;a massive increase in the material required for the sentencing court&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/8">and, secondly, that there would be,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/9" class="indent">&quot;submissions and argument in court about whether there is a sufficient risk of serious harm&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/10">We have heard from the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, that the courts have a presumption that a person is dangerous, so it is on him to prove that he is not dangerous.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/11">I said that the scheme envisaged,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/12" class="indent">&quot;a significant lengthening of terms of imprisonment&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/13">and that,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/14" class="indent">&quot;the cost of extending the Parole Board and its bureaucracy to cope with what would be a massive increase in its workload&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/15">had not been assessed. I referred to:</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/16" class="indent">&quot;The cost of supervising licenses&mdash;presumably by the probation service&mdash;of those released&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/17">and I asked where the money was coming from,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/18" class="indent">&quot;to pay for more court days, more judge time and the increased workload of defence and prosecution lawyers&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/19">and for the cost of building,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/20" class="indent">&quot;new prisons to accommodate those prisoners who will be held for longer, to extend the Parole Board and to expand the probation service&quot;.</p>

	<p pid="a.194.0/22" class="indent">&quot;cutting back on rehabilitation schemes&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/10/03; col. 770.]</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/23">I was supported by the much lamented Lord Carlisle of Bucklow, by the noble Lord, Lord Campbell of Alloway, and by the noble Baroness, Lady Kennedy of The Shaws, who said it was &quot;a scandal&quot; and that the provisions would &quot;ratchet up sentencing everywhere&quot;. My noble friend Lord Carlile, Lord Ackner and the noble Lord, Lord Hylton, all supported my points. What was the Government's response at that time? They said, &quot;It will be alright, don't worry about it&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/24">The first point that was made, I am sure in utmost good faith, by the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, was that it was intended to reduce the pressure on prisons by allowing other people to go. There was to be a greater use of community service and community penalties&mdash;in fact, we now know that community penalties and offenders fined, as a proportion of those convicted, have gone down, according to official figures last year.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/25">The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said that,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/26" class="indent">&quot;by introducing these provisions, it is not the intention of the Government to accelerate or exacerbate the prison population&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/10/03; col. 775.]</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/27">That prison population then stood at 72,000, or 10,000 less than it today.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/28">The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said about rehabilitation,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/29" class="indent">&quot;that the whole thrust of what we have done is to make it clear that every intervention with any individual who comes into contact with the criminal justice system has a meaning. From the moment a person first offends or first appears before the criminal justice service, he or she will have an intervention which will include an opportunity for rehabilitation, restoration and restitution&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/30">That is the basis of the Government's policy at that time. It is obvious that that policy has completely failed. The noble Baroness said that she appreciated that &quot;additional resources&quot; would be needed for probation and that, when offenders were released, they would have,</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/31" class="indent">&quot;a programme that would enable them to make the best use of their release and rehabilitation back into the community&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 14/10/03; cols. 778-79.]</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/32">When one realises the way in which this policy was first promulgated and the reasons that were then made, and then compares it with reality, it is clear that the Government have wholly failed in dealing with IPP sentences. Their policy is, as the noble Lord, Lord Monson, said, that a person should be punished for what he might do. My noble friend Lady Linklater made the same point.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/33">There was a time when the criminal justice system was designed to discover who had committed a criminal offence and to punish him to give him his just deserts. It was hoped that in that process there would be the resources to assist him to rehabilitate himself. Instead, the Government now try to manage future risk possibilities that might occur in relation to individuals in the future. A culture is growing that has moved the criminal justice system away from punishing people for offences that they have committed to trying to control future behaviour, which can be seen in ASBOs, serious crime orders and all the stuff that comes out of the Home Office.</p>
	<p pid="a.194.0/34">If the Government, instead of trying to manage risk in this way, tackled problems on estates at their roots&mdash;as I seem to remember Mr Tony Blair did when he was the shadow Home Secretary&mdash;and put resources into the people on that estate rather than handing out ASBOs piecemeal to offenders, the criminal justice system might not have to carry this responsibility of avoiding risk and we might have less crime in our community. I wait with interest to hear what the Government have to say in response.</p>
