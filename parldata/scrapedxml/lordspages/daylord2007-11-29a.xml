	<p pid="a.1304.4/1" pwmotiontext="asked">rose to call attention to the Government's record on the management and prosecution of sexual offences; and to move for Papers.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/2">My Lords, I am very grateful for the opportunity of holding this debate today, especially during White Ribbon Week and following the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-25">25 November</phrase>. Yesterday the <I>Map </I><I>of</I><I> Ga</I><I>ps</I> document was launched by the Equality and Human Rights Commission and the End Violence Against Women coalition. It sets out geographical maps showing support services for women throughout the UK, or the lack of them. In addition, yesterday the Government issued their response to the consultation document, <I>Convicting Rapists and </I><I>P</I><I>rotecting Victims</I><I>&mdash;</I><I>Justice for Victims of Rape</I><I>.</I> It outlines the measures that the Government will take to further assist victims of rape and that we hope will result in a rise in the conviction rate. I am sure that my noble and learned friend will say a lot more about that later.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/3">The UN definition of violence against women is:</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/4" class="indent">&quot;Any act of gender-based violence that is directed against a woman because she is a woman, or that affects women disproportionately&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/5">It includes rape and sexual violence, domestic violence, forced marriage, stalking, trafficking and sexual exploitation, forced prostitution, crimes in the name of honour, female genital mutilation and sexual harassment. Violence against women is endemic in every country in the world; women can go nowhere to escape it. It acts as a weapon to control women and as a punishment. Rape is used as a weapon of war in many conflicts in the world today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/6">The figures of violence against women make depressing reading. Three million women across the UK experience violence each year. Many more women cope with the legacies of abuse experienced in the past as children or adults. Almost half of women in England and Wales experience domestic violence, sexual assault or stalking in their lifetime. Convictions for rape are falling&mdash;just 5.3 per cent of rapes reported to the police result in a conviction&mdash;but I will say more about that later. Women represent around 85 per cent of victims of forced marriage. It is estimated that 33,000 young women and girls are at risk of female genital mutilation. Other noble Lords will speak about those matters today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/7">The effects of violence against women include physical injury, gynaecological disorders, long-term mental health issues, self-harm and suicide. This violence is also connected with women's social exclusion&mdash;for example, that of women offenders. Histories of violence and abuse often form a pathway into their offending behaviour. Research for the Government estimates that, in England and Wales in one year, domestic violence alone cost &pound;23 billion&mdash;&pound;17 billion is a human and emotional cost and &pound;6 billion is a direct cost to the state.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/8">Violence against women is both a cause and consequence of women's inequality. Under some measures men are more likely to be victims of violence, but it is not usually part of an ongoing or repeated pattern of behaviour as violence against women is. Violence that women experience is usually committed by men they know&mdash;partners, family members, friends or work colleagues. In addition, sexual harassment in public is widespread and contributes to women's fear of crime and whether they feel safe in public places at night. Women are twice as likely as men to be worried about violent crime.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/9">Violence against women is an issue that cuts through all walks of life. Girls and young women are more likely to experience sexual violence. Older women are more likely to be abused by carers than are older men. Women with mental health problems and learning disabilities are particularly vulnerable to sexual violence. Ethnic-minority women face additional barriers to access and support, and experience particular forms of violence such as forced marriage, female genital mutilation and crimes in the name of honour.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/10">Violence against women is a violation of women's fundamental human rights&mdash;the right not to be treated in an inhumane and degrading way, the right for respect for private and family life, and the right to life. There have been many good initiatives by our Labour Government over the last 10 years, and I feel proud of the measures carried out and the laws put in place. Much of that drive has been made by my noble and learned friend the Attorney-General, and I congratulate and thank her on and for all her efforts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/11">The acceptance of violence against women needs to be tackled. An ICM poll commissioned by End Violence Against Women showed that 42 per cent of young people knew girls whose boyfriends had hit them, and that 40 per cent knew girls whose boyfriends had coerced or pressurised them into having sex&mdash;yet there is minimal work with children and young people to challenge attitudes that tolerate violence against women.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/12"><I>Map of Gaps</I>, the document that was published jointly yesterday of which I spoke earlier, has for the first time mapped specialist violence-against-women services across the UK. It shows that for the 3 million women across the UK who experience violence each year and for the many more coping with legacies of abuse, specialist services are essential for their access to safety and justice and their ability to move on with their lives. The document is a useful tool for determining where and what services are required and where more funding and support are needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/13">Most women across the UK have no access to rape crisis centres; and less than one-third of local authorities have any sexual violence service at all. A very small proportion of the UK is currently covered by the existing sexual assault referral centres, though the Government are extending the network. These centres are a place where victims can receive medical care and counselling and assist the police investigation through a forensic examination. There were five centres in 2001, but today there are 19. By the end of financial year 2008-09, there will be at least 36 centres.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/14">Fewer than one in 10 local authorities have specialist services for ethnic-minority women, services which could address forced marriage, female genital mutilation and crimes of honour as well as other forms of violence, or services for women in prostitution. The End Violence Against Women coalition and the Equality and Human Rights Commission yesterday called on national government and local authorities to take urgent action to ensure that there is consistent national coverage and funding of specialised third-sector support services for all women.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/15">Rape is one of the worst offences against women. It is estimated that a minimum of 47,000 women in England and Wales are raped each year. Most rapes are committed by someone the victim knows, often a partner or ex-partner. Up to 95 per cent of rapes are never reported to the police. The number of rape convictions has remained relatively stable, but the number of rapes reported to the police has been increasing year on year. The result has been that the number of rapes resulting in conviction has declined from 33 per cent in 1977 to 7.5 per cent in 1999 and to 5.29 per cent in 2004. Although there is a steady increase in the number of reported incidents, there has not been an increase in the number of convictions. Overall, less than 6 per cent of cases reported to the police in England and Wales result in a conviction, though the figures vary across England and Wales.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/16">I shall take the rape conviction rates for 2004 as an example. The overall figure for all police forces in England and Wales was 5.29 per cent, but in Northamptonshire it was 13.79 per cent; in Cumbria, 12.7 per cent; and in south Wales, 12.18 per cent. Those are the three highest. The lowest three were Cambridgeshire, at 1.75 per cent; Suffolk, 1.6 per cent; and Gloucestershire, amazingly, at 0.86 per cent. The consequence is that men who commit rape in those police force areas know that they will never have to worry too much about being convicted. I do not know why some police areas have a better conviction rate than others, but it would be good to discover why. Perhaps their methods could be used in other parts of the country. The chief constable in south Wales, with one of the three highest conviction rates, is Barbara Wilding, a wonderful woman who works very hard on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/17">While I believe that it is so important to do everything possible to achieve a better conviction rate, I also believe that efforts should be made to try to reduce the number of incidents of rape. In January, Dr Katherine Rake, the director of the Fawcett Society, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/18" class="indent">&quot;More fundamentally we need to change the public debate about rape in which violence against women is often seen as acceptable and victims of rape are frequently blamed or disbelieved. The Government must take the lead in exposing the realities of rape and challenging the myths and stereotypes that surround them&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/19">For example, an Amnesty International opinion poll showed that a third of people believe that the woman who is raped is partially or totally responsible if she behaves in a flirtatious manner or is drunk or wearing &quot;sexy or revealing clothes&quot;. It is an amazing assumption: when a woman is raped, she and not the man is to blame.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/20">How can we change the culture of our society and give a clear indication that violence against women in all its forms is totally unacceptable? One method would be an education programme which starts at an early age and teaches children about respect, including respect, certainly, for girls and women. Good programmes already exist, such as those that have been promoted by WOMANKIND, which has for past three years led research into the prevalence of violence against young women in UK schools and the accompanying attitudes and beliefs. WOMANKIND will tonight be launching its findings and recommendations, and those have important implications for the Government, local authorities and teachers. I look forward to reading the conclusions of that research.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/21">I should like to say a few words about the White Ribbon Campaign. I knew very little about this campaign until recently when, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-25">25 November</phrase>, to mark International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, I was invited to a service in Llandaff Cathedral, where I wore my white ribbon for the first time. The campaign was started by men whose aim is to end violence against women, and the wearing of a white ribbon signifies a commitment never to commit, condone or remain silent about violence against women. Men and boys are asked to wear a white ribbon to show their support, and the campaign encourages men to talk in schools, workplaces and places of worship about the problem of violence. It deserves our support. When men show other men that violence against women is unacceptable, it is a step forward in changing perceptions and attitudes.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/22">I wish to put a suggestion to my noble and learned friend, and I ask her to comment on it in her response. Does she agree that there should be a long-term and sustained campaign to highlight the fact that violence against women in all its forms is totally unacceptable? I am aware that it takes a very long time to change a culture&mdash;but let us consider other campaigns, such as the one to highlight the dangers of drink-driving. That long-term and sustained campaign brought home the dangers of drink-driving to both drivers and victims and people now regard such behaviour as unacceptable. It was the same with the campaign highlighting the dangers of smoking, and there is now a smoking ban everywhere in the UK; but it took many years of campaigning, highlighting the health dangers to smoker and passive smoker alike, to achieve it. One can think of other campaigns that have changed attitudes&mdash;on the wearing of seat belts, for motorcyclists to wear crash helmets, and the recent ban on the use of mobile phones while driving. Those were evidence-based campaigns in which Governments have undertaken over the years to persuade the public that a behaviour is unacceptable because it harms people or damages their health.</p>
	<p pid="a.1304.4/23">The same sort of campaign targeting violence against women could be carried out by central government, the devolved nations and local authorities, and through education at school. It is government, passing laws, who can help change the culture. The Government have a great record on supporting women who suffer sexual and domestic violence: passing laws and setting up institutions to assist and support women victims; ensuring better training for the police and a better understanding of the nature of violence against women. Women have benefited from the Government's actions in the past 10 years, and changes are occurring in society as a result. Although we are still some way from addressing the present culture and attitude towards women and from bringing about a society where all are treated equally, I believe that we are starting to get there. I beg to move for Papers.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-29a.1332.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100352" speakername="Lord Kingsland" colon=":" colnum="1332"  time="013:31:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71129-0006.htm#07112972000244">
	<p pid="a.1332.0/1">My Lords, I too congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Gale, on the persistent&mdash;indeed, tenacious&mdash;way in which she has stuck to her guns on these issues over the years. The House owes a great debt to her.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332.0/2">As your Lordships are all aware, the debate happily coincides with the Government's response to their 2006 consultation on the offence of rape, to which I will turn in a minute. However, it is vital to emphasise, as many of your Lordships have done, that rape is just one example&mdash;although a particularly dreadful one&mdash;of our more general and mounting alarm over the growth of violence against women in our society, of which domestic violence is a significant factor. Indeed&mdash;again, as many of your Lordships pointed out&mdash;a high percentage of rapes are inflicted on victims who are in some kind of relationship with the perpetrator, often a very close one.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332.0/3">We cannot escape the conclusion that much of that growth in violence is explained by changes in our society's culture, often exhibited on television and in films. The media frequently portray young women, principally or sometimes exclusively, as sex objects. This reflects a deep cultural malaise to which there is no short-term solution. Perhaps our best chance of success is in our schools, as the noble Baronesses, Lady Gale and Lady Gould, suggested. They emphasised that respect for women should be a crucial ingredient in children's education. Indeed, my right honourable friend the leader of the Opposition, David Cameron, said on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-12">12 November</phrase> that we would never make progress in this area until we were prepared to teach values in school.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332.0/4">Much has been made of the statistics for rape. It was pointed out by the noble Lord, Lord Elystan-Morgan, among others, that whereas there is a low rate of conviction in the context of reported offences, nevertheless, if you put convicted perpetrators in the context of the number of cases brought to trial, we are talking about a respectable success rate. I have seen different statistics; some have been as high as 50 per cent, some as low as the early 40s. These are by no means unfavourable in comparison to murder, for example.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332.0/5">Rape cases present particular evidential difficulties, as a number of your Lordships have explained, because there are usually no witnesses to the offence and because there is often no forensic evidence that is admissible in court. As noble Lords know, over the past decade there have been a number of substantial changes in our evidential rules. I shall briefly remind the House of what they are. There has been a change in the definition of consent in statutory law. An &quot;honest belief&quot; that consent was available is now replaced by the expression,</p>
	<p pid="a.1332.0/6" class="indent">&quot;no reasonable belief that consent was given&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332.0/7">Parliament has widened the circumstances in which hearsay can be admissible. It has limited the circumstances in which a victim's previous sexual history is admissible in court. It has expanded the circumstances in which evidence of the defendant's bad character is admissible in court, and now we have experiments in pre-trial interviews with witnesses by counsel. Those have made some changes to the conviction statistics, but not dramatic ones.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332.0/8">The Government have come forward with a number of suggestions to which many of your Lordships have referred; I should like briefly to touch on them. I hope that the noble and learned Baroness will not think that my remarks are conclusive of our views, because we must wait to see what proposals the Government come up with. I shall, telegraphically, indicate how we are thinking.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332.0/9">First, I respectfully say to the noble and learned Baroness that we think that the Government are right to leave the issue of capacity to the courts. There has been a recent case that I am sure that she considers helpful. Society would be best served by the development of the concept in the courts rather than trying to set down a rigorous rule in statute.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332.0/10">Secondly, one issue that we have debated today is that of the victim who is reluctant to talk about the event at an early stage, either to her family or to her friends, and equally does not go to the police until a rather late stage. The Government propose that hearsay evidence, at any stage between the act and the prosecution, in principle, ought to be admissible in the proceeding. I assume that the noble and learned Baroness will contemplate adding to that proposal the normal limitation that a judge may in his discretion decide that a particular item of hearsay evidence is not admissible, even in this context.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332.0/11">The third question is that of video-recorded evidence for adults. Again, we are not in principle against that, but the noble and learned Baroness will agree when I say that here, above all, the devil is in the detail. For example, we do not know whether additional questions in chief may be put by the prosecution to the alleged victim in court, or whether the only evidence in chief will be that on video. We do not know when the video recording will be made. Will it be at the time of the alleged victim's first interview with the police, or later? If it comes later, will that be after the CPS has been involved? What role will the CPS have in the preparation of a recording? I am asking these questions because the Government will have to address them before they come up with a statutory provision.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332.0/12">On the final matter, which has received the most attention in your Lordships' House, to introduce what has been referred to as general expert material to dispel myths about rape victims' behaviour, again I am neutral on that until I see what the Government have proposed. I very much take the point made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, about the subliminal factors that might influence the way in which a jury might approach a particular case, which would prejudice it in principle against a conviction. Difficult though it is, I can see circumstances when, if the right sort of document is produced, it could play a constructive role. It would, however, have to reflect prejudices or otherwise against both parties in the litigation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332.0/13">These proposals will undoubtedly increase the conviction rate to, I suspect, only a modest degree. The real difficulty is the period between the reporting of an offence and the conviction. That is where the failure of the system lies. I shall be most interested to hear what the noble and learned Baroness has to say about that in her final remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1332.0/14">Rape crisis support centres have been referred to by a number of noble Lords. I know that noble Lords will agree that they are proving vital in helping women to overcome what has happened to them. But there are far too few of them; and those that exist are undermined by short-term, usually annual, funding, with funding often having to be decided halfway through the financial year. Many of them face the constant threat of imminent closure. We need more of these institutions, and we need to give them the support that they deserve. Among other items in his speech on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-12">12 November</phrase>, my right honourable friend David Cameron, the Leader of Opposition, announced that a Conservative Government, when elected, will replace annual funding decisions with a three-year funding cycle.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-29a.1367.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100255" speakername="Lord Greaves" colon=":" colnum="1367"  time="015:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71129-0011.htm#07112977000153">
	<p pid="a.1367.0/1">My Lords, I, too, thank the noble Lord, Lord Berkeley, for introducing this debate. The noble Lord spoke eloquently of the success and growth that permeate much of the railway in this country. I want to talk about some problems, as other noble Lords have done, but we should not let the problems that exist detract from the fact that there is a real success story at the moment. My noble friend Lord Mar and Kellie said that he had been a train enthusiast for 43 years. I thought; only 43 years! What it is to still have the joys of youth.</p>
	<p pid="a.1367.0/2">I want to talk about some aspects of the north of England. A lot of the growth that has taken place and a lot of the proposed investment as the Government and the industry chase that growth have occurred and are occurring in the south of England, particularly the south-east of England and, as other noble Lords have said, in Scotland, where a different political system has produced a more ambitious approach to rail openings. Not everything in the north of England is gloom by all means. The services to London are now incredible and would have been unimaginable in the days when I used to stand as a train-spotter at Wakefield station. Northern Rail took over a very difficult franchise that was thought to be a basket case and went through an inquiry which many people thought was going to result in a lot of service reductions. However, Northern Rail is really doing quite a good job. The growth in traffic that is taking place in the north of England is a credit to it, as is the improvement in services and reliability. The new TransPennine franchise, against the expectations of many of us, is turning into quite a success, with the fancy new class 185 trains.</p>
	<p pid="a.1367.0/3">Nevertheless, there are still many examples of lack of a joined-up railway and a lack of connectivity, as people might say, partly due to the continued fragmentation of operational services and partly due to the dismantling of large amounts of the railway that took place in the 1960s and progressively in little ways for the 30 years afterwards. I will not talk about the need for a high-speed railway to the north of England; other noble Lords have mentioned that. The two glaring examples where electrification is needed in the north are strategic lines; the Leeds to York line and the Manchester to Preston line, which are an integral part of the east coast and west coast operations&mdash;and they could be far more so if they were electrified, not least as diverting lines. We can dream and look ahead to the future to the electrification of the Settle and Carlisle and what that could do. Not very long ago, we were all campaigning to stop people closing that line down.</p>
	<p pid="a.1367.0/4">On a much more local level, here is an example of a lack of common sense in the operation of services. I often get the 20.30 from Kings Cross to Leeds when I am going home. That has an advertised connection at Wakefield Westgate with the last train to Huddersfield. Time and again, passengers are advised to stay on the Leeds train and take a much longer journey to Leeds, because the Leeds trains are a few minutes late and the Huddersfield train is going to leave on time from the other platform across the station bridge. People sit on the train watching the Huddersfield train set off while they are still on the Leeds train. This last week, people were advised to stay on the Leeds train, and a few enterprising people got out, raced across the bridge and got on the Huddersfield train. Others were sitting watching them do that. It is crackers. It is all to do with the fact that they are under different ownership and because there are tight targets on punctuality. It is the last train at night; that train is not going to hold anything else up. It is just about a lack of common sense in providing the good service that could be provided.</p>
	<p pid="a.1367.0/5">I give another example. On Monday this week, my daughter went to Colne station for the Preston train, on her way to work in Manchester. It should have left at just after seven o'clock, but it did not arrive. There were no indications or announcements on the Tannoy to say that it was not going to arrive. There were 20 passengers waiting at Colne to go to work who had to wait an hour for the next train, because it is only an hourly service. Why? It was because the train had been late getting to the section of line between Gannow junction and Burnley and Colne, an 11-mile single-track siding. Once a train is on it, no other train can get on it for the best part of an hour, so the trains are turned around early. It is madness. How on earth can you persuade people to take the train regularly and not find other ways of travel when that happens more often than it ought to? It seems to happen about once a month. The answer is to reinstate the passing loop at Nelson, where there is an island platform and where, even after they &quot;singled&quot; the whole line from Gannow junction, there used to be a passing loop. It is common sense that that should be reinstated to allow a proper, flexible and reliable service. Otherwise, how on earth do you expect people to use that line to go to work?</p>
	<p pid="a.1367.0/6">Those are just examples of joining up missing links on a very small scale. For the rest of my time, I want to talk about the railway line between Colne and Skipton. Of course, it is not a railway line, because it does not exist. It is a missing link. It was closed down in 1970. Since 2001, when the campaign group SELRAP, the Skipton East Lancashire Railway Action Partnership, was formed, it has had tremendous success; indeed, a number of noble Lords in this Chamber have signed up to the campaign. Some 10 years ago, pretty well everyone thought that the line was a lost cause. It is now being looked at as a serious proposition. If anyone wants to know more, they can Google SELRAP and will find a most impressive website.</p>
	<p pid="a.1367.0/7">It is topical today, because tomorrow in Skipton there will be the official launch of a SELRAP study, commissioned from independent consultants JMP Consulting, into the business case for reopening the railway line. If people tell me that reopening railway lines is not a possibility and a hopeless dream, I merely produce in evidence my noble friend Lord Mar and Kellie, who will wax lyrical, when asked, about the reopening of the line to Alloa, with which he has had something to do. We are talking about increasing patronage of railways by passengers. SELRAP has made its own small contribution to this. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase> this year, a special train called the Missing Link was commissioned by SELRAP to travel from Colne to Skipton. It had to go a long way around and took five hours. It was the subject of a cartoon in the local newspaper, the <I>Colne Times</I>, showing a drawing of a train at Skipton station with the following caption:</p>
	<p pid="a.1367.0/8" class="indent">&quot;We apologise for the 37-year delay to the Colne train. This was caused by vandals removing 11 miles of track&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1367.0/9">I hope that I live long enough to see the service reinstated.</p>
	<p pid="a.1367.0/10">The 70-page report is embargoed until tomorrow, but I have permission from SELRAP to tell noble Lords a little bit about it today. The study was carried out at the suggestion of the Department for Transport and Network Rail, which told the campaigners that if they wanted to have their case taken seriously, they had to produce a business case and feed into the Lancashire and Cumbria Route Utilisation Strategy, which is being prepared and is due to be published next year. It would provide a missing link between central Lancashire&mdash;which the Government think is a city region&mdash;and the Leeds city region. It would provide Pennine Lancashire&mdash;towns such as Blackburn, Accrington, Burnley, Nelson and Colne&mdash;with a link to better rail services to the west to Manchester and to Leeds and Bradford. It would also increase overall trans-Pennine rail capacity. The Northern Way, an organisation which the Government tell us is leading the way in the north of England, has put forward the concept of a Pennine or north of England Crossrail. The idea arises from the need to increase the capacity and amount of trans-Pennine, east-to-west rail traffic in the north of England.</p>
	<p pid="a.1367.0/11">Many of the Government's policies on railways seem to be based on what, in road terms, has been discredited as &quot;predict and provide&quot;. Clearly, if there is increasing rail traffic in some areas, you have to provide for it, but there is also a need to use investment in railways as part of regenerating areas. The regeneration of East Lancashire&mdash;in housing terms, the Elevate area, now branded as Pennine Lancashire&mdash;is absolutely crucial. Reinstating the Colne to Skipton rail service can play a real part in the regeneration of the old Pennine Lancashire textile towns. According to the study, the cost is between &pound;43 million and &pound;81 million, but the cost-benefit analysis suggests that there is real potential. The study mentions a positive cost-benefit ratio for single track reinstatement with potential for a positive cost-benefit ratio on a double track, wider economic and social benefits for employment, new businesses, visitors to the region and to the Yorkshire Dales, and a positive environmental impact with a net reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. I commend the report to the Government and to all your Lordships who are interested in these matters, and we look forward to its launch tomorrow.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-29a.1386.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="1386"  time="016:36:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71129-0013.htm#07112977000244">
	<p pid="a.1386.1/1">My Lords, I intend to come to that point because the noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, asked a similar question about our projected costs. As regards my noble friend's other point about the heavier goods vehicles, there has been a lot of coverage on this and I think there was an article in the <I>Times</I> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-26">26 November</phrase>. There are no plans to allow LHVs in the UK. The Transport Research Laboratory&mdash;one noble Lord also referred to the Heriot-Watt study&mdash;is undertaking a desk study to assess what the effects might be if LHVs were to be committed. That study was commissioned in response to a growing interest within the rail freight industry. However, I reiterate that we have no plans to allow LHVs in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.1386.1/2">I am conscious of the time. I realise that I am running over but I shall comment on oil. The noble Lord, Lord Dykes, gave an interesting historical discourse and made important points about the Channel Tunnel Rail Link and freight. The opening of section two of the CTRL does not threaten its use by freight in any way; in fact it will free up more paths on those parts of the conventional network not currently used by Eurostar. We are in continued consultation on the charging regime for CTRL and that covers passenger and freight operations. There is no doubt that freight operators will continue to let us have their views and that will inform our negotiations and discussions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1386.1/3">The noble Lord, Lord Bradshaw, asked me at Question Time yesterday about the assumptions made on fuel prices that underpin the DfT forecasts. Those assumptions are set out in the UK air passenger demand and CO2 forecast November 2007 report. The forecasts are based on the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform's central forecasts on oil prices. Its forecast is that oil prices will fall from $65 per barrel in 2006 to some $53 dollars per barrel in 2030, with most of the decline occurring from 2012. That is the basis on which those projections are made. Of course, there will be a wide-ranging debate and continued reflection on that and no doubt there will be considerable disagreement too, but that is the model on which we currently base our view.</p>
	<p pid="a.1386.1/4">I shall stop now as I recognise that I have gone on for far too long. However, this has been a very helpful, enjoyable and positive debate. Noble Lords asked many questions. The noble Earl, Lord Attlee, asked me quite a few detailed questions that I have not dealt with. I shall endeavour to put my answers together in a compendium letter which I shall circulate not just to those who asked the questions but to all other noble Lords who contributed to this very useful and positive discussion on the future of our rail network.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-29a.1391.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100279" speakername="Lord Harrison" colon=":" colnum="1391"  time="017:05:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71129-0014.htm#07112977000276">
	<p pid="a.1391.0/1">My Lords, as chairman of the Opposed Bill Committee I start by thanking my four colleagues who sat with me for two days and all the officers who so ably helped us. I also thank the two sponsors of the Bills, who have explained the problems so well from their own experience of their towns. I am pleased to see the noble Lords, Lord Graham and Lord Turner, who will no doubt tell us that as members of the All-Party Group on the Markets Industry they have wide knowledge on this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391.0/2">I also thank the opponents of the Bill and the agents, Mr McGerr and Mr Robert Campbell-Lloyd, for sending information on the Bill even at this late hour. We listened to them carefully, but neither I nor my committee was persuaded by their opposition. One minor recommendation we made was that local authorities should be minded in implementing the legislation to ensure that the officers are well and properly trained in how to advise street traders and in particular pedlars who wish to ply their trade.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391.0/3">The problem, which has been put before us so well, is the consequence of outdated legislation and concerns the distinction between a pedlar and a street trader. The pedlars' legislation is ancient, dating from 1871 and 1881, and addresses the simple idea of someone plying their trade from door to door, hence carrying their wares; whereas a street trader has a pitch with a licence and typically has a stall from which he or she offers goods or services. The definition is now being abused. Street traders are using the cheaper pedlars' licences. These licences are not only cheaper but can be issued in one town and used, in a portable way, across the length and breadth of Britain. Genuine street traders, who pay a lot more for their licences, are restricted in where they can obtain a licence and can set up their pitch only in that one town or city.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391.0/4">The regulation of these two different kinds of trader is enormously difficult not only for local authorities but for the police. I might add that responsibility for licensing pedlars falls to the police but for street traders to the local authorities. That also causes confusion. Alex Chadd, a member of South Wales Police, speaking on behalf of ACPO, believes that there should be reform. The police certainly want to offset their current charge of having to deal with pedlars' licences.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391.0/5">The law is in confusion. I could give your Lordships many of the examples that are so well set out in <I>Street Traders and Pedlars Legislation&mdash;The Case for Reform</I>, which was published by the All-Party Group on the Markets Industry. I am sure that colleagues from the group will speak tellingly of that report. However, I shall give one example in which street traders observed a pedlar essentially setting up as a street trader and called in the police. The policeman concerned was so confused by the law he had to enforce that he said to the pedlar, &quot;Don't move! You stay on that pitch so that when I come back in an hour I can check that you're still there and not doing anything unlawful&quot;. At a stroke of the law he changed him from a pedlar into a street trader, much to the chagrin of the genuine street traders.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391.0/6">There are in this unhappy situation numerous associated problems which have been partly described by the noble Lords sponsoring the legislation. These problems include the issue of faulty or illegal goods and how to acquire a refund. A street trader who has the same pitch from week to week can respond to a dissatisfied consumer or trading standards officer whereas the pedlar is gone the next week and there is no recourse for the consumer seeking fair play. We have countless examples of local authorities such as Portsmouth saying that anything that is done to repeal the 1871 Act will be well received. Attempts to move pedlars on can be labour intensive, and that is an important point. The current system of dealing with pedlars in Birkenhead is so long-winded that it is ineffective. In Southampton, because of the outdated pedlars Act, a considerable amount of the time of police and city centre staff is occupied in bringing offenders to court. In Winchester, pedlars contribute nothing to the local economy but often pass on shabby inferior goods to the unsuspecting public.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391.0/7">The law is ineffective because, as a result of these ancient laws, the fines are too small to inhibit pedlars trading as street traders. There is seldom an opportunity to confiscate goods, a practice which could otherwise be a route to salvation. It is interesting to note that the London Local Authorities Act 2004, which sought to remedy the problem, included provision for confiscation and higher fines that have largely solved the problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391.0/8">Danger is also an issue because of the potential for public disorder concerns. Many noble Lords will be acquainted with the lovely town of York and the narrow street called the Shambles which boasts properly licensed street traders. But it occasionally is a shambles because other pedlars come along to fill the street and make it much more difficult to pass. We sometimes have to be concerned about overloading such streets where markets ought to be operating vibrantly.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391.0/9">As for the current position, there have been a series of Private Bills from local authorities. I chaired the committee considering the eighth and ninth&mdash;so that is nine down. Today, however, I have received information that four more cities&mdash;Canterbury, Leeds and Nottingham city councils and Reading Borough Council&mdash;now want private legislation on street trading. I read out the names to emphasise the fact that major councils feel that they are dealing with a major problem.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391.0/10">The letters that I have received from the Government imply that this is not a matter of great moment. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-05-16">16 May</phrase>, our colleague from the other end of the Palace of Westminster, Dr Brian Iddon MP, attended a meeting specifically called to deal with the pedlar problem in London. Some 40 local authorities attended. I shall furnish the Minister with a list of them if he has not already got one. People do not come down to London for a single-item agenda if they are not already sensitised to a problem which needs to be dealt with. So far we have had piecemeal legislation. One fact that was borne in upon the committee is that it is absurd for committees to sit and deal with this type of legislation again and again only to arrive at the same conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391.0/11">There is a further problem on which the House might like to reflect. The four new cities I mentioned above are large ones, but when the legislation goes through the pedlars will have to move on as they will be prevented from imitating street traders. The effect will be to displace them to smaller market towns. My wife and I rejoice in the market town of Garstang, in Lancashire, and we love to go there on Thursdays. It is only a small town of some 8,000 people, but I can see that the pedlar problem will arise there too. It will have consequences for the police, for instance, who will not necessarily have the opportunities and facilities to reconnoitre the markets, and consequences for trading standards officers. That is why it is imperative that we get on and do something about this.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391.0/12">The committee I chaired recognised not only that the law is in confusion but that costs are involved. We understood that the cost of obtaining an Act for Newcastle upon Tyne, one of the first local authorities to institute legislation, was &pound;200,000. That legislation has been successful in that the pedlars in Newcastle upon Tyne have moved over to Gateshead&mdash;what a waste of public money. The additional costs for the police and the local authority have been well explained by my noble friend Lord Bradley and by the noble Lord, Lord Eden. There are also costs in bureaucracy and as a result of filling the courts that must, with great difficulty, deal with these matters. There is also the cost of Opposed Bill Committees in your Lordships' House. Quite frankly we have better things to do than spend two days summoning QCs to address these issues, especially when we always come out with the same result.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391.0/13">The committee had a reply to its decision from Gareth Thomas MP, on behalf of the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform. The Government allow that there is a problem particularly with pedlars. It is good that we have that understanding. They say that &quot;some&quot; authorities are concerned about this matter. However, I contend that the list I read out, and the growing list of those who wish to seek Private Bill legislation, shows that this is not about &quot;some&quot; authorities but is a nationwide problem. We are told that there are existing powers. However, as the all-party group, noble Lords who have already spoken and I have demonstrated, the existing powers are confused, not well understood by those who are supposed to enforce them and need some clearing up. This is not just about counterfeit and illegal goods, which are a concern, but about the unfairness of having two types of street trader: the pedlar and the genuine street trader.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391.0/14">Astonishingly, the Government tell us that the department needs evidence of these matters on which to base concerns and to bring forward legislation. Surely the series of Bills that comes streaming into the House is evidence enough. The fact that an all-party group is producing well-researched papers on street trading also demonstrates the need, as does the fact that the street traders and the associations that represent them&mdash;NABMA, the NMTF and APMO; I will translate those acronyms for the Minister if he wishes&mdash;have spoken on this, as have ACPO and the ATCM, the Association of Town Centre Management, and the LGA itself. When the Minister says in his letter that there is an absence of evidence and that the case has not been properly made, I contest that all the way.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391.0/15">The Minister also invokes the Rogers review, which supposedly looked at these matters. I suggest, however, that the review deals with enforcement, not with the real problem&mdash;the defunct definition of pedlars and street traders in modern market conditions. I am also surprised that the Rogers review says that the problem, if it is one&mdash;this is what it implies&mdash;has only a low impact on the community. That is wholly understandable, because until there is a calamity of the shambles-in-the-Shambles sort, where things begin to go wrong and there is public disorder, there is not going to be anything else. The case of those consumers who bought something one week at the market and returned the following week to find the bird has flown comes to the attention of the local authority, but all consumers see are market traders of one description or another. It falls to the police, the local authorities and TSOs to ensure that the market is operating properly. The invocation of the Rogers review therefore does not work.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391.0/16">We are now told that the Regulatory Enforcement and Sanctions Bill will help with this problem. I ask the Minister to demonstrate how the Bill will change out-of-date legislation. It seeks only to sweeten the pill that, through the ages, has become a placebo. Mr Ian McCartney, a previous Minister for the DTI, was clearly sympathetic to the cause of having national legislation. He wrote to Pat McFadden MP in the Cabinet Office, who replied that there was a lack of parliamentary time. We are taking two weeks off in addition to our usual work next year. Perhaps we can deal with this legislation in April. That would be successful.</p>
	<p pid="a.1391.0/17">Finally, I make a plea to the Minister. Next week, on <phrase class="date" code="">6 December</phrase>, Dr Brian Iddon will repeat a presentation Bill, as I understand it is called, which follows up the 10-Minute Rule Bill that he offered to the House on a previous occasion. The Minister has argued the case well in the past, and doubtless he will bring fresh information and fresh arguments to the debate in your Lordships' House tonight, but my plea is this: if the Government were to listen, they would allow the presentation Bill in another place to go to a Committee where these matters can be properly debated and all the objections raised in Gareth Thomas's letter can be addressed. Clear legislation, based on the existing nine examples of legislation which are already having some success, can then be devised and brought forward, and we could do something not only for consumers and market traders, but for the well-being of market towns up and down this country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-11-29a.1401.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100334" speakername="Lord Jenkin of Roding" colon="" colnum="1401"  time="018:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71129-0015.htm#07112977000322">
	<p pid="a.1401.4/1" pwmotiontext="asked">asked Her Majesty's Government what arrangements will be made for parliamentary scrutiny of the operation of the new Statistics Board.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/2">My Lords, I am grateful for the opportunity, albeit at a somewhat later hour than I had anticipated, to return to an issue debated in both Houses during the passage of the Statistics and Registration Service Bill, as it then was; it is now an Act. As part of the Government's expressed aim to restore public trust in the statistics system by distancing Ministers from influencing the production and distribution of official statistics, the Act establishes a new Statistics Board, with enhanced powers to promote and safeguard the production and publication of official statistics that serve the public good.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/3">Ministers have also made plain from the start their wish that the board should, instead of reporting to Ministers, be directly subject to monitoring and scrutiny by Parliament. The Act therefore lays a duty on the board to produce each year an annual report on its activities and plans and to lay that report before the UK Parliament and the devolved elected bodies in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. However&mdash;and I say this quite properly&mdash;the Act is silent on the arrangements that each Parliament or Assembly may wish to make. The setting up of committees has traditionally been a matter for each House to decide for itself after discussion between the usual channels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/4">The issue that I wish to bring back to the House this evening is whether the monitoring and scrutiny of the Statistics Board's reports by the UK Parliament should be for another place alone or whether there should be, more advantageously as I would contend, a Joint Committee of both Houses to discharge that function. Noble Lords who took part in debates on the Bill will recollect that at various stages of the Bill's progress that issue was discussed. As the Bill reached us, it was strongly argued in many parts of the House that the Bill did not properly implement the Government's aim of restoring trust. This is not the occasion to rehearse those arguments&mdash;certainly not at this late hour&mdash;except to remind the House of two things. First, we in this House amended the Bill in a number of important respects, all of which were designed to enhance public trust in the system. Secondly, when the Bill was returned to another place, almost all of our amendments were accepted in substance. Even though Ministers had resisted the amendments here, they decided in the event to advise the other place to accept them. Indeed, in one respect they went further. The Prime Minister himself announced a very welcome shortening of the time allowed to Ministers for the pre-release of statistics, for which we had argued long and hard.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/5">That was an admirable example of the revising function of this House. A principal reason for that success was that a number of noble Lords&mdash;and I am glad to see the noble Lord, Lord Moser, in his place this evening&mdash;have a long experience and great expertise in the subject matter of the Bill and they deployed that to great effect in our debates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/6">The argument for a Joint Select Committee of both Houses has actually been acknowledged by Ministers. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-01-16">16 January</phrase> this year, the Minister in charge of the Bill in another place, John Healey, who was then Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/7" class="indent">&quot;I see some merit in the proposal for a Joint Committee of the two Houses, although it is not a matter for me as a Minister. It would enable both Houses' expertise and interest in such matters to be played in, and it would allow their breadth and depth of expertise to play a part in the strong and proper scrutiny of the system&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/8">I could not have put it better myself.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/9">Nevertheless the honourable Member rejected the idea because,</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/10" class="indent">&quot;it would not assist in achieving the overall objectives of the Bill&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, Commons, Statistics and Registration Service Bill, 16/01/07; cols. 67-69.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/11">I found that a very difficult argument to understand.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/12">Perhaps I should say a brief word about Joint Committees. Although most committees of Parliament are set up by the two Houses separately and their roles and purposes can differ markedly, Joint Committees have a long history. That excellent book <I>How Parliament </I><I>W</I><I>orks</I>, by Rogers and Walters, points out that the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments goes back many years. More recently, there have been rather more Joint Committees. For example, there was a Joint Committee on Parliamentary Privilege which reported in 1999 and the Joint Committee on Conventions, chaired by the noble Lord, Lord Cunningham of Felling, which reported in November last year. It is common ground that both those committees earned high praise for the clarity and wisdom that they brought to their respective tasks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/13">Perhaps a closer analogy of what I am arguing for is the Joint Committee on Human Rights. This is an ongoing committee of both Houses and the experience of that committee's work has shown that it is valued by both Houses. It is of relevance&mdash;I say this in passing&mdash;that the then Leader in another place, the right honourable Margaret Beckett, did not announce a Joint Committee on Human Rights until after the Human Rights Bill had received Royal Assent. It is certainly not too late, therefore, for the same to happen with the Statistics Bill, yet I sense that Ministers still seem chary of a Joint Committee on statistics.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/14">One reason for that could be that for some years, statistics have been a Treasury responsibility. A sub-committee of the Treasury Select Committee of another place reported on the subject. However, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase>, that responsibility moves from the Treasury across to the Cabinet Office and the Treasury will no longer be in charge. That was one of the substantial amendments which we argued for and passed in this House and which was accepted in another place. Therefore, I think the argument that this was done by a Treasury committee now disappears. It will have to be another committee. Happily, the noble Lord, Lord Bach, who will reply to this debate, represents both the Treasury and the Cabinet Office in this House, so we are very pleased to see him and there will be no change for him.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/15">But fresh in everybody's minds must be the recent pre-legislative Joint Committees on human tissue and embryos and on climate change. I was very privileged to serve on the former&mdash;the Joint Committee on human tissue and embryos&mdash;and I was very impressed by the different expertise that the Members from each House brought to the task and how they complemented each other. Their expertise was not the same. There was also a distinct reluctance to become involved in anything of the nature of party politics. At the other end there is some grandstanding from time to time in Select Committees, but that does not happen in a Joint Committee. I argue that those are good examples of a Joint Committee and that such a committee would be entirely appropriate to scrutinise statistics. So my own experience has strengthened my view that the committee that will be set up to scrutinise the work of the Statistics Board should also be a Joint Committee of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/16">I wish to refer to two other matters only. The chairman of the Statistics Commission which hands over to the board on <phrase class="date" code="2007-04-01">1 April</phrase>, Professor David Rhind, sent a statement to me yesterday and I have his permission to read it. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/17" class="indent">&quot;The Statistics Commission believes that the success of the new statutory arrangements will depend in no small measure on close scrutiny by a suitable Parliamentary committee. And whilst we recognise that the form of scrutiny is a matter for Parliament itself, any new committee will need to be able to draw on a wide spectrum of relevant knowledge in order to fully engage with a field as all-embracing as official statistics&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/18">I emphasise the words,</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/19" class="indent">&quot;a wide spectrum of relevant knowledge&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/20">I think that is something that we can claim to have in this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.1401.4/21">I mention one other point, on which I end. I can tell the House that after discussions with my noble friends here and in another place, my honourable friend George Osborne, the shadow Chancellor, has agreed to throw his weight, and that of his colleagues, behind the proposal for a Joint Committee. Why cannot Ministers do the same?</p>
