<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2005-07-12a.1034.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="1034"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/50712-14.htm#50712-14_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1034.0/1">Section 8 of the 1993 Act gives the Charity Commission the power to open an inquiry into a charity or group of charities and to publish a report or statement following such an inquiry. The opening of a Section 8 inquiry gives the commission access to other powers under the 1993 Act in respect of the institutions or persons that are the subject of the inquiry. The commission's policy is normally to inform all charity trustees and relevant officers of the decision to open an inquiry under Section 8 of the Act. A standard letter is sent to all trustees on the opening of an inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/2">On the rare occasions when notification to the trustees of an inquiry opening needs to be delayed for a short time, the commission's policy is that this decision is made by a senior inquiry manager and noted on the files. This may be done on the rare occasions when there has been real suspicion of continuing criminal activity, typically fraud or child abuse, and the commission has not wanted to prejudice its inquiry or a possible police investigation. Examples include cases where steps need to be taken to protect assets, where the commission is working in partnership with the police and does not want to alert the charity at that time, or where data protection matters relating to a particular individual need to be resolved before others are notified.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/3">The first part of Amendment No. 35 would require the Charity Commission to open a Section 8 inquiry on reasonable grounds and to communicate those grounds within seven days only to those who are subject to the inquiry. We do not accept the amendment. First, the Bill places the commission under a duty to follow best regulatory practice, which includes the principles under which regulatory activities should be proportionate, accountable, consistent, transparent and targeted only at cases in which action is needed. Therefore the commission must have reasonable grounds for opening a Section 8 inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/4">Secondly, there are circumstances in which it would not be appropriate for the commission to provide notification of the inquiry and the reasons for its decision to open it; for example, in cases where serious allegations have been made which may at some point lead to a criminal investigation and prosecution or the use of the commission's protective powers. In such cases, providing notification of the inquiry to those involved could be entirely counterproductive and hamper the conduct of the inquiry and any subsequent criminal investigation or use of the commission's powers to protect the charity's assets.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/5">The second half of Amendment No. 35 and Amendment No. 48&mdash;to which reference has been made already and which we will debate later&mdash;would mean that those who are the subject of a Section 8 inquiry would be able to append their own comments to the commission's report or statement. On this point I refer your Lordships to the answer that I gave during the previous Session, in Grand Committee on <phrase class="date" code="">14 March</phrase> this year, in response to Amendment No. 135 (<i>Hansard</i>, col. GC 440). Essentially, we do not agree that the amendment is necessary or desirable for the following reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/6">First, it is the commission's normal practice to give persons affected by a Section 8 inquiry the opportunity to make representation to the commission before it finalises and publishes its statement on the inquiry and decides on what, if any, further action is to be taken. However, the commission's statement does not purport to be a consensual summary of the inquiry&mdash;it is the statement of the regulator.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/7">Secondly, the commission has a duty to ensure that the statements it publishes about its inquiries are factually accurate and are not defamatory. As has been discussed at length, the Bill also places the commission under a duty to follow best regulatory practice in performing its functions. This would include the conduct of a Section 8 inquiry and its report of that inquiry.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/8">Finally, anyone affected by an inquiry is at liberty to publish their own account of it, and they would not expect to have to append the comments of the Charity Commission to such an account.</p>
	<p pid="a.1034.0/9">For those practical reasons and, in extreme cases, in order to protect the interests and assets of the charity involved&mdash;and also in the interests of possible criminal proceedings to be taken in the future&mdash;I hope that the noble Lord, Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts, will see the force of our argument and understand why, although in some senses it may appear desirable, his amendment is not acceptable and we cannot take it on board.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2005-07-12a.1043.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100293" speakername="Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts" colon=":" colnum="1043"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/50712-17.htm#50712-17_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1043.0/1">I have an amendment in this group&mdash;Amendment No. 42. However, before speaking to it, I must say that I support what the noble Lord said about his amendments and the timing of the whole matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.0/2">We discussed these draconian powers at an earlier Committee stage of the earlier Bill, on <phrase class="date" code="">14 March</phrase>. I am extremely grateful to the Government for having accepted the spirit of those earlier amendments. Subsection (6) of the new section requires that the,</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.0/3" class="indent">&quot;authorised person must make a written record of&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.0/4" class="indent">(a) the date and time of his entry on the premises;</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.0/5" class="indent">(b) the number of persons (if any) who accompanied him . . .</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.0/6" class="indent">(c) the period for which he . . . remained on the premises;</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.0/7" class="indent">(d) what he . . . did while on the premises; and</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.0/8" class="indent">(e) any document or device of which he took possession while there&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.0/9">Subsection (7) qualifies that by saying:</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.0/10" class="indent">&quot;If required to do so, the authorised person must give a copy of the record to the occupier of the premises or someone acting on his behalf&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.0/11">We wonder whether the wording of the subsection is sufficiently direct. My amendment would rewrite it so that it stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The authorised person must supply a signed copy of the list to the person from whose possession it was taken or who is acting on behalf of the occupier, or where the premises are unoccupied must leave a record on the premises&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.0/13">That would ensure that a written record would not only be made but handed over to the relevant person when entry was made to premises and documents seized. As drafted, the Bill would not require that such a record be handed over.</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.0/14">There is a statutory obligation proposed by the Bill that all the documents removed must be returned as soon as reasonably practicable, and if no proper record of what is removed is handed over there may be uncertainty and difficulties in causing them properly to be returned under this provision. This is of particular concern where the items removed&mdash;computers or disks, for example&mdash;contain information about other organisations or the personal and private business of the owner which could be of no possible relevance to the commission's concern but of considerable importance to the owner.</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.0/15">It is also quite possible that when items are removed, a person, such as a security guard, acting on behalf of the occupier will have no knowledge that they are entitled to ask for a written record of items taken. For all these reasons we believe that it is not merely desirable but essential that there should be evidence of the items removed by the commission, given at the time to the relevant person, so that it will remain properly accountable for its stewardship of the property taken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.0/16">We propose that there should be a provision that a copy of the list should be handed to the person in charge of the premises from which they were removed by the member of the commission's staff responsible for so removing them.</p>
	<p pid="a.1043.0/17">I conclude by saying that we are returning to transparency and accountability. As has been much discussed&mdash;and as indeed the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, said&mdash;the commission's powers are being significantly increased, and an increase in power needs to be balanced by an increase in accountability. This amendment would achieve this balance and I hope that the Government can see the force of it and will be able to accept it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2005-07-12a.1055.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100293" speakername="Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts" colon=":" colnum="1055"  url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/50712-20.htm#50712-20_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.1055.3/1">This is another amendment that we have tabled to try to make clearer and simpler the thresholds at which the need for inspection or examination of accounts kick in. As I argued in Committee on <phrase class="date" code="">14 March</phrase>, in <i>Hansard</i> at cols. GC 457&ndash;58, the Bill provides for a rather complicated double test for a charity to satisfy before it can determine whether it is required by statute to have its accounts audited. That requirement would apply if either,</p>
	<p pid="a.1055.3/2" class="indent">&quot;the charity's gross income in that year exceeds &pound;500,000; or . . . the charity's gross income in that year exceeds the accounts threshold&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1055.3/3">&pound;100,000&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1055.3/4" class="indent">&quot;and at the end of the year the aggregate value of its assets (before deduction of liabilities) exceeds &pound;2.8 million&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055.3/5">The two-pronged nature of that second test seems unduly complicated, particularly when read alongside the first. It seems perfectly sensible that a charity with assets of more than &pound;2.8 million should in any event be required to have an audit, even if those assets are primarily functional assets or for some other reason do not produce high levels of income. Losing assets worth &pound;2.8 million could have an impact on public confidence. The fact that the charity had an annual income below &pound;100,000 would not make any difference to that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055.3/6">The Minister explained the value of the concept of the accounts threshold at col. GC 458 on <phrase class="date" code="">14 March</phrase>, but I felt that it was an inadequate explanation of a threshold that makes only this one fleeting appearance in the Bill. Is the accounts threshold truly necessary considering that there are two other tests concerning, first, the annual gross income, and secondly, the aggregate value of the assets? Surely, the fact that a charity's assets exceed &pound;2.8 million should be a sufficient benchmark to establish whether a charity needs an audit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055.3/7">Members of the Committee might notice that the amendment differs from the one to which I spoke in the earlier Committee, in that it excludes the words &quot;before deduction of liabilities&quot;. That follows a point made by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, who asked in that Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.1055.3/8" class="indent">&quot;Why is the &pound;2.8 million taken before deduction of liabilities? That seems very odd, even bizarre, if you have a land charity with &pound;3 million in assets and a mortgage of &pound;2.5 million&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1055.3/9">The noble Lord, Lord Bassam, replied:</p>
	<p pid="a.1055.3/10" class="indent">&quot;Yes, all right. The noble Lord has floored me. Having heard what I have been advised, I want to drop the noble Lord a note about it. I want to understand the point better as well&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 14/3/05; col. GC 459.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1055.3/11">Our point remains achieving clarity about the thresholds and dividing lines that govern charity law. If you have &pound;2.8 million of assets, there should be a return on it. If you have geared up your assets by borrowing against them, as envisaged by the noble Lord, Lord Phillips, you have assumed implicitly a greater degree of risk. Therefore the need for an audit is not removed&mdash;in fact, it is probably increased. Therefore, the second alternative of the test should be simplified by referring simply to the asset value of &pound;2.8 million, and the reference to income levels in this part should be deleted. I beg to move.</p>
