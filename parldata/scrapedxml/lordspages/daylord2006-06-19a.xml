	<p pid="a.505.2/1">My Lords, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-31">31 May</phrase>, Under-Secretary-General Gambari briefed United Nations Security Council members on his visit to Burma and his meeting with Aung San Suu Kyi. We understand that he requested that the regime should release her and put an end to the violence in Karen state. We support the United States' proposals for a proper discussion of Burma at the Security Council, which we hope will lead to a resolution. Today is her 61st birthday. The Prime Minister has made a statement, and I am certain that all sides of the House would want to wish her well.</p>

	<p pid="a.505.4/1">My Lords, I also deplore the continued detention of Aung San Suu Kyi and the attacks carried out by the Burmese army on civilians in northern and western Karen state. Representations on all those matters were made by my right honourable friend Ian McCartney on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-15">15 June</phrase>. At the moment, my estimation is that there is not support for a binding resolution, but there is, we believe, growing support&mdash; much work still needs to be done on it&mdash;for a non-binding resolution, if we can overcome the objections, in particular, of China and Russia.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-19a.535.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="535"  time="016:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60619-10.htm#60619-10_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.535.1/1">My Lords, before turning to the amendment's deficiencies, I must, on behalf of the Government, respond to one or two of the points made during what I can only describe as almost a Second Reading debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/2">The provisions in Part 1 are based on robust evidence and the management of risk to health from second-hand smoke. Of course, important issues such as personal liberty and the regulation of business have been important in framing this policy. The risk to health, however, is the driving force behind this Bill. That is, ironically, the vital point that the Select Committee on Economic Affairs seems to gloss over in a slightly cavalier fashion.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/3">The evidence of the health risks of second-hand smoke is now extremely well established. The single medical expert that the committee sought evidence from was indeed Professor Sir Richard Peto, who has already been described as a distinguished medical epidemiologist and told the committee in his evidence that:</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/4" class="indent">&quot;The definite statement is that some people are killed by breathing other people's smoke&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/5">The risk level is set out in the two reports of the Scientific Committee on Tobacco and Health, of which Professor Sir Richard Peto is a member. In its 2004 report, the scientific committee concluded that there is an estimated overall 24 per cent increased risk of lung cancer in non-smokers exposed to second-hand smoke and a 25 per cent increased risk of heart disease. As a result, the committee advised that,</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/6" class="indent">&quot;second-hand smoke represents a substantial public health hazard&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/7">It was not just Caroline Flint who said that. She repeated that evidence of a committee, one of the members of which gave evidence to the Select Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/8">A number of noble Lords have, I suggest, rather pooh-poohed the evidence that I tried to set out on behalf of the Government in Committee. The evidence base is recognised not just in this country but internationally, not least by the 168 nations that are signatories to the World Health Organisation's framework convention on tobacco control. The evidence on the risk of second-hand smoke comes from across the world, and has been scrutinised and reviewed in great depth. The literature base is substantial and the WHO's International Agency for Research on Cancer report, <i>Tobacco smoke and involuntary smoking</i>, published in 2004, reviewed all the evidence of the health risks associated with smoking and second-hand smoke. It is over 1,400 pages long. The evidence is absolutely overwhelming, whatever people choose to say.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/9">A number of people, including the noble Lord, Lord Monson, have asked for choice and fair play. The Government are very interested in securing fair play for all those who suffer at the hands of second-hand smoke, such as all those with medical conditions like lung cancer, heart disease, asthma attacks, childhood respiratory disease and sudden instant death syndrome. Those are not myths; they are the facts of life in our country regarding people's exposure to second-hand smoke.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/10">The noble Lord, Lord Wakeham, drew attention to the fact that his Select Committee's report was unanimous. I suppose that most noble Lords would pay tribute to his success as a Chief Whip in the past. I am not altogether surprised that he managed to achieve a unanimous report. He also drew attention, as have other noble Lords, to the fact that public bans on smoking may mean more smoking in the home.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/11">Let me give the House the evidence on that. International experience provides no evidence to support the view that smoke-free legislation will encourage more people to smoke at home; we know that bans encourage smokers to give up or to reduce the number of cigarettes that they smoke, which is a beneficial secondary effect. We also know that seven out of 10 people who smoke say that they want to give up. We have assessed the impact that a ban on smoking in public places would have in reducing smoking prevalence: up to 650,000 people would be affected, which would, thereby, have a beneficial impact of reducing smoking at home. Indeed, evidence from New York suggests that 100,000 people have quit smoking since the ban was introduced there. Recent research, reported by the Royal College of Physicians in the publication <i>Going smoke-free</i> points to a statistically significant increase in the percentage of smokers who banned smoking in their own home after smoke-free laws were introduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/12">Important research was published on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-16">16 June</phrase> in the <i>Irish Medical Times</i>, which reported a household survey that was conducted in Ireland before and after the introduction of smoke-free laws. Before the ban, 58 per cent of people allowed smoking in their homes, but after the workplace legislation came into effect, that figure fell to 50 per cent. The evidence points in absolutely the opposite direction as regards smoking in the home to that stated by a number of noble Lords.</p>
	<p pid="a.535.1/13">Perhaps I can correct the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit, who cited the Chief Medical Officer's failure to take up his suggestion about conducting a study among airline pilots. The Chief Medical Officer has responded that he did not think that that would be helpful, because the research proposed by the noble Lord would not have resulted in a study of a scientific calibre that could be relied on; there were good grounds for not accepting the helpful suggestion from the noble Lord, Lord Tebbit.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-19a.542.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100013" speakername="Baroness Amos" colon=":" colnum="542"  time="016:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60619-12.htm#60619-12_spmin0">
	<p pid="a.542.1/1">My Lords, with permission, I would like to repeat a Statement made by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister. The Statement is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.542.1/2">&quot;With permission, Mr Speaker, I shall make a Statement about the European Council held in Brussels on 15 and <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-16">16 June</phrase>. I would like to thank Chancellor Schuessel and the Austrian Government for their arrangements for the summit and for the way in which they conducted their presidency.</p>
	<p pid="a.542.1/3">&quot;There were two parts to this Council. On the constitutional treaty, it was agreed that there would have to be a further period of reflection, because at present there is no consensus on how to proceed. A Europe of 25, not 15, soon to become 27, and in time enlarged still further, needs a modern set of rules to function effectively. Around 15 states have ratified this treaty, but of course, there have been the No votes in France and Holland. As a result, others, including the United Kingdom, have not proceeded with ratification. The German presidency, in the first half of 2007, will therefore consult member states and present a report to the European Council. Decisions will then be taken by the end of 2008. But it was made crystal clear that, in line with last year's conclusions, there can be no presumption about the outcome of this discussion.</p>
	<p pid="a.542.1/4">&quot;The bulk of the conclusions of the Council, however, deal with the specific issues of most immediate concern to Europe's citizens. One of the key outcomes of a positive attitude towards Europe on the part of Britain was the election of President Barroso to the Commission. I welcome thoroughly his commitment to the Council to transmit direct to national Parliaments all new Commission proposals and consultation papers and to take due consideration of their views. This is an important boost to a long-held British concern over subsidiarity.</p>
	<p pid="a.542.1/5">&quot;In addition, on better regulation, the Commission has already announced the withdrawal of some 70 pieces of legislation. The European Council invited the Commission to report by early 2007 on further progress&mdash;and, in particular, asked the Commission to make proposals by that time on how to reduce administrative burdens on businesses by 25 per cent. This, again, is a central British objective, on which we built alliances with other partners.</p>
	<p pid="a.542.1/6">&quot;On the single market, the Council welcomed the agreement on the services directive; welcomed agreement on the competitiveness and innovation programme; and looked forward to the Commission's forthcoming review of the single market and proposals for completing it. The services directive, in particular, is expected to deliver some 600,000 jobs across the EU and add around &euro;31 billion to the EU economy. I pay tribute to the work of British MEPs from both the Party of European Socialists and the European People's Party in securing the compromise necessary to allow it to pass.</p>
	<p pid="a.542.1/7">&quot;The Council agreed a number of specific measures and initiatives to combat illegal immigration, designed to strengthen borders while improving co-operation with some of the main source countries of migrants and refugees. In particular, the Council agreed to implement regional protection pilot projects to protect refugees in their region of origin and therefore avoid the need for mass migration. We also agreed to intensify work on readmission agreements, so that across Europe failed asylum seekers can be more easily returned.</p>
	<p pid="a.542.1/8">&quot;On energy, another of the Hampton Court initiatives, we welcomed and agreed to take forward proposals for an external energy policy, developed jointly by Javier Solana, the EU's High Representative, and the Commission. One of the priorities will be developing strategic partnerships with the main producer and transit countries, including an agreement with Russia.</p>
	<p pid="a.542.1/9">&quot;The Council also agreed declarations on the western Balkans, Iran, Iraq, the Middle East peace process, Africa, Lebanon and Timor-Leste.</p>
	<p pid="a.542.1/10">&quot;Finally, on climate change, the European Council committed itself to pursuing, in all the relevant multilateral organisations, an international goal consistent with the objective of a maximum global temperature increase of two degrees centigrade above pre-industrial levels.</p>
	<p pid="a.542.1/11">&quot;This was a European Council which focused on the practical policy-driven agenda which the UK has long advocated. It demonstrated yet again the benefits of positive engagement with Europe. I commend the outcome to the House&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.542.1/12">That concludes the Statement.</p>

	<p pid="a.555.0/1">My Lords, this amendment broadly brings the Bill back to the Government's original position, as set out in their consultation document of <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-20">20 June 2005</phrase>&mdash;almost exactly a year ago today. Members of the licensing trade believe that the original scheme was less inimical to their profitability and viability and less inimical to the well-being of their customers, 45 per cent of whom apparently smoke to a greater or lesser degree, than the altered formula in the Bill. Why did the Government change their mind?</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/2">A clue to the Government's reasoning emerged in Grand Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2006-04-24">24 April</phrase>, when the Minister extolled the desirability of ensuring &quot;consistency with Scottish legislation&quot;. Why should there be such consistency? After all, just a few moments earlier the Minister had spoken of the desirability of allowing the Welsh to make their own decision on what precisely constitutes &quot;enclosed&quot; and &quot;partially enclosed&quot; spaces. Why are the English, alone in the United Kingdom, treated in such a cavalier fashion by this Government, or, perhaps I should say more accurately, in such a Cromwellian fashion?</p>
	<p pid="a.555.0/3">If the Government are unwilling to accept this amendment, will they, as an alternative, consider accepting my Amendment No. 46&mdash;we are likely to come to it next Monday&mdash;which provides for the regulations to be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure? Technical though they may be, too much is at stake both in terms of the continued viability of many licensed premises and the comfort and well-being of literally millions of their customers to allow these regulations to be nodded through under the negative procedure.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-19a.567.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100207" speakername="Lord Faulkner of Worcester" colon=":" colnum="567"  time="018:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60619-19.htm#60619-19_spnew5">
	<p pid="a.567.1/1">My Lords, it will not surprise your Lordships to know that I oppose this amendment. I hope very much that the House will reject it. I should declare my interest as a trustee of the Roy Castle Lung Cancer Foundation. As many of your Lordships are aware, Roy Castle was a much loved and popular entertainer who contracted lung cancer from the effects, so he and his widow believed, of working in smoky pubs. He never smoked, but he contracted lung cancer and tragically died of it. When he set up the Lung Cancer Foundation, he was determined that as much as possible should be done not only to treat people who are diagnosed with lung cancer, but also to persuade people that others should not die in the same horrible way as he did.</p>
	<p pid="a.567.1/2">We are not talking about a small section of the British community&mdash;the private membership clubs. As my noble friend Lord Pendry pointed out, there are something like 20,000 of them. An estimate was given by a Conservative MP on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February</phrase> that the number of employees who work in those clubs is 165,000 or more. That was not denied by the Secretary of State, so we can imagine that it is a realistic figure. Clubs are not run by one or two volunteers in country areas. They are serious places of employment. In many localities, they are run alongside the local pub, wine bar and restaurant.</p>
	<p pid="a.567.1/3">We must bear two things in mind. First, taking account of the debate that we had on the earlier amendment and the very decisive decision that your Lordships took about the risks of second-hand smoke and the undesirability of maintaining smoking in restaurants and pubs, as well as the provision for private areas for smokers, we must ask whether we have a right to say that that law does not apply to private members' clubs. My noble friend Lord Rosser alluded to a number of examples where the law naturally applies to private members' clubs. The House is indebted to the noble Lord, Lord Lester of Herne Hill, for pointing out the excellent work that he did to ensure that our race relations legislation applies equally to private members' clubs. I only regret that the Private Member's Bill that I introduced in your Lordships' House to eliminate sex discrimination in private members' clubs did not get passed in the other place. However, I remind noble Lords that it went through your Lordships' House.</p>
	<p pid="a.567.1/4">The main issue is whether employees are entitled to protection. The special nature of clubs was the basis of a letter that I received from the secretary of a clubs trade association, which said that they are special places and deserve a special place in British society. Up to a point that may be so. However, is anyone suggesting that if a club is infested with asbestos, the club management can say to the people who work there, &quot;Don't worry about this; you do this at your own risk and we will not allow the normal health and safety legislation to apply to you when we ask you to take it out&quot;? Of course, we would not do that. Given that your Lordships are clearly of the view that second-hand smoke is dangerous, the protection of workers in clubs is also important.</p>
	<p pid="a.567.1/5">My noble friend Lord Pendry referred to the Labour Party election manifesto. At the end of last week, he was kind enough to write to us on these Benches drawing our attention to that letter. I suspect that some of my colleagues were a little surprised to discover on reading Friday's Guardian that the organisation and circulation of that letter had been funded by the Tobacco Manufacturers' Association, which is not a body one normally associates with Labour Party policy. But, if we put that to one side for a moment, the party manifesto needs to be addressed. The noble Lord, Lord Pendry, was right to refer to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.567.1/6">The House must take account of what the Government did once they had been re-elected and once they had decided to embark on legislation on smoking and health. They had already given a commitment that they would consult on these provisions, and they consulted over the course of last summer. This test of public opinion, I would stress to your Lordships, is crucial. Fifty-seven thousand people responded to that consultation. According to the Department of Health, the vast majority of them&mdash;four-fifths&mdash;called for the proposed policy in the Labour Party manifesto to be changed to a complete ban on smoking in all enclosed public places and workplaces. The Department of Health added that the vast majority of those responding believed that, as membership clubs are workplaces, there should be no exemptions.</p>

	<p pid="a.569.7/1">My Lords, that more or less brings me to the end of what I want to say. The outcome of that consultation was the vote in the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-14">14 February</phrase>. There was a majority of 384 to 184, and 276 Labour Members of Parliament&mdash;all of whom had been elected at the May elections, all of whom perhaps can be regarded as the guardians of the manifesto&mdash;voted for it. They outnumbered the &quot;Noes&quot; on the Labour side by five to one. I hope we will have exactly the same result in this House if this goes to a Division today.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-19a.570.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100670" speakername="Lord Warner" colon=":" colnum="570"  time="018:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60619-20.htm#60619-20_spnew9">
	<p pid="a.570.1/1">My Lords, I was so taken aback by the support for the Government of the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, that I almost dozed off. I apologise.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.1/2">Amendment No. 5 would reinstate the possibility of exempting membership clubs from the smoke-free provisions, as a number of noble Lords have said. I have to remind noble Lords that the issue of whether or not private members clubs should be exempt from the smoke-provisions was the subject of a free vote at the Report stage in the other place. The clear view that was expressed there was that private members clubs&mdash;and, of course, other licensed premises&mdash;should be treated in the same way as other public places and workplaces. On the first vote, the majority in favour of extending the ban to membership clubs was 200; on the second vote on whether the ban should extend to membership clubs and all other licensed premises the majority grew to 284. In short, the House of Commons took the view that the legislation should go further than the position in the Labour Party's manifesto in the interests of the public health.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.1/3">I am not trying to disguise that fact. That was the decision that was taken in the other place. It is the Government's firm view that that was the right decision, both in terms of public health and in reflecting public opinion.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.1/4">A number of noble Lords have referred to the issue of why the situation changed. My noble friend Lord Faulkner cited the change in public opinion reflected in the post-election consultation. We have always said as a government that we would listen to public opinion on the smoke-free provisions in the Bill. That is why we offered a public consultation after the election. Our original proposals offered a balance between minimising the risk to workers and non-smokers whilst retaining some places for smoking. However, as I said earlier, we listened to many different views inside and outside Parliament and the growing opinion in England in support of a more comprehensive set of measures.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.1/5">At the time when the Labour Party's manifesto was drafted, public support for smoke-free pubs and bars was not as strong in England as to warrant comprehensive legislation. It was, as I think a number of noble Lords have said, both today and at the Committee stage, about 50 per cent in favour of a ban. A large majority of the population in England now support a law to make pubs and bars entirely smoke free. While only about half the population supported entirely smoke-free pubs and bars in England April-May 2004, in under two years&mdash;that is, by the end of 2005&mdash;that proportion of support for a complete ban had risen to two-thirds and looked as though it was continuing to rise.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.1/6">It shows great credit that the Government are prepared to listen to that changing mood on something which a number of noble Lords in this House have said is about culture. The culture of public attitude is changing on this issue. I accept that it may not be changing in one or two places in this House quite as quickly as public opinion, but it is changing in this particular area. The other place voted to create a level playing field in the hospitality sector both in economic terms and, importantly&mdash;as a number of noble Lords have said&mdash;in terms of protecting the health of workers and patrons.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.1/7">As the noble Lord, Lord Walton, made clear, this amendment would create unfair competition for a large section of the hospitality industry. All pubs, bars and restaurants would have to become smoke-free, while the membership club next door could continue to permit smoking. Private clubs with bars frequently compete with pubs in their local area. It is understandable then that the pub trade is strongly opposed to this amendment. In an editorial on <phrase class="date" code="2006-01-26">26 January</phrase>, the Morning Advertiser&mdash;the newspaper of the pub industry&mdash;recommended that,</p>
	<p pid="a.570.1/8" class="indent">&quot;the 20,000 members clubs in England and Wales must operate on the same lines as our pubs. If they do not, the Government will have created an explosive situation that could tear communities apart in many regions of the country. The trade must now switch its focus to persuading the Government that only a total ban is fair&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.1/9">The amendment would also result in disparities in protection from second-hand smoke for workers or patrons in membership clubs compared with those in other hospitality venues. Work in a membership club is similar, if not identical, to work in other hospitality venues. That is the reality of the position in most clubs, as a number of noble Lords have correctly identified. Yet this amendment would mean that a person working behind the bar in a membership club would be expected to breathe hazardous second-hand smoke while a person working behind the bar in a pub would be protected under the law. That is the situation that we would create if we passed this amendment. I know which side of the argument I and the rest of the Government want to stand on.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.1/10">In a press notice on <phrase class="date" code="2005-10-27">27 October 2005</phrase>, the British Institute of Innkeeping stated that the pub trade,</p>
	<p pid="a.570.1/11" class="indent">&quot;strongly opposes the proposal that members' clubs are exempt from the ban. If the basis for banning smoking is to protect staff working in licensed premises, those working in members' clubs deserve the same protection. Allowing smoking in members' clubs would lead to a migration of drinkers from local pubs into the members' clubs, which could essentially become smoking clubs. This loss of custom to small licensed premises could drive them out of business&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.1/12">That is the industry and not some nanny state speaking on these issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.570.1/13">The Bill will ensure a level playing field for the hospitality industry, equal protection from harm for all workers in the hospitality industry and consistency with smoke-free legislation in Scotland. A bit of consistency in that area is no bad thing.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-19a.592.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100680" speakername="Baroness Whitaker" colon=":" colnum="592"  time="020:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60619-26.htm#60619-26_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.592.0/1">My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, has done a service to the governance of the UK as well as to many African states in calling attention to this excellent report. I declare an interest as a member of the Executive of the Africa All-Party Parliamentary Group, and of the Advisory Council of Transparency International (UK), the anti-corruption charity.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/2">The report distinguishes between grand corruption and petty corruption, which states themselves have to grapple with. They are increasingly doing so, as the noble Lord, Lord St. John, said: such as the state-funded Nigerian Government's Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control, bravely rooting out fake, often death-dealing, corruptly purchased medicines; and the new Liberian President, Ellen Johnson Sirleaf's code for the civil service, aimed, with legal penalties, at rooting out the corruption which she described two weeks ago in London as &quot;pervasive throughout&quot; her society. We can support this with measures such as the Private Member's Bill on reporting and transparency, which I hope to introduce shortly.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/3">Grand corruption, of the sort that loots national infrastructure budgets and puts the revenues of national assets into the pockets of powerful individuals, is not a matter of the internal culture of the suffering country alone. Bribery on this scale needs an, invariably foreign, investor/contractor, as well as a local recipient. John Githongo, the distinguished Kenyan former Permanent Secretary of their anti-corruption department, in a very interesting speech on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-08">8 June</phrase>, described the nourishing of this corrosive evil as,</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/4" class="indent">&quot;embedded corruption networks engineered mainly during the Cold War&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/5">when&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/6" class="indent">&quot;the West supported some of the most corrupt and oppressive regimes on the continent&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/7">It was to deal with this that the main international rules were developed. The UK has signed up to most of them and it has moved positively, after complaints, to improve the Export Credit Guarantee Department's anti-bribery and corruption procedures last March.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/8">But there is not a clear message at all about what our anti-corruption legislation consists of. The law is piecemeal and unsatisfactory; the Government's previous attempt to draft a Bill&mdash;the scrutiny committee which I was privileged to sit on&mdash;was, sadly, confusing and missed the point about overseas corruption. I hope the current consultative process will take account of all the points raised. Very many responsible companies know how to keep their house in order ethically. Those of us who read the interesting debate last week about London as a financial centre might have been struck by how crucial the culture of trust and shared values was to the original development of the City and how important it is now, as the noble Lord, Lord McNally, emphasised.</p>
	<p pid="a.592.0/9">I do hope that the Government will accept the report's proposed amendment to the Company Law Reform Bill, which all our honourable friends are minded to move to close a significant loophole against money-laundering. But even more, I hope they will take the heaven-sent opportunity of a draft Bill&mdash;which business can understand and operate, and which is stimulated by the scrutiny committee's report&mdash;and which the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, is fortunately to take forward. For while the Government delay, millions suffer and many die, because of corrupt acts carried out by rich companies with impunity, including British ones. Our part of the bargain with the developing states, whose better governance we solicit, must be to reduce substantially corrupt behaviour by UK companies.</p>

	<p pid="a.598.0/1">My Lords, I, too, am grateful to the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, for securing today's debate and giving us an opportunity to discuss the very fine report from the Africa All-Party Parliamentary Group, <i>The Other Side of the Coin</i>. I am delighted that it has been so well received. In fact, this evening feels rather like a meeting of the AAPPG.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/2">The report of the Commission for Africa began with an Igbo proverb:</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Not to know is bad. Not to wish to know is worse&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/4">In Africa, in international institutions, and certainly in the UK, we know there is a huge global problem relating to corruption. We know that, and I quote my right honourable friend the Prime Minister,</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/5" class="indent">&quot;The corrosive effect of corruption undermines all efforts to improve governance and foster development&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/6">Most importantly, this Government accept their responsibility to support African Governments in their battle against corruption. I must refute the allegation made by the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, about the lack of political will. The Government have shown extraordinary political will in their fight for Africa and against corruption in Africa. It is also good to hear reports from the noble Lord, Lord St John of Bletso, that the tide is turning in some countries in Africa. However, I tend to agree with the noble Baroness, Lady Rawlings, that the situation is extremely depressing.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/7">The UK took a lead in ensuring that addressing poverty in Africa was a priority during its G8 presidency, and that G8 leaders made commitments to address corruption at the Gleneagles summit. As noble Lords have clearly demonstrated, the consequences of international and domestic corruption for poor people in poor countries are devastating. The costs to exchequers are extraordinary, as outlined by the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, as are the human costs, but it also creates a blight on investment and public sector development and holds back economic growth. That is why DfID supports a wide range of governance reforms to prevent, detect and take action against corruption. It is why in his speech, &quot;Development Beyond Aid&quot;, at Chatham House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-23">23 February 2006</phrase>, my right honourable colleague the Secretary of State for International Development highlighted global corruption as one of the key themes of the upcoming White Paper on international development.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/8">The recommendations of the AAPPG fall into three broad categories: those where the Government are already working towards implementation; those where action plans are currently being developed and will be announced in the near future; and those where significant further work is required to determine how best to address the issues. The vast majority of the recommendations fall into the first two categories, and we warmly welcome the way in which the report raises awareness and provides an impetus for action.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/9">Sadly, it is not possible in this all-too-short debate to comment on all recommendations in detail, so I will concentrate on the six headline recommendations and answer as many questions as possible. The suggestion of the noble Lord, Lord Avebury, that there should be a longer debate is a matter for the usual channels, but I would support that.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/10">The first recommendation calls on the Government rigorously to enforce existing laws and sanctions against international bribery and money laundering. We have strengthened our enforcement framework and, I assure noble Lords, that we are firmly committed to enforcing those laws. The Serious Fraud Office now leads on vetting, monitoring and investigating allegations of overseas bribery. The Crown Prosecution Service has been restructured and now includes a fraud unit, staffed by specialist prosecutors, which is likely to be in charge of future files involving overseas bribery.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/11">Like the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, we agree that we need to do more, but I stress that currently there are cases moving through the long and complex legal processes. For example, Joshua Dariye, the governor of Plateau State in Nigeria, had his UK-based assets seized in December last year. We are making efforts to return them to Nigeria and his appeal is in progress. Indeed, there are 35 overseas bribery allegations currently being vetted to see if there is sufficient evidence to open a case and there are 13 active investigations in England and Wales and one in Scotland.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/12">The second headline recommendation is to bring a new anti-corruption Bill before Parliament before the end of this year. The Government agree that the law of bribery is in need of reform. That is why, in December last year, we issued a consultation paper setting out options for reform. Most of the respondents seem to have taken differing views, but shortly we hope to publish a response covering all the comments received.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/13">Bribery is a hard crime to pin down in a way that balances the interests of all stakeholders, as previous attempts to reform the law have shown. The AAPPG's views will be taken fully into account along with the views of other stakeholders, and of course the views expressed by noble Lords this evening. The noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, and my noble friend Lady Whitaker mentioned the Bill recently introduced by my honourable friend Hugh Bayley in another place. Of course, that is being studied closely and it will be taken account of in the Bill to which the Government remain committed. These are complex issues and we have to get them right; we have to ensure that the Bill is workable in the courts, which is why the process is perhaps taking longer than many noble Lords would wish.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/14">I am grateful for the offer, or the suggestion, from the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, that he should table a Private Member's Bill in the Lords. I can assure noble Lords that the Government are committed to introducing a Bill. They are carefully considering a plethora of views that have been presented. We want to continue building a consensus around a new Bill. However, ultimately it will be up to the noble Lord whether he brings forward his own Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/15">The third recommendation calls on the Government to implement the third European Union money laundering directive before December 2007. The Government are confident that we will implement the directive by December 2007, and a consultation document on our proposed implementation will be published shortly. The directive provides for a co-ordinated EU-wide approach to tackling money laundering and terrorist financing, and requires banks to perform enhanced due diligence for non-domestic politically exposed persons. I am pleased to report that UK banks are already taking steps to implement these requirements.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/16">My noble friend Lord Lea spoke of the international framework. As the report made clear, this is a global problem which requires a global response. That is why we are working within the context of the G8 and OECD. The context works. For years, we advocated in the OECD development assistance committee that development agencies must influence their governments, and that is now widely accepted. A couple of weeks ago, in the same committee, we took a strong lead in advocating that all donors try to influence their governments to address supply-side corruption, and we trust that that will work in the same way.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/17">In relation to international tax treaties, the OECD has recently started an initiative on them, and I will seek to find out more information for my noble friend.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/18">The noble Lord, Lord Avebury, suggested that we should work with the African Union so that it can provide assistance and guidance to those African countries that wish to sign up to and implement the African Union convention against corruption and the UN convention. That seems to be a very sensible idea, and I will certainly take it back to the department. However, it might also be something that we should discuss with colleagues in the European Parliament in view of the fact that the AU receives substantial funding from the EU.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/19">The fourth recommendation was that we,</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/20" class="indent">&quot;Ensure that Crown Dependencies and Overseas Territories deal with corruption . . . as robustly as the UK&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/21">is problematic in tone. That is because it does not fully recognise the complexity of the constitutional arrangements between the UK and those territories. The UK overseas territories are aware of the threats posed by money laundering and corruption and the risks they carry for the reputation of their economies. The Government will continue to encourage them to counter those threats and ensure that they have robust legislation in place, in particular on financial regulations, as well as adequate enforcement capacity, and to put relevant international agreements into force. Where possible, we will offer practical help.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/22">The fifth recommendation calls for Government to,</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/23" class="indent">&quot;Report to Parliament annually on international development spending&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/24">As noble Lords will be aware, Tom Clarke's Bill, which I am delighted to say has completed its passage through the other place, will require us to report not only on aid, but also on how other issues affect development. I look forward to the Bill's Second Reading on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-29">29 June</phrase> when it will be introduced by my noble friend Lady Whitaker.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/25">The sixth recommendation calls for the appointment of an anti-corruption champion. We fully agree that there is a need to improve policy coherence between the large number of government departments and agencies whose work is associated with international anti-corruption and money laundering. We further agree that there should be clear responsibility for co-ordinating policy coherence and implementation across Whitehall. The strategy for realising this recommendation is currently being discussed by Ministers, but I am optimistic.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/26">Several noble Lords quite rightly raised the issue of China. China has ratified the UN Convention Against Corruption and that, together with domestic auditing reforms, shows that China is interested in discussing good governance. The Government are committed to joining international partners in a dialogue on corruption.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/27">In relation to the Company Law Reform Bill, I will respond in writing and send a copy of my letter to all noble Lords who have participated in this debate.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/28">The matter of Nigeria and the Abacha money was raised by my noble friend Lord Lea. No money has been returned to Nigeria from the UK, although some assets are currently restrained under a civil order. It is unlikely that significant funds remain here. Evidence supports the view that the UK was used as a transit route, rather than as a deposit, for most of the money. The UK stands ready to assist any international partner, including Nigeria, with requests for mutual legal assistance in accordance with our domestic law and in line with our international obligations. There is a UK initiative to provide mutual legal assistance training to Nigerian personnel to assist them in making requests, and the Home Office played a leading role in a recent training seminar in Abuja.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/29">In relation to the case of a solicitor alleged to have carried out a corrupt act in Nigeria, it would not be appropriate for me to comment on individual cases. The Government's consultation paper of December 2005 made a proposal to enhance the powers of the Serious Fraud Office to assist it in investigating allegations of bribery overseas so that they can be cleared up.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/30">The AAPPG is to be warmly congratulated on the publication of <i>The Other Side of the Coin</i>. It draws attention to the scale of the challenges, makes a set of complex issues accessible and will act as a catalyst for further change.</p>
	<p pid="a.598.0/31">The Government's response to the report will of course be published in the near future. I regret that it has taken some time, but, as the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, acknowledged it is a cross-department responsibility. <i>The Other Side of the Coin</i> has already been influential in shaping the global corruption aspects of the White Paper. I am confident that many of the concerns expressed today will be alleviated when the full extent of the Government's commitment on those issues is made known. Like the AAPPG and noble Lords who have participated today, the Government remain committed to Africa and to tackling corruption, which is a critical obstacle to its development.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-19a.606.4" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100435" speakername="Lord Monson" colon=":" colnum="606"  time="021:00:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60619-29.htm#60619-29_spnew4">
	<p pid="a.606.4/1">My Lords, I, too, agree with everything the noble Earl, Lord Howe, said and essentially with everything the noble Lord, Lord Stoddart of Swindon, said, which is why I added my name to Amendment No. 11. I must make one correction, however. The noble Lord, Lord Stoddart, said that the Deputy Prime Minister had said that 20,000 people a year die from exposure to traffic fumes. The Deputy Prime Minister said it six years ago, backed up by his department. Actually, 24,000 people a year die prematurely from exposure to traffic fumes and industrial pollution. That vastly exceeds the most exaggerated estimate of the number of people who die each year from passive smoking.</p>
	<p pid="a.606.4/2">I should like to give an example of how illogical the clause is. Let us take two small plumbing firms. The first is a one-man band, and the one man in question is a smoker. He will be allowed to smoke wherever and whenever he wants in his white man&mdash;or a van sprayed any colour of the rainbow. The rival firm is a two-man partnership, but both partners are smokers. They both smoke, let us say, roughly 20 a day. However, they are not allowed to smoke in the firm's van, white or otherwise, even if they are not travelling together, unless the Government are prepared to accept the noble Earl's amendment. For example, if the arrangement is that Bill goes out on calls on even-numbered days of the month leaving Jack to take care of the office, the telephone and so forth and the position is reversed on odd-numbered days of the month, it would still be theoretically illegal, although of course totally unenforceable since the Government appear to be claiming that tobacco smoke is so deadly&mdash;it is not only tobacco smoke because, as we learnt in Grand Committee, herbal cigarettes are now deemed by the Government to be almost as deadly&mdash;that it would poison the car for days afterwards rather like sarin in the Tokyo underground system.</p>
	<p pid="a.606.4/3">If that were really so, one would have to ban smoking in hire cars. Firms which rent out cars may request their clients not to smoke, and some do, but most do not. However, they would have to ban smoking in those cars and even in hotel rooms, because hotel rooms are much less well ventilated than cars. As the noble Earl said, cars are automatically ventilated when people open the doors and windows.</p>
	<p pid="a.606.4/4">The noble Earl, Lord Howe, talked about the necessity of workable and credible legislation. The utterly disproportionate overkill represented by the clause as it stands brings the law into ridicule and contempt, which cannot be desirable from anyone's point of view.</p>

	<p pid="a.614.1/1">My Lords, I will not keep the House very long. The Minister has done his best to answer all the questions, but I fear that he and I are poles apart, and it is a dialogue to the death as far as we are concerned. I believe that the clause is wrong; it is wrong in principle, it is completely unworkable and it will bring the law into disrepute. Only time will tell which of us is right; but I guess that it will come down in my favour.</p>
