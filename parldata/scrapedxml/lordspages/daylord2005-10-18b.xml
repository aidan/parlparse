<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2005-10-18b.682.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100623" speakername="Lord Swinfen" colon=":" colnum="682"  time="015:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51018-05.htm#51018-05_spnew1">
	<p pid="b.682.3/1">My Lords, the purpose of the amendment is to require the Charity Commission to publish with its inquiry reports the agreement or otherwise of the affected parties. The proposal is necessary because the commission's reports are often very one-sided and leave a burning sense of injustice in the people referred to in the reports, giving them no opportunity to refute unbalanced information. In too many of the commission's cases, the victims have suffered unjust treatment and then have had to further suffer a one-sided account published on the Charity Commission's much-visited website where it remains, I understand, for two years.</p>
	<p pid="b.682.3/2">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-12">12 July</phrase>, at col. 1054 of <i>Hansard, </i>I quoted the Minister as saying that anyone affected by an inquiry is free to publish his own account of it however he wishes. That is of course true, but I do not believe that it is good enough. The Minister also said that maligned trustees would already have had the opportunity to put evidence to the commission during an inquiry. So they would, but that does not help them to feel better if the commission publishes a one-sided account justifying its own behaviour. The Minister added that the trustees were asked to comment on the draft before it was published. That is true, but they are often given only a few days to comment on a document that has taken months to prepare and are confined to commenting only on factual content. They may well feel that the playing field is tilted towards the vertical.</p>
	<p pid="b.682.3/3">I have seen a recent case in which an inquiry was closed, but the charity, its lawyers, and its trustees were not told. I understand that the Charity Commission prepared a report on the charity on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-11">11 February</phrase> that was not sent to the charity until <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-13">13 July</phrase>&mdash;at any rate that is the date on the covering letter. It was received by first class post on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-15">15 July</phrase>, with the reply to the report required by <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-25">25 July</phrase>. That allowed, as there were two weekends in between, a pure six working days for it to arrive not by <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-25">25 July</phrase> but on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-25">25 July</phrase>. Really that gave only five working days if one was to take first class postage into account as guaranteed by Royal Mail.</p>
	<p pid="b.682.3/4">Bearing in mind that many people, trustees included, can be away for a fortnight at that time of year on holiday, that is not good enough, and it is not fair and reasonable. It is because of that cavalier attitude of the commission that I move the amendment. I hope that noble Lords will agree it. I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2005-10-18b.684.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100038" speakername="Lord Bassam of Brighton" colon=":" colnum="684"  time="015:14:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51018-05.htm#51018-05_spnew3">
	<p pid="b.684.0/1">My Lords, the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, has steadfastly raised the issue at every stage of the Bill's progress, and I congratulate him on his persistence in arguing the case. I gave the Government's clear view on the amendment, as the noble Lord said, when we last discussed the amendment on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-12">12 July</phrase>, as recorded at col. 1054.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.0/2">For the benefit of those who were not in the House on that occasion and who have not had the opportunity to peruse <i>Hansard</i> I will briefly reiterate our case. First, it must be understood that anyone who does not agree with all or part of an inquiry or report published by the commission is, as I have made plain and as the noble Lord has also explained to the House, entirely at liberty to publish their own account. Secondly, trustees have the opportunity to express their views to the commission throughout the course of any inquiry that is conducted. Finally, the commission routinely sends inquiry reports to persons affected for comments on factual issues.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.0/3">The commission has a statutory duty to undertake inquiries, and the inquiry report reflects the commission's view and the commission's conclusions. It is entirely right to express those views and draw conclusions from its own inquiry. It is a neutral body and is entirely independent. It does not take sides in inquiries but aims to take an objective view on the best interests of the charity. There are a number of internal quality checks on the report before it is published. Once the caseworker has drafted the report, it is checked by a senior manager and additionally by legal advisers. It is then sent to those who are affected by the inquiry. If substantive comments are received, the report could be rewritten, and the checking mechanisms would be processed again.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.0/4">At the commission's recent open AGM, it was made plain through an announcement that it was reviewing the form and content of inquiry reports, although the review itself does not extend to including a right of reply on inquiry reports. It is also reviewing how long inquiry reports remain on its website&mdash;the point that the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, raised in moving the amendment.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.0/5">I cannot agree that it is appropriate for people other than the commission to add comments to a report that is nothing more and nothing less than the commission's own description of its inquiry and its own conclusions. We have to have confidence in the commission. It cannot be right that Parliament does not trust the independent regulator to draw up properly considered inquiry reports to the extent that it expects future inquiry reports to be unfair and unbalanced and in need of a right of reply. Other regulators work in the same way, and I do not see that we could accept the amendment and expect the commission to differ from what most Members of your Lordships' House would agree is a practical and workable model that has served this regulator and other regulators well.</p>
	<p pid="b.684.0/6">The commission will ensure that those affected by an inquiry report will have a reasonable time to consider a draft report and make representations about it. That is a guarantee from the commission. I am interested in the case that the noble Lord, Lord Swinfen, has raised. It is entirely reasonable that the time limits for a response are clear and that those affected are given ample opportunity to make their views known to the commission in the way in which it prepares its inquiry reports. I am assured that the commission is determined to provide reasonable time for proper representations to be made. For all those reasons, I cannot accept the noble Lord's amendment today, as I have been unable to accept it on other occasions.</p>

	<p pid="b.703.4/1">My Lords, I shall speak extraordinarily briefly to Amendments Nos. 80 and 81, which are concerned with Clause 39 on the power to transfer all property. We have discussed on several occasions, most recently in Committee on <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-12">12 July</phrase>, the problem of a small charity wishing to wind itself up having to find a single charity with precisely matching charitable objectives to merge with. The Minister gave an encouraging reply then, as a result of which I withdrew my amendment. I understand that the tectonic plates are about to shift but have not yet done so. Perhaps the Minister could update us. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="b.734.2/1">My Lords, the rules insert a new Order 116A into the Rules of the Supreme Court (Northern Ireland) 1980 to support proceedings in the High Court and appeal proceedings in the Court of Appeal under the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005. It may be helpful if I recap briefly the background to the rules.</p>
	<p pid="b.734.2/2">It remains the Government's view that it is appropriate and necessary that procedures are put in place to protect the nation against the risk of terrorism caused by individuals who are suspected of involvement in terrorist-related activity but who cannot be prosecuted through the criminal courts. However, it is also the Government's view that it is imperative that such procedures are subject to strict safeguards and consistent with the rule of law and our human rights obligations.</p>
	<p pid="b.734.2/3">The Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 provides for the making of control orders that impose obligations on individuals suspected of involvement in terrorism-related activity. The Act, as noble Lords will recall, draws a distinction between two types of control order: the derogating control order and the non-derogating control order, and there are different judicial procedures in respect of each type of control order. The purpose of this amendment to the Rules of the Supreme Court (Northern Ireland) 1980 is to establish rules to support control order proceedings and relevant appeal proceedings.</p>
	<p pid="b.734.2/4">Noble Lords will recall that supreme court rules are usually made by the Northern Ireland Supreme Court Rules Committee, which is the body with statutory responsibility for maintaining those rules. The committee is chaired by the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, Sir Brian Kerr, and is made up of representatives from the judiciary, barristers and solicitors. Due to the exceptional circumstances in which the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005 was passed, it would have been impossible for the Supreme Court Rules Committee to make the relevant changes to the rules of court in the very short period of time originally available. That is why it was necessary to legislate for a special rule-making procedure under paragraph 3 of the schedule to the Prevention of Terrorism Act authorising the Lord Chancellor to make rules on the first occasion after the Act was passed, instead of the Supreme Court Rules Committee. This mirrored the approach taken in England and Wales whereby the relevant civil procedure rules were made by the Lord Chancellor as opposed to the civil procedure rules committee.</p>
	<p pid="b.734.2/5">The Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland was informed before the introduction of the Bill of the need for a special procedure to make the first set of rules. The Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland, made the first set of rules, but the Supreme Court Rules Committee may make any subsequent rules or amendments as and when necessary. Rules made by the Supreme Court Rules Committee will be subject to the normal requirements of the Judicature (Northern Ireland) Act 1978, including the negative resolution procedure.</p>
	<p pid="b.734.2/6">The Rules of the Supreme Court (Northern Ireland) (Amendment No. 4) 2005 introduce a new Order 116A to the Rules of the Supreme Court (Northern Ireland) 1980. The new rules in Order 116A are based on the general principle that the existing provisions of the Rules of the Supreme Court relating to applications and appeals in general should apply to control order proceedings and appeals subject to any necessary modifications as set out in Order 116A.</p>
	<p pid="b.734.2/7">The order is divided into five parts. Part I deals with the scope of the order, the interpretation of terms used, and necessary modification of the overriding objective of the Rules of the Supreme Court, to ensure that sensitive information is not disclosed contrary to the public interest. It has been modified for the purposes of the new order by placing a new duty on the court to ensure that information is not disclosed contrary to the public interest and by requiring the overriding objective to be read and given effect in a way which is compatible with that duty.</p>
	<p pid="b.734.2/8">Part II deals with applications to the High Court relating to derogating control orders. Part III deals with leave applications, references and appeals to the High Court relating to non-derogating control orders. Part IV deals with onward appeals to the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal. Part V contains general provisions that apply to all proceedings in the High Court and Court of Appeal brought under the Prevention of Terrorism Act. This includes provision in Rules 25 to 28 for closed hearings and the use of special advocates.</p>
	<p pid="b.734.2/9">Finally, Part V also includes provisions in Rules 30 to 32 which require the Secretary of State to disclose to the court all the material available to him and which is relevant to the matter under consideration. The Secretary of State must also disclose all such material to the other party,. except where the court permits him to withhold material on the grounds that disclosure would be contrary to the public interest. If the Secretary of State withholds material from the other party without the permission of the court, the court may prevent the Secretary of State from relying on such material himself, or it may withdraw the matter from its consideration. These rules reflect the requirements of paragraph 4(3) of the schedule to the Prevention of Terrorism Act 2005, which was inserted by an amendment to the Bill to meet concerns about the need to establish a procedure for the disclosure of exculpatory material.</p>
	<p pid="b.734.2/10">That is an outline of the substantive provisions of the Rules of the Supreme Court (Northern Ireland) (Amendment No. 4) 2005.</p>
	<p pid="b.734.2/11">Moved, That the rules laid before the House on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-27">27 June</phrase> be approved [<i>2nd report from the Joint Committee</i>].&mdash;(<i>Baroness Ashton of Upholland</i>.)</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2005-10-18b.738.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100024" speakername="Baroness Ashton of Upholland" colon=":" colnum="738"  time="018:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds05/text/51018-21.htm#51018-21_spnew2">
	<p pid="b.738.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful to the noble Baroness and to the noble Lord for their comments and I will endeavour to deal with the questions that they have raised. I will agree to disagree with the noble Baroness, Lady Harris, on the background to the issues. I also remember the all-night sitting. It was an important debate. I am grateful that, in raising some of the broader issues, the noble Baroness is not saying that what I am bringing forward today is something with which she could fundamentally disagree.</p>
	<p pid="b.738.0/2">I know that the noble Baroness is interested in the issue of enforcement. A breach of the control order would be a criminal offence to be dealt with in the same manner as any other criminal offence. I am not aware of any formal consultation with the Police Service of Northern Ireland, but if the noble Baroness recalls, Section 8 of the Act obliges the Secretary of State to consult with the Chief Constable about whether there is any evidence available that could be used for the purposes of prosecuting the individual in question for a terrorism-related offence. In addition, if the Secretary of State proceeds to make a control order, he must inform the chief constable that he has done so and the chief constable will then be under a duty to ensure that the conduct of the individual in question is kept under review throughout the period during which the control order has effect, with a view to bringing a prosecution for a terrorism-related offence.</p>
	<p pid="b.738.0/3">The noble Baroness also asked whether we had consulted the Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission. Normally, as she knows, we would seek the comments of that commission, but given the exceptional and urgent manner in which the rules were made, I understand that such consultation was not possible in this particular case.</p>
	<p pid="b.738.0/4">The noble Baroness asked me about the special advocates. She will know that the special advocates are currently drawn from the Attorney-General's panel of senior counsel. It is envisaged that that will remain the case for the foreseeable future, which I hope addresses that particular point.</p>
	<p pid="b.738.0/5">Both the noble Baroness and the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, raised the question of the delay in the rules being brought before the House. As noble Lords will know, the rules were originally made by the Lord Chancellor in consultation with the Lord Chief Justice of Northern Ireland on <phrase class="date" code="2005-04-05">5 April 2005</phrase>, shortly after the Act received Royal Assent. The rules came into force immediately after being made, but ceased to have effect 40 days thereafter as a result of not having been approved by Parliament within the affirmative resolution period. The reason for the delay was largely because the general election intervened and, as the noble Baroness said, there was a subsequent delay in establishing the membership of the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments, which must consider the rules before they can be considered by this House.</p>
	<p pid="b.738.0/6">However, the Lord Chancellor used his powers under paragraph 3 (6) of the Schedule to the Act to make the rules again on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-26">26 June 2005</phrase> and it is these rules that I now move before the House, this being the earliest opportunity to do so after the Summer Recess. I understand that the Summer Recess does not count for the purposes of the 40 days, in case noble Lords&mdash;as I did&mdash;added the days up and found that there were too many.</p>
	<p pid="b.738.0/7">The controls were continuous over the period between the first set of rules that were made by the Lord Chancellor having ceased to have effect and the present set of rules coming into operation. The first set of rules ceased to have effect when the requisite 40-day affirmative resolution period expired on <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-26">26 June 2005</phrase>. The present set of rules were made on 26 of June 2005, came into operation on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-27">27 June</phrase> and, in accordance with Section 4(A) of the Interpretation Act 1978, came into force at the beginning of <phrase class="date" code="2005-06-27">27 June 2005</phrase>, the previous ones having expired at 12 o'clock midnight on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-26">26 June</phrase>. Consequently, there was no gap in the provision made by the first and the second set of rules.</p>
	<p pid="b.738.0/8">The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, specifically asked about the disapplication of certain parts of the principal rules. Due to the nature of these proceedings, it was considered that it was appropriate to make some modifications to the application of the principal rules. However, we believe that they are limited to what is considered to be necessary. As the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, said, Order 1, Rule 1A, the overriding objective, is amended so that it is subject to Order 116A, Rule 2(1). The overriding objective is to enable the courts to deal with cases justly, which includes, among other matters, ensuring that the parties are on an equal footing, dealing with cases in a way that is proportionate, expeditious and fair, and allotting each case an appropriate share of the court's resources.</p>
	<p pid="b.738.0/9">Although proceedings under the 2005 Act should be subject to the overriding objective, such cases are based on sensitive intelligence material. Of course, it is important to ensure that information is not disclosed contrary to the public interest. Therefore, for that reason, the overriding objective has been modified for the purposes of the new order by placing on the court a duty to ensure that information is not disclosed contrary to the public interest and requiring that the overriding objective be read and given effect in a way that is compatible with that duty.</p>
	<p pid="b.738.0/10">The noble Lord, Lord Kingsland, also asked me about the new Rule 24(2)(c). The intention of that rule is to prevent the court being required to hold a hearing when that would serve no purpose. However, it does not fetter the court's discretion to hold a hearing in any case in which it considers it appropriate to do so. Moreover, the exercise of that discretion will be subject to the overriding objective to deal with cases justly and, of course, in accordance with the rights protected by the Human Rights Act 1998; in particular Article 6, the right to a fair trial.</p>
	<p pid="b.738.0/11">Finally, the noble Lord asked about special advocates. It will be a matter for the Northern Ireland Supreme Court Rules Committee to make any further amendments to the rules, which will include a list of the functions of special advocates. It will make those rules in the usual way, subject to the requirements of the 1978 Act, by negative resolution procedure. Noble Lords will know that the noble Lord, Lord Carlile, is involved in a review, which I gather will report at the end of this year or the beginning of next, to facilitate his observations becoming part of any further legislation that the Government may wish to take forward.</p>
	<p pid="b.738.0/12">I hope that I have answered all the questions that have been raised. Accordingly, I commend the Rules of the Supreme Court (Northern Ireland) (Amendment No. 4) 2005 to the House.</p>
