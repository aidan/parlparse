	<p pid="a.767.2/1">My Lords, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-24">24 March</phrase>, the Deputy Prime Minister announced funding for six pathfinders for 2006-08. In reaching decisions, we considered a scheme update from each pathfinder, which set out its strategy and proposed a programme for the next four years. Important factors in our assessment include the quality of community involvement and consideration of heritage. Pathfinders are very alive to the benefits of capitalising on the distinctive character of their area.</p>

	<p pid="a.779.3/1">My Lords, we on these Benches wanted the Bill to contain a provision to abolish the common-law offence of conspiracy to defraud, as recommended by the Law Commission, and I moved an amendment to that effect on Report. The noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General wishes to retain the offence for the time being because, in his view, it may be useful in certain circumstances. But it is agreed that the retention of the common-law offence will be reviewed in three years' time in the light of the extent to which it turns out to be useful in the interim period.</p>
	<p pid="a.779.3/2">The noble and learned Lord the Attorney-General offered to show the draft advice which he has prepared for prosecutors and which is intended to restrict the use of the common-law offence to cases which are not adequately covered by the new legislation on fraud. He has sent copies of a working draft of his advice to me and the noble Lord, Lord Kingsland. I am satisfied by the advice, but it would be very helpful if the noble and learned Lord could explain it to your Lordships' House and put on record an outline of his advice. In the circumstances, it is my intention to withdraw my amendment at the end of the debate. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.783.2/1">My Lords, with permission, I shall repeat a Statement made by my right honourable friend the Minister of State for the Armed Forces earlier today in another place. The Statement is as follows:</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/2">&quot;On <phrase class="date" code="2004-12-15">15 December 2004</phrase>, I informed the House that I had commissioned a review into the circumstances surrounding the deaths of four young soldiers at Princess Royal Barracks, Deepcut, during the period 1995 to 2002. As I told the House then, I was aware that its scope and nature may not satisfy all those&mdash;Members of this House included&mdash;who have been calling for a formal public inquiry into combat deaths in the Armed Forces, and in particular the four deaths at Deepcut. I said that by concentrating on the circumstances of the four deaths, the review would focus on the issue at the heart of current public concern.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/3">&quot;The review has been undertaken by the distinguished human rights lawyer Mr Nicholas Blake QC and is now complete. Copies will be placed in the Libraries of both Houses.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/4">&quot;This morning the families had the benefit of a briefing by Mr Blake on his conclusions. I know that this will be another difficult day for them; the passage of time, in such sad circumstances, does little to lessen the pain. I hope that they will find at least that Mr Blake has addressed carefully and sensitively the questions that have troubled them. I acknowledge the dignity with which they have conducted themselves over this long period.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/5">&quot;I am grateful to Mr Blake for the thorough and professional way in which he has approached his task. In conducting his review he has had the full co-operation of the Ministry of Defence. He has had full and unrestricted access to our records, and all serving soldiers were encouraged to help the review in any way they could. I am satisfied that this report, running to 416 pages plus annexes, represents an independent, objective and comprehensive analysis of all matters that have a bearing on the four deaths, and that Mr Blake has not been constrained by his terms of reference. Importantly, he has been able to tackle the wider issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/6">&quot;There were three issues around which much comment had been made about events at Deepcut: the alleged suspicious circumstances of the deaths; a claimed culture of bullying; and the need for a formal public inquiry. I am pleased to note that Mr Blake makes substantial findings on all three points.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/7">&quot;First, Mr Blake has concluded that, on the balance of probabilities, the deaths of Sean Benton, Cheryl James and Geoff Gray at Deepcut were self-inflicted. Given the recent coroner's inquest into the death of James Collinson, he understandably refrains from reaching any conclusion on that particular death. However, he does comment that the opportunity for self-infliction was afforded by the policy of frequently assigning trainees to guard duty at Deepcut, unsupervised by experienced soldiers. The review found a number of factors that may have contributed to their unhappiness and may have made them more susceptible to self-harm. The review considers that,</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/8" class="indent">&quot;although the Army did not cause any of the deaths&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/9">there were institutional failures to identify potential sources of risk and to subsequently address them.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/10">&quot;On the question of bullying, Mr Blake states that there is no evidence that any of the trainees were bullied to death. However, he accepts that some trainees at Deepcut&mdash;and, at that, probably only a small minority&mdash;experienced harassment, discrimination and oppressive behaviour. Those who did not complain appear to have had little confidence that the system could or would address their grievances. These are important criticisms, which will be addressed.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/11">&quot;Finally, on the question of a public inquiry, as I indicated in my response to the earlier HCDC report on this, I did not consider that a formal public inquiry was required. The HCDC was of a similar view. Mr Blake, in a carefully reasoned examination of the arguments for such an approach, has concluded that a public inquiry into the immediate or broader circumstances surrounding these deaths is not necessary. I reaffirm my earlier position and concur with Mr Blake's conclusion.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/12">&quot;This review, taken alongside the other inquiries and inquests into the deaths at Deepcut, has set out with great clarity the circumstances of the four deaths and the context in which they occurred. We now need to move on and to take forward the changes that are required. We accept Mr Blake's conclusions and welcome the opportunity to address his recommendations. We accept that there have been shortcomings, and we will do all we can to address them.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/13">&quot;Although the purpose of the review was not to attribute blame, Mr Blake has described a disturbing catalogue of allegations of misconduct at the relevant times. The Army authorities will carefully examine the report to see whether there is any indication of professional misconduct or negligence that might make administrative action appropriate. In addition, any matters that suggest that a disciplinary offence may have been committed will be referred to the Royal Military Police for further investigation. We will also have to take into account the overall training environment in which our personnel were working, and the constraints faced by those in the command chain.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/14">&quot;Mr Blake understands the importance, particularly for the Army, of recruiting under-18s, but he has highlighted weaknesses with regard to their appropriate care. This is an issue that we are alive to, and we are improving the standard of care and support afforded to young recruits. For example, trainees' surveys and focus groups have been established, and a note of guidance for all commanding officers covering all aspects relating to working with under-18s has been produced. Furthermore, Mr Blake commends in particular the specialist training regimes for 16 year-olds established at the Army Training Regiment, Bassingbourn, and the Army Foundation College, Harrogate. But there is clearly still more to do, especially in extending best practices such as these establishments, and we are committed to implementing such changes as far and as quickly as we can.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/15">&quot;The quality of our Armed Forces and the professional way in which they were, and are, meeting their operational commitments is evidence of the quality of military training, and I pay tribute to this without hesitation. The report describes the British Army as a unique and extraordinary institution which, for the past decade or more, has been sent on a wide variety of operational deployments in many parts of the world, to great personal danger and regular personal sacrifice.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/16">&quot;The report notes that many of the young people who are, or were, accepted as recruits into the Army have had very challenging lives as children; a high proportion are from single-parent homes; some had left school with no qualifications; many had deficits in basic skills. The report comments that it is a remarkable challenge to turn these young people into effective soldiers forming part of a disciplined and interdependent team. It is worth noting that Deepcut alone sent approximately 10,000 trainees into the field Army during the period covered by the review.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/17">&quot;However, the number of young people, particularly those under 18, whom the services employ places particular responsibilities on us to recognise their potential vulnerability. We are committed to improving the way in which all our recruits are trained, developed and looked after. In view of this, and in the light of the recommendations made in recent reports by the House of Commons Defence Committee and the Adult Learning Inspectorate, work has already been, and continues to be, done to make changes for the better.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/18">&quot;As in society as a whole, bullying, harassment and other inappropriate behaviour can never be totally eliminated in the Armed Forces. But it is essential that we establish an environment in which bullying is wholly unacceptable. At every stage of their training and careers, it is made very clear to personnel that bullying and harassment in any form is not tolerated and that it is part of their duty, and a function of leadership, to eliminate it.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/19">&quot;It is a sad and unfortunate fact, again just as in wider society, that the Armed Forces will never be able to eradicate the tragic incidence of suicide or self-harm. But the risks can be reduced to a minimum by careful management, pragmatic policies and better understanding, knowledge and education. As the Blake review makes clear:</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/20" class="indent">'Every Officer, NCO, civilian instructor and trainee should be alert to any sign of abuse and be required to report it through the chain of Command, so prompt and effective action can be taken'.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/21">&quot;The Armed Forces Bill, currently being scrutinised by a Select Committee of this House, contains proposals to streamline the complaints redress system, including provision for an independent element. Also, the Bill will consider aspects of the procedures applying to boards of inquiry. The review makes recommendations in these two important areas. We will give full consideration to those recommendations, and the Bill gives us the opportunity to implement any changes deemed appropriate.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/22">&quot;The report has identified areas in the training environment, especially between 1995 and 2002, that required improvement. It cites examples of inappropriate behaviour that should not have taken place. It also identifies areas where we can, and should, improve the way in which we manage the young people for whom we are responsible, and we accept these observations. We now need to look at every one of Mr Blake's 34 detailed recommendations to see how they should best be taken forward to address the weaknesses identified as quickly and as effectively as possible. I also urge honourable and right honourable Members to take time to analyse Mr Blake's report in full prior to forming their own opinions.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/23">&quot;Mr Blake has given us a detailed and painstaking report of considerable substance. I am confident that it will provide further impetus for improvement. I can assure the House of my determination to deal with the issues he has raised, and I undertake to provide a detailed formal written response to the House on all the recommendations. I am determined to ensure that everything possible is done to prevent similar tragedies occurring in the future. I have enormous confidence in the dedicated men and women working as instructors in our training organisation. I want to make sure that they have the support, resources and facilities they need to pursue excellence. The trained young men and women they produce lie at the very core of how we deliver on the defence interests of this country. Their efforts have to be matched by commitment from the very top of the MoD.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/24">&quot;Mr Blake concluded his report with his profound condolences to each of the families concerned. On behalf of the Ministry of Defence, I add my condolences&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.783.2/25">My Lords, that concludes the Statement.</p>
</speech>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-03-29a.787.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100026" speakername="Lord Astor of Hever" colon=":" colnum="787"  time="016:04:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60329-06.htm#60329-06_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.787.0/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister for repeating the Statement. The Blake review is a substantial document and will require detailed study. But we must not lose sight of the fact that it was necessary because of the deaths of four young recruits. These deaths were personal tragedies, and the hearts of all noble Lords will go out to their parents and families.</p>
	<p pid="a.787.0/2">Like previous reports, the Blake review will have wider implications for our Armed Forces, the way they train their recruits and the MoD's duty of care. These issues are complex because they require a difficult balance. On the one hand, the Army needs individuals who will put themselves in the line of fire to protect all of us, and that inevitably requires a robust and tough training environment and a culture quite unlike that of civilian life. On the other hand, the Army has a duty of care to each individual under its command.</p>
	<p pid="a.787.0/3">Mr Blake makes a number of important points. He finds that the Army did not cause the deaths of the three recruits whose cases he studied, although he identifies a number of &quot;institutional failures&quot; in the Army. Despite calls for a public inquiry, he believes that no useful purpose will be served by holding one. He concludes that no new reliable evidence as to how the four trainees met their deaths is likely to be available. We recognise that that will come as a disappointment to the families, but Mr Blake's decision confirms the view that we have taken all along.</p>
	<p pid="a.787.0/4">The review demonstrates that mistakes were made in the MoD's duty of care for the young recruits in its charge and opportunities missed in dealing with the problems at the base. Between 1988 and 2002, seven inquiries into MoD training identified a number of the problem areas and shortfalls in provision. However, the MoD failed to act on these. The defence budget was grossly overstretched, and too often training seemed like an easy source of savings and a low priority for funding and improvements.</p>
	<p pid="a.787.0/5">The review is particularly critical of the levels of supervision at Deepcut, which in some cases were as bad as 1:60. In a Westminster Hall debate on <phrase class="date" code="2004-04-27">27 April 2004</phrase>, the Secretary of State announced a further 179 instructors and a supervisory ratio target of 1:38 in all phase 1 and phase 2 training establishments. Can the Minister confirm that this target of 1:38 has been met?</p>
	<p pid="a.787.0/6">The review is very critical of the poor quality of accommodation and the sanitary and washing facilities available. What improvements has the MoD made in this very important area?</p>
	<p pid="a.787.0/7">We are aware that two of these recruits had medical records of self-harm prior to recruitment, unknown to the MoD. What is the MoD doing to identify vulnerable recruits on entry into the service? Is there sufficient psychological profiling of potential recruits, and will the Minister's department consider automatic availability of NHS medical records prior to a recruitment decision? What improvements have been made to the vetting procedure of instructors following the conviction of Leslie Skinner in December 2004 for indecent assault of four young recruits? Problems have been identified arising from the break between phase 1 and phase 2 training. What plans do the Government have to restructure the training programme to reduce the problems experienced by soldiers awaiting trade training?</p>
	<p pid="a.787.0/8">We welcome the recognition in the Statement of the need to spread and sustain best practice in relation to young soldiers beyond Deepcut&mdash;Bassingbourn and the Army Foundation College at Harrogate were both mentioned. We welcome the recognition that it would be appropriate to amend the Armed Forces Bill to meet some of the points identified by Mr Blake, and the Government can look to the Opposition to give a fair wind to such amendments.</p>
	<p pid="a.787.0/9">The Ministry of Defence and the Army are clearly embarked on a number of sensible measures to help prevent a recurrence of such failings. I hope that the Minster will continue to report regularly to this House that the better practices are in full operation, and that they have not been allowed to slide back as the memories of what did and did not happen at Deepcut slide back into the past.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-03-29a.788.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100778" speakername="Lord Garden" colon=":" colnum="788"  time="016:10:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60329-06.htm#60329-06_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.788.0/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister both for early sight of the Statement and the opportunity to have access to the report at the Ministry of Defence early this morning. Our sympathy is also with the families of these young soldiers, who died so early in their lives.</p>
	<p pid="a.788.0/2">Time will not allow us to deal with each of the 34 important recommendations in the Blake review, just as the Statement talks only broadly about them. When are we going to get this full report back? We cannot wait years to hear the Ministry of Defence's response. I trust that it will be within, for example, three months.</p>
	<p pid="a.788.0/3">As we have heard, the review does not recommend a further public inquiry, given that it does not believe that more evidence will emerge at this stage. It does, however, recommend disclosure of information to the families, among a number of other measures. It is too early to know how the families, who have suffered so much, will react. However, if the recommendations of the report in this section are fully implemented, closure may be achieved. We will have to wait to see how the police and the Government react to the recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.788.0/4">A number of important recommendations could be implemented by Ministry of Defence Ministers now. Do they intend to immediately implement them in full? The measures range widely, from the living conditions, supervisory arrangements, instructor vetting and training and investigation arrangements, through to complaints procedures. We have raised many of these issues on many occasions. It is always a question of priority for resources.</p>
	<p pid="a.788.0/5">Will the Minister assure us that under-18 year-olds in training are not to be put at risk through losing out in the resource priorities battle within the defence programme? Will he immediately implement the recommendation for separate training facilities for those aged 16? Will the poor quality accommodation, identified as a factor, be upgraded now and not left to rot like so much of the rest of the defence estate? Will the measures to vet and train instructors be implemented now, for the protection of young people? Will the recommendations regarding the Military Police be implemented? Here, again, we have concerns about resources, just as we recently had over the police in Iraq. In particular, will the Minister undertake to implement recommendation 24&mdash;that the Royal Military Police be brought formally under Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Constabulary?</p>
	<p pid="a.788.0/6">In this brief opportunity to focus on the issues raised by Deepcut, I wish to finish with two major areas. First, in recommendation 3, Blake examines whether it is right that the UK is one of the few countries which recruits child soldiers&mdash;that is, those under 18. We have had international criticism for this policy. The review says that recruiting needs are not a satisfactory justification, but goes on to say that the policy is justified given the inadequacies of education and training in the UK's civilian system. As long as the education benefits outweigh the downside of having child soldiers, the report requires a number of special safeguards: the separation of 16 year-olds; a right to resign if still under training, even if past your 18th birthday by the time you get there; and, most importantly&mdash;I ask for the Minister's comments and assurance on this&mdash;that no posting to the field army will occur before the age of 18. Do the Government intend to implement these immediately?</p>
	<p pid="a.788.0/7">Finally, recommendation 26 calls for the establishment of a commissioner of military complaints&mdash;an Armed Forces ombudsman for all the Armed Forces, not just trainees. The Armed Forces Bill has a watered-down proposal for an independent element in redress procedures. The Blake review has a much more useful recommendation, which could address the growing concern among the Armed Forces that their views on their conditions are just ignored. I suggest to the Minister that this is the opportunity to take an imaginative approach. Do the Government intend to take up that proposal in the Armed Forces Bill?</p>
	<p pid="a.788.0/8">If any good is to come from these terrible, tragic events at Deepcut, the Ministry of Defence needs to respond to transfer all the necessary resources to make its under-18 training regime safe, otherwise it needs to consider whether it can continue to recruit such young people into the army.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-03-29a.790.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100779" speakername="Lord Drayson" colon=":" colnum="790"  time="016:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60329-06.htm#60329-06_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.790.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful for the tone taken by the noble Lords opposite in commenting on the Blake review. I stress that there is a complete commitment from the top of the Ministry of Defence and throughout the organisation to learn the lessons from the Blake review. It is right that we take the time to reflect fully on the recommendations of this detailed and comprehensive review, to ensure that that the implementation is done properly. Therefore, it is not appropriate for me to give commitments in this House today to implement the recommendations, but I give a commitment that I and my ministerial team will look at and review the Blake recommendations with speed. I shall answer directly the noble Lords' questions on the timescale for reporting back. Consistent with making sure that when we report back we are able to do so in a way that focuses on implementation, we will report back quickly&mdash;within months.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.0/2">With regard to the context in which the Blake review has taken place, it is important for us to note that a considerable amount has already been done by the Ministry of Defence and, particularly, by the British Army throughout the past seven years. Indeed, things were already being done prior to 1995. None the less, Blake shows that despite the significant improvements that have been made, which the report recognised, they have not gone far enough. More needs to be done. To give a specific example of what has been done already, I can say that considerable investment has gone into living accommodation. If people were to visit Deepcut today they would find, compared with five years ago, a significant improvement in the facilities. However, going forward from here, it is right to focus on the pace at which implementation takes place. I make a commitment to the House to report back to it regularly on the pace of that implementation. It is vital for us to show that we are properly putting people before equipment, that we have the right balance within our defence budget and that, consistent with the tempo and challenge of operations that we undertake within the defence budget, we put people first. There are clearly no better examples of people who should be put first than the youngest members of the Armed Forces, the trainees coming into them.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.0/3">It is important for me to give that context in terms of our response. We are working on the specifics relating to matters such as medical record disclosure&mdash;which was one of Blake's recommendations&mdash;and improvements in vetting procedures. We need to look in detail at how we can implement them properly. I know that in relation to vetting procedures we would like to go further with Criminal Records Bureau checks, but are unable to do so under the current legislation in respect of people already in full-time employment, rather than those applying for employment. We are having discussions with the Home Office about what can be done to develop legislation to enable us to go further.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.0/4">We are restructuring our training programme, which the noble Lord asked for. We must recognise the challenge that the Army faces in phase 2 training. Deepcut is a phase 2 training establishment where soldiers, having been through their basic training, go through their trade training, which can take several years to complete. It is a challenge for us to ensure that during that process their motivation is maintained for a considerable period. One of our innovations is to take people from the training establishment and have them spend short periods with the field army to maintain their motivation and recycle that trade training.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.0/5">Levels of appropriate supervision depend on the activities undertaken and the particular factors at each training establishment. Training establishments carry out different functions. Noble Lords have mentioned that Blake describes the excellent facilities provided at Bassingbourn and Harrogate. These clearly are good models which we know are working, so we have achieved improvements but have further to go.</p>
	<p pid="a.790.0/6">We accept that levels of supervision have been unacceptable in the past, and are making the improvements that need to be implemented now. We use the commanding officers risk assessment guidelines to determine the appropriate levels, as well as to ensure that the focus on the training of instructors is improved. I would be happy to provide further reports to the House as we make progress. We expect to be able to report on all the recommendations made by Blake to the House in months, but it is important, as noble Lords have requested, that that is maintained subsequently with regular updates.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-03-29a.794.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100840" speakername="Lord Ramsbotham" colon=":" colnum="794"  time="016:21:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60329-08.htm#60329-08_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.794.2/1">My Lords, I would like very much to associate myself with all the remarks made by my noble and gallant friend Lord Bramall. He had the experience of commanding soldiers at a training depot. At the same depot, I had the experience of commanding child soldiers, including, at that time, some 15 year-olds. I remember the experience well. It was rather like commanding a ticking time-bomb in many ways, but you had to adopt different techniques to motivate them and to ensure that they were properly supervised.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.2/2">That is not the purpose of what I wanted to say. I have found that there are certain parallels in the report and the inquiry with suicides in prison. We have devoted a great deal of attention to these in your Lordships' House. I am very pleased to see in the report the clear recommendation that the impetus to make certain that conditions and treatment are right should come from the very top. That must start with Ministers and go all the way down. I was delighted to see that.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.2/3">I do not notice a concern that the press and many of the public have regarded the fact that these four deaths took place at Deepcut as an indication of a &quot;conspiracy&quot; at Deepcut. I remember exactly the same suspicion about HMP Brixton following the suicides of five Irish prisoners. Immediately there was suspicion that something was going on against Irish people as opposed to the fact that these were sad and random affairs. Each suicide needed investigation because each had separate circumstances. There is a great danger of trying to make a generalisation when that may not apply.</p>
	<p pid="a.794.2/4">The most important point, which I do not yet see recognised in the report, is the question of &quot;time&quot;. A week ago I saw the parents of a young man who had committed suicide in a prison four and a half years ago. The inquest has only just taken place. Imagine what the family have been through in that time. One of the problems of this inquiry is again that the families have been waiting an enormously long time to hear the outcome. I therefore ask the Minister whether he will, when he goes through the recommendations, consider the word &quot;time&quot;, see what can be done to speed up the inquiry process and make certain that the families particularly affected are given the facts as soon as possible to help them come to terms with their tragic bereavement.</p>

	<p pid="a.797.0/1">My Lords, I beg to move that the House do not insist on its Amendments Nos. 22J and 22K in lieu, to which the Commons have disagreed for their reasons 22JA and 22L.</p>
	<p pid="a.797.0/2">I note that the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, is not yet in his place. However, I wish to speak to Motion A1 standing in his name. I see that the noble Lord has now reached his place. In the best traditions of the House, he is seeking to reach an acceptable compromise in tabling Amendment Nos. 22M, 22N and 22O in lieu. I, on behalf of the Government, will urge my colleagues to support his Motion.</p>
	<p pid="a.797.0/3">The Commons earlier today reaffirmed their view, for the fifth time, that those applying for a designated document should have their details entered on the national identity register and be issued with an ID card. As your Lordships are aware, this has been fundamental to the Government's approach in implementing the identity cards scheme, going back to our very first consultation exercise in 2002. That approach continued in the policy announcement in 2003, the draft Bill scrutinised by the House of Commons Home Affairs Committee in 2004, the Bill debated before the election, the Government's manifesto commitment, which we established yesterday was clearly understood&mdash;at least at the time&mdash;by the Liberal Democrats, and all our subsequent debates.</p>
	<p pid="a.797.0/4">As I said yesterday, during our debates we have conceded on many points. We have moved and moved and moved again, to the point where it is hard to see what more the Government can give. I am grateful that the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, has persevered in his honourable attempts to find a way somewhere between &quot;must&quot; and &quot;may&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.797.0/5">The noble Lord's Motion preserves the integrity of the national identity register by ensuring that the details of all applicants for designated documents will be entered in the national identity register, an issue which, as I have explained on a number of occasions to the House, is key and central to the Government's delivery of the process. This will mean that they will all be afforded the protection that this will provide from identity theft. It will also provide the wider benefits to society by ensuring that attempts by people to establish multiple identities will be more easily detected.</p>
	<p pid="a.797.0/6">Once the passport becomes the designated document, the noble Lord's amendment provides for a time-limited opt-out for people applying for passports to be issued with an identity card as well. I share the noble Lord's view that few people will opt out. For those who do, while they will not be able to prove their identity securely in a range of transactions with public and private sector organisations, they will also not be required to inform the authorities of changes in prescribed details such as their address; that obligation applies only to those to whom the ID card has been issued. As this has been one point that has appeared to cause some noble Lords concern, I hope that they will take this into account when deciding whether or not to support the amendment of the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, today.</p>
	<p pid="a.797.0/7">If we are to secure value for money in the procurement process and obtain the full benefits of the scheme over time, there has to be certainty about the number of people registered and the proportion of people who hold ID cards. The noble Lord's amendment therefore sensibly sets a time limit on when the opt-out from being issued with an identity card would end. While the date of <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2010</phrase> will add a degree of uncertainty to the Government's plans for implementing the scheme, this will, we hope, be manageable. I note that a number of noble Lords suggested the inclusion of a date yesterday. The debate has ranged around that issue. The date proposed by the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, strikes a sensible compromise and is acceptable to the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.797.0/8">I have to confess that I have mixed feelings about our long and many debates on this Bill. In many respects, this House has performed its duty admirably in improving the Bill. But its actions in holding out against the clearly expressed wishes of the elected Chamber have put at risk this House's reputation&mdash;</p>

	<p pid="a.801.0/1">My Lords, first, I apologise for the absence of my noble friend Lord Phillips of Sudbury, who has been defeated not by the Government but by a very small virus. He very much regrets his inability to be with your Lordships at this time.</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/2">We on these Benches oppose the amendment in the name of the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong of Ilminster. The noble Baroness, Lady Scotland, said yesterday that over the years this House has rightly grown in stature. Well, it has not always had the reputation that she describes. Yesterday, reference was made to Asquith and Churchill, and noble Lords would expect me to refer to Lloyd George, who said:</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/3" class="indent">&quot;Every man has a House of Lords in his own head. Fears, prejudices, misconceptions&mdash;those are the peers, and they are hereditary&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/4">This House has come a long way since those days.</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/5">But the present-day reputation of this House has been gained not by being cravenly subservient to a government party supported by 36 per cent of the voters in the last general election&mdash;22 per cent of the electorate&mdash;but by standing for the traditions of liberty and freedom which are at the heart of the British constitution. If there is a constitutional issue, as the Minister said yesterday, that is what it is.</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/6">We were amused when, in these debates on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-06">6 March</phrase>, the noble Lord, Lord Gould said:</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/7" class="indent">&quot;Sadly, it is now impossible to tell where the Conservative Benches end and the Liberal Democrat Benches begin&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/8">He used the word &quot;courting&quot;, as I recall. He spoke, too, of,</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/9" class="indent">&quot;a union designed to oppose measures that help our security, whatever the people say and whatever the other place decides&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, 6/3/06; col. 557.]</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/10">There are links in these two deep-rooted political traditions; we and the Conservatives both believe that the democratic state exists to protect the liberty of the citizen and that civil rights and political liberties are inalienable. It is to the enormous credit of this Government that in their early years they recognised those same principles in passing the Human Rights Act, which was a milestone in the history of this country.</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/11">What, however, has happened since? The watchword is now &quot;security&quot;. The philosopher Hobbes, in his 17th-century view of the state, started from the premise that the world is dangerous and filled with unknown enemies perpetually striving to do us harm, and that the only way to achieve security is to give up our freedom and liberty to a common power. This is what he said in his great work, <i>Leviathan</i>:</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/12" class="indent">&quot;The only way to erect such a common power, as may be able to defend them from the invasion of foreigners, and the injuries of one another, and thereby to secure them in such sort as that by their own industry and by the fruits of the earth they may nourish themselves and live contentedly, is to confer all their power and strength upon one man, or upon one assembly of men, that may reduce all their wills, by plurality of voices, unto one will&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/13">In this authoritarian model of the state, it is the state, on the basis of secret information that it does not disclose, that defines the gravity of the threats to this country and to our security, and it is the state that determines what civil liberties it will grant us and to what degree it will do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/14">It is a grim philosophy, which in the last few years has underlain much of the Government's approach to legislation in this House: the terrorism bills, the criminal justice bills and now this Identity Cards Bill, where compulsion is the keynote. We have heard in the past day or two that the Government always meant to have compulsion. Why did they not say so? Why did they use the word &quot;voluntary&quot;? What is the initial period of voluntariness to which their manifesto undoubtedly refers?</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/15">There are severe dangers. There have been cruel terrorist acts on our streets that have destroyed lives. If the Government had produced any evidence that identity cards would protect us from such dangers, we would freely consent to join a national database and to carry identity cards. That would be an exercise of freedom, not of compulsion. It is in resisting the threat to personal freedoms that this House has made its reputation. It was ridiculous for the Minister to say that we had put the reputation of this House at risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/16">The noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, said yesterday that there is an issue of personal freedom that should not be brushed aside as being of no consequence. I pay tribute to him for his shrewd attempt yesterday to arrive at a compromise that the House could have supported as a whole. However, his compromise was not accepted, and what is objectionable in what is put before us now with the full support of the Government is that the applicant for a passport will still have to register on the national database. He may not take his identity card, but the organs of the state will have access to his records under this Bill. Information may be put on that national database referring to him. If you look at Clause 19, you will see how many organs of the state will have access to that information without his knowledge.</p>
	<p pid="a.801.0/17">We will not have it on these Benches. This is an issue of freedom and of personal liberty. Although I have paid tribute to the noble Lord, Lord Armstrong, we cannot support him in the Lobbies tonight.</p>

	<p pid="a.808.1/1">My Lords, I beg to move that this Bill be now read a second time.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/2">The Government have achieved considerable success in recent years in reducing violent crime. The British Crime Survey shows that, since 1997, violent crime has fallen by 34 per cent. While that is clearly excellent news, it is no reason to assume that more should not be done.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/3">We know, for example, that according to the British Crime Survey just under half of all violent crime is believed to be alcohol related. Many of us will have witnessed in our own towns and city centres the disorder that often accompanies binge drinking. While much of this behaviour often amounts to relatively low-level offences, it can too frequently lead to serious, violent incidents.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/4">We also know that trends in violent crimes involving weapons will always be influenced by the availability of those weapons. That is why we must be constantly alert to shifts in criminal behaviour, and look to see what they tell us about the effectiveness of the legislative framework.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/5">This Bill recognises that there are areas of violent crime in which more can be done to assist the police and local authorities in making our communities safer. We are introducing new powers to challenge unacceptable behaviour, punish those who commit violent acts and stop weapons getting into the hands of those who would misuse them.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/6">The Bill benefited from much considered and helpful debate in the other place. The Government have been keen throughout to listen to arguments, respond to concerns and improve the Bill where we can. I am sure that this constructive approach will continue in your Lordships' House, and I look forward to some lively and instructive debate in the coming weeks, although I must confess that I hope it will be slightly less lively than that which we have just enjoyed.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/7">Part 1 introduces a range of innovative measures to tackle the problems associated with alcohol-related violence and disorder, which unfortunately is a highly visible part of the night-time economy. Most people drink responsibly, but the effect caused by those who do not is disproportionately damaging. In too many of our towns and cities, law-abiding citizens feel unable to enjoy a night out in safety. The British Crime Survey shows that nearly one in five of all violent incidents occur in or around pubs and clubs. That is a significant proportion, and much of it will be as a result of binge drinking.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/8">Responsibility for ending a culture in which people frequently drink to excess must ultimately lie with the individual. To hold individuals to account for their actions, we seek to introduce through the Bill a new civil order: the drinking banning order. It will be available to protect communities from the criminal or disorderly behaviour of an individual while they are under the influence of alcohol. Through this order, a court will be able to impose whatever prohibitions it believes necessary to protect others from this type of behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/9">The aim of the drinking banning order is really quite simple: we want to discourage unacceptable, alcohol-fuelled behaviour, and punish such behaviour when it occurs. In doing so, we want to protect innocent people from the harm caused by those who misuse alcohol.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/10">Your Lordships may be aware that when the Bill was in the other place, the Government undertook to consider the parallels with interventions to provide education and support to drink-driving offenders and whether similar interventions might be developed for those who are subject to drinking banning orders. I can confirm that we will bring forward amendments about that in Committee in this House. Those amendments will enable the courts to reduce the duration of a drinking banning order if individuals agree to undertake a course designed specifically to address their misuse of alcohol and their resultant behaviour, and then satisfactorily complete this course. I know from many of our debates that this House takes seriously the need to break the cycle of alcohol abuse.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/11">The Bill also provides a new power for the police to prevent alcohol-related disorder by issuing to an individual aged 16 or over a direction to leave a locality. If the presence of an individual in a particular place is likely to cause or contribute to alcohol-related crime or disorder, a police constable may issue that person with a direction to leave the locality and prohibit their return for up to 48 hours.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/12">Noble Lords will, I hope, be pleased to see that we have included an explicit necessity test in this provision, which ensures that this power can be used only where it is imperative for the police to intervene in a situation to prevent disorder or violence occurring or escalating. These measures focus on the individual and provide new tools for the police and local authorities to use in tackling unacceptable behaviour. However, it is clear that the alcohol industry and licensed premises also have an important role to play in tackling alcohol-related violence and disorder. We very much welcome the steps that the trade has taken to raise operating standards. The alcohol industry has published a comprehensive statement of principles and standards for the retail of alcohol, and is working on how these can be embedded across the board. Locally, initiatives such as the &quot;Best Bar None&quot; accreditation scheme, which was first launched in Manchester, are rewarding the best-run premises and encouraging good practice. But there is more to be done to improve the performance of pubs, clubs and off-licences, and the new powers in the Licensing Act 2003 are a key part of this.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/13">As I have said, a lot of alcohol-related violence and disorder in town and city centres takes place at night, in the streets around pubs and clubs rather than inside them. It is often difficult to blame a particular pub, club or off-licence for this disorder, but that does not mean that premises can deny all responsibility for it. We want the industry to take collective responsibility for the problem. The Bill therefore proposes a new power for the police and local authorities to designate alcohol disorder zones where there is a significant problem with alcohol-related disorder. Let me reassure noble Lords that alcohol disorder zones will be a measure of last resort. The key focus of the alcohol disorder zones provision is on the action-planning stage. Bringing licensed premises together to implement the action plan, whose steps are intended to reduce the risk of alcohol-related crime occurring in the first place, is the real benefit here. It is prevention, rather than simply cure.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/14">The action plan will be tailored to provide solutions to specific local problems. Typically, this could include taking steps to raise the standard of management in premises, or seeking voluntary contributions towards additional services for the night-time economy, such as taxi marshals to prevent the flare-ups often seen as people queue for taxis at the end of a long night out. The decision to move to formal designation, where necessary, will be reviewed after three months. We foresee very few areas moving beyond the action-planning stage. Much of the detail of the administration of alcohol disorder zones will be in secondary legislation. Noble Lords will, I hope, be pleased to learn that following the helpful recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee, we will table an amendment in Committee to make these regulations subject to the affirmative procedure of both Houses of Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/15">The Bill also introduces provisions, which supplement existing arrangements in the Licensing Act 2003, to expedite reviews of premises' licences in the case of serious crime and disorder. Under this provision, the licensing authority can act much more quickly to take steps to tackle problem premises in serious cases.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/16">Finally on alcohol, the Bill introduces a new offence of persistently selling alcohol to children. It gives the police and trading standards officers the power to serve a closure notice on licensed premises, banning the sale of alcohol for up to 48 hours, if alcohol has been sold to children three times in a three-month period. That new offence will create a powerful deterrent by ensuring that sanctions are directed against the business, not just the individuals making the sales. I hope that noble Lords will be pleased to learn that we have accepted the recommendation of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and will table an amendment in Committee to ensure that any increase in the maximum fine available for this offence will also be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/17">In Part 2 we will bring forward another range of important measures, this time designed to tackle aspects of violent crime involving weapons, particularly the misuse of air weapons, imitation firearms and knives. As noble Lords are only too well aware, there is already a range of legislation which makes it an offence to possess a prohibited firearm or to carry knives and other weapons in public without reasonable excuse. The Criminal Justice Act 2003 introduced a mandatory minimum sentence of five years' imprisonment for unlawful possession of a prohibited firearm. In the 12 months to September 2005, there was a 38 per cent reduction in fatal injuries caused by firearms other than air weapons.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/18">However, offenders may seek to escape prosecution by passing a weapon to another person to hide it for them. Clearly, we need to address this. That is why we will introduce a new offence of using someone to mind a weapon. This will make it an offence to use a person to hide or carry a knife or firearm. The measure includes a requirement for the courts to take into account the age of the person used to hide or carry the weapon when considering sentencing. If the offender is aged 18 or over and the person used to mind a weapon is not, that must be regarded as an aggravating factor which will affect the length of the sentence handed down.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/19">Another area of real public concern is the misuse of air guns, either as a result of sheer recklessness or out of ignorance of safe practice. It is true that the number of air weapon crimes in 2004&ndash;05 was down from the previous year, but we are still looking at a total of 11,825 recorded crimes. That is simply not acceptable, particularly when a closer look at those statistics reveals a total of 1,358 slight injuries and 143 serious injuries in the past year alone. Those statistics tend to obscure real personal tragedies such as the deaths of a two-year-old toddler, Andrew Morton, in Glasgow, and 12 year-old Alex Cole, in Doncaster. Our hearts go out to their families and friends, who have had to cope with those tragic events.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/20">We already have a wide range of controls regulating the use of air weapons and it is important that they are enforced. But we need to go further and take action at source to control who can sell air weapons. That is why we will make it an offence to sell air weapons by way of trade or business without being registered with the police as a firearms dealer. Sales will also be subject to a requirement for all weapons to be handed over on a face-to-face basis, which will ensure that ages can be checked and address the risk of under-age purchases through the internet or mail order. We will also raise the minimum age for possessing an air weapon from 17 to 18: we believe that much of the misuse is attributed to young people. They will, of course, still be able to use air weapons under supervision.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/21">Making sure that ammunition is not easily obtained is an important element in tackling gun crime, and we are aware that some criminals try to escape prosecution by holding ammunition in its component form, rather than assembled rounds. Ammunition is essentially useless without a primer and we see no reason why people should be able to buy primers unless they have a genuine reason for possessing them. We are therefore introducing a requirement that primers are sold only to those who hold an appropriate firearms certificate. We are similarly looking to restrict the purchase and sale of ammunition loading presses.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/22">On Clauses 32 to 37, we were never under any illusion that defining a realistic imitation firearm would be easy, but we simply could not allow the situation to continue where they were increasingly used to commit crime or to cause fear on the streets. The statistics are frightening, the reality even more so.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/23">Imitation firearms were used in 3,333 crimes in 2003&ndash;04, an increase of 55 per cent on the previous year&mdash;and that on top of previous rises of 18 per cent and 46 per cent. If we exclude air weapons offences, this represents nearly one-third of all firearms crime. This is all the more worrying when we consider that over 80 per cent of these offences were violence against the person. I hope we can all agree that being threatened with a realistic imitation can be just as traumatic as the real thing.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/24">We are therefore proposing to make it an offence to manufacture, import or sell a realistic imitation firearm, by which we mean an imitation of so realistic an appearance as to make it indistinguishable for all practical purposes from a real firearm. We understand the need for objectivity if this law is to be properly enforced, which is why we have tightened up during the passage of the Bill the process governing what can and cannot be regarded as a realistic imitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/25">The definition specifically excludes deactivated firearms and imitations of antiques, as well as any imitations which are antiques in their own right. I know that some collectors of real antique firearms are concerned that we have used 1870 as a reference point when there is no fixed date for antiques in the firearms Acts. I should explain that this date was chosen because it was only after then that the manufacture of a particular type of breech-loading firearm became widespread. I am happy to put on the record that we see this date as having relevance only to the Violent Crime Reduction Bill; it has no effect on the provisions of the Firearms Act 1968 which deal with the status of real antique firearms. I hope that noble Lords opposite will derive a certain degree of pleasure from what I have said on that point today.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/26">We believe that, taken together, these measures will go a long way towards capping off the future supply of realistic imitation firearms used to threaten, intimidate or rob, while still allowing certain legitimate uses to continue. Quite apart from the need to impose more stringent restrictions on realistic imitation firearms, we also need to ensure that other imitations are not capable of misuse. It is for this reason that we are seeking a power to make regulations requiring them to conform to specifications.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/27">Too often we hear of police armed response units being called out to deal with incidents of people seen brandishing guns, only for them to find that it is youngsters messing around, with little appreciation of the consequences and the risk of being shot in the confusion of the moment. It would be sensible, therefore, to introduce a minimum age for the purchase of any imitation firearm, and we propose to set this at 18. And lest anyone think it is okay to mess about in public with an imitation gun of any description, the Bill increases the maximum penalty for possessing an imitation firearm in a public place without lawful authority or reasonable excuse from six months to 12 months.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/28">Part 2 also contains measures to deal with those who carry knives and other offensive weapons with the intention of causing harm to others. We fully support the work of the police in tackling knife crime. There are many dedicated, intelligence-led operations going on up and down the country, such as Operation Blunt in London, and we are preparing, in partnership with the Association of Chief Police Officers, for a nationwide knife amnesty, which will run from <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May</phrase> until the end of June.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/29">The Government also recognise the important part played by communities in addressing knife crime. We have this year put &pound;2 million from recycled criminal assets into projects working against gun and knife crimes and issues involving gangs across England and Wales. However, we believe that more needs to be done to help prevent young people, in particular, getting hold of knives. It is currently an offence to sell a knife to a person under the age of 16; Clause 38 increases the age to 18.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/30">The Bill also introduces a power for head teachers in state and independent schools in England and Wales&mdash;if the Assembly wishes to commence the power there&mdash;to search any pupils or their possessions if it is suspected that they are carrying a weapon such as a knife. On the whole, schools are orderly and well managed and most pupils never carry a knife. This proposal is directed at the very few young people who ignore the law and take an illegal knife on to school premises. The Bill also provides an equivalent power in relation to further education institutions and attendance centres for young people.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/31">Part 3 deals with a range of issues, including football-related disorder, sexual offences and mobile phones. The football World Cup and the measures being taken to prevent English troublemakers travelling to the tournament have received a good deal of publicity in recent weeks. It is an area where a great deal has been achieved, but there can be no grounds for complacency. The Bill introduces measures extending the ticket-touting laws to cover the sale of unauthorised tickets on the internet and makes permanent and fine-tunes the banning order arrangements introduced by the Football Disorder Act 2000.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/32">The Bill also introduces measures to ensure that we remain able to take effective action against those who pose a risk of serious sexual harm to our communities. These include amending the Sexual Offences Act 2003 to restore the power to order the forfeiture and detention of vehicles used by those engaged in the inhumane trade of trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/33">Noble Lords will know that the Bill is part of a very full agenda of the Government's work to build on our success in reducing violent crime. It complements our citizen-focused approach to neighbourhood policing by giving communities the powers they need to respond quickly and creatively to local problems, in particular alcohol-related violence and disorder. But it also recognises that tough action needs to be taken to prevent those more serious violent crimes involving weapons. That is why we are making weapons harder to get hold of and making sure that there are appropriately stiff penalties in place for those who break the law.</p>
	<p pid="a.808.1/34">I apologise for taking a little longer than I would normally, but I hope that these helpful indications of how we will progress this matter will leave noble Lords less troubled than they would otherwise have been, and that they can therefore, perhaps, make shorter contributions. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-03-29a.815.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100016" speakername="Baroness Anelay of St Johns" colon=":" colnum="815"  time="018:24:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60329-12.htm#60329-12_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.815.0/1">My Lords, as ever, I thank the Minister for her explanation of the Bill. We always seem to be on a treadmill with Home Office Bills&mdash;as one goes, another one comes along.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/2">Crime statistics are trotted out by the Government to paint a picture of a Britain where crime is reducing, but we know that British crime survey figures are systematically flawed; they are not comprehensive and they omit murder, sexual offences and crimes against people under the age of 16 altogether. In the case of violent crime, they are contradicted by the recorded crime figures and by everyone's everyday experience. According to the international crime victimisation survey, Britain has the second highest levels of criminality in the industrialised world.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/3">At one end of the spectrum, we read of the appalling crimes of violence where law-abiding people are attacked as they walk home after a night out or unsuspectingly answer the door of their home to robbers. At the other end, we hear stories of fines being dished out to people who drop their junk mail into street litter bins or of ASBOs being imposed on those who are a suicide risk.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/4">We could argue the toss over the accuracy of crime figures until the end of this Government, but in the spirit of being constructive about this modest Bill, which tinkers at the edges of violent crime, I shall concentrate on the proposals in the Bill and our response to them.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/5">I have to observe that the Government obviously see no urgency about the Bill. Otherwise, why would they leave it mouldering on the shelf for so long? It had its Second Reading in another place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-20">20 June</phrase> last year and its First Reading in this House on <phrase class="date" code="">15 November</phrase> last year. Nineteen weeks have passed since the Bill reached this House. It is interesting to learn a little today of what I hope has been rather more progress by the Government in that time, particularly on drafting regulations. I welcome the moves that the noble Baroness announced today, particularly in accepting the recommendations of the Delegated Powers and Regulatory Reform Committee and the other matters to which she referred.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/6">I would be grateful if the Minister could also tell us what progress the Government have made with regard to the policy detail of the alcohol disorder zone regulations. I note in particular a letter written by her right honourable friend Hazel Blears to my honourable friend Humfrey Malins on <phrase class="date" code="">10 November</phrase> last year, which stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/7" class="indent">&quot;We are still working on the policy detail of the Alcohol Disorder Zone regulations, but hope to be able to have them in draft form as soon as possible&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/8">Will we have a sight of those before Committee and, if not, why not? Perhaps they might even be available today. As I have said in debates on previous Bills, I live in hope&mdash;always the optimist.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/9">I am grateful to the noble Baroness for referring to amendments that the Government will bring forward in Committee with regard to the treatment of those who have alcohol disorder-related problems. We will look at those with great care, but the principle is of course to be welcomed.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/10">What progress have the Government made on their plans to consult those businesses that will be penalised by the introduction of the alcohol disorder zones? What progress have they made on consultation with those who have an interest in legislation on air guns and imitation firearms? Will further amendments be brought forward in Committee to improve the Bill as a result?</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/11">There are many parts of the Bill that we can support outright. Others we will support only subject to the important caveat of making sure that they are both fair and effective in their scope and application. We welcome the greater powers to be given to courts to allow them to ban individuals from drinking in pubs and clubs in a defined area for a given length of time. There is no doubt that local authorities need powers to control local drinking hotspots, and giving courts the chance to focus on serial disorderly drinkers who populate such places should, we hope, be of some help.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/12">There are a few issues that we will need to examine carefully in Committee to make sure that the scheme works better. It seems odd that licensees who control their premises impeccably should have to pay for the cost of dealing with the disorder caused by others who may not even be licensees. We will want to examine whether it is possible to give the local authority a measure of discretion in how it imposes charges on local businesses.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/13">We want to examine whether the Bill treats consultation in the right way. It does not at the moment, for example, seem to specify that businessmen and women from our ethnic communities should be included formally in the consultation process. We shall table amendments in Committee to address that issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/14">We support the proposals to create the offence of using an accomplice to conceal weapons. There is evidence that a number of cases are not prosecuted for lack of a weapon, so the provision may well help to convict more criminals.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/15">We on the Front Bench support the extension of the age limit for the purchase of air guns. I anticipate that those on my Back Benches who have long experience of the needs of rural areas may take an alternative view. I recognise fully that the lawful use of guns is an essential part of many areas of rural life and the rural economy. While this Bill is well intentioned, my noble friends will want to ensure that it will not prejudice the interests of those whose livelihoods are based in the rural community.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/16">We agree with the Government that there is a problem with replica firearms, which can be used to terrorise the public. They make life difficult and downright dangerous for the police, and they can lead to tragedy. However, the age-old problem of definition plagues this part of the Bill. I welcomed the Minister's further explanation of the term &quot;antique&quot;. I and others will look carefully at her assurances regarding Clause 34(8), which relates to realistic imitation firearms pre-dating 1870.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/17">I always take very seriously assurances that are given at the Dispatch Box. Due to a domestic circumstance, I take them perhaps even more seriously this week than I might have done a week or so ago. As the Minister knows, my husband is a practising lawyer. He brought to my attention an exchange of views between the noble Baroness and me a little while ago during the passage of the Extradition Act. He showed me a recent decision by the Court of Appeal on the matter of <i>habeas corpus</i>. A categorical assurance about <i>habeas corpus</i> given to me by the Minister in response to an amendment was deemed by the Court of Appeal to be a clarification of the law, and it made a decision in an extradition case based on her assurance. So I take those matters seriously. We will need to see whether the definition that she has provided today goes far enough. I hope that it does.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/18">Other aspects of the definition of &quot;realistic imitation firearm&quot; also cause a problem. The Government made some sensible progress in another place, but we will need to examine further whether their objectives are fully met without causing the honest person to lose the opportunity to carry out his legal pastime, particularly those who engage in airsoft activities. I confess that, before this Bill came along, I had never heard of airsoft. When I did, I mistakenly thought that it was rather like paintball. I am grateful to the Association of British Airsoft for its careful briefing on this matter and for the time that it has taken with me. I now appreciate that the amendments which the Government passed in another place may not have had quite the beneficial effect that they intended and that the future of airsoft is still under threat.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/19">In addition, it seems that the new defences to the offence of possessing an imitation firearm do not fully cover historical re-enactors and those who run private museums and galleries. We will table amendments which examine that matter further. I understand that Hazel Blears is still in contact with some of the organisations that are interested in this part of the Bill&mdash;for example, the Association of British Airsoft. That is a constructive approach, and I hope that we will be able to make further progress in this House as a result.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/20">We are puzzled that the Government have still failed to carry out their commitment to establish a firearms committee of experts. We shall table an amendment which asks them to justify their inaction.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/21">The Bill deals also with weapons of a different kind: knives. There has been a sharp increase in knife killings since 1988 and the number of offences has gone up by 17 per cent. That clearly has to be tackled, but how? One does not prevent a crime by banning the weapons with which it is committed, although one may be able to limit its incidence and its effects. Rather, one prevents crime by detecting it, punishing it and, in the case of violent crime, keeping those responsible out of circulation and in prison for the safety of the public. We question whether the Government have had any great success on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/22">It is now proposed to increase the age at which knives can be bought legally. Somebody will be able to marry at 16, but not buy a knife to use in their kitchen. There is no reason to believe that the new offence will be effective. There is no shortage of knives in circulation and, with or without the Bill, there is unlikely to be a shortage in the future. A MORI poll in 2004 revealed that a quarter of children aged between 12 and 16 admitted to carrying a knife. Almost one in five of them said that they had attacked someone intending to do injury. That is a horrific statistic. If we want to reduce knife crime, we should focus on those who use the knives, not only on those who buy them.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/23">We support provisions throughout Part 3 of the Bill, as they tidy up a range of measures, from those tackling football disorder to others that strengthen the law on trafficking for sexual exploitation. During my first trawl through the Bill, I considered that the drafting did not require improvement. So this may be a first in my time speaking on home affairs since 2002, in that I shall not table any amendments to clauses in a part of a government Bill. I celebrate that&mdash;and the Minister may be rather relieved.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/24">Finally, there are a couple of measures that I shall seek to add to the Bill, which we hope the Government may find useful. They are put forward in a constructive spirit, and I shall table the new clauses tomorrow to make provision for them. The first is for a new criminal offence of &quot;happy slapping&quot;. Noble Lords will be all too aware from press reports that there has been much concern about the prevalence of a new sort of activity among people who have ready access to a mobile phone that takes still or video pictures and who use that phone to record a criminal event&mdash;usually a group kicking, beating or raping an individual. The pictures are then transmitted to others on the basis that they can all have a good laugh at the victim and applaud the criminal. That is a despicable way in which to behave.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/25">The new offence that I hope to introduce would make it illegal for any person intentionally to make an audio or visual recording of a criminal offence for the purpose of obtaining gratification for himself or another. I stressed the words &quot;intentionally&quot;, &quot;purpose&quot; and &quot;gratification&quot; for the very simple purpose of explaining that I believe that in that way I would ensure that those who record criminal events for the purposes of prosecuting the same are not caught by my proposed offence. I am thinking not only of the police or journalists, but also of the quick-thinking members of the public who took pictures in London of the consequences of the July bombings, for example. They are to be praised and would not fall foul of my proposed offence.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/26">My second proposal addresses the needs of those of our Olympians who excel at shooting events. At present, it is almost impossible for those who wish to participate in the pistol events to train properly without heavy financial burdens and the need to travel outside UK jurisdiction, which act as disincentives. We think it right that we work with the Government to introduce measures that would enable our shooting sportsmen and women to equip and train themselves in the UK for the Olympics when they are held in London in 2012. My noble friend Lord Glentoran will lead us on these matters. I shall give a little support, but he will do the redoubtable work on it.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/27">We shall seek to allow a person to have an authorised pistol, subject to several very severe conditions, giving the Secretary of State some very strong backstop powers. It will be vital to ensure that there is strict control so that the ownership and use of single-shot pistols is restricted to those who are training to take part in the Olympics in London. We must ensure that there is a time limit, so that sportspeople do not benefit from the relaxation of existing rules until <phrase class="date" code="">1 January 2010</phrase>&mdash;that date might ring in the Minister's ears after our recent vote. That is two years in advance of the London Olympics. It is a date of my own choosing, unlike the one in the matter on which we have just voted. If the Government can find another and better way by which they can guarantee that our participants in the London Olympics will be able to practise within the UK, I shall be happy to discuss it with them.</p>
	<p pid="a.815.0/28">Overall, this is a well intentioned Bill, but one that merely tinkers at the edges of what we really need&mdash;a significant reduction in violent crime. Nevertheless, like the Minister, we look forward to a constructive and lively, if perhaps not too lively, time in Committee.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-03-29a.825.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100241" speakername="Lord Glentoran" colon=":" colnum="825"  time="019:03:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60329-14.htm#60329-14_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.825.0/1">My Lords, I am delighted to follow the noble Lord, Lord Pendry. Not for the first time&mdash;and, I am sure, not for the last&mdash;the Government Front Bench will find itself, on one issue at least, in a small squeeze between the noble Lord and myself.</p>
	<p pid="a.825.0/2">I want to suggest to the noble Baroness that we should correct a couple of previous pieces of legislation involving sport. She will be aware of the Private Security Industry Act 2001 and its intention to raise the standards of the security industry in relation to licensed premises and to reduce criminality within the security industry. However, is she aware that the regulating authority&mdash;the Security Industry Authority&mdash; has subsequently sought to include stewards at sports grounds and major sports events? I am led to understand that even the PGA European Tour open golf championship, the Olympics, when they come, and all other major sports events of that nature could fall, as they do at present under the law, within that remit. This potentially causes a huge financial and administrative burden to all the sports involved.</p>
	<p pid="a.825.0/3">I understand that arrangements are already in place for football events under a separate regulatory framework, and rightly so. The noble Lord, Lord Pendry, knows considerably more about the football world than I do. However, during the initial consultation on the licensing of door supervisors et cetera, and in the accompanying regulatory impact assessment, it was not made explicit that the proposals would apply in the case of other sports events. Nor were representative bodies on the consultation lists. This seems to suggest that sporting events were not intended to come within the scope of this Act. The Minister for Sport, Richard Caborn, has said that in other places. It may well have been an oversight that they were not excluded from the Act in the same way as cinemas and theatres were.</p>
	<p pid="a.825.0/4">I understand that, as of last week, it has become illegal to work as a security guard without an SIA license, which means that organisers of sports events are now&mdash;today&mdash;potentially criminally liable for using unlicensed stewards. I also understand that consultation is going on between those representing sports events organisers and the Home Office. While this consultation is going on, however, members of the sports industry have been left in uncertainty about whether they will fall foul of the Act. As I understand it, they are relying solely on an informal agreement with the police that they will not be prosecuted. I am sure noble Lords will agree that that is an unsatisfactory state of affairs.</p>
	<p pid="a.825.0/5">The Bill presents us with an opportunity to rectify this unfortunate situation. I ask the Minister to table an amendment in Committee through which we can agree to sort this out, or perhaps I could speak to officials outside the Chamber and try to draft an opposition amendment that might satisfy the Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.825.0/6">The second issue is another problem caused by previous legislation which also was mentioned earlier today by my noble friend Lady Anelay. It is the effect of firearms legislation on the ability of our pistol-shooting athletes to compete with foreign competitors on an equal footing. I acknowledge the sensitive nature of this issue. The Firearms (Amendment) Act 1997 was passed after the terrible events at Dunblane. However, the ban on sporting handguns has had a disproportionate effect on would-be international and Olympic competitors who wish to represent their country in a perfectly legitimate activity.</p>
	<p pid="a.825.0/7">I accept that there is a massive gun crime problem in the United Kingdom, but I am afraid that, since 1997, the current system has proved ineffective in preventing the rise in gun crime, while jeopardising the UK's medal-winning attempts for the London 2012 Olympics. Three of the 15 Olympic shooting disciplines involve the use of banned cartridge-firing pistols, but the current situation means that our athletes have to store their weapons and train abroad for these events at great expense and inconvenience. I understand that, for the Manchester Commonwealth Games in 2002, special licenses had to be issued to allow the English team to import their pistols into the UK. While this may provide a temporary and expedient solution for a specific event, it does not address the lack of opportunity for young pistol shots to train regularly and cheaply. As the Government have just set a target of the UK being in the top four of the final medal ratings for the 2012 Olympics, now would be an excellent time to remove this impediment to our medal-winning hopes. I understand that the Great Britain Target Shooting Federation is in talks with the Home Office on this issue. The last thing I would wish would be for anything to jeopardise a successful outcome to those discussions, but given the context of the Bill, now would seem an appropriate moment to ask Her Majesty's Government what their intentions are in this matter.</p>
	<p pid="a.825.0/8">I look forward to hearing the Minister's response and to further discussions on the detail of the legislation at a later date.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-03-29a.837.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100634" speakername="Lord Thomas of Gresford" colon=":" colnum="837"  time="019:49:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60329-17.htm#60329-17_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.837.0/1">My Lords, I join the noble Lords, Lord Graham of Edmonton and Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, in wondering why the legislation that is already in existence has not been enforced to the degree that it might have been. It is undoubtedly the case that the enforcement of that legislation has weakened, and I share with the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, a concern that the new powers granted in the Bill be used. I shall look forward to his amendments to monitor these powers and see whether they are being put to effective use.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/2">We seem to be faced today with a youth culture which is fuelled perhaps by greater wealth&mdash;more money in the pocket&mdash;and certainly by cheaper and stronger drinks. The sorts of drinks that are customarily consumed are probably three times the strength of the Wrexham lager which I used to drink in my youth. Consequently, a youth culture exists. The night economy, which is a new phrase that I have heard in connection with this Bill, arises out of the youth culture. The Minister promised us a new civic order, but I hope that she will bear in mind that she should be legislating for the safety of the young in a young environment. We do not want to see our streets made safe only for those of more mature years.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/3">How do we deal with binge drinking? In a press release of <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-07">7 February</phrase> last year, the Association of Chief Police Officers stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/4" class="indent">&quot;We are never going to solve the problem through enforcement alone as enforcement only deals with the symptoms and not the cause. ACPO continues to stress the importance of a far more holistic approach that includes dealing with the culture of excessive drinking and the need for all of the drinks industry to adopt a responsible attitude. Our fear is that we will never solve the problem if we do not address its underlying causes&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/5">I am pleased to see moves to ban &quot;happy hours&quot; and the provision of cheap drink at an early time in the evening. We have yet to see whether, in the youth centres where the night economy flourishes, we will all be sipping wine on the pavement as we were promised in previous legislation that went through this House.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/6">I welcome the amendments that the Minister has promised to help deal with the problems of drink. It is interesting that 87 per cent of the participants in the Dudley alcohol arrest referral scheme, to which the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, referred, are recorded to have had positive experiences and have been helped. We suggest that the Government build on that pilot by putting forward a national programme, as Alcohol Concern has suggested.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/7">For a drinking banning order to be made, there is no requirement, as is the case with ASBOs, that the conduct complained of,</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/8" class="indent">&quot;caused, or is likely to cause, harassment, alarm or distress to others&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/9">That is necessary for an ASBO to be made. Therefore, conduct of which people merely disapprove is within the scope of drinking banning orders. You do not have to show that anybody is alarmed or harassed. That means that the order is broadly available.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/10">I am one of those who have always been a critic of ASBOs, because it is just a device to make a civil order on a lower standard of proof and with lower standards of evidence&mdash;hearsay evidence has always been accepted. The case of McCann, however, which came before this House on appeal, has made a significant difference by requiring a full criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt for an ASBO. I hope that the Minister will give us an assurance that a similar standard of proof will be required in the making of drinking banning orders. However, the Government have conceded that a breach of a drinking banning order will not lead to imprisonment, as they had originally suggested. That is where the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Worcester may take some comfort in his concern with how many more would be incarcerated as a result of this Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/11">But then there are other vague areas that we need to explore. The scope of the order is to impose any prohibition. ASBOs have been issued in strange circumstances, and I imagine that we will be reading in the popular press in due course that peculiar conditions and prohibitions have been placed on these drinking banning orders as well, as they are qualified only by provisions that they do not exclude a person going home, to work or to school.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/12">The provisions are then concerned with disorderly conduct under the influence of alcohol&mdash;not that a person is drunk but that he acts in a disorderly way under the influence of alcohol. Very few people in this country have not come within that definition at some time in their lives. The order is made if it,</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/13" class="indent">&quot;is necessary to protect relevant persons from further conduct by him of that kind&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/14">That is a safeguard; it has to be shown that it is &quot;necessary&quot;; but there is no question whether, although necessary, it is an appropriate order to make&mdash;and when you are dealing with people who are suffering from some form of mental illness, that is a matter of importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/15">The interim orders proposed under Clause 8 are made without notice to the individual concerned and can be renewed indefinitely. We shall be looking to see what we can do to ensure that there is a finite period for which an interim order can be made against a person who has no notice of it.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/16">Another matter that is controversial is what is thought to be the &quot;badge of shame&quot;; of naming and shaming young people who are subject to these orders. It may well be thought to be a badge of honour to have your picture up in the local newsagent as a person against whom one of these DBOs has been made. It is contrary to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which says:</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/17" class="indent">&quot;States parties recognise the right of every child alleged as, accused of, or recognised as having infringed the penal law to be treated in a manner consistent with the promotion of the child's sense of dignity and worth, which reinforces the child's respect for the human rights and fundamental freedoms of others and which takes into account the child's age and the desirability of promoting the child's reintegration and the child's assuming a constructive role in society&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/18">Naming and shaming and putting up photographs of people who are subject to ASBOs has taken place, and it is a very controversial area that we need to look at closely in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/19">As for the alcohol disorder zones, we support the concept that there should be a mechanism that holds licensees accountable for the impact that their businesses have on local communities. We welcome the idea that they should contribute to the costs of disorder in their particular area. But I share the doubts of the noble Lord, Lord Graham, and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, who referred to the provision as rather odd, and of the noble Lord, Lord Brooke of Alverthorpe, who said that there was no distinction between the good and the bad operator. I do not know that I quite followed the noble Lord, Lord Brooke, when he said that the mere presence of a number of licensed premises creates a rowdy scene, so they may as well all pay, but I may have misunderstood his argument. But I think that there should be a discretion to share the costs fairly and that the good licensee should not be penalised in the same way as a bad licensee.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/20">No distinction is drawn between the types of operation. The noble Lord, Lord Graham, made this point very strongly a moment ago, and my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones pointed out that there is a distinction between a public house, off-licences and so on, so we should look at that. Nor is a cap proposed on the amount of the charge. When Hazel Blears was asked in another place whether there was a cap or whether the whole cost was to be spread among licensed premises, she said:</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/21" class="indent">&quot;I am mindful of the fact that charges need to be set at a level that enables the police and local authorities to recover the costs of the extra enforcement activity&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/22">So initially you get the impression that they are going to pay for everything.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/23" class="indent">&quot;However, charges should not be set at a level that is so high that it could have almost the reverse effect and push people into economic non-viability&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons Standing Committee B, 18/10/05; col. 107.]</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/24">That requires some clarification.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/25">There is no time limit to these alcohol disorder zones, and therefore no incentive for local authorities to bring to an end the revenue that ADZs will bring; and, as my noble friend Lord Clement-Jones said, there is no appeal. There are matters to look at. While we are in favour of it in principle, we do not think the scheme as proposed is without flaw.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/26">As for directions to individuals to leave a particular locality, they give a wide power to the police. A person can be ordered away although he has done nothing wrong&mdash;presence in the locality is enough&mdash;and the police constable is the sole arbiter of whether the individual is likely to cause or contribute to the occurrence of alcohol-related crime or disorder, or indeed whether it is necessary for him to be told to leave. There is no appeal. Liberty has helpfully quoted from another case from the Appeal Committee in the House of Lords: Gillan v Commissioner of Police for the Metropolis and another. The legality of a broadly drafted power&mdash;Section 44 of the Terrorism Act 2000&mdash;was being considered. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Bingham, said,</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/27" class="indent">&quot;The exercise of power by public officials, as it affects members of the public, must be governed by clear and publicly-accessible rules of law. The public must not be vulnerable to interference by public officials acting on any personal whim, caprice, malice, predilection or purpose other than that for which the power was conferred. This is what, in this context, is meant by arbitrariness, which is the antithesis of legality. This is the test which any interference with or derogation from a Convention right must meet if a violation is to be avoided&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/28">What we do not want, in a crowded scene late at night, is for policemen, without proper reason, to be pushing people about, ordering them out of the locality and telling them not to come back for 48 hours, as the Bill envisaged. Will guidance be given to police officers on how these powers should be exercised?</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/29">With regard to firearms, I fully support the offence of using someone to &quot;mind&quot; a weapon. That frequently happens. I have had experience of it. I have nothing to add to the way the Bill is framed except to commend it, but I do oppose the minimum sentence provisions in this regard in Clause 24(4) and (5), which we will need to look at, particularly when it concerns children of 16 and 17. We have been around the course a few times on minimum sentences, but what this really does is take away the discretion a judge should exercise in this area. Regarding air guns, the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, asked if this was all cosmetic. I wonder that, too. I declare that I do not shoot and have never shot, but I have been shot by an air gun, when I was quite young. I remember it well, and very painful it was.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/30">I support responsible shooting for both pest control and sport. The noble Earl, Lord Shrewsbury, has outlined with enthusiasm the importance of shooting and its success as a sport. I commend him for that. But short of making a gesture, it is not clear what the Government are about with regard to air guns. They do not try and ban air guns; indeed, the Home Office consultation paper of May 2004 says:</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/31" class="indent">&quot;We do not believe that licensing of low-powered airguns and imitations, or restrictions on their sale, is proportionate or enforceable&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/32">The Government have changed their mind since then, and I want to know why. Was it cosmetic, or a gesture, or what?</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/33">Take, for example, the phrase &quot;purchased by a licensed dealer&quot;. We know that other guns are subject to licensing and certification and can be traced after sale, but, as has been pointed out, there are 7 million air guns in circulation which certainly cannot be traced, so how can purchase from a registered dealer have anything to do with that? I refer to face-to-face sales designed to cut out mail order sales. Why is that?</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/34">There are many other matters. I see that time is getting on and I shall not weary your Lordships further except to refer, finally, to searching by teachers. We shall need to look closely at that very important matter. What are &quot;reasonable grounds&quot; for believing that a schoolboy or schoolgirl is carrying a weapon? I refer to the bulge in the pocket and the emotional volatility that have already been mentioned. There has to be guidance. When is such action appropriate? Is it appropriate to take it to protect another child or a teacher when it is not possible to call the police? How is it to be carried out? Surely it should be carried out by designated teachers who have been trained not just in what is meant by the use of reasonable force but also in how to deal with armed people. I was involved in the tragic case of the stabbing of the headmaster, Philip Lawrence&mdash;it had a substantial effect on me&mdash;which concerned the carrying of knives by young people. It is a difficult and dangerous area. There should at least be another teacher present, and not &quot;another person&quot;, as it says in the Bill. We shall have to consider how the search is carried out and make sure that there is sensitivity to ethnic differences and so on. There is a lot of material there that we shall look at closely in Committee.</p>
	<p pid="a.837.0/35">The Bill will be very welcome once we have looked at it and perhaps improved it, and once we are sure that it will be put into effect and enforced. I am sure that if we can do that, this will be a safer country.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-03-29a.843.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100574" speakername="Baroness Scotland of Asthal" colon=":" colnum="843"  time="020:15:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60329-18.htm#60329-18_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.843.0/1">My Lords, I endorse straightaway what the noble Viscount, Lord Bridgeman, said about the constructive tone of the debate. We have assent from all Benches that these are issues with which we must grapple. I very much accept the pithy and telling comments made by the noble Viscount that the devil is often in the detail. We need to be proportionate and ensure that we do only that which is necessary. I respectfully agree with him on that. I commend, welcome and celebrate the comments made by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, in relation to her restraint on Part 3. She is an exemplar I ask others to follow.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/2">I say, too, on a serious note that we do not see the Bill as a panacea to all ills. It is not, but it is a valiant and appropriate contribution to the tool kit that we think we need as a community to respond to difficult and pressing problems with which we are jointly faced. The tasks that the Bill will address are important.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/3">We very much take on board the comments made by the right reverend Prelate on the need to ensure that the offences that we have are necessary. I endorse the comments made by the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, about the drink banning orders. They do not contain a provision regarding imprisonment, but they contain an appropriate community intervention in relation to responding to a difficult problem&mdash;and with support.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/4">The Bill must be seen alongside all the other measures that we are taking on health and education to try to change the culture to which the noble Lord, Lord Thomas of Gresford, referred. I agree that there is a need to address the underlying problem of alcohol misuse. That is why we are introducing new clauses to enable individuals to take a course to address their alcohol misuse and behaviour.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/5">I very much endorse what was said by my noble friend Lord Brooke, who made some powerful points not only in support of the Bill, but in directing our minds and attention to the work that is being done more broadly to support the reduction of abuse of alcohol. I assure him that the Government and the Department of Health are convening a group with industry representatives specifically to consider labelling and the sensible-drinking message. The undertaking given in the Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy is to review the strategy in 2007.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/6">Of course, the Government are continually assessing the impact of new developments and will respond accordingly. They are involved in alcohol referral schemes in a number of areas, and the Home Office, through the conditional caution pilots and the custody referral schemes for drink and capacity, is dealing with that too. The Department of Health and the screening and brief intervention pilots are seeking to make a contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/7">The Minister with responsibility for alcohol matters in the Home Office is my honourable friend Paul Goggins. He met representatives of the Aquarius scheme in Dudley and has asked officials to explore alcohol referral schemes in detail. In saying that, I hope that I can reassure noble Lords that we are taking these issues absolutely seriously. I know that that is certain to be a satisfaction to the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and others who have raised them this evening.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/8">I could excite your Lordships by giving a long catalogue of further things that we are doing in that regard, but perhaps we can wait until we come to Committee. The noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, and others sought to indicate that we are not enforcing the current law, but we are doing so. The figures are not going down. If one looks at the figures for the number of defendants proceeded against in the magistrates' court and found guilty, and sentenced at all courts for offences in England and Wales, the figures for enforcement of drunk and disorderly behaviour have gone up, not down. We can track the figures from 1993 to 2003. I shall give the headline figure. In 1993 it was 20,578; in 2003 it was 31,343. We know that prosecution is not the only answer; education, intervention and the help and support programmes are also of critical importance.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/9">The Government's commitment is evidenced in this Bill. It is clear that we have already taken many steps to enhance our performance and that has been beneficial. I have touched on the subject of the behaviour orders, and from what noble Lords across the House have said about them it is clear that we all think they will be beneficial and supportive, particularly if we rely on the additional support that I have indicated we will bring forward in future.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/10">It is right that we consider alcohol disorder zones. I very much welcome the support from right round the House in that respect, but there is a huge amount of detail. That detail was questioned in the other place and we have to consider it here. I can assure noble Lords that we are giving it the most anxious and acute consideration.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/11">The issues raised by noble Lords are valid and we want to be able to make an appropriate response. I hope that I have reassured the House that we do not see alcohol disorder zones as the first port of call, but very much as the last after the action plans and using the available licensing provisions. But they may be a useful tool. However, we will return to those many complex and detailed issues in Committee. I hope that I will be able to better satisfy my noble friend Lord Graham, the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones, the noble Baroness, the noble Viscount and others who raised those matters. They are proper issues and we will have to deal with them in detail.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/12">As I have already indicated, we will also be following the recommendations on the affirmative resolution. Therefore, we will have another opportunity, even after the passage of this Bill, to ensure that we get it right&mdash;a point echoed by the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/13">With regard to alcohol disorder zones, I hope that I can also reassure my noble friend Lord Graham that the size of the area that might be designated is of acute concern to us. We do not think that it would be appropriate for the whole of a local authority's area to be so designated without very powerful information to justify it. The ADZs will be very tightly drawn around specific areas&mdash;perhaps a very few streets&mdash;which is why we have defined them as I have just indicated.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/14">We consulted the industry on ADZs. Proposals for them were included in our consultation paper, <i>Drinking Responsibly: The Government's Proposals</i>, published in January 2005, and Ministers and officials met the industry in the summer and autumn of 2005 to discuss these matters. We will continue to consult the industry on the orders, including the guidance, as the Bill requires us to do. Noble Lords will also see that the Bill provides for a 28-day consultation period in areas where ADZs are proposed. I know that that consultation concerns the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay, acutely.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/15">The Licensing Act&mdash;a matter raised by the noble Lord, Lord Clement-Jones&mdash;strengthens the powers available to local partners to take tough action against irresponsible operators. We hope that the ADZs will build on that strong foundation. We will continue to look at how we can better support responsible drinking. The responsible drinking consultation paper said that the link between sale and consumption and a particular premise and disorder may be tenuous. That is not the same as saying that the link between alcohol and disorder is tenuous, but we can address that at a later stage.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/16">I now turn to the issues relating to guns. I found the comments of the noble Earl, Lord Erroll, interesting, but I rather agree with the noble Viscount that his interpretation was somewhat alarming. We think it sensible to restrict access to dangerous weapons used in violent crime but, as I said earlier, there is much to be done in addressing the gun culture. Last year, the &pound;2 million from recycled criminal assets was used on anti-gun projects. The Connected Fund was launched in 2004 and it has given support to more than 200 community groups working to tackle gun crime and related matters. That is an issue on which we have to work quite hard.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/17">I know that the matter of private museums has excited the attention of the noble Earl, Lord Shrewsbury, and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay. I am pleased to be able to give a bit of pleasure right at the beginning, so that we may have a slightly happier time than otherwise. We have in Clause 33 already provided defences where the imitation firearm is made available for the purposes of a museum or gallery. We accept that this may have been drawn a little too tightly, in that it confines the defence to museums that do not distribute any profit that they make. We will therefore extend this defence in Committee, so that certain private museums&mdash;which are open to the public as <i>bona fide</i> tourist attractions&mdash;can acquire new exhibits. I hope that your Lordships will think that a sensible and appropriate move.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/18">A number of noble Lords&mdash;the noble Lord, Lord Glentoran, and, again, the noble Earl, Lord Shrewsbury, and the noble Baroness, Lady Anelay&mdash;raised the issue of pistol sports. I join the noble Earl in celebrating the fantastic shooting results that we have had at the Commonwealth Games. That may indicate that the things that we have done have not inhibited our success, but perhaps that is for another day.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/19">Pistol shooting events will certainly be able to go ahead in 2012 without changes to legislation. We have already said that we will put in place the same arrangements that worked so well for the Manchester Commonwealth Games, involving use of the Home Secretary's powers under Section 5 of the Firearms Act to authorise competitors and officials to possess prohibited handguns for the duration of the games and for the special warm-up events. We will discuss with colleagues in the Department for Culture, Media and Sport what arrangements should be made to allow squads to practise in the United Kingdom in advance of the games. I hope that that, too, has given satisfaction to noble Lords opposite.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/20">The noble Lady raised the issue of airsoft rifles. It has been suggested that we have cast our net a little too wide and that the proposed ban on the manufacture, import and sale of realistic imitation firearms will bear down too hard on people who engage in airsoft activities. While we accept that realism is an important aspect of skirmishing, we can see no good reason why non-realistic guns cannot be used for these activities. The Bill makes provision for size, shape and colour to be taken into account in determining whether an imitation firearm is distinguishable from a real firearm, and airsofters can take advantage of these provisions. We will be looking at this area together, and I assure noble Lords opposite that the Government are trying to be constructive in addressing this issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/21">Noble Lords will know that we received a large response to the consultation on firearms&mdash;around 4,500 submissions. They have all been read and analysed, and we are considering how to proceed. A summary of the responses will be published in due course. We have a duty to act immediately when it becomes apparent that steps are needed to protect public safety; in particular, the increasing use of imitation firearms in crime means that we need to place restrictions on their general availability. I am glad to welcome the comments made in support of that right around the House. I reiterate my thanks for the constructive approach on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/22">My noble friend Lord Pendry made interesting and comprehensive comments on ticket touting. I commend him for his unstinting work in this area over a number of years. The provisions in the Bill on ticket touting extend the existing legislation to cover sales over the internet. Ticket touting for football matches has public order consequences, as he has indicated. Unauthorised sales undermine crowd segregation, which is why we are using public order legislation to address touting in football. Similar problems in relation to the potential for disorder do not apply to other sports in the same way. We will, of course, be keeping this issue under review.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/23">I took to heart the concerted three-Bench, three-pronged approach from the noble Lords, Lord Glentoran and Lord Addington, and my noble friend Lord Pendry regarding the application of the licensing provisions in the Private Security Industry Act 2001 to security guards in the sports and events sector. The Bill presents an opportunity to seek views from all concerned. We have today published a consultation document on the application of the licensing provisions and I hope that it will give us an opportunity to look at this issue and get it right. I must say to the noble Lord, Lord Addington, and others who think that we have applied this law by some slip that it is not, as is claimed, an accident that the sports sector was included in the Bill's provisions. The security industry is broad, but we are keen to consult further to ensure that we get it right, that it catches those who should be caught and that another way can be found for those for whom another way should be found.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/24">The noble Baroness touched on the issue of knives. As she rightly said, there is already a range of legislation to tackle the problem of knife crime. It is an offence to carry a knife in a public place without good reason or lawful authority, with the exception of a small, folding pocket-knife. Those found guilty face a penalty of up to two years' imprisonment. The possession of an offensive weapon without lawful authority or reasonable excuse carries a maximum penalty of four years in prison. We are tackling knife crime in a variety of ways. They include a knife amnesty to which I referred earlier that will run in England and Wales from <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-24">24 May</phrase> to <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June</phrase>. The provisions in the Bill particularly focus on problems associated with young people and knives. That is why we are raising the age at which a knife can be purchased to 18 and why we are introducing a power for staff in schools and colleges to search pupils and students for weapons. The Government are committed to tackling violent crime involving knives and offensive weapons and we believe that these measures will make a valuable contribution.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/25">Of course I hear it said that we allow people to get married at 16 but we will not let them buy knives. Well, some people think that it is fairly dangerous to get married at 16. However, it is lawful and has many benefits in terms of stability, security and warmth, among others. Buying knives that are not going to be used for normal proposes is a different matter. We must look at the issue. We have had a problem and it has been highlighted by some tragic consequences. Therefore, we think it necessary to look at the issue in a proportionate, reasonable and appropriate way. I can assure the House that that is how we intend to deal with it.</p>
	<p pid="a.843.0/26">The noble Lord, Lord Thomas, asked about searching pupils for weapons and whether two teachers would be necessary. The Bill provides that searches are carried out only in the presence of another person aged 18 or over and by an individual of the same sex as the pupil being searched. Another adult will be present, but I am sure that the noble Lord does not seek to make a distinction between a teaching assistant and a teacher or some other responsible adult in a school.</p>
