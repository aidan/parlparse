	<p pid="a.609.1/1">My Lords, Amendment No. 5 would prevent civilians who are under 18 years of age from being tried before the court martial. On<phrase class="date" code="2006-10-24">24 October</phrase>, the European Court of Human Rights gave its judgment in the case of Martin. We need to be clear about what it decided.</p>
	<p pid="a.609.1/2">The case was about the son of a serviceman who was tried by court martial in 1995 for the murder of a civilian in Germany. The court martial was subjectto the same objections as were found to exist inthe Findlay case in 1996, which were remedied by the Armed Forces Act 1996. It is no surprise that the European Court decided in Martin that the court martial was not compliant. The European Court did not decide that courts martial should not try civilians, or that they should not try civilian juveniles; it stated the important principle that a military jurisdiction should be exercised over civilians only if there are compelling reasons to do so. In the case of Martin, there was the possibility of civilian trial in the UK because the charge was murder.</p>
	<p pid="a.609.1/3">The European Court did not decide whether there had been compelling reasons for court martial trial. It did not need to, because it decided the case on the basis that the court martial at that time was not compliant. The court did not go into what it thought would be compelling reasons.</p>
	<p pid="a.609.1/4">In the Martincase, the reasons for court martial trial were mainly to do with the availability of witnesses, most of whom were German. However, there were case-specific factors that might have suggested that it would have been better to try him in a UK court: besides his age, Martin was no longer subject to service law; he had been back in the UK for over a year; and his father was no longer in the Army. The European Court commented that it had considerable doubts about whether it would have found the reasons for court martial trial compelling in this particular case.</p>
	<p pid="a.609.1/5">Looking more generally, however, I believe that we should provide for all civilians subject to service discipline to be subject to a system of investigation and trial that will apply the criminal law of England and Wales, that conducts its proceedings in English and that is ECHR compliant. This is especially important for contractors and others who increasingly accompany our forces on operations abroad. It is in the vital interests of the services themselves, of the civilians who live and work with them and of the civilian population among whom they operate that there is a fair and robust system of justice outside the UK to deal with offences by civilians as well as service personnel.</p>
	<p pid="a.609.1/6">We must recognise that the use of civilians deployed with our Armed Forces has increased in recent years. This is the reason for our general approach in this area. But the largest constituency affected is service families overseas, and we realise that some 20,000 or so children accompany them. This presents real challenges. We must accept, however, that from time to time these under-18s may commit serious offences against other service dependants or even against service personnel in UK service bases overseas.</p>
	<p pid="a.609.1/7">In these circumstances, as the noble Lords, Lord Borrie and Lord Kingsland, have said, the foreign local jurisdiction may be highly undesirable. Even if it affords a compliant court, it will not apply the law of England and Wales and may not conduct proceedings in English. If an accused is convicted, his punishment may not be one that exists in the UK and any period of detention would not be served in the UK.</p>
	<p pid="a.609.1/8">Perhaps, however, I can allay some of the fears that noble Lords may have about juveniles routinely being tried by the court martial. This simply will not be the case. In the vast majority of cases, civilians will be tried in the service civilian court, which is of course presided over by a civilian judge advocate. In relation to adults, this court has the same powers as a magistrates' court in England and Wales, which means that for an adult accused it may try any offence that in England would not have to be tried in the Crown court.</p>
	<p pid="a.609.1/9">However, in relation to juveniles, the offences that the service civilian court may try are more numerous. When dealing with a juvenile, the service civilian court has the same powers as a youth court in England and Wales. This means that the service civilian court is able to try any offence of which a juvenile is accused except the homicide offences, certain firearms offences and offences where an adult would face 14 years' imprisonment.</p>
	<p pid="a.609.1/10">Noble Lords will see, therefore, that only in exceptional circumstances would a juvenile civilian appear before the court martial. On those occasions when they do, the court will of course be presided over by a civilian judge advocate who will have had the same training as Crown court judges in relation to juveniles. Furthermore, in the Bill we have the ability to provide that, when civilians appear before the court martial, the lay members are themselves civilians&mdash;indeed, it may be that the entire panel will be civilian. These provisions will be contained in court martial rules, which will be subject to the affirmative resolution procedure, so noble Lords will have adequate opportunity to scrutinise them in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.609.1/11">I hope that the provisions in relation to civilians and juveniles in particular will lead noble Lords to see the amendment as unnecessary and undesirable. In view of the reasons that I have given, I hope that the noble Lord will agree to withdraw his amendment.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-11-06a.613.2" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100778" speakername="Lord Garden" colon=":" colnum="613"  time="016:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/61106-0004.htm#0611066000001">
	<p pid="a.613.2/1">My Lords, I am grateful to the Minister for his agreement on Report that we should defer debating this amendment until Third Reading. Amendment No. 6 seeks to constrain the manner in which those members of the Armed Forces under the age of 18 may be used and treated. There would be a prohibition on service in combat areas, and they would be prohibited from guarding using live weapons. The amendment also requires special handling of those members of the Armed Forces who are under 17.</p>
	<p pid="a.613.2/2">I described in Committee how the amendment would implement the clear recommendations stemming from Nicholas Blake QC's investigation into the tragedy of Deepcut barracks. I also explained our disappointment over the Government's response to the Blake report. I remind your Lordships what the Blake report said. Recommendation 3 was:</p>
	<p pid="a.613.2/3" class="indent">&quot;The Army should plan to eliminate the need for soldiers to join their units in the field army on completion of Phase 1 and 2 training until they reach the age of 18&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.613.2/4">Recommendation 27(iii) said:</p>
	<p pid="a.613.2/5" class="indent">&quot;The minimum age for trained soldiers in the field army to conduct unsupervised armed guard duty should be 18&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.613.2/6">Recommendation 2(i) said:</p>
	<p pid="a.613.2/7" class="indent">&quot;Those under 17 should be trained in establishments exclusive to this age group&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.613.2/8">The Government, in their response to the report, have given various reasons why they are either unwilling or do not have the resources to implement those recommendations.</p>
	<p pid="a.613.2/9">In any event, it should not have needed the horrors that we all read about and debated following Deepcut to make the Government face up to their responsibilities in this area. On <phrase class="date" code="2003-07-24">24 July 2003</phrase>, the United Kingdom ratified the UN optional protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child on the involvement of children in armed conflict. This protocol says in Article 1:</p>
	<p pid="a.613.2/10" class="indent">&quot;States Parties shall take all feasible measures to ensure that members of their armed forces who have not attained the age of 18 years do not take a direct part in hostilities&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.613.2/11">Article 3 recognises that,</p>
	<p pid="a.613.2/12" class="indent">&quot;persons under the age of 18 years are entitled to special protection&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.613.2/13">The amendment both deals with the Blake recommendations and brings us in line with what we have ratified in the UN protocol.</p>
	<p pid="a.613.2/14">The Minister wrote to me on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-24">24 October</phrase>. I, too, pay tribute to the ceaseless work that both he and the staff have done in briefing us and keeping us aware. The problem is that there is always no change; and there are always explanations of why there is no intent to modernise in this Bill, but merely to bring together ancient law. I would be grateful if the Minister could tell us which other European nations take the view that under-18s can be put into combat. His letter tells me that the proposals by Blake and ourselves regarding combat areas ignore,</p>
	<p pid="a.613.2/15" class="indent">&quot;the practical reality that does very occasionally arise. For example, ships have been diverted to operations at minutes' notice&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.613.2/16">That means that the MoD is in breach of its obligations under the protocol. It should not place under-18s in a position where it knows that this may happen. It is not terribly difficult to keep them in the training area if there are going to be under-18s in the armed services. If the MoD is to hold to its position where the United Kingdom is internationally criticised for its policy and will not put in place these most basic safeguards, we shall subsequently need to examine carefully whether recruiting under-18s into the military should continue in this country. I beg to move.</p>

	<p pid="a.623.0/1">My Lords, I shall be brief. We now know, as the noble Lord, Lord Drayson, said on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-12">12 October</phrase>, that arrangements for these flights are,</p>
	<p pid="a.623.0/2" class="indent">&quot;part of the normal arrangements between states&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 12/10/06; col. 440.]</p>
	<p pid="a.623.0/3">We also know, from the noble Baroness, Lady Scotland of Asthal, on <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October</phrase> (at cols. 782 and 783 of the <I>Official Report</I>) that these were not arrangements made between the UK and the US. The grant to foreign aircraft to overfly or leave our military airfields in the UK was given by diplomatic clearance under &quot;customary&quot; and reciprocal international law of which the principles were not clear. That had happened &quot;for decades&quot;, and the Chicago Convention does not apply. She also said that we expect that if there is something to do with rendition then they will tell us, but that there is no obligation to do so.</p>
	<p pid="a.623.0/4">The right in this arrangement, which has apparently gone on for decades, is diplomatic clearance sought with or without permission. I do not know quite what that means. If you are seeking diplomatic clearance, I think that means that you are asking permission, and I assume that that permission is either without asking the purpose or not. I am a bit lost in that diplomatic sea.</p>
	<p pid="a.623.0/5">Where do we go from here if that is right? The United Kingdom cannot unilaterally opt out of such an international arrangement, which by custom is not justiciable and could not be enforced in any court of law. Resorting to the ECHR, the Human Rights Act 1998 and other international conventions would also be excluded, as you cannot challenge the operation of diplomatic conventions in any court of law. This amendment is destined to drift into the &quot;ebb-drawn shoals&quot; of an Orcadian poet, in which the series of sister amendments already lie in limbo.</p>
	<p pid="a.623.0/6">The intendiment of this amendment could be dealt with through bilateral agreement between the United States and ourselves. That would require granting clearance to overfly and so forth&mdash;and taking off in the UK only if satisfied as to compliance with legal requirements and international obligations, the provisions for inspection provided by the US for take-off and with regard to passenger lists or bills of lading for cargoes of weaponry. It is not for me to draft the provisions of such an agreement, but I mention this to show the sort of arrangement that could be made by diplomacy. It is really beyond the point to ask why permission was granted for twoout of four flights. What happened to the large remainder? Why was no explanation of these arrangements&mdash;I am glad to see the noble Lord, Lord Triesman, in his place&mdash;given in response to my Unstarred Question, on which I was helped by my noble friend Lord Kingsland?</p>
	<p pid="a.623.0/7">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-07-18">18 July</phrase>, we had no inkling of what I have mentioned to your Lordships today. Indeed, no one had an inkling before 12 or <phrase class="date" code="2006-10-18">18 October</phrase>. I am not saying this to criticise the Government because there is no use in doing so. Neither is there any use in asking a whole series of questions that you might as well ask Martin Gilliatt's one-glass-eyed teddy bear.</p>
