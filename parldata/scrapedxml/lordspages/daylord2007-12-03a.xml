<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-03a.1518.7" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100012" speakername="Lord Alton of Liverpool" colon=":" colnum="1518"  time="016:45:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71203-0005.htm#0712036000225">
	<p pid="a.1518.7/1">My apologies. They are not ungrouped on the list that I have been given. I am grateful for that clarification, and I will come to those amendments in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/2">Following the BSE crisis, and after the saga of genetic crops, the Science and Technology Committee of your Lordships' House said that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/3" class="indent">&quot;many are deeply uneasy about the huge opportunities presented by areas of science including biotechnology and information technology, which seem to be advancing far ahead of their awareness and assent. In turn, public unease, mistrust and outright hostility are breeding a climate of deep anxiety among scientists themselves ... Science's relationship with United Kingdom society is under strain&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/4">Do we seriously believe that the creation of animal-human hybrid embryos, about which there is deep unease, will heal that fractured relationship? The main argument for using hybrids is for medical cures. Interspecies cloning is particularly in highlight in this regard. However, the Japanese procedure, which was referred to at Second Reading, to produce cells that resemble embryonic stem cells directly from skin, producing multipotent stem cells that were identical immunologically to the patient without using an embryo, was recently found to work with human cells by two groups, as several noble Lords mentioned in our debate on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-19">19 November</phrase>. That is a major advance. The two groups were led by Professor Yamanaka in Japan and by Professor James Thomson in America, who originally isolated human embryonic stem cells.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/5">My noble friend Lord Patel spoke powerfully against the Japanese procedure in that debate. He questioned the ability of the production of embryonic stem cells directly from skin, and pointed to some of the issues that might arise. He emphasised that the mouse produced from these cells had tumours, owing to a particular gene that had been inserted to induce the cells to become multipotent. I am delighted to be able to tell your Lordships' House that the same research group published a further article on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-30">30 November</phrase> in <I>Nature Biotechnology</I> in which it described research in which it did not use that gene and none of the mice developed tumours. The cells are likely to be much more biologically relevant than cells produced by interspecies cloning, as cloning produces numerous biological flaws and carrying out interspecies cloning would simply magnify those problems. On <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-30">30 November</phrase>, The <I>Daily Telegraph</I> reported:</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/6" class="indent">&quot;Now the Japanese team led by Prof Shinya Yamanaka and colleagues at Kyoto University show in the journal Nature Biotechnology how to convert adult human skin cells into cells that resemble embryonic stem cells without using the tumour-causing gene&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/7">These genes will be an immune match to the patient, so pursuing this avenue of research would negate the need to pursue therapeutic cloning and interspecies cloning.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/8">What is the precise purpose of what we are being asked to approve, should the amendments not be made to the Bill? What did scientists speaking to the Joint Committee say on being asked their views on so-called true hybrids? Dr Lovell-Badge said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/9" class="indent">&quot;I cannot think of a good experiment to do now but I am sure someone will think of a good experiment&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/10">Professor Bobrow said that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/11" class="indent">&quot;we are also not aware of any pressing scientific reasons at the moment for creating such entities, but who knows what tomorrow might bring?&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/12">Professor Smith said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/13" class="indent">&quot;At the present time, we have not been able to identify such a particular reason&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/14">to make true hybrids&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/15" class="indent">&quot;but that does not mean that they do not already exist and that there are not people already in the scientific community who would have appropriate grounds or that they would come along in the future&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/16">This is not exactly overwhelming, compelling evidence that true hybrids are urgently required for medical use. Furthermore, the Chief Medical Officer, Sir Liam Donaldson, said in his evidence to the Joint Committee on the draft Bill on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-06">6 June</phrase> that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/17" class="indent">&quot;there was no clear scientific argument as to why you would want to do it, and, secondly, a feeling that this would be a step too far as far as the public are concerned. I think we do have a responsibility to ensure that we take the public with us in the other important areas of research that we want to do, and do not lose their confidence by moving forward with something which is much further out, as far as acceptability is concerned, and where the scientific arguments for wanting to do it are not particularly strong or convincing, or even existent&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/18">I know that many of those who voted for embryonic cloning in 2001, and who will vote for animal-human hybrids, did so out of a genuine humanitarian desire to help those who suffer from disabling diseases. I do not believe that anything divides us in this House in our determination to try to do that, but were those beliefs well founded?</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/19">It may be instructive to note the subsequent widely reported comments of the noble Lord, Lord Winston, in 2005. He said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/20" class="indent">&quot;I think it is unlikely that embryonic stem cells are likely to be useful in healthcare for a long time ... I was concerned that parliamentarians&mdash;particularly in the House of Commons&mdash;have been convinced that it was just a matter of a few years before we would be able to transplant stem cells and cure a lot of neurological disorders, like Alzheimer's disease, for which I think it is going to be a hugely difficult problem and probably completely insoluble by stem cells&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/21">To pretend that the creation of hybrid embryos from animal eggs will offer a desperate patient with motor neurone disease their only hope of a cure, as was prominently asserted earlier this year, is perpetrating yet another piece of fiction which does no service to the seriously ill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/22">Perhaps now would be a good time to pause and similarly ask what the creation of interspecies embryos might realistically promise. In his speech on Second Reading, my noble friend Lord Walton of Detchant inform us that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/23" class="indent">&quot;the new technique of cloning using the interspecies embryo&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/24">would not require suppression of the immune response. Indeed, he went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/25" class="indent">&quot;Now, if one can use animal cells to produce the type of capsule or framework in which the nucleus from that cell can be implanted, stem cells derived from that cell will be immunologically compatible with the host into whom the subsequent stem cells will be implanted. That overcomes the difficulties arising as a result of some use of other cells such as the adult stem cells to which the noble Lord, Lord Alton, referred&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 19/11/07; cols. 708-09.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/26">In due course, I know that the Committee will greatly appreciate it if my noble friend would be willing to explain how it is that cells containing proteins from a distantly related species would not provoke an immune response, yet stem cells taken only from the same individual supposedly would. In expounding such views, I also trust that my noble friend will explain fully how one can be so sure about the developmental potential of such a cloned interspecies entity, especially without implanting it in a womb or crossing the 14-day limit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/27">In our debate in January 2001, my noble friend was sceptical about progress using adult stem cells, stating that progress would take many years of fundamental research. In his speech on Second Reading, my noble friend also commended an article by Julian Savulescu on the purported benefits of attempts at human cloning with eggs of distantly related species. I hope my noble friend will take the opportunity to dissociate himself from Professor Savulescu's previously expressed views in favour of reproductive cloning or the harvesting of tissue from cloned foetuses.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/28">Meanwhile, Her Majesty's Government seem decidedly confused regarding whether or not the potential use of a technique known as tetraploid complementation would fall under the remit of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act if human embryonic stem cells were injected into a tetraploid embryo of another species tetraploid embryo complementation is already a well established technique for deriving mature mice entirely from mouse embryonic stem cells in which the cells of a tetraploid mouse embryo give rise to extra embryonic tissue, such as placenta, while the mouse's embryonic stem cells contribute directly to the developing foetus.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/29">The Minister has stated that the reference to,</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/30" class="indent">&quot;such other things as may be specified in regulations&quot;,</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/31">as proposed to be inserted under Clause 4(2) of the Bill has the scope to cover any predominantly or substantially human organism that conceivably may be created by injecting human embryonic stem cells into an embryo of another species into which the animal cells primarily produce extra embryonic tissue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/32">I invite the Committee to contrast those remarks with those of the noble Baroness, Lady Royall of Blaisdon, and also with those previously made by the noble Lord, Lord Hunt of Kings Heath. He stated that an animal embryo altered for an experimental or other scientific purpose by the introduction of one or more human cells will be governed by the provisions of the Animal (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 once it reached the half-way point of gestation or incubation. That was given to me in a Written Answer on <phrase class="date" code="2007-06-28">28 June 2007</phrase>. Subsequently, the noble Baroness, Lady Royall of Blaisdon, stated that if the cells that make up an embryo contain at least a haploid set of human chromosomes and at least one sequence of animal DNA, including a tetraploid complement of animal chromosomes, then it will be regulated as an interspecies embryo, but the regulation of animal embryos that contain single or multiple human cells is not within the scope of the Bill. That was given in a Written Answer on <phrase class="date" code="2007-07-12">12 July 2007</phrase>.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/33">Under which legislation would an embryo fall if it contained a significant proportion of human embryonic stem cells, which obviously themselves contain at least a haploid set of human chromosomes that have been injected into a tetraploid primate embryo? The evident confusion displayed by the contrasting answers from Her Majesty's Government on this potential issue have not inspired much more confidence in the ability to regulate such research than the extensive indecision of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority regarding whether or not it could regulate the so-called &quot;cybrid&quot; embryos. Such confusion may be especially disconcerting in the light of Dr Stephen Minger's comments to the Joint Committee on the Human Tissue and Embryos (Draft) Bill that it may be only a few years before someone will want to,</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/34" class="indent">&quot;take human embryonic stem cells and put them into a primate blastocyst and take that blastocyst to mid-gestation or maybe to birth or maybe to ten years of age&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/35">So much, then, for the 14-day limit as applied to interspecies embryos.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/36">In 1990, in opposing the first Human Fertilisation and Embryology Bill, I quoted in another place scientific opinion that doubted the scientific worth, let alone the ethics, of human embryo experimentation. I quoted an intervention from a debate in your Lordships' House by my noble friend Lord Walton, whom I respect enormously although we disagree fundamentally on this issue. I seem to have been arguing with him now for the past 20 years. He had been asked what significant cures or advances in treatment had been achieved. He replied,</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/37" class="indent">&quot;I agree that as yet there are none&quot;.&mdash;[<I>Official Report</I>, 8/2/90; col. 958.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/38">In 2001 when I divided your Lordships' House, when close to 1 million human embryos had been destroyed, I asked the same question. No one could point to a single cure, yet we then authorised the cloning of human embryos. Seven years later we are now being asked to permit the creation of interspecies embryos. Although some 2 million human embryos have now been destroyed or experimented upon, the answer to the question remains the same. Cures&mdash;around 80 are now documented&mdash;are coming through adult stem cells, not through interspecies manipulation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1518.7/39">We should be clear-sighted. We should think wisely about what we are being asked to authorise. Having done so, we should reject these proposals as a step too far. I beg to move.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-03a.1561.1" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100960" speakername="Lord Darzi of Denham" colon=":" colnum="1561"  time="019:30:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71203-0011.htm#07120328000031">
	<p pid="a.1561.1/1">The spectrum of human animal embryo research is broad. It extends from animals created to contain one human gene through to human embryos modified to contain one animal gene. The purposes of human animal embryo research, and the limits that should be placed on it, depend on what point along that spectrum the research is undertaken.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.1/2">Research at the human end of the spectrum involving human embryos, and embryos created using human eggs or human sperm or human somatic cells, warrants the regulation warranted under the 1990 Act&mdash;strict regulation and strict limits placed on the creation and use of such embryos. This is what we propose to bring about through this Bill.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.1/3">Research involving protected animals, which are all vertebrates&mdash;excluding humans&mdash;and octopi, including transgenic animals, is subject to licence by the Home Secretary under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Section 2 of the Act includes within the definition any protected animal from the mid-point of the gestation or incubation period for the relevant species.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.1/4">There is no legislation that specifically applies to research involving non-human embryos in vitro, but the 1986 Act applies to any procedure involving a living animal, including the implantation of an embryo, as well as the creation or breeding of any genetically modified animal.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.1/5">The noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, and the noble Lord, Lord Jenkin, have tabled an amendment that would remove the ability to update the definitions of interspecies embryos through regulations. This regulation-making power was proposed such that if new technologies are developed by which human-animal embryos can be created, where those entities warrant the level of regulation proposed in this Bill for interspecies embryos, they can be brought within the scope of regulation provided by the 1990 Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.1/6">I believe that through the definitions provided in new Section 4A(5)(a) to (d) of the 1990 Act, as inserted by Clause 4, all the necessary categories of interspecies embryos are caught. This means that all forms of human-animal embryo, which we believe warrant the level of regulatory oversight provided by the HFEA&mdash;that is, by a body licensing individual research projects using human embryos and interspecies embryos&mdash;are brought within its remit. However, as the noble and learned Lord, Lord Mackay, pointed out, we can never be sure that new techniques will not be developed in the future or that new forms of human-animal embryos will not be developed that may also need to be regulated under the 1990 Act. Therefore, the problem of definition is an issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.1/7">I refer to a letter sent over the weekend by Professor Bobrow of the Academy of Medical Sciences. It states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.1/8" class="indent">&quot;The Scrutiny Committee's final report acknowledged the limitations of the proposed definition. Following publication, the Academy liaised extensively with the Department of Health, to see if we could refine the Scrutiny Committee's definition to avoid the problems outlined above. This involved a great deal of e-mail correspondence and a meeting hosted by the Wellcome Trust on <phrase class="date" code="2007-08-07">7 August</phrase> attended by representatives from the Academy, MRC, Royal Society, Wellcome Trust and Department of Health. Despite considerable efforts, we were unable to draft a satisfactory general definition of an ISE&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.1/9">interspecies embryo&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.1/10" class="indent">&quot;and concluded that, even with more time, we were unlikely to reach a viable solution. We agreed that a regulation-making power, allowing the list of definitions to be expanded as necessary in the light of new research methods and findings, to be the preferable option&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.1/11">That is the scrutiny of the scientific committee. I come back to the point raised about regulation. The noble Lord, Lord Patten, asked who would regulate interspecies embryos. The regulations in question would be for the House to debate in the form of an affirmative resolution.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.1/12">Amendment No. 19, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, seeks to insert new provisions into the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to regulate the placing in an animal of an embryo altered by the introduction of any elements derived from human cells and seeks to create an associated regulation-making power. In so far as it applies to the placing of embryos into recipient animals already protected by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, it adds nothing new to the existing provisions of that Act and is redundant. However, the amendment, as worded, also seeks to regulate the placing of an embryo into recipient animals other than those protected by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.1/13">The 1986 Act defines a &quot;protected animal&quot; as any living vertebrate, other than man and one invertebrate species, Octopus vulgaris. Unprotected animals therefore comprise man and all invertebrates other than Octopus vulgaris. This would vastly extend the reach of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act. As the noble Lord, Lord Patel, pointed out, the generation of transgenic animals containing human DNA has become a common technique to study both basic and applied human biology. It forms an important part of modern medical research. Any additional regulation would be an unnecessary burden in cost and time for researchers and regulators and would have little or no additional benefits for animal welfare. It would be contrary to the Government's better regulation agenda.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.1/14">Amendment No. 20, tabled by the noble Earl, Lord Howe, seeks to insert new provisions into the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 to regulate the keeping or using of animal embryos altered by the introduction of any elements derived from human cells. It also seeks to set time limits for keeping or using them. As with Amendment No. 19, in so far as it applies to keeping or using embryos of animals already protected by the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986&mdash;other than creating a requirement to restate in regulations the criteria on which the relevant licences are granted&mdash;the amendment adds nothing new to the existing provisions and protections afforded by that Act and is redundant. However, in common with Amendment No. 19, it would vastly extend the reach of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act to the embryos of unprotected animals; that is, to human and invertebrate embryos.</p>
	<p pid="a.1561.1/15">I invite noble Lords not to press the amendments. However, we may in later debates discuss some of the issues relating to definition, which I feel are important and need further debate.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-03a.1563.5" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100583" speakername="Baroness Sharp of Guildford" colon="" colnum="1563"  time="019:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71203-0011.htm#07120328000050">
	<p pid="a.1563.5/1" pwmotiontext="asked">asked Her Majesty's Government why at a time when they are encouraging people to upgrade skills and continue working later in life, adult learners seeking a second qualification at an equivalent or lower level to that already held must pay full-cost fees.</p>
	<p pid="a.1563.5/2">My Lords, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-07">7 September</phrase>, the Secretary of State for the Department for Innovation, Universities and Skills wrote to the chairman of the Higher Education Funding Council for England setting out the CSR settlement for 2008-11. In that letter, he announced that he was seeking a reallocation of some &pound;100 million used at present to subsidise those who are taking bachelors' degrees or other lower level qualifications when they already have a degree. Instead, he wanted to see the money used for expanding provision for those who had never before been to university.</p>
	<p pid="a.1563.5/3">The announcement came without any consultation with those involved. There is a consultation exercise taking place now, finishing at the end of this week, on <phrase class="date" code="">7 December</phrase>, which makes this debate apposite. It is clear from discussions taking place that Ministers have made their decision and that, although they are listening through the consultation exercise, they do not intend to change much substantively.</p>
	<p pid="a.1563.5/4">The problem has been dubbed the ELQ problem&mdash;equivalent or lower qualification problem&mdash;and it has caused considerable furore in the higher education and further education worlds. The number wishing to speak in tonight's short debate is a good illustration of that. The Secretary of State's argument is that it is a matter of allocating scarce resources in a fair way. There is no bottomless pit to fund higher education, and government priorities lie with getting as many as possible up to degree level to meet the challenging Leitch target of 40 per cent of the working population with degrees by 2020. That &pound;100 million will finance some 10,000 full-time university students, more if they are part-timers or foundation degree students. Why should those students be denied university places in favour of students on whom the state has already spent some &pound;15,000 or &pound;20,000 in higher education provision?</p>
	<p pid="a.1563.5/5">Put that way, it is difficult to fault the logic. None of us would argue that there are unlimited resources; trade-offs have to be made, and on the face of it those who have already had considerable resources lavished upon them should not take priority over others who are knocking on the door of higher education wanting to get in. Yet there are good reasons to reject this proposition. First, it is not obvious that there are at present many knocking on the door of higher education and being denied entry. On the contrary, most of those with the relevant qualifications are found places, while the falling secondary school rolls mean that the number of teenagers coming forward in the next few years will free up places for adults. The hope is, of course, that with all the Leitch initiatives there will be an increasing number of adults coming forward to fill those places, but until they begin to emerge, is it right to make these cuts?</p>
	<p pid="a.1563.5/6">There are also questions of cost-effectiveness and, perhaps even more, unintended consequences. Maybe there will be places for 10,000 extra full-time students, but the Open University alone reckons that it is going to lose 29,000 of its 120,000 students as a result of the changes. As Brenda Gourley, its vice-chancellor, remarked to me, &quot;That is three medium-sized universities. Is that really what the Government intended?&quot;. That is not all. In many universities, particularly the post-1992 universities, all part-time courses have a fair number of participants who are taking second qualifications. One such university reckoned that 60 per cent of its 450 full-time equivalent numbers in its centre for lifelong learning were such. Losing those students will make those part-time, often evening, courses non-viable and the universities will be forced to close them down. That illustrates all too well the unintended consequences of taking decisions without prior proper consultation. In any case, it sits oddly with the Leitch agenda, which encourages upskilling and reskilling to meet the challenges of global competition.</p>
	<p pid="a.1563.5/7">Most people would reckon that the shelf life of a bachelor's degree is about 15 years and, in any case many recognise, even when they graduate, that had they had better advice they might have chosen a very different undergraduate degree. Overall, the proposals privilege the young and those with employer support and disadvantage those over 25 who want to choose their own learning pathway. It hits disproportionately those whom the Government are trying to entice into higher education, namely part-timers. It has been estimated that some 20 per cent are going to be affected, compared to 2 per cent of full-timers. Those people are already earning their qualifications the hard way, giving up their evenings and weekends to acquire better and more appropriate qualifications. They already get much less than their full-time equivalents; they have to pay fees up front; there are no interest-free loans and if they borrow via career development loans they have to pay commercial rates of interest; and they get little by way of maintenance support.</p>
	<p pid="a.1563.5/8">Who are they? They are disproportionately older students. The Open University reckons that 68 per cent of those affected will be over 35. Many are training for new careers, and many are teachers. Teacher training will be excluded, but not the degree behind the training. Some 25 per cent are taking qualifications in maths, science and technology; many are women returners who are retraining after years out with childcare; others are older people who are retraining in the hope of getting a better job, gaining a management qualification or returning to the job market after redundancy.</p>
	<p pid="a.1563.5/9">Some professions are going to be particularly hard hit. Many train in social work, counselling and psychotherapy only after experience in the workplace; and with the new Layard initiatives we are in need of large numbers of such people. The clergy are going to be very hard hit, since nearly all take degrees in theology after a first degree, again often later in life. What is tough is that precisely at a time when the Government are telling us that we need to keep our skills up to date and think in terms of working through to 70, they are putting a damper on precisely that opportunity.</p>
	<p pid="a.1563.5/10">It hits disproportionately precisely those institutions&mdash;universities and further education colleges&mdash;which have been doing most to widen participation and encourage those who have traditionally not gone into higher education to do so. It is not just Birkbeck and the Open University, but the likes of the London South Bank University, Westminster, Anglia Ruskin University, Barking College and Lewisham College.</p>
	<p pid="a.1563.5/11">Lastly, but by no means least, we have no way of checking who has a previous qualification and who has not. Do we have to rely just on people being truthful? Or is this going to be an excuse for yet another big database?</p>
	<p pid="a.1563.5/12">The Government are proposing some compromises. Medicine, architecture, nursing, some but not all teacher training, and for the moment the STEM subjects&mdash;science, technology and engineering&mdash;which are part of the strategically important and vulnerable subjects, are being exempted. There are some social work exemptions, but many of the professions allied to medicine, including pharmacy, will be hit. Foundation degrees will be exempt. One cannot help feeling that perhaps the whole enterprise is an underhand way of forcing universities into offering two-year foundation degrees and helping therefore to meet government targets in this area. Again, the Government are promising transitional help&mdash;funding guaranteed at 2007 levels for the Open University and Birkbeck until 2010 to help them &quot;reconfigure&quot; their programmes&mdash;but does this mean moving to foundation degrees? Are these compromises enough? Can the Open University and Birkbeck really be expected to change that rapidly? Surely, the Open University's suggestion that the issue be considered as part of a revamp of the part-time student deal in 2009 is reasonable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1563.5/13">I come back to the trade-offs and value for money. Essential the trade-off being offered here is only within the HEFCE budget and we are, of course, being assured that the money is being used within the higher sector to help widen participation. Equally, however, this move needs to be seen as part of the wider education and skills agenda&mdash;the Leitch agenda. Here, only last Monday, the Government announced a doubling of the Train to Gain budget for employer training, with a doubling from &pound;500 million to &pound;1 billion a year. Yet there are real doubts as to whether this sector&mdash;employer-based training&mdash;has either the will or the capacity to absorb this money and expand that fast. There are serious questions about value for money. The IFS evaluation of the pilots suggested that 85 per cent of expenditure on these pilots was dead weight&mdash;namely, that employers were being paid for training they would do anyway. Surely the &pound;100 million needed to meet the Leitch higher education targets could be funded from the Train to Gain budget.</p>
	<p pid="a.1563.5/14">I must stop there; I was going to conclude with a quotation from David Blunkett, but I will leave it at that.</p>

	<p pid="a.1571.0/1">My Lords, this debate is rich in what Shakespeare called,</p>
	<p pid="a.1571.0/2" class="indent">&quot;wise saws and modern instances&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1571.0/3">I am no good at wise saws but perhaps I may offer two modern instances. The first is a lad of 18, who has the idea of drifting along with some of his schools friends to do a degree in media studies at his local university. The other is a woman of 31, whose work experience has convinced her that a qualification in accountancy would enhance a career built on computer skills acquired at university a decade ago. She scrutinises what is on offer at Birkbeck and the Open University and wonders, first, whether she can afford the expense of part-time education; secondly, whether her day job will leave her with the necessary stamina; and, thirdly, whether her husband would be up to acting as a single dad with their toddlers for two or three evenings a week.</p>
	<p pid="a.1571.0/4">Which of those potential students fits more easily with the Leitch agenda that is so enthusiastically backed by six Cabinet Ministers, all of whom have their pictures on page six of his report? Which of the two deserves and needs the stronger incentives and support? Which of the two is more vulnerable to discouragement? Surely the answer in each case is the lady. To judge from data supplied by Professors Latchman and Gourley, she is quite typical of the Birkbeck and Open University students whose experience and aspiration alike determine the kind of ELQ they need and who would be gravely affected or even excluded by an upward surge in fees.</p>
	<p pid="a.1571.0/5">John Denham's letter of <phrase class="date" code="2007-09-07">7 September</phrase> specified a consultation period which ends this very Friday. Will Her Majesty's Government now recognise the storm of reasoned objections and gracefully back off?</p>

	<p pid="a.1577.0/1">My Lords, where does my noble friend think that those 20,000 extra students are going to come from? Many universities are struggling to meet their HEFCE contracts. Money will be taken away from one group, but there is no obvious solution to where that new group of students is going to emerge from. There is a bit of a misconception around, unless there is a dramatic improvement in the number of young people leaving school with the relevant and appropriate qualifications. On a budget of &pound;10 million, I wonder whether it is worth playing around in this way for &pound;100 million to be allocated in an uncertain way as soon as 2010.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2007-12-03a.1580.3" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100012" speakername="Lord Alton of Liverpool" colon=":" colnum="1580"  time="020:42:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldhansrd/text/71203-0014.htm#07120331000037">
	<p pid="a.1580.3/1">In moving Amendment No. 21, I shall also speak to Amendments Nos. 22, 23 and 62. Amendment No. 21 is in my name and that of the noble Baroness, Lady Williams of Crosby, who spoke at Second Reading and who is unavoidably absent overseas, taking part in a long-standing engagement.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/2">The amendment would require the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority to report to the Secretary of State on the respective sums of money used in human embryonic stem cell research and adult stem cell research. It seeks to ensure that, as with the local ethical review process established in the case of animal experiments under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, an amicus curiae&mdash;in this case, someone to speak for the human embryo&mdash;would be appointed to the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority and would have a remit at least to challenge repetitive experimentation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/3">Amendment No. 23 seeks to disqualify from membership of the HFEA anyone who has a direct pecuniary interest in any of the activities governed by the Act. Amendment No. 62 seeks to establish clear record-keeping by the HFEA of ovarian stimulation, oocyte retrieval and hospitalisation.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/4">Turning first to Amendment No. 21, it is ironic indeed that the moral justification, if it can be passed as such, for experiments on human embryos is the desire to keep Britain in the lead. This mistaken jingoism is a false patriotism at every level. While we have been diverted down the blind alley of embryonic stem cell research, the most breathtaking discoveries are being made by our competitors. Promises of a biotech El Dorado have proved illusionary, with vast sums of public money consumed in the process. How much better it would have been if those public resources have been used, as some of us have argued throughout, on the less ethically troubled pursuit of adult stem cell technologies. Amendment No. 21 seeks to require regular reportage of the respective sums of money allocated for the two approaches, a point eloquently made during the Second Reading debate by the noble Baroness.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/5">Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 deal with the membership and the role of Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority. There are currently 18 members of the HFEA. It has an interim chair, Walter Merricks, who was a founder member of Donor Conception Network. The chair is supposed to be a lay person and I would argue that to accord this status to Mr Merricks is stretching definitions&mdash;something about which we heard earlier in another context&mdash;beyond their intended sense. Eight other current members of the authority are working as medical or scientific professionals in the field of IVF or genetics. Apart from Mr Merricks there are two other members, Messrs Brown and Dundas, who are directly involved in patients' groups and lobbying. The other seven could generically be described as lay people, but some have publicly advocated embryonic experimentation and cloning. The academic lawyer, Emily Jackson, who has spoken out in favour of human reproductive cloning is an active participant in pro-choice abortion politics and this November delivered a speech at the London School of Economics entitled &quot;Rejecting the sanctity principle and rethinking the wrongness of killing&quot;. Her perspective is contained in the title, which she argued passionately. David Archard is the token philosopher on the authority, holding entirely predictable views. The four others could be described as neutral in the absence of any information to the contrary. So, in effect, it is only possible to claim that, at the most, four of the 18 come at assisted reproduction and embryo research from a potentially neutral perspective.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/6">I have never heard any indication of any member of the committee who has expressed serious reservations about anything which vast swathes of our population consider to be controversial at best and unethical at worst. Summing up this analysis, 11 of the 18 are involved, in one way or another, with fertility treatment and research; three others are outspoken in their position on research; leaving just four others&mdash;two with a financial background, one involved in childcare work and one ex-BBC&mdash;who could possibly be described as neutral.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/7">As the <I>Times </I>reported only this morning, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, a point I put to my noble friend the right reverend Lord Harries of Pentregarth, is currently considering two licence applications from the Newcastle and King's Universities for the creation of interspecies embryos, called by them cytoplasmic hybrids, involving the cloning process, adult somatic cells and enucleated animal eggs. These applications are due to be ruled on on <phrase class="date" code="">5 December</phrase>. Following a freedom of information request by Comment on Reproductive Ethics, it is acknowledged that the HFEA has never turned down a research licence application to the best of its knowledge. Will it grant these applications? As I asked my noble friend earlier today, what then is the purpose of the Bill which dedicates so much space to the permitted creation of interspecies embryos? It would appear that the HFEA has already assumed authority in this area of science.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/8">So indifferent is the HFEA to widespread hostility to creating animal-human hybrids that they it has totally disregarded its own consultation which demonstrated that of more than 800 submissions, only one in eight supported the creation of hybrids. This not only ignores public consultation but it is dangerous to treat Parliament with apparent contempt to pre-empt deliberation in both Houses; it would make a total mockery of what passes as a democratic process.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/9">This is not a new problem. In 1982 the then Government announced the terms of reference for what became known as the Warnock committee. On <phrase class="date" code="1993-11-18">18 November 1993</phrase>, in a Radio 4 broadcast of the &quot;Analysis&quot; programme, my noble friend Lady Warnock gave an insightful response when asked how the membership of her committee was determined. I quote her directly from a transcript:</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/10" class="indent">&quot;There exists what is generally known as the Central List. The Central List is produced and combed for people who might have an interest in this kind of thing. I was then given a kind of draft list and asked whether there were any other people I thought would be obvious choices, maybe people who were not yet among the great and the good, and I was with some difficulty allowed a power of veto. There was one particular person who was supposed to be the Catholic, and I said I would not have him. I just knew that I couldn't work with him. We went right up to the day before publication with the civil servants saying, 'But there's nobody else in the world'. So in the end, the night before publication, I said, 'Well, will you please tell the Minister that it's a very, very bad way to embark on working on a committee when you know that there's somebody you're not going to find easy to work with'. The following morning two names were suggested. So I did win on that, but it was very, very hard and it took a lot of persistence&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/11">Doubtless it would be much easier for us all if people we found it difficult to work with could be excluded from committees and public bodies. I have probably had that effect on some of your Lordships during today's proceedings. In 2002 Susie Leather, the chair of the HFEA, said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/12" class="indent">&quot;I don't think we need them&quot;&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/13">that is, people opposed to the use of human embryos&mdash;</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/14" class="indent">&quot;continually on the committee saying, 'I'm opposed to all this'&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/15">And the Joint Committee adumbrated a very telling new constitutional principle:</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/16" class="indent">&quot;those with such public views cannot administer the law to which they may be fundamentally opposed&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/17">That simply is not true. Removing dissenting and questioning voices is a huge error. Many local ethical review committees&mdash;I sit on one&mdash;contain people opposed to animal experimentation, but they see their role as a questioning one, ensuring, at least in the context of the law as it stands, that the interests of the subject are not dismissed or neglected.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/18">When I last looked, 70 per cent of the HFEA's income came in fees from the very clinics it is supposed to police&mdash;a case of the watchdog being far too closely identified with the burglar. Perhaps the Minister can tell us what the current figure is. Clearly that incestuous relationship makes it difficult to say no too often, or ever at all. My Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 seek to address those issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/19">On Amendment No. 62, Her Majesty's Government have declined to follow the lead of their South Korean counterparts by restricting the type of human eggs that may be used in embryo research in order to protect women's health and welfare. Instead, appeal is made to an HFEA consultation undertaken in 2006 on the donation of eggs for research in which the publicly stated risks of side effects due to ovarian hyperstimulation&mdash;a point made today by the noble Baroness, Lady Neuberger&mdash;seems, curiously, to have been described as threefold lower than those indicated by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists in the same year. I refer your Lordships to two Written Answers, at cols. <I>WA 99</I> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-23">23 October 2007</phrase> and <I>WA 131</I> on <phrase class="date" code="2007-11-29">29 November</phrase>, to Questions I tabled, as well as to the conflicting statements of the HFEA and the RCOG. The HFEA has said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/20" class="indent">&quot;Mild OHSS is relatively common (occurring in between 1-10% of treatment) and can be treated and controlled. Severe OHSS is rarer (occurring in around 1% of cases)&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/21">The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, by contrast, says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/22" class="indent">&quot;Women should be informed that mild forms of OHSS are common, affecting up to 33% of in vitro fertilisation (IVF) cycles, and that 3&mdash;8% of IVF cycles are complicated by moderate or severe OHSS&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/23">According to Written Answers by the Minister, the noble Lord, Lord Darzi of Denham, on <phrase class="date" code="2007-10-22">22 October</phrase>, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority appears to have incomplete records regarding ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome. This is not necessarily reported by clinics unless treatment was discontinued, and it does not hold data regarding how many in vitro fertilisation patients were at risk of hospitalisation after producing 20 or more eggs. Such appalling deficits would hopefully be rectified by the implementation of Amendment No. 62, which would lay on the HFEA a duty to keep records. Although clinics have to report OHSS if it causes an IVF cycle to be cancelled before egg collection for embryo transfer, they do not have to report all cases of women being hospitalised for OHSS. If women choose to continue with the cycle, risking their health, and end up in hospital, IVF clinics do not need to report it. The Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists, in its guidelines on the management of OHSS published in September 2006, called for auditable standards, including the percentage of women who were admitted to hospital with OHSS, the number of days as an in-patient and incidence of thrombosis.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/24">The appalling degree of underreporting recently came to light when the journal, <I>Human Fertility</I>, reported in September that, in a four-year period of study, there were 53 incidents of women from an IVF clinic in Newcastle being hospitalised with OHSS, two of whom had life-threatening complications. However, the data held by the HFEA for the Newcastle clinic on the reported incidence of OHSS for six years during the same period show that only three cases of OHSS were reported to it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1580.3/25">Amendment No. 62 has an affinity with Amendment No. 24, in the name of my noble friend Lady Finlay, which also stresses the importance of record-keeping, in that case of IVF&mdash;success rates on the one hand, and risks of serious adverse side-effects on the other. I hope that the Committee and the Government will be convinced by the arguments for greater transparency and accountability. I beg to move.</p>
