	<p pid="a.1313.3/1">My Lords, I thank the Minister for that Answer. The atmosphere was very positive when Javier Solana presented his proposals on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-06">6 June</phrase> in Tehran and, indeed, some of the more provocative American comments have faded away somewhat since then. However, is the Minister confident that the success of the EU3 negotiating team and its capacity to exercise supervision and oversight in the longer term will be fully maintained, linked to UNSC 5+1, bearing in mind the very narrow dividing line between civilian and military enrichment activities?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-29a.1333.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100804" speakername="Lord Dykes" colon=":" colnum="1333"  time="012:12:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60629-06.htm#60629-06_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1333.0/1">My Lords, inevitably the subject matter today has a difficult, very complex, sombre and serious side. I deliberately use the word &quot;pleasure&quot; in following comprehensively able speeches so far&mdash;much more expert than mine&mdash;and I express my nervousness at following three distinguished military experts who know a lot about these subjects. I well remember that my very brief brush with the Ministry of Defence was becoming a humble PPS in the Ministry of Defence several weeks after Parliament started after the June 1970 election. Following the correct exhortation of the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, that military people should keep politicians at bay, I was briefly given a basement office in the MoD without any windows to underline the humble role of politicians in comparison with the military experts and officials.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/2">I thank the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, wholeheartedly for his choice of debate and the very dignified way in which he enunciated some of the enormous anxieties about the present situation. There are so many urgent and worrying questions to be dealt with in virtually all aspects of prevailing UK defence policy. It seems ironical after the 1998 review that we have to say that, but because the world has changed so much in such a short time it remains the daunting reality that we now face. I will concentrate briefly on a number of special areas where there are inevitably, in this context, more questions than answers. I thank the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, for his comments, which I entirely agree with, on the procurement problems and on the nuclear question, which I will also refer to in the time available. I wholeheartedly support what the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, said&mdash;I am sure that it will arise again and again in this debate&mdash;about the inadequacy of some of our procurements and the inadequacy and age of some of the equipment that our Armed Forces have to use to deal with their current responsibilities.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/3">I am advised that relations between the European Union and the United States are now much better than they were three years ago. This, too, has an impact on the policy formulation and the defence postures of this country by at least indirect implication, and possibly more than that. However, relations between senior officials and military people in the various European Union defence secretariats and agencies and NATO in Brussels need far more effort before the mutual tensions subside. On the creation of both detailed sub-aspects of policy formation and the grand strategy, we can perhaps agree that UK defence policy is unavoidably and starkly affected by this illegal invasion of Iraq by Britain and America&mdash;made legal subsequently, but illegal at the time and with many illegal implications even now. Afghanistan is an ominous and separate problem arising and is causing more and more anxiety.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/4">We now see a total picture where our Armed Forces are sorely stretched beyond all reasonable demands by the foolish geopolitical errors of inexperienced members of the Government, from the Prime Minister downwards. It was bad enough to have to endure the United States, with perhaps one of the most disappointing American Administrations since before the Second World War and the depression, rampaging into Iraq without proper long-term planning and preparation and no sense of intelligent statecraft, let alone the United Kingdom Government doing the same thing for reasons that have still not been properly justified or explained and which look all too much like self-induced delusionism about the defence capabilities of Britain, which we all accept is a very small country and economic base for all such tasks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/5">Nothing makes our impressive soldiers, sailors and air staff more cynical than when politicians pay them endless fulsome tribute&mdash;they do so even when they are tragically killed in a dubious cause&mdash;but insist that they still fulfil their tasks with woefully inadequate equipment. I am sad that I have to say that repeatedly. Britain is a small country on its own. It surely behoves us, therefore, to cut our cloth accordingly and not to posture about here, there and everywhere in some quasi-imperialist adventurism for apparent reasons of doubtful prestige.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/6">Not only is the situation in Iraq dire in all aspects, but Afghanistan looks more and more ominous. The so-called war on terror needs to be fought with high technology, intelligence and infiltration, and subversion by using sincere local people, not by the obsession of the United States with bombing from a high altitude and killing mostly civilians in the process, and by hapless US and UK deployment of troops in uniform, who will increasingly be sitting ducks unless they stay in green zone-type fastnesses and never go out into the countryside.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/7">We handled Northern Ireland with much more intelligent solutions. Yes, it was closer to home and thus easier in one sense but, equally, it was much more difficult than the far-flung problems that we now face. Why have we in this country lost the capacity for geo-strategic common sense? We had a great reputation in the past; we need to rebuild it to restore the morale of our Armed Forces. Far from reducing the excessive tasks for those fighting forces and the back-up personnel in all sections, we are adding to them. Morale is seriously affected by that depressing outlook.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/8">The sharp fall in TAVR renewals is an ominous sign, as is the stress counselling for more and more Regulars and the decisions of soldiers and others to leave the forces earlier than expected. We also have the extra European tasks that were featured on page 41 of the Government's January 2006 White Paper. Although those tasks are still in the early planning stages, and therefore at the disposal of officials at a high level and of senior military personnel, gradually greater numbers of military personnel on the ground will be drawn in by them. The whole burden will increase at a time when the pressures are already becoming literally unbearable. Morale and self-confidence in the Armed Forces is at its lowest ebb in the whole post-war period, with the exception of the Suez adventure, which was finally dealt with by what in those days were sensible objections by the United States.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/9">Other noble Lords will cite examples of poor equipment, some of which have been mentioned, and complex mistakes in specifications affecting many units' kit. Our men and women in the forces feel overstretched and overexploited by an irrationally aggressive Government. The Cold War ended, but the Government perhaps decided that there should be new enemies on the horizon. Obviously al-Qaeda is an enemy in the new, modern, difficult-to-grasp sense, as is the Taliban, but where is the serious military threat to us from anywhere in the world in the conventional sense&mdash;or the nuclear sense, as events now stand? There may be one in the future, but, right now, where is the threat to the existence of the United Kingdom? The answer is that there is not one.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/10">I hope that we are not now starting to call the Palestinians our enemies due to deplorable and tragic individual terrorist incidents there, which can be used as excuses for further procrastination as regards giving them their own sovereign state. Of course, as we constantly say, Hamas needs to recognise Israel and its security and safety, but Israel too needs to obey international law in all the ways that the UN has repeatedly called for.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/11">Increasingly, surely our role has to be limited to the natural defence of the people here at home&mdash;the homeland&mdash;in case of future threats, as well as being involved in the international forces of peacekeeping and help to indigenous populations, if they genuinely seek our help. This should be decided more and more in the future, as it already is, through our membership of the various collective treaty agencies. That is the modern trend. We cannot any longer be on our own.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/12">Although it sounds hyperbolic, the European-wide polls held last week and the week before among the public in European Union countries, which suggested genuine anxieties about US actions as a threat to peace, need to be heeded by the British Government, even though they appear to be an unfair attack on the Americans. The USA has not really succeeded in winning over the ordinary citizens of Iraq, Afghanistan and the various countries in Arabia, and the worries about this failure to appeal to those people spill over to us here.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/13">I turn finally to the vexed question looming up at the other end of the scale&mdash;the grand strategy; the massive equipment&mdash;which is of our nuclear deterrent and the future procurement problems involved in renewing our nuclear arsenal. We start off with the extraordinary news that the by now almost self-appointed next leader of the Labour Party and Government is pledging to find the replacement for Trident, to be commissioned in a few years' time and completed by 2024. Was this a combination of warding off his own sceptical Back-Bench colleagues in another place and anticipating the report of the Defence Committee on this theme? I do not think that it is right for any Government just to make this decision before Parliament and the nation have had a full and lengthy opportunity to consider all the options.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/14">The conclusion, after all, may indeed be that we should maintain our existing capacity or upgrade to the modernised replacement, to which the noble Lord, Lord Trefgarne, referred in detail. However, the end of the Cold War, if coupled with a successful modernised and renewed non-proliferation treaty, could offer alternative prospects without in any way undermining this nation's safety and future welfare. Would it be a submarine system, as now, or air-launched missiles? The debate is just starting, and much more detailed thought needs to be given to those matters.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/15">However, most worrying of all is the notion that we could still rely totally on the United States for the new system. Although the warhead could be British-made, the so-called independent deterrent would still be something of a continuing myth, except ironically for the French&mdash;President Chirac was making strange bellicose noises at the west coast navy base in France six weeks ago.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/16">Are we not, after all, both legally and for practical reasons obliged to honour our commitments to the NPT, both in its present form and perhaps in a new form if that should be necessary? It is astonishing how we fail to perceive the accusation of hypocrisy from such quarters as the non-nuclear powers, who are watching what we and other nuclear countries are up to very carefully, when we have plainly not met all our duties under the treaty but continue to exhort other countries such as Iran, North Korea, India and Pakistan to do the necessary under it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/17">In fact, the non-proliferation side of the equation has been more successful than what has been achieved by the old nuclear club although, to be fair, the United Kingdom has made some important reductions in its arsenal. But the club members are legally committed under the NPT to move to the elimination of their nuclear arsenals. Russia has some 5,000 warheads, some of which are possibly in a questionable maintenance state; America has more or less the same; and France and the UK together have some 5 per cent of those unnecessarily massive arsenals. The START II and START III negotiations and agreements faltered badly and have not achieved their objectives at all.</p>
	<p pid="a.1333.0/18">In the debate introduced here on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-06">6 June</phrase> by my noble friend Lady Williams of Crosby, Hans Blix was mentioned and reference was made to some 27,000 nuclear weapons that are still scattered around the globe. The report sent to Kofi Annan by Hans Blix's Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission strongly emphasised a call on Britain and France to reduce their existing arsenals. This House will return to these solemn challenges on many future occasions, I am sure. The debate is now on.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-29a.1357.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100083" speakername="Viscount Brookeborough" colon=":" colnum="1357"  time="013:39:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60629-12.htm#60629-12_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1357.0/1">My Lords, I, too, thank my noble and gallant friend Lord Inge for initiating this debate. I feel rather nervous because I am taking quite a narrow view of a particular subject; the Minister will be aware of this because I wrote to him earlier about it. I should declare my interests. I am, first, a member of the National Employers Advisory Board for the Reserves of the Armed Forces. Secondly, I am honorary colonel of a TA battalion.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/2">While in Basra recently, I was struck by the similarity of certain operations to those that we carried out in Northern Ireland. But what really made an impression was the obviously low numbers of helicopters&mdash;less than half the maximum of 72 that we had in Northern Ireland. I have been involved in anti-terrorist operations in Northern Ireland for the past 30 years or so, and I saw some interesting parallels.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/3">In Basra, in the multinational force area, insurgents are not normally suicidal. However, they have taken IRA technology&mdash;which is what it was&mdash;directly off the shelf. Suffice it to say, it is a device that noble Lords may have seen in the newspapers last week. It is called a PIR RC IED&mdash;a passive infrared radio-controlled improvised explosive device. It is almost certainly manufactured in Iran. It is not improvised&mdash;the device has been made by machines in a factory. The system of initiation enables extreme accuracy. That is why soldiers are being killed in Snatch vehicles. It is also capable of disabling tracked vehicles.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/4">I am aware that we are developing counter measures. However, like Northern Ireland terrorists, the insurgents are most certainly developing the next generation of weapons to get round our counter measures. By the nature of things, we will always be slightly behind, so the problem cannot just be shuffled away, with the hope that there is a counter measure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/5">We were told by the Minister in May in answer to a Written Question that our service helicopter fleet was only 59 per cent operational. That is seriously bad news; it is a disgrace within a modern Army. We were also told that there were 28 helicopters in Iraq, of which an average of 22 per cent were not serviceable. Therefore, there are, on average, 20 serviceable aircraft in Iraq. This does not differentiate between the various capabilities. We were told that we had two Chinooks, eight Sea Kings, seven Merlins, five Pumas and six Lynx. I read a report about more Sea Kings going to Iraq, but I am not sure whether they are the right aircraft and whether we are not plugging a hole with the wrong nail.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/6">If these helicopters are defined, rather vaguely, into &quot;support/heavier lift&quot; and &quot;tactical/patrol deployment&quot; categories, that would result in the Chinooks, Sea Kings and Merlins being in the support and heavy lift category, the Pumas being dual purpose and the six Lynx being the patrolling aircraft. This does not take into account the fact that seven may be unserviceable, spread over all types, or in extremes, all from one category. That is a possibility, but we hope it does not occur.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/7">My observations are as follows. The 17 aircraft in the larger category and the Pumas in the second category are almost entirely used moving personnel and equipment between bases in the multinational force area in southern Iraq. That also includes providing aircraft to go to Baghdad occasionally. These tasks include administrative resupply, changeover of units, servicemen travelling to and from R&amp;R and hospital visits. These tasks are important&mdash;in fact, they are essential. They have become a vital priority in maintaining our deployment, so they are not for giving up, day by day, in preference to something else.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/8">That leaves the Lynx and sometimes some of the Pumas for all the other tasks, including operational patrolling, surveillance and general taxi work. Surveillance is important because our modern surveillance system&mdash;the successor to P3&mdash;fills up the back of a Puma. You cannot land it on the ground and pick up eight soldiers. That helicopter is operational for surveillance only.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/9">At the very best, it would be difficult to ring-fence the use of more than eight choppers for eagle patrolling and tactical operations by troops on the ground throughout the whole of our area. Where the use of single aircraft is at high risk, it will have to be done in pairs, thereby reducing separate operations that may be supported by choppers at any one time.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/10">In practical terms, regardless of the theory, if anyone suffers a reduction in heli hours due to serviceability, it is the soldiers deploying on routine operations&mdash;they may be routine, but they are highly dangerous in Iraq&mdash;and not the vital admin resupply and support. It is therefore true that an overall increase in helis, and therefore heli hours, by, for example, 25 per cent, would be seven aircraft. That could result in a 100 per cent increase in availability of choppers for supporting patrolling on the ground. That is not great and I do not understand why we are not doing it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/11">We have lost personnel increasingly while on mobile patrol. We had a very similar problem in Northern Ireland, and we had to put large areas completely out of bounds to mobile patrols. Where I live, across the main road, it did not matter what happened&mdash;you were not allowed to take a mobile patrol. We used covert patrol vehicles, but I accept that that is not an option for Iraq. We also used helis, but we had 72 before taking serviceability into account. They often had to operate in pairs. We must ask ourselves questions about the patrols, especially mobile patrols. Is a given patrol really necessary? What is the threat and why is the IED beside the road? Could the patrol be done on foot? If we have the heli hours, could we use helis to patrol at virtually no risk? Are the helis at risk?</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/12">There was a range of conclusions, which included the following. Obviously many mobile patrols are vital to achieve the mission, but occasionally, if you ask the questions carefully, it is found that the answer is that they are &quot;not really vital&quot;. So why are we doing it? If the threat to a mobile patrol is an IED, then why did the opposition set it up? To protect something, or purely because the patrol would pass it? If the latter is correct, then there is no need to be there, and that is why the IED is there. That is a very simple but important argument.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/13">If the patrol is on foot, it is easier, through tactics developed in Northern Ireland and now in Iraq, to protect themselves and control the environment around them. I shall not go into detail, but that is what occurs. If there are heli hours, eagle patrolling reduces the risk immediately. If helis are at risk, the use of helis in pairs enhances safety yet again. One helicopter operates while the other one watches. Two helis in the air can virtually freeze terrorist movement in a 2 kilometre-square area. The second one can react to any unusual activity. There are more ARFs&mdash;air reaction forces&mdash;in the air, day by day, which can react to other things occurring in the area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/14">In Northern Ireland, the threat to helis virtually disappeared when there was more than one of them in the air. There were occasions in County Fermanagh, where I live, when a patrol or OP was hit and there was not vital necessity for it to be there. There would have been no attack if it had not been on the ground at the time. If it was not in an ambush position, what was it doing providing a target? That is what some mobiles are doing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/15">While in Iraq, I asked a very senior person how the Iraqis will patrol when we leave and remove our technology, which is going to happen. I was told that the Iraqi mobile patrols did not seem to be targeted in the same way. We seem to be providing ourselves as a target, especially if an Iraqi patrol can do it. That is fact&mdash;it is what I was told.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/16">If you ask a senior officer, &quot;Are you coping with accomplishing your mission?&quot;, the answer will be yes. If he gave the wrong answer, you would probably remove him. However, if you were to ask, &quot;If you were provided with substantially more helis, would it change your tactics and make it safer?&quot;, the answer would be a resounding yes and you would have a very happy officer. Incidentally, an increase in helicopters to Northern Ireland levels would increase those provided to soldiers by 600 per cent.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/17">In a discussion on research for new vehicles in the other place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-26">26 June</phrase>, the Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/18" class="indent">&quot;There are medium and long-term plans relating to vehicles, and I shall be considering what we can do to respond to the situation in the short term&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/19">The review should already be under way. We are in an operational situation. How come we have just decided to do it today? The terrorists, or the insurgents, are already reviewing what we are trying to counter, and we are about to set up the review. I suppose that it is something. What are the Government doing when they say that they,</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/20" class="indent">&quot;shall be considering what we can do to respond . . . in the short term&quot;?</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/21">The &quot;short term&quot; is tomorrow. Something should already have been done. That debate was on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-26">26 June</phrase>. It is amazing.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/22">Later, the Secretary of State said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/23" class="indent">&quot;Decisions on which vehicles to use on operations are for the commanders on the ground&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 26/6/06; cols. 4-5.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/24">The commander can use only what he's got. It is a lovely turn of phrase, but if he had the helis, he wouldn't be in the wagon.</p>
	<p pid="a.1357.0/25">A number of those in another place and some commentators have asked about bigger or stronger vehicles, but I do not think that that is the right line to go down. We do, however, need a patrolling vehicle, because the type of IEDs being used will disable tracked armoured vehicles. What are you left with after such an incident? You are left with a marooned armoured vehicle. How do you get it out? If you cannot, you may have a riot situation. Or perhaps we do not need to worry about it because, after they have stopped killing people in the tracked vehicle, the crowd will ensure that the situation is sufficiently in hand to petrol-bomb the living daylights out of it. These vehicles are difficult to recover. All I will say is that these reviews are a bit late in the day, and we ought to get some of the 41 per cent of choppers which are non-operational into the air pretty quickly.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-29a.1365.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100778" speakername="Lord Garden" colon=":" colnum="1365"  time="014:11:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60629-14.htm#60629-14_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1365.0/1">My Lords, I, too, thank the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, for arranging this important debate. We have heard common themes from noble Lords, with all their wide experience. We have heard of too many operational tasks. We have heard of deficiencies in the current equipment and in the future equipment programme. The question of insufficient resources in the defence budget has come up time and again. Most important, we have heard expressions of concern about the way in which our men and women who serve and try to make the system work in the Armed Forces are feeling bruised. We have also heard personnel worries about the future. I want to keep the personnel issues uppermost in my remarks.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/2">I turn first to operational tasking. I was grateful for the remarks of the noble Lord, Lord Owen, about the lack of a debate on Iraq and Afghanistan with a Foreign Office Minister to respond to it. Despite the assurances that I had that such a debate would happen before the Recess, it has not. I trust that it will happen soon after the Recess. For all the reasons that the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, gave for the necessity to look at the grand strategic picture of these campaigns, it is important that we have this debate and that it is answered by a Foreign Office Minister.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/3">The challenges that our troops face in these two theatres remain severe, as we have heard. In Iraq, the announcement of the forthcoming handover of one of the provinces to the Iraqi security forces is of course welcome, but it means that we will see a redistribution to the more difficult areas, such as the urban areas of Basra. What effect will the forthcoming departures by the Japanese and Italian personnel have on UK force taskings in that area?</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/4">The other major operational challenge, as we have heard, is in Afghanistan. We are in a period of transition as the south goes over to NATO control from Operation Enduring Freedom. It is a considerable test for the alliance, and clarity of purpose and command is essential. The chairman of the Defence Select Committee, James Arbuthnot, speaking in the defence debate last week in the other place, asked whether,</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/5" class="indent">&quot;the operational command and control between ISAF and Operation Enduring Freedom has been fully worked out&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 22/6/06; col. 1539.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/6">In the same debate Sir Malcolm Rifkind&mdash;a former Defence Secretary, of course&mdash;worried that we might,</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/7" class="indent">&quot;maintain an inefficient military command structure that cannot deliver the best results&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 22/6/06; col. 1532.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/8">He also warned that it might be used to justify a reduced American commitment. We cannot afford to find ourselves trying to solve Afghanistan with allies who operate under debilitating national constraints and with the focus of the United States moving away. I ask the Minister to address this issue in his remarks, as I think that we have yet to be reassured on these questions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/9">As we have heard, both Iraq and Afghanistan, although different operations, pose common equipment and personnel challenges. Lack of appropriate equipment to give safe mobility has been a common theme in a number of speeches today. Reflecting on his visit to Iraq, the chairman of the Defence Select Committee said in the other place last week:</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/10" class="indent">&quot;The number of helicopters there is tiny, and the number of vehicles is too small&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 22/6/06; col. 1541.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/11">I was grateful to the noble Viscount, Lord Brookeborough, for giving us the detail behind that. I agreed with everything he said. Whether it is vehicle protection on the ground or lack of helicopter lift, we are seriously hampering our operational capability.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/12">In sum, I worry that we have a serious problem of not concentrating sufficiently on the needs of the two major operations in which we find ourselves engaged. The future of Trident, on which we had two speeches, FRES, new carriers, network-enabled capabilities, Future Lynx, JSF, Astute submarines, A400M, Type 45 frigates and the other new projects are important issues, but I fear&mdash;and, having listened to the speech of the noble Lord, Lord Levene, am now certain&mdash;that they will arrive later than expected and cost more than we have budgeted for, as has been the case in the past. We have to get by in the mean time. As an example, my first operational tour was on the &quot;Canberra&quot;; next July, the &quot;Canberra&quot; goes out of service after 55 yeas of operations constantly waiting for replacement. We have to make do with the equipment that we have, and we need to focus on where to upgrade it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/13">We know that we are going to be in Afghanistan for at least the next three years, and it would be a brave forecaster who thought that Iraq would be all right in less than that time. What can we do to urgently improve the capabilities that are available now? As the noble Lord, Lord De Mauley, reminded us, we need greater numbers of suitable troops and specialists to reduce the operational pinch points, which are defined as the trades where there is insufficient strength to perform directed tasks. The AFPRB identified those pinch points in its February report and I remind your Lordships of the astonishing figures: 20 different manning areas in the Royal Navy, 25 in the Army and 40 in the Royal Air Force.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/14">This is a double whammy. We have the Armed Forces working continuously beyond the defence planning assumptions year after year. We also have a shortfall in the key specialisations for operational tasks, which is why we cannot achieve harmony levels in those areas in particular. That affects retention, which in turn makes shortages more acute and drives down experience levels. As the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, told us, it also affects the level of training that we can give these people, so they are less experienced and less trained.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/15">We had the opportunity on <phrase class="date" code="2006-03-23">23 March</phrase> this year, following a Statement by the Minister, to debate how the Reserves are being affected by this operational overstretch. I trust that he will give us an update on how that is progressing, particularly on the medical side. The lack of medical capability in the Regular Forces is likely to worsen because of growing pay differentials between civilian and military doctors. The AFPRB report on medical pay for this year has still not been published. Why not? Dr Brendan McKeating, chairman of the British Medical Association Armed Forces Committee, speaking at the conference this week, said that,</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/16" class="indent">&quot;if . . . a low or inflation-matching pay award for armed forces doctors is announced, it will have disastrous implications for a service which is already significantly undermanned in critical areas. It is also likely to cause many of these doctors who are the military's deployable medical experts to resign from the armed forces to go into significantly better paid NHS posts where they will not have the added turbulence of repeated deployments&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/17">I turn briefly to the future equipment programme. I am tempted to get myself into the Trident debate, but time does not allow for that and I know, given the guarantees that Ministers have given, that we shall come back and have a proper debate on it in due course. I have a few key questions, though. We want the Eurofighter Typhoon to be air-to-ground. That is what we need it for operationally. When are we going to know what capabilities are going to be added to the Eurofighter to give it that capacity, and when will they arrive?</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/18">On the carrier programme, I ask not when will they come into service, but when the Minister anticipates that the first piece of metal will be cut. Where are we on JSF discussions with the US, which seem to go up and down on whether the technology transfer will happen? I have one question on the nuclear deterrent, which reflects a point that the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Boyce, made: what assumptions have been made about the funding profile beyond 2010? Has the Ministry of Defence already allowed for the Trident replacement, or must this be found at the expense of other capabilities?</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/19">On the defence industrial strategy, I remind your Lordships of the conclusion of the Defence Select Committee:</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/20" class="indent">&quot;Adequate funding will be vital for the success of the Defence Industrial Strategy&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/21">Does the Minister agree with that? The committee went on to say:</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/22" class="indent">&quot;This will be a key issue for the MoD to negotiate with HM Treasury in the Comprehensive Spending Review&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/23">That brings me to the defence budget. It is the key to how we manage all the problems that we have been talking about. In July 2001, the late Sir Michael Alexander and I wrote an article in <i>International Affairs</i> entitled &quot;The Arithmetic of Defence Policy&quot;. We looked back over 25 years of spending and forward for 20 years. Using forward projections and assumptions, we reckoned that defence in 2020 would receive 1.3 per cent of UK GDP. Five years on, the proportion of GDP is tracking our graph exactly. We then forecast a consequential front line of half the 2001 size after 20 years. Again, we have seen such cuts.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/24">We offered a solution that looked much more seriously at sharing capabilities across Europe. Unfortunately, progress there has been too slow. Without any serious uplift in defence funds&mdash;which I think is unlikely&mdash;or deeper co-operation with allies, I fear that your Lordships will find themselves debating reductions in front-line capabilities every year.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/25">I conclude by talking about the servicemen and servicewomen and how they are affected by operational, budgetary and equipment decisions. We keep speaking about their extraordinary dedication and how they put up with conditions of service that sometimes appear to come from a different age&mdash;perhaps the Victorian age. In that respect, I ask the Minister to look more carefully at draft Answers to Questions, because they are read by servicemen. If it sounds as though everything is okay, there is a feeling of disconnect between the MoD and the serviceman. I refer to Deepcut, Gulf War illness, new pension and redundancy arrangements, accommodation standards, which were covered very well by the noble Lords, Lord Luke and Lord De Mauley, or the latest incident of the joint personnel administration system, which has left various people not getting their additional pay when they should have done.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/26">I was not going to talk about the Armed Forces Federation, but the noble and gallant Lord, Lord Inge, mentioned it. Other nations manage to operate serious militaries while having a federation. If there is no other way of solving some of the problems that we have been talking about than to raise their profile, that may be a reasonable way forward. Certainly, directors of public relations are important for internal and external PR. We need the services to feel good about themselves and that means that they need service people doing the public relations, both internally and externally.</p>
	<p pid="a.1365.0/27">We ask an incredible amount of the services and we mourn the continuing deaths and serious injuries, but the focus must be on the people and giving them adequate standards of care. The duty of care is greater than in any other sector of the community. If that means reducing operational commitments, that may be the price that has to be paid, or we will find ourselves with a great deal of shiny equipment but nobody to operate it.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-29a.1384.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100427" speakername="Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer" colon=":" colnum="1384"  time="015:22:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60629-18.htm#60629-18_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.1384.0/1">My Lords, we on these Benches also welcome the Statement. It gives us just the skeleton and will be fleshed out by the formal national allocation plan and a lot of my questions will be reserved for that phase of the business. However, phase 2 is important and is one of the main tools that this country has for getting us on track to meet our Kyoto targets. Now that we have reached phase 2, we have to avoid some of the failures of phase 1.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384.0/2">One of the most difficult things across industry and for the public of phase 1 is that it was not very clear that the polluter pays. This issue got lost in a blizzard of figures, percentages and statistics. People really want to now whether this is being effective in reducing carbons admissions.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384.0/3">The Minister said that the provision would cover 45 per cent of our admissions of the sectors included. That is critical. The Minister has been silent on a couple of areas because they will fall within the fuller plan, and on whether aviation and transport in any form will be included in the full plan. There is a disconnect with which the Government I am sure struggles, which is common in every government in Europe&mdash;that is, we have national allocation plans within a single market.</p>
	<p pid="a.1384.0/4">At the moment energy and the allocating plans are a national matter. That makes it very difficult. Will the Minister give his reaction to the setting of the German levels? When we reach phase 3, will there be any thought of setting the levels at a European level and therefore making sure that no country falls for the temptation of setting a lower level on the basis of safeguarding its industries?</p>
	<p pid="a.1384.0/5">I was cheered to hear the Minister make the announcement about the Defra/DTI Environmental Transformation Fund. Is the intention that the auctioning process will produce the revenue for the fund? It was not clear to me where the revenue would come from. I imagine that the Government have thought about the size of the fund. I see that the scale and scope of it will be announced in the spending review for implementation in 2008, so there is a while to wait. Will the Minister give some idea where the proceeds from the auction will go?</p>
	<p pid="a.1384.0/6">I have a couple of final questions on the shape of the national allocation plan. What sort of incentives will there be to ensure that new entrants invest in low carbon fuels and efficient technologies? Again for new entrants, will there be clear definitions and consistent applications of the relevant provisions to support incentive structures and fairness? For the plants for which closure is the only option, will this scheme sufficiently push to close those old, inefficient and highly polluting plants?</p>
	<p pid="a.1384.0/7">These Benches welcome this very important tool. It takes us through to 2012. If the first phase was a learning curve for not making the same mistakes in the second phase, perhaps it is disappointing that we have not ironed out all the faults. Early on in this 2007&ndash;08 period we must ensure that by the time we get into the post-Kyoto scenario, which will be phase 3, the scheme is as perfect as possible at a European level.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-29a.1385.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100549" speakername="Lord Rooker" colon=":" colnum="1385"  time="015:28:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60629-18.htm#60629-18_spnew2">
	<p pid="a.1385.0/1">My Lords, I am grateful for the responses of the noble Lord and the noble Baroness, not least because they have kept off some of the technical stuff in what is quite a complicated Statement. I am doubly grateful to the noble Baroness because she opened her remarks by saying that she would save most of her questions for when we make the final allegation plan, which has to be done by <phrase class="date" code="">31 December</phrase>. I look forward to being more onboard then.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385.0/2">I am very pleased that nobody has questioned that there is a real problem&mdash;that is very important for business and the wider population. There is a major problem out there; the science is clearly with us; and there are disputes about it. On a visit to one of the department's laboratories the other day, I came across a couple of facts that have stayed with me. Things were explained in a way that puts the matter across to ordinary bods and industry. For example, the amount of fresh water lost from the Greenland ice cap in recent years is enough to cover France to a depth of 35 kilometres. That is an enormous change. The other fact is that of the 10 hottest years ever recorded, nine of them were in the past 10 years. So something is happening out there which we must get a grip on. Climate change is a major issue.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385.0/3">I did not understand the surprise of the noble Lord, Lord Dixon Smith, about the Statement. We were obliged to make a Statement by <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-30">30 June</phrase>, and we have done so. We have met that commitment.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385.0/4">We did a lot more than others in phase 1 and the proposed cap moves us towards our domestic target and confirms our position as leaders in the climate change debate. We make no apology for wanting to be a leader in the debate, as the Prime Minister has made absolutely clear. The commission has sent a very strong message about expectations of member states. Colleagues are quite right to ask about that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385.0/5">The recent article in the <i>Financial Times</i> by Commissioner Dimas stated that the Commission will use all political and legal tools at its disposal to ensure that national plans are fully consistent with Kyoto commitments and the verified data, so that there is a scarcity on the market and a level playing field for all participants. It has stated its intention to use actual, verified emissions from 2005 as a starting point for assessing member states' national allocation plans. That will mean more significant cuts from the majority of other member states. That makes the point that the noble Baroness asked about: we have information from phase 1. We did not have it before we started. So we are moving forward.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385.0/6">The United Kingdom supports the messages from the Commission. We are actively lobbying to ensure that all member states set caps in line with the requirements of the directive to ensure real scarcity in the market. Ministerial calls are being made to Germany, France, Spain and Italy to build support across Europe for that leadership.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385.0/7">On the level of auction and the 7 per cent figure, a range of factors were listed in the consultation. I understand that, at the moment, there is no auction and the figure may move to 10 per cent. The figure of 7 per cent takes into consideration the 20 million tonnes of CO2 that we think are missing from phase 1. I have seen constant references to that. Those in the know, which I presume includes those on the two Opposition Front Benches, will understand that there is an issue about a missing 20 million tonnes. The consideration of the auction takes account of that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385.0/8">The fund is a major opportunity. We will grasp the opportunity of the new fund to invest in renewable energy, non-nuclear low-carbon technologies and energy efficiency. There are a range of issues associated with that to deal with. Indeed, one of the Select Committees of your Lordships' House is undertaking an inquiry into biomass energy and use of fuel. So a lot of work is going on.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385.0/9">The question that the noble Baroness asked about aviation and transport is wholly legitimate. It is like the dog that did not bark. I understand that the Commission is due to adopt proposals to include aviation later this year. We hope that aviation can be included in phase 2 and we are considering extending that to other sectors in later phases and working with the Commission on that.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385.0/10">As I said, we are now in the second year of the first phase of the scheme. The results from year one have provided a first opportunity to judge allocations against emissions. As has been implied from what happened in the market earlier this year, it has been discovered that most member states' caps do not provide the scarcity that the scheme demands. The UK cap is 245 million tonnes and I understand that our system has worked quite well.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385.0/11">As for the environmental transformation fund using the proceeds from the auction, the decisions on the fund must be part of the normal process of public expenditure decision-making, as was mentioned in the Statement. The fact that we are auctioning 7 per cent of allowances will create receipts that will improve the expenditure context. That is new money designed to channel money into investment in renewables and low-carbon technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385.0/12">If we use our brains and our innovation, we are on the cusp of helping to create in this country whole new industries in which we can almost repeat the Industrial Revolution in our offering to the rest of the world. We have an early start in many ways, and there are many examples from around the country of attempts at renewables, which, as I say, give us enormous potential.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385.0/13">New entrants will receive a level of allocation that incentivises the best available technologies. That is the only answer that I can give the noble Baroness. This is important; we want new entrants, but we want them to be incentivised. The whole scheme is a very low-cost way of introducing low-carbon technologies.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385.0/14">So far as future plans are concerned, the Commission is reviewing the directive and drafting a proposal to amend it, and we are already working with the Commission to ensure that lessons are learnt.</p>
	<p pid="a.1385.0/15">Finally, the noble Baroness asked about some of the older plants and how we will make inefficient plants close. Events will encourage investment in low-carbon technology. A stronger cap across all member states will stimulate demand in the carbon market and encourage investment in cleaner technology. The whole point of trading is that the Government do not decide which plant closes; businesses do. In other words, it is a commercial decision. That is the whole point. If we can build that in, we do not get political or non-market inference; we get something that makes people outside see that it is worth investing in change. That is the best way in which to bring about change. It is certainly preferred above all state direction. We must have a level playing field, which is why we have to work within the context of the EU.</p>

	<p pid="a.1387.0/1">My Lords, I welcome the Statement on this important subject and the Government's decision to set the cap at the top end of the range of effort on which they consulted. But the cost of carbon alliances, and therefore their impact, is driven, as the Statement pointed out, by the cumulative effect of all member states' decisions and the level of ambition of individual member states.</p>
	<p pid="a.1387.0/2">The review published this week by the Carbon Trust chief economist pointed out that if member states do not demand sufficiently large emissions reductions, the system will unravel and be ineffective. It is now clear that, during phase 1, there was considerable over-allowance by individual member states and by member states collectively. As the Statement put it,</p>
	<p pid="a.1387.0/3" class="indent">&quot;most member states' caps for phase 1 do not provide the scarcity the scheme demands&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1387.0/4">It follows that cuts in allowances for phase 2 must not relate to those made in phase 1, but need to be assessed against a baseline on the recalculated 2005 emissions data that are now available.</p>
	<p pid="a.1387.0/5">The Minister said that the UK will expect more stringent caps to be enforced in phase 2, and will support the European Commission in its efforts to ensure tough caps. Good&mdash;I welcome that&mdash;but will the Government make every possible effort to ensure that the reductions are made from the revised data and not from the over-allowances for phase 1? I think the Minister began to indicate that that was the Government's position when he responded to a previous question, but I think it is the crucial issue on which the industry awaits an answer. Can he also assure me that the UK has given the lead by calculating our allowances on that basis?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-29a.1412.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100074" speakername="Viscount Bridgeman" colon=":" colnum="1412"  time="017:08:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60629-24.htm#60629-24_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.1412.0/1">My Lords, after the eloquent speech of the noble Baroness, Lady Walmsley, it is clear that I must reassess the role of my gender. I join other noble Lords in thanking the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, for initiating this debate. The House is fortunate to have among its Members just about the most informed and influential of authorities in the country on the subject of prisons. It would be unfair to describe his speech as a wake-up call to the Government, for I am aware of the efforts made by Ministers to address this desperate problem; perhaps we can say that it is the snooze button making itself known.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/2">The statistics regarding women prisoners speak for themselves and have been referred to by many noble Lords. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of women being incarcerated: a rise of 126 per cent between 1992 and 2002 compared with only 52 per cent for men, and so on.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/3">This derives from the increasing tendency of courts to remand women in custody. The fact that women offenders commit fewer serious crimes and have shorter criminal careers than men is also important. Many are small players in the drugs train, often simply acting as mules. In turn, that possibly partly explains the startling rise in foreign nationals in custody, of whom about half who are convicted for drug offences are Jamaican.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/4">The Fawcett Society points out that on the whole women receive lesser sentences than men. However, while a custodial sentence of even one year is not enough to give a woman some form of corrective training, it is quite long enough to break up a family unit. Then there is the obvious extra strain imposed by women prisoners on family life, particularly children. I believe that female prisoners across the country have an average of between two and 2.5 children. The chilling statistic from the Prison Reform Trust is that 17,000 children are separated each year from their mothers by imprisonment, and that 66 per cent of female prisoners are mothers. There is also the risk to which these children are exposed&mdash;often separated from their mothers under traumatic circumstances&mdash;of social exclusion, and of the children themselves becoming offenders in the future.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/5">Many noble Lords have spoken eloquently on the problems of suicide and self-harm. They are much greater for women than for men and significantly greater in local prisons than in training prisons.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/6">Then there is the factor of unintended consequences. Because there are fewer women's prisons than men's prisons, they are unevenly distributed around the country&mdash;we have heard that there are none in Wales&mdash;and the chances of women being held remote from their families is that much greater. As the right reverend Prelate the Bishop of Southwark reminded us, half of female prisoners are held more than 50 miles from their home town, and a quarter are held more than 100 miles away.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/7">The subject of churning often features in these debates; it appears to be an intractable feature of the prison system, whereby convicted prisoners have to be transferred to make way for remand prisoners, who have to be kept near their court of appearance. This, again, is a particularly acute problem for women prisoners, with the additional complication of families. I would welcome the Minister's reassurance that this churning of women prisoners in particular is being reduced.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/8">The noble Baroness, Lady Stern, reminded us of the transportation of females between prisons. Why are there no seat belts in those vehicles? It is because the authorities consider that it is probably better to have women shaken around during transportation, although in some cases they may be heavily pregnant, rather than expose them to the risk of a ligature&mdash;that awful word&mdash;if a seat belt is provided?</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/9">The case of the six women left behind in Durham prison after the transition to an all-male establishment has passed into folklore among people concerned with the welfare of women in prison. They were largely forgotten. There was a scathing report by the chief inspector following a visit in June 2006. Juliet Lyon of the Prison Reform Trust visited the six women in October 2004, and her account states:</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/10" class="indent">&quot;Last October, during a PRT visit to Durham prison, I met a woman prisoner covered in open cuts and scars lying on a mattress on her cell floor littered with blood-stained bedding and clothing. From outside the cell door also surrounded by blood-stained material, a male officer was doing his best to talk to and comfort her. The then Governor stated that this woman had been waiting for some time for a transfer to a secure hospital&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/11">My only comment is that this was nearly two years ago, and we should give the authorities in Durham the benefit of the doubt that things have improved.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/12">On <phrase class="date" code="2006-05-26">26 May</phrase>, Cathy Stancer of<i> </i>Women in Prison, Juliet Lyon of the Prison Reform Trust and Deborah Coles of Inquest wrote to Dr John Reid, drawing his attention to the distance from home of many women prisoners. They made the simple and sensible suggestion that in response to the strain on accommodation of additional women prisoners and the re-roling of women's prisons to male prisons, it would be a much more effective use of resources to divert women who pose no threat to public safety to specialist drug, alcohol and mental health services, and give them the focused support they need to stop them reoffending. I would welcome a comment on that letter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/13">This debate is about the creation of a women's justice board. The scene was set by the publication of the Wedderburn report, a seminal document, but that was published six years ago. The noble and learned Lord, Lord Woolf, then the Lord Chief Justice, said it all in the following year:</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/14" class="indent">&quot;There should be a board responsible for women in the criminal justice system. Its responsibilities in relation to women should be similar to the Youth Justice Board. It should regard its primary responsibility to be to contain the growth of the women prison population&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/15">The Youth Justice Board has indeed been a success, as the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and others have reminded us.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/16">The Police and Justice Bill is passing through your Lordships' House as we speak. The whole of the inspectorate system is under review. There surely cannot be a better time to address with urgency the creation of a women's justice board. Many of the factors underlying women's offending such as education, employment, health, childcare and housing, lie beyond the control mechanism of the criminal justice system and the Home Office. The case has surely been made for a multi-agency approach to deal with women's offending. The Youth Justice Board does indeed straddle different agencies and has proved itself a successful body. Let this be a template for a women's justice board.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/17">Such a board must have a wide remit. It must for instance encompass the awful problems often faced by women on release from prison. Prisoners often speak of the curiously strange world they find themselves in even after short sentences. Add to that the trauma largely peculiar to women prisoners. The Prison Reform Trust estimates that one third of women in prison will find that they have lost their homes and possibly their possessions, as a result of incarceration. The Fawcett Society says:</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/18" class="indent">&quot;On release, women find themselves in a catch-22 situation; they have problems getting their children back if they do not have a home, but have problems in getting a home if they are not caring for their children&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/19">They just cannot win.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/20">The marginalisation of women prisoners has been with us for years. Because they form only 6 per cent of the prison population, it easy to see how their special needs have tended to be ignored, and, to be fair, it did not start with this Government.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/21">I have one last thought. I once again urge the Minister to look overseas at other countries' practices. For this I am indebted to the Fawcett Society. In Russia, for example, mothers of children under the age of 14 who are convicted of all but the most serious offences are routinely given suspended sentences. In Germany, women are housed under curfew with their children in units attached to prisons but located outside the gates.</p>
	<p pid="a.1412.0/22">To return to the subject of this debate, something must surely be done. I fear that I am not alone in expressing my disappointment at the Minister's reply on <phrase class="date" code="2006-02-01">1 February</phrase> that the Government have no plans to act on the three proposals of the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, and his successor Anne Owers, all focusing on the creation of a women's justice board. Against that background, I once again thank the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham, for setting the tone for this outstandingly well informed debate. I look forward with anticipation to what the Minister has to tell us. In particular, can she give us any encouragement on the creation of a new women's justice board to fulfil the eloquent forecast of her noble friend Lord Rooker with which this debate started, along with the noble Lord, Lord Ramsbotham?</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-29a.1423.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100850" speakername="Lord Chidgey" colon=":" colnum="1423"  time="017:50:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60629-27.htm#60629-27_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1423.0/1">My Lords, I join the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, in congratulating Tom Clarke on his tireless work inside and outside Parliament to advance the transparency and accountability that we so desperately need in international development. I also join her in welcoming our two newly ennobled colleagues who are to break their duck, so to speak, tonight. I particularly welcome my noble friend Lord Cotter, who has been a colleague and a friend in the other place for many years. I know he will make a valuable contribution to our proceedings in this Chamber.</p>
	<p pid="a.1423.0/2">As Tom Clarke emphasises, at the heart of his Bill is an annual report to Parliament on progress in aid and millennium development goals, on accountancy, on accountability and on transparency. I welcome the Bill as a tool&mdash;a weapon&mdash;to address the woes of unfortunate failures in international development aid policy in past years. However, it is only one tool in the toolbox, only one weapon in the armoury. The Make Poverty History campaign last year reminded us of the challenge facing the developed world in empowering poor countries to reach the development goals. The challenge was starkly underlined in Africa.</p>
	<p pid="a.1423.0/3">I declare my usual interest as a vice-chairman of the Africa All-Party Parliamentary Group and vice-chairman of a number of other African country groups. As the Secretary of State, Hilary Benn, said, nearly half the population of sub-Saharan Africa lives on less than a dollar a day. Some 40 million children are not at school and, of those who are at school, far too often the girls do not complete their education. They are taken out of school at the end of the primary phase because culturally their place is considered to be at home, rather than being educated. Some 250 million Africans do not have access to safe water or to sanitation and each year, millions die from HIV/AIDS, TB, malaria and water-borne diseases.</p>
	<p pid="a.1423.0/4">Of the G8 commitments to Africa made at Gleneagles last year, very little&mdash;perhaps inevitably&mdash;has so far been delivered on the ground. Real change will, I think, take decades. I believe that it would be a mistake to concentrate entirely on aid to lift the grinding poverty that the continent has suffered. Despite decades in which its resources have been ravaged, Africa remains a rich continent. The key to bringing millions of citizens in Africa out of poverty and out of despair is not simply to rely on aid, but to aid Africa in developing its own economy and to develop its trade between African countries as well as with the industrialised world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1423.0/5">A critical aspect of taking the citizens of Africa out of poverty is to break the stranglehold of corruption: corruption in their governments, corruption in their financial and commercial institutions and corruption in their trading partners, including here in the United Kingdom. That is why we should welcome this reporting and transparency Bill, as a step towards enshrining accountability and the crime of corruption in our own laws.</p>
	<p pid="a.1423.0/6">As I said before, to a degree the Bill provides a tool to help to tackle corruption, but other more powerful legislative tools are coming down the track to complement this Bill once Parliament has had the opportunity to deliberate them. Some noble Lords may recall that in a debate in this Chamber on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-19">19 June</phrase>, on the Africa All-Party Group's report on corruption, <i>The Other Side of the Coin</i>, I drew attention to the need for a corruption Bill to address the shortcomings in United Kingdom legislation in the battle against corruption. This Bill cannot address those shortcomings, and that is not its fault. It is a short Bill, which will hopefully have a rapid passage through this House. By definition, it cannot address the wider issues.</p>
	<p pid="a.1423.0/7">I am grateful that, within three days of that debate, the Government published their response to the recommendations made in that report. In particular, I welcome the announcement of the appointment of the Secretary of State for International Development as an anti-corruption champion. I look forward to seeing the gentleman in that role. I am sure it is a capable fit.</p>
	<p pid="a.1423.0/8">I also welcome the fact that the Government have agreed to find funding for a new international corruption task force. It is all to the good. But we still need progress with legislation such as a corruption Bill; for example, that prepared by a well known NGO, Transparency International, in draft form. It has taken a lead by helping with the preparation of a ten-minute rule Bill introduced in another place. It is ready, as noble colleagues and the Minister will know, to be presented as a Private Member's Bill in this House should the need arise.</p>
	<p pid="a.1423.0/9">The positive elements of the Government's response to the Africa group's report are welcomed. But it remains to be seen whether it will lead to the degree of effort required to prosecute corruption legislation in its entirely. For example, the United Kingdom is one of 14 parties to the OECD anti-bribery convention, under which not a single prosecution for foreign bribery has been made in recent years. That is surprising, given the United Kingdom's substantial involvement in sectors and countries with a high risk of corruption. It is not enough for the Government to say that it remains committed to introducing a corruption Bill in due course.</p>
	<p pid="a.1423.0/10">Earlier this year, DfID took the initiative of consulting widely on its new White Paper on development. In response, TI has submitted a comprehensive paper, setting out how anti-corruption measures could improve the effectiveness of our development policy and assistance. The Bill is, in many ways, a scene-setter for an approach supported by the TI submission and many others. The draft corruption Bill sets out the actions that can be taken in legislative form.</p>
	<p pid="a.1423.0/11">Finally, while I welcome Tom Clarke's Bill and genuinely wish it speedy progress into law, I urge the House to note and consider that much more remains to be done before we have a comprehensive box of tools to tackle corruption in development aid and other funding.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-29a.1425.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100444" speakername="Lord Morris of Manchester" colon=":" colnum="1425"  time="017:58:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60629-27.htm#60629-27_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.1425.0/1">My Lords, I was delighted to hear my noble friend Lady Whitaker so ably detailing the Bill's provisions and strongly commending this humane and long overdue measure to your Lordships' House. She did so with compelling concern, commitment and charm. Her speech alone justifies a Second Reading for the Bill. With my noble friend and the noble Lord, Lord Chidgey, I very much look forward to the maiden speeches in the debate of my noble friend Lady Quin, and the noble Lord, Lord Cotter.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/2">Like my noble friend Lady Whitaker, I congratulate and pay tribute today to my right honourable friend Tom Clarke on steering the Bill through the House of Commons with such skill and success. Speaking as a serial legislator&mdash;both as a private Member and a Minister&mdash;I hold his achievement in admiration. By all the tests of the good MP, he is an outstanding parliamentarian. For me this is a deeply evocative moment. It calls to mind the warm all-party support he received in enacting his Private Member's Bill that became the Disabled Persons (Services, Consultation and Representation) Act 1986. My roles then were as Tom's co-sponsor of his Bill, and secondly, to lead for Her Majesty's Opposition at all stages of its progress through the House of Commons. I described him at that time as a young parliamentarian of high promise. Now he is one of even higher performance.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/3">Very few parliamentarians have succeeded in taking two Private Members' Bills&mdash;and in different policy areas&mdash;to the statute book. I believe Tom Clarke will soon become one and this measure, like Tom himself, deserves well of this House. One would not have had to out-prophesy the prophet Isaiah to predict&mdash;after his success in the ballot for Private Members' Bills for the current parliamentary Session&mdash;that Tom's chosen measure would again be one to relieve and reduce preventable human suffering.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/4">At Report in another place on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-16">16 June</phrase>, Tom wisely reflected that Private Members' Bills are defeated not only by determined opponents but often also,</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/5" class="indent">&quot;by their friends and supporters&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/6">He advised his supporters to,</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/7" class="indent">&quot;stick to the brevity to which I have committed myself&quot;.&mdash;[<i>Official Report</i>, Commons, 16/6/06; col. 1008.]</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/8">Even more important today is the fact that there is now no parliamentary time-allocation left for debating further amendments to this Bill in the House of Commons. Thus amending it here would end any realistic prospect of it becoming law. That is the backcloth against which this debate is taking place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/9">In her speech, my noble friend Lady Whitaker emphasised the Bill's importance in making executive government more accountable. Unquestionably also its enactment will help parliamentarians more effectively to discharge their duty&mdash;some would say sovereign duty&mdash;to subject policy-making in this deeply sensitive and crucially important field to much more detailed scrutiny than is possible today.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/10">Who among us here can have any doubt that the combined wisdom of this House in scrutinising the annual report the Bill requires will improve policy-making on issues such as aid, debt and trade; or have any doubt that more accountability will benefit those most in need provided, of course, that it is not just about listening and responding to well-heeled lobbyists but hearing the cries of those now unheard?</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/11">Improved accountability, transparency and scrutiny can and must be about ensuring that most help from the resources we provide reaches those most in need. That this is not happening now was graphically illustrated by UNICEF's classic report <i>The State of the World's Children 1994</i> which stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/12" class="indent">&quot;When so much could be done for so many and at so little cost, then one central, shameful fact becomes unavoidable: the reason that these problems are not being overcome is not because the task is too large or too difficult or too expensive. It is that the job is not being given sufficient priority because those most severely affected are almost exclusively the poorest and least politically influential people on earth&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/13">Today that &quot;shameful fact&quot; is well exemplified by the incidence of blindness across the world. Four out of five blind people live in the third world and four out of five of them are preventably blind. Yet as that inspired crusader against avoidable disabilities, my friend the late and still widely mourned Sir John Wilson, so clearly demonstrated, the cost of saving people in the third world from preventable blindness has been falling as dramatically as the incidence of preventable blindness in many of the poorest countries has increased.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/14">Dr Samuel Johnson wrote:</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/15" class="indent">&quot;How small of all that human hearts endure, That part that Lords and Kings can cure&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/16">By hastening Royal Assent to this Bill&mdash;the Tom Clarke Bill&mdash;this House can refute that cynical assessment of what parliamentarians acting together can achieve in righting the wrongs endured by the weak and vulnerable.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/17">It will not be the first refutation of Dr Johnson's cynicism&mdash;take the case of Wilberforce and human slavery&mdash;but never was it more necessary than it is now to wield all the influence we have to ensure that right is done in transforming endurance into lives worth living for the poor, vulnerable and afflicted people this Bill can help.</p>
	<p pid="a.1425.0/18">We were reminded by my right honourable friend the Prime Minister only this week that too few aid pledges are made for real and too many for show. This Bill is about being real and I, too, commend it unreservedly to the House.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-29a.1431.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100907" speakername="Lord Cotter" colon=":" colnum="1431"  time="018:20:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60629-29.htm#60629-29_spnew0">
	<p pid="a.1431.0/1">My Lords, I congratulate the noble Baroness, Lady Quin, on her maiden speech. I shall have to strive very hard to match the ability and fluency that she achieved a short while ago. Perhaps I may say how grateful I am for this opportunity to speak in your Lordships' House for the first time, in particular when we are talking about worldwide events. Most important, I thank enormously all concerned for the support and help that I have been given up to and after my introduction on <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-05">5 June</phrase>, especially the noble Lord, Lord Redesdale, and the noble Baroness, Lady Northover, who is here today, for introducing me on the Floor of the House. I also thank the many noble Lords from all quarters who have made me most welcome, as well as the official staff and everyone for being so supportive.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431.0/2">I should like to mention the introduction packs and information leaflets given to new Peers, which describe the working background and responsibilities of this House. I am sure that all noble Lords would agree that this information reaches the highest standards of presentation and content. Very few commercial firms or other organisations could do better. This information undoubtedly reflects the smooth efficiency and high standards of this House. I hope to do all that I can to justify the encouragement and help that I have received.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431.0/3">I would especially like to avoid an experience that I had early on in my eight years as a Member in the other place. During Prayers, I remember hearing the familiar sound of a mobile phone ringing. I looked around, thinking, &quot;This is outrageous&quot;. But wait&mdash;the sound seemed to be rather close. In fact, it was coming from my pocket. Imagine my embarrassment when Prayers finished and there were cries from the opposite Benches, led by the redoubtable Dennis Skinner: &quot;It's him. It's him&quot;. Fortunately for me, the Speaker, now the noble Baroness, Lady Boothroyd, chose to ignore it and proceeded with business. Today, I have not only switched off my mobile phone but left it in my office just to be sure.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431.0/4">I am glad that my title &quot;of Congresbury&quot; enables me to speak about the village where my wife and I live. It has a lively and caring population, a real community, which dates back to the 12th century.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431.0/5">I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate because the subject is dear to my and many other people's hearts. In particular, I would like to speak about an event of a horrifying nature in 1994&mdash;the genocide in Rwanda. I declare an interest as the patron of SURF, a charity that was set up in 1997 to aid and assist survivors&mdash;widows, women, children and families&mdash;of the Rwandan genocide. In 1994, in only 100 days, more than 1 million people were slaughtered.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431.0/6">In all adversity there are heroes, and I would like to talk about some of them. My first is Fergal Keane, the well known TV journalist and fellow patron of SURF. He was a prime mover in letting the world know of the genocide, risking his life and continuing to tell the story since. He is a hero because it takes both physical and moral courage to do something of that nature. It is a role, of course, that is still being played courageously even today by many other journalists throughout the world.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431.0/7">My second hero is Mary Blewitt, who set up and runs the charity SURF. Supported by many good people, she is an inspiration and a survivor herself. I know that she would want me to refer to many others who work heroically for this cause, but mostly she would say&mdash;and I agree&mdash;that there are other heroes, those who survived and to this day struggle to cope and recover. The work of SURF includes practical aid, while a big aim is to establish a resource and testimony centre to provide an archive and a sanctuary for survivors in Rwanda. Work goes on to respect the dead. Over the past year, 22 mass graves have been built and a further 23 are planned for 2006 so that people can pay their respects.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431.0/8">Speaking of heroes, there are many testimonies, and I shall refer to just one, that of a young girl called Valentina, who was 11 years old when the events took place. As she said, she came from a,</p>
	<p pid="a.1431.0/9" class="indent">&quot;happy family who did not want for anything&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431.0/10">But on <phrase class="date" code="1994-04-12">12 April 1994</phrase>, killers entered the church where they had taken refuge, killing her family for no reason.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431.0/11">Finally I want to speak of another hero, Lieutenant-General Romeo Dallaire, the general in charge of the UN force entrusted to stop the killing. He was not given the troops he needed and his warnings were not heeded during the run-up to the genocide. The killing could have been stopped and the general strove heroically. But because of lack of support and troops, we see a record of United Nations failure and the moral cowardice of many, allowing the genocide to take place.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431.0/12">What is my reason for mentioning this today? I make a plea once again that the genocide in Rwanda must not be forgotten. We have natural tragedies in this world which are usually unstoppable, but we must renew our efforts to stop human killing human. I should like to end with some words from Lieutenant-General Dallaire:</p>
	<p pid="a.1431.0/13" class="indent">&quot;In Rwanda I shook hands with the devil&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431.0/14">But in his remarkable testimony, he says that he still believes in good in the world. I know that in this House great efforts are made to address these issues. Please may we carry on doing so. As the general said:</p>
	<p pid="a.1431.0/15" class="indent">&quot;Sometimes humanity is called into question, but we have a duty to value all lives equally&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1431.0/16">He has expressed the hope that this century should become the century of humanity. We as humans need to rise above race, creed, colour, religion and national self-interest. I thank noble Lords for ensuring that today we are doing a little something to help to achieve that aim, but the international community still has a long way to go.</p>

<speech id="uk.org.publicwhip/lords/2006-06-29a.1438.0" speakerid="uk.org.publicwhip/lord/100467" speakername="Baroness Northover" colon=":" colnum="1438"  time="018:48:00" url="http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld199900/ldhansrd/pdvn/lds06/text/60629-30.htm#60629-30_spnew1">
	<p pid="a.1438.0/1">My Lords, from these Benches we are happy to support this Bill. I thank the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, for introducing it. I too pay tribute to Tom Clarke for taking this Bill through the Commons, and to the NGOs that helped to draft it. My colleague in the other place, John Barrett, was a co-sponsor. As we saw in the Commons, and as we see again in the Lords, this Bill commands cross-party support. I pay tribute to the noble Baroness, Lady Quin, for her thoughtful and well informed maiden speech. I also pay tribute to my noble friend Lord Cotter for his equally committed and very moving speech.</p>
	<p pid="a.1438.0/2">The noble Lord has referred to my role as his supporter. I was honoured to be asked by him to dress up in a red robe and support him in that fashion. I do not often get that chance. I am grateful that he has made his maiden speech in support of this particular area.</p>
	<p pid="a.1438.0/3">As the noble Baroness, Lady Whitaker, has so effectively and comprehensively explained, this Bill seeks to bring accountability and transparency to what the UK does in terms of aid and humanitarian relief. Last year, Make Poverty History made a public case for assisting the poorest people in the poorest countries of the world, and by the end of that year, eight out of 10 people in the UK were familiar with its message. That was an incredible achievement. Children like mine wore white wrist bands and knew exactly why they did so.</p>
	<p pid="a.1438.0/4">But it would be too easy to let this subject slip. The UN High Level Panel, of which the noble Lord, Lord Hannay, was such a notable member, made clear last year that development relates to the security of us all; it is not simply about what we should do to help those most in need, though that is, or should be, the key motivation. We heard from the noble Lord, Lord Judd, and others exactly what that means in terms of the support that is needed.</p>
	<p pid="a.1438.0/5">This Bill ensures that governments of whatever colour must report on what they are doing in international development under a number of headings, which, one hopes, would make it difficult to put an inappropriate gloss or spin on things. The Bill aims to increase transparency in reporting in this area so that the level, poverty-focus and coherence of the Government's international development policy and expenditure, and their contribution towards reaching the millennium development goals, can be readily tracked over time. As the noble Earl, Lord Sandwich, has said, DfID produces a comprehensive annual report, but that forces parliamentarians to read and assess it.</p>
	<p pid="a.1438.0/6">If the Bill becomes law, it will require the Secretary of State to prepare an annual report to Parliament using information that is comparable over time, including between government administrations. It will also place on the statute book for the first time a specific reference to the UN target&mdash;which we signed up to in 1970&mdash;for expenditure on official development assistance to constitute 0.7 per cent of gross national income. It will also for the first time prescribe in law how DfID should report on its development policies and use of resources. As I have mentioned, it strengthens the role of parliamentarians in holding the Executive to account.</p>
	<p pid="a.1438.0/7">I should illustrate how this might help. It is notable that Ireland made the commitment of having a timetable to meet the 0.7 per cent target when it held the presidency of the EU. It promptly reneged on that as soon as the UK took over from it and the international spotlight was off it. The noble Lord, Lord Hannay, has mentioned how governments pay tribute to that goal while all the time moving away from it. The Bill would make such slippage less easy, or at least more embarrassing, and that is helpful to us in all parties if we wish to see the MDGs delivered, ever. Would that there were similar Bills going through other Parliaments and within the European Parliament.</p>
	<p pid="a.1438.0/8">As my noble friend Lord Chidgey put it, this Bill is one tool in our toolbox. I note that he wishes to add at least one more&mdash;his Bill against corruption. I look forward to cross-party support on that. The noble Lord, Lord Judd, made it crystal clear how important this is and how much more we all need to do.</p>
	<p pid="a.1438.0/9">It has been made clear that this is a straightforward Bill that is fit for purpose and that any slippage in the timetable in the Lords will cause it to fail. I have heard no rumours of people wishing to see changes in it, such that they would jeopardise its passage. Lest noble Lords think that the Bill was simply rubberstamped in the other place, I point them to the inch-thick transcript of the Commons discussions. I have to admire Tom Clarke's deft footwork in stepping over and round not only a critic or two but also, as the noble Lord, Lord Morris of Manchester, put it, the expansiveness and lengthy support of some friends.</p>
	<p pid="a.1438.0/10">An editorial in the <i>Guardian</i> of <phrase class="date" code="2006-06-15">15 June</phrase> stated:</p>
	<p pid="a.1438.0/11" class="indent">&quot;Few private members' bills become law. Fewer still can hope to affect millions of lives. But the international development bill . . . just might&quot;.</p>
	<p pid="a.1438.0/12">In the interests of brevity I will not detain your Lordships further and simply say that the Liberal Democrats strongly support this Bill, that we will table no amendments to it in the interests of it passing into law, and that we are very glad indeed that it has been brought forward.</p>
