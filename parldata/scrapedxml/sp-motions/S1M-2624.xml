*S1M-2624 Ms Margo MacDonald: Aung San Suu Kyi and the Burmese Democracy Movement-That the Parliament recognises that the people of Burma elected their representatives in free and fair elections on 27 May 1990 and that these democratically-elected representatives, including Aung San Suu Kyi, were denied their legitimate right to serve as members of parliament and continue to be the only democratically-elected parliamentarians in the world who are barred from taking their oath of office; recognises that the Inter-Parliamentary Union has cited the arresting, detaining and sentencing of duly elected members of parliament under laws considered by the United Nations Human Rights bodies to be in breach of international civil and political rights standards (Resolution adopted by the Council of the Inter-Parliamentary Union at its 165th Session, Berlin, 16 October 1999); recognises that according to the National League for Democracy (NLD), which won 392 of the 485 seats in the 27 May 1990 elections, as many as 55 of the elected representatives of the people of Burma were in detention as of March 2000; recognises that conditions of detention are reported to include torture, the lack of proper medical care and insufficient food and that five elected members of the parliament have died while in detention; recognises that the United Nations Commission on Human Rights has cited "increasingly severe and systematic violations of human rights in Myanmar" (United Nations Commission on Human Rights, 55th session, 1999); recognises that the International Labour Conference of the International Labour Organization has cited the continued imposition of forced labour on the people of Myanmar by the Ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) (Resolution on the Widespread Use of Forced Labour in Myanmar, International Labour Conference, 87th Session, Geneva, June 1999); therefore resolves to join with other democratically-elected members of parliaments throughout the world in declaring support for and solidarity with the elected members of the parliament of Burma, and calls upon the military Government of Burma to (a) release immediately and unconditionally all MPs-elect and end all violations of human rights imposed on the people of Burma, (b) recognise the right of the duly elected representatives of Burma to convene the parliament and immediately cease all restrictions against them and (c) agree to join the National League for Democracy and the representatives of ethnic nationalities in a dialogue to achieve a peaceful transition to democracy.
