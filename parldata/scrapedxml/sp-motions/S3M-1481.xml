*S3M-1481 Bill Wilson: Tax Havens and Relative Poverty—That the Parliament supports the recent call by Germany for an EU-wide debate on tax havens; notes that the super-rich use European tax havens, such as the Channel Islands, to avoid paying billions of Euros to members of the European Union; holds that tax avoidance and evasion is inimical to tackling relative poverty and that, in developed countries, relative poverty is at least as detrimental to health, happiness and longevity as is absolute poverty; notes that the funds released by eliminating tax avoidance and evasion could significantly reduce relative poverty and that relative poverty and child poverty, as noted by motion S3M-1474, is a major problem in Scotland; considers, however, that the abuse of tax havens is global; therefore welcomes Barack Obama’s proposed Stop Tax Haven Abuse Act, and calls on governments worldwide to examine their relationships with businesses that expatriate profits through the use of tax havens.
