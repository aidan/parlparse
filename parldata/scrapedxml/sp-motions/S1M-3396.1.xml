 *S1M-3396.1 Alex Fergusson: Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Billâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-3396) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end "but, in doing so, regrets that the provision in the bill of a right to buy for some tenants has already led to a significant reduction in the amount of land let under medium- and long-term arrangements, and believes that the enactment of such a provision will minimise land available for rent, including holdings under the new tenancies proposed in the bill, confining tenancies to those of a very short-term nature with a resultant negative impact on the management of the tenanted sector."
