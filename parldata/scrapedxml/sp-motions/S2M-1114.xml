*S2M-1114 Mike Pringle: Keep the Flying Scotsman in the UK-That the Parliament notes that the Flying Scotsman steam locomotive has been put up for sale with the bidding process ending on 2 April 2004; is concerned that it may be sold abroad if £2 million is not raised; congratulates the National Railway Museum in York and Sir Richard Branson for finding a substantial amount of money for a bid; notes that recently the Scottish Executive gave £6.5 million for the John Murray Manuscript Archive; considers the Flying Scotsman also to be of significant national value to Scotland, given that it was the first locomotive to run from London to Edinburgh non-stop; calls on the Executive to make a contribution to the bid, and hopes that this will keep the locomotive in the United Kingdom and allow it to be seen regularly on the Scottish railway network.
