*S2M-1000# Ms Sandra White: Situation of Asylum Seeker Hunger Strikers-That the Parliament condemns the current immigration policies of Her Majesty's Government which force refugees such as Farouk Haidari, Farnborz Gravindk and Mokhtar Haydary to take such drastic action as sewing up their mouths and going on hunger strike for 15 days rather than face deportation; notes, with great concern, that two of the refugees have now been found unconscious and hospitalised, and, in view of the severity of the current situation, believes that the Scottish Executive should contact the Home Office immedately and intervene on behalf of the refugees.
