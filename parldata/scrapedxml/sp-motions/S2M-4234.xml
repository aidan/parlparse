*S2M-4234 Jackie Baillie: West Dunbartonshire Literacy Initiativeâ€”That the Parliament congratulates West Dunbartonshire Council for the continuing success of its Literacy Initiative, now in its ninth year; welcomes the recent evaluation of the project which shows substantial year-on-year gains across all school age groups in literacy levels; notes that when the project was set up in 1997, it was an ambitious initiative aimed at raising achievement and eradicating illiteracy in all schools in a 10-year period, with particular focus on areas of deprivation; further notes that in 2001 28% of pupils entering secondary school in West Dunbartonshire were functionally illiterate, whilst this coming year will see almost all school leavers achieving the expected national reading levels, and commends all involved in wiping out illiteracy in West Dunbartonshire and giving our young people the very best start in life.
