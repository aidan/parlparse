*S2M-4841 Roseanna Cunningham: Perth and Kinross Cittaslow Bid—That the Parliament commends the commitment and ambition being shown by Perth and Kinross Council and Scottish Enterprise Tayside in their aim to make Perth Scotland’s first Cittaslow town and Perth and Kinross the first Cittaslow area in the United Kingdom; notes that Cittaslow, which has grown out of the Slow Food movement, is a network of over 100 towns across Europe that have committed themselves to promoting a healthier way of life through encouraging healthy eating, protecting the environment, promoting local produce and local traditions and enhancing the quality of the urban fabric; recognises that over 60 detailed criteria have to be met to be accepted into Cittaslow membership; believes that being part of the Cittaslow network would help Perth and Perth and Kinross to increase demand for local produce and endorse the excellent environmental qualities of the area; supports the drive by Perth and Perth and Kinross towards Cittaslow membership, and further believes that they can provide a model that other Scottish towns and communities can follow to eventually establish a strong network of Cittaslow towns across Scotland.
