 *S2M-271# Ms Sandra White: It's Scotland's Oil—That the Parliament welcomes the comments by its former Presiding Officer, Sir David Steel, that the revenues from Scotland’s oil reserves should be placed under the control of the Parliament and believes that the Scottish Executive should support this welcome initiative from a leading Liberal Democrat figure and press Her Majesty’s Government for control of Scotland’s oil revenue to be placed in the hands of the Parliament.
