*S2M-5389.1 Carolyn Leckie: Health with specific reference to Accident and Emergency Unit Provision—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5389) in the name of Mrs Nanette Milne, leave out from "and calls on" to end and insert "further expresses concern that hospitals are showing the strain caused by insufficient capacity with, for example, Wishaw General closing to admissions; believes that PFI costs are sucking resources from the NHS, and calls on the Scottish Executive to reverse the closure decisions and conduct an urgent review of NHS capacity with reference to meeting actual need and to abandon the wasteful PFI policy to fund capital projects."
