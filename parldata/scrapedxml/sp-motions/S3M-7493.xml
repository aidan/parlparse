*S3M-7493 Kenneth Gibson: Arran Aromatics—That the Parliament welcomes the continued success of the Scottish luxury toiletries producer, Arran Aromatics, with forecast sales growth of 20% in the coming year despite the ongoing difficult financial climate and lack of consumer confidence in the wider economy; commends the management of the company who have taken the business from the verge of bankruptcy to being what is considered one of Scotland’s most prestigious manufacturing and exporting companies, with annual sales of around £5.6 million; recognises that Arran Aromatics is one of the biggest private employers on the island and considered a pillar of the local economy; further welcomes news that, following the successes of its seven outlets, the award of lucrative contracts from prominent hoteliers, such as Cameron House Hotel in Loch Lomond, and with booming export sales to America and Russia, the company intends to increase manufacturing capacity and expand its ventures south of the border, and wishes Arran Aromatics great success in this project and continued success in future. Supported by: John Wilson*, Stuart McMillan*, Rob Gibson*, Bill Kidd*, Alasdair Allan*, Mary Scanlon*, John Lamont*, Sandra White*
