*S3M-985 Kenneth Gibson: A Youth Court for Ayrshire—That the Parliament supports the establishment of a youth court in Ayrshire following the success of two pilot youth courts in Hamilton and Airdrie; notes that in Hamilton and Airdrie youth offender recidivism is lower than in comparable sheriff courts, despite dealing with young people with a higher number of convictions; approves of the fast-track form of justice which ensures that young offenders are quickly brought before court, usually within 10 days of the date of the crime being committed, making them more aware of their wrongdoing; welcomes the fact that designated sheriffs, who share in the work of youth courts, provide consistent supervision of each young offender and continue to oversee the young offender’s rehabilitation, allowing for sentences to be amended as necessary; recognises that a convicted youth remains accountable to the court for his or her actions or behaviour; acknowledges that this ongoing relationship helps to ensure that young offenders receive the most appropriate treatment and are encouraged to address offending behaviour, and believes that the high level of persistent youth offending in Ayrshire, which has risen substantially in recent years, causing misery and distress for local communities and putting law enforcement agencies under tremendous pressure, makes Ayrshire a priority for establishing a youth court.
