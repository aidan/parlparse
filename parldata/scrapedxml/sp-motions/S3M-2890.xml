*S3M-2890 Elaine Murray: Electric Shock Training - Disappointment at Decision—That the Parliament expresses disappointment at the Scottish Government’s decision not to push ahead with a ban on electric shock training devices until the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs research is completed in 2010; notes that the Welsh Assembly has already announced a ban on their use in Wales and is currently drafting legislation; further notes that a wide range of organisations, including the Kennel Club, veterinary surgeons, respected dog trainers and behaviour experts, call for the sale and use of electric shock collars to be prohibited in Scotland, and urges the Scottish Government to review its decision.
