*S3M-2759# Jeremy Purvis: Digital Switchover—That the Parliament notes that the UK’s digital TV switchover commences with the switchover of the Selkirk transmitter on 6 and 20 November 2008 in the Border TV region; believes that digital is a positive development within television but is concerned that the Switchover Help Scheme, established to give practical support to those people expected to have the most difficulty in making the switch to digital TV, has been subject to doubts over its effectiveness, and expresses further concern that, with the Border TV region having the highest percentage of viewers receiving their television signal through relay transmitters, the switchover will create a two-tier service with more than 50% of viewers in the Borders able to access only 50% of digital channels.
