*S2M-3165 Richard Lochhead: Investing Scotland’s Oil Revenues—That the Parliament believes that after 30 years when £200 billion of revenues from North Sea oil have gone to the Treasury in London, it is now high time that revenues from oil and gas in the Scottish sector of the North Sea came under the control of the Scottish Parliament and further believes that, with world oil prices now over $60 a barrel, the monthly revenues of £1 billion could be better used to invest in Scotland’s people, economy and infrastructure, rather than being wasted by the British government to fill the black hole in UK public finances.
