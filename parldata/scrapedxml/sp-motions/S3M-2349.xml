 *S3M-2349 Bill Kidd: UK Government in Breach of Non-Proliferation Agreements—That the Parliament condemns the apparent duplicity of the UK Government over its reported decision to have secretly agreed to approve a new generation of nuclear missiles despite assurances that any such decision would not be taken until after 2010; further condemns attempts by the Ministry of Defence to block the release of the speaking notes of David Gould, then chief operating officer at the Defence Equipment and Support Organisation, in which he stated to a private gathering of arms manufacturers in June 2007 that "The (UK Government’s) intention is to replace the entire Vanguard class submarine system. Including the warhead and missile", and believes that by giving the go ahead for a new generation of warheads the UK Government could be in breach of international agreements on non-proliferation and that appropriate representations should be made to the United Nations over these serious allegations.
