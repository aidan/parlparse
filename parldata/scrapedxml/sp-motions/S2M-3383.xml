*S2M-3383 Frances Curran: Water Charges—That the Parliament believes that monies should be made available in the forthcoming investment period to deal with the backlog of historic under-investment in assets and infrastructure in the water industry; recognises that the impact of not dealing with this backlog could result in much greater costs in future and a large increase in water charges in the next review period; calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that Scottish Water is given adequate funding to fulfil its core functions, including promoting sustainable development and meeting obligations for biodiversity within the charge caps proposed by the Water Industry Commissioner, and further calls for all Executive objectives, essential and desirable, to be delivered to achieve a degree of compliance with environmental regulation. Supported by: Ms Sandra White*, Rosie Kane*
