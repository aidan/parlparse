*S3M-8135 Robert Brown: Handling of Asylum Claims in Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes 21 Months Later, a report by the British Red Cross (BRC) and the Refugee Survival Trust (RST), which highlights the plight of people who have to travel from Scotland to Croydon to register claims for asylum without receiving financial help for this from the UK Government; notes that the BRC and RST pay for food and overnight bus travel for the claimants; further notes that the BRC and RST are calling on the UK Border Agency to meet the travel costs for people making these trips of approximately 400 miles to register their claims, and considers that asylum seekers housed in Scotland should have the right to lodge and have their claims dealt with in Scotland.
