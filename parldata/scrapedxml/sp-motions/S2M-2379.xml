 * S2M-2379 Frances Curran: Keep CalMac Public—That the Parliament congratulates the RMT union on its campaign to keep Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd (CalMac) ferries in public ownership, despite the refusal of the First Minister to make a clear statement that he was committed to public ownership of our ferries; condemns the pre-emptive decision to invite tenders for the Gourock to Dunoon route and supports the CalMac workers in their legitimate right to take industrial action to defend jobs and services should they decide to take such action; congratulates Bob Crow, the RMT General Secretary, on his record of defending his members’ jobs and conditions in the face of an onslaught of privatisation of our formerly public transport systems, and condemns statements made on BBC Radio Scotland by Alasdair Morrison MSP unjustly attacking Bob Crow and accusing him of having no concern for the communities served by CalMac when it is the Scottish Executive which is showing its lack of concern for these communities by moving to privatise their vital lifeline services. Supported by: Carolyn Leckie*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Campbell Martin*
