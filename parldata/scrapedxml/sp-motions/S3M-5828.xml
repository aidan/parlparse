*S3M-5828 Ted Brocklebank: Congratulations to Jack Vettriano—That the Parliament congratulates Fife-born artist Jack Vettriano on being named 2010’s Great Scot; acknowledges his national and international appeal; notes that his work has never been added to the permanent collection of the National Galleries of Scotland, and calls on the galleries to recognise officially his inspiring contribution to Scottish art.
