*S1M-435# Dorothy-Grace Elder: Slopping Out in Scottish Prisons—That the Parliament agrees that urgent action must be taken in the 21st century to end "slopping out" at affected Scottish prisons, particularly Barlinnie Prison, Glasgow which is 90% without basic sanitation; acknowledges that Barlinnie cannot start its third century with this stomach churning and degrading practice continuing and that the practice of emptying chamber pots around five times a day is not only inhumane for prisoners but for also for staff who supervise and who deplore the practice; notes that Barlinnie’s high international status as an innovative prison and its excellent rehabilitation work is impaired seriously by the time consumed by slopping out, with around 400 staff hours a day wasted away from essential rehabilitation work with prisoners due to the security need to be on duty at sluice rooms, and urges that the money removed from the Scottish Prison Service budget for the Drugs Enforcement Agency must not result in any delay to plans to end slopping out as feared by prison officers.
