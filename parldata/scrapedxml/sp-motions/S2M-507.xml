*S2M-507# Helen Eadie: Scottish White Stuff Milk Moustache Campaign-That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Scottish White Stuff Milk Moustache campaign, a joint campaign of the Milk Development Council and the Scottish Dairy Marketing Company; supports its aims of promoting increased consumption of low fat, semi-skimmed milk as part of a balanced diet, targeted especially at young people who are known to have, on average, lower intakes of vitamins and minerals; applauds the campaign for tailoring its message to the perceptions and interests of young people such as by emphasising the benefits of milk for skin complexion; praises celebrities who have supported the campaign, and acknowledges the complimentarity between the Scottish White Stuff Milk Moustache campaign and the Scottish Executive's Healthy Living campaign.
