*S2M-1310# Mark Ballard: Redeployment of the Black Watch to Iraq-That the Parliament notes reports that the Black Watch have been put on standby to serve again in Iraq, having returned only 10 months ago, as a result of the departure of Spanish troops and considers that Her Majesty's Government should seek a handover of control in Iraq to the United Nations and a UN-mandated international security force rather than supporting the increasingly discredited existing coalition.
