 *S2M-931# Colin Fox: Fountainbridge Brewery Closure-That the Parliament condemns the decision of Scottish and Newcastle Breweries to close their Fountainbridge facility; believes that the decision has less to do with the current state of the United Kingdom beer market and more to do with cashing in on the Edinburgh property boom; notes the assurances the company gave the workforce only recently that their jobs were safe when it asked for, and received, "greater employee flexibility" and opened a £10 million state of the art kegging operation, and considers that the Scottish Executive should give its full support to the campaign to save the facility's 170 jobs.
