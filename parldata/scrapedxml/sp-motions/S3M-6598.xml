* S3M-6598 Anne McLaughlin: The Darker Side of the World Cup—That the Parliament notes the concerns raised by charities, such as Coalition against Trafficking in Women, and the United Nations Development Fund for Women regarding the increased demand for prostitution associated with the World Cup in South Africa; shares the concerns of South African officials regarding the dangers of an increase in people-trafficking associated with the World Cup as well as the exploitation and public health issues linked to the expected increase in prostitution; recognises the preventative measures undertaken by the South African Government to stop exploitation and hinder child trafficking; recognises that some organisations are raising the issue as a concern for the 2014 Commonwealth Games; urges the authorities to work against this threat, and, while wishing the World Cup every success as a sporting event, hopes that it raises awareness of the links that exploitation, trafficking and prostitution can have with large sporting events.
