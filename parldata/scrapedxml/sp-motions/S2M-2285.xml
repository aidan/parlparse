 * S2M-2285 Richard Lochhead:Good Luck Message to Scottish Schools Debating Team—That the Parliament notes the commencement of the World Schools Debating Championships between 9 and 18 February 2005 in Calgary, Alberta, Canada; further notes that Scotland has won the competition on two previous occasions and reached the quarter-finals of the 2004 tournament; believes that debating is an activity which should be encouraged at school level due to the positive impacts it has on knowledge and understanding, confidence and critical thinking and the way in which it promotes positive engagement in society, and takes the opportunity to wish the Scottish team of Gabriel Brady (George Heriot’s School), Rose Grogan (Aberdeen Grammar School), Gareth Jones (Robert Gordon’s College), Jonathan Lafferty (St Aloysius’ College) and Beki Muinde (St Margaret’s School for Girls) the very best of luck in the competition and is certain that they will do Scotland proud.
