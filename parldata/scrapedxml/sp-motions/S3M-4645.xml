*S3M-4645 Robert Brown: Scottish Police Board—That the Parliament notes with concern the Scottish Government’s decision to set up a new Scottish Policing Board to be chaired by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice; further notes that this board is to act as a single collective voice for policing; recognises that local policing has long proved its worth in Scotland and therefore believes that a one-size-fits-all approach to policing is entirely wrong; believes that Scotland’s police forces must remain operationally independent of government; asserts that major policy initiatives of this kind are clearly a matter for parliamentary approval; further believes that convening a National Policing Board without debate in Parliament and with no basis in law is a slippery slope towards a single Scottish Police Service, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to defer these proposals until detailed plans can be debated in the Parliament and approved or otherwise.
