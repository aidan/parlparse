*S3M-5697 Rob Gibson: Global Alert to Stop Monsantoizing Food, Seeds and Animalsâ€”That the Parliament welcomes global action timed for late March 2010 in order to present governments, politicians and patent offices around the world with a call to stop the Monsantoizing of food, seeds and livestock, which is considered to be growing at an alarming rate; notes that individuals and organisations can sign the global alert petition at http://www.no-patents-on-seeds.org/monsantoizing.htm; encourages farmers, growers, crofters and consumers in Scotland to understand that rising food prices, the loss of independence and rising indebtedness for farmers, a reduction of plant and animal diversity, ever higher constraints for breeding and research activities and the concentration of the seed sector in the hands of a few multinational firms represent the most worrying impacts of this trend, and asks as many concerned citizens as possible to join this global alert.
