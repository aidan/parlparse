*S2M-1677 John Swinburne: Concessions for Elderly Passengers of Scottish Citylink—That the Parliament welcomes the additional concession by Scottish Citylink to allow concessionary passengers to travel across boundaries on all of their services; further congratulates Scottish Citylink on the introduction of lower fares for passengers aged 60 and over on its Glasgow to Edinburgh route; acknowledges that these concessions go beyond the current local concessionary travel scheme for the elderly; notes that the limitations of the local scheme impact negatively on the social exclusion of elderly people; agrees that this must only be a short-term solution, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to implement its policy in the Partnership Agreement by properly financing and delivering a national concessionary travel scheme for elderly and disabled people forthwith.
