*S1M-3803 Christine Grahame: Medacs and the NHS—That the Parliament is concerned at the consequences of the privatisation of prison medical services in November 2000 and the award of the contract to Medacs, a company that primarily supplies locum doctors; notes that these consequences include (a) the last information on the cost of primary care being pre-privatisation, when it was in the order of £1.3 million, but no subsequent figures being available owing to commercial confidentiality, (b) the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) not knowing how many doctors Medacs provides because it is for the contractor to arrange to provide the outputs specified in the contract, (c) there being no "output" specification because the contract is to deliver services in accordance with the SPS’s Standards of Healthcare for Prisoners and (d) there having been no attempt to audit the company’s compliance with the Standards of Healthcare for Prisoners; further notes that the poor performance of Medacs is demonstrated by a trebling of prisoner complaint numbers about medical services, substantial fines about which there has been no detailed information owing to commercial confidentiality, the comments of the British Medical Association on the lack of co-ordination between Medacs and the NHS on discharge for ongoing and future care and changing from 30 minutes to 60 minutes the time within which a doctor on call must be able to reach the prison; is further concerned at gaps in SPS knowledge on the state of health of prisoners in that the SPS does not know how many inmates suffer from hepatitis C, HIV and other blood-borne illnesses, tuberculosis or mental illnesses requiring treatment and, in the light of the above and need for openness and accountability, calls upon the Scottish Executive to integrate healthcare into the NHS.
