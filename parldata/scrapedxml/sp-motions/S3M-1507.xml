 *S3M-1507 Roseanna Cunningham: Clothing is Not an Invitation to Rape—That the Parliament condemns the comments made by defence lawyer and temporary sheriff, Iain Smith, in a recent sexual assault case in Perth Sheriff Court in which he used the clothing worn by the 15-year-old victim and reports that she may have been sexually active to claim that "she was not vulnerable" as part of a mitigation plea for his client; notes that the use of comments such as this by representatives of the legal profession is unacceptable and contributes to Scotland’s low rates of prosecution in cases of rape and sexual assault; recognises the Scottish Government’s campaign to change the attitudes toward rape and sexual assault, in particular to challenge the view that rape or sexual assault can be justified by the way a woman or girl behaves, her previous sexual activity or the clothing she is wearing, and urges the Scottish legal profession to take action to ensure that the use of such a defence or mitigation plea is no longer acceptable. Supported by: Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Alasdair Allan*, Patrick Harvie*, Stuart McMillan*, Irene Oldfather*, Cathy Peattie*
