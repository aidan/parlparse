 *S3M-2248 Sandra White: Aircraft Carrier Delay Could Cost Jobs—That the Parliament expresses concern over the delay in signing the contract for two new aircraft carriers, which could lead to the loss of jobs at the Clyde shipyards in Glasgow; condemns the reported comments made by Glasgow MPs Mohammad Sarwar and Ian Davidson that if Scotland were to become an independent state it would risk losing up to 50,000 jobs in the defence sector; believes that, by putting political self-interest ahead of the vital Scottish shipbuilding industry and engaging in needless scaremongering, these comments will only serve to cause uncertainty and worry for many workers and their families, and calls on all Scottish MPs to work constructively to safeguard the future of the shipbuilding industry in Scotland.
