*S3M-2704 Sandra White: Scottish Government Investment in Glasgow Housing—That the Parliament recognises that Scotland is facing a housing crisis characterised by a severe shortage of good quality affordable homes; notes with concern that one of the most serious aspects of this crisis is the existence of slum housing, particularly in areas such as Govanhill in Glasgow; condemns the slum landlords that preside over this poor quality and overcrowded housing; welcomes the substantial funding by the Scottish Government for improving housing in the city, totalling £177 million in 2008-09 alone, made up of £93 million to Glasgow City Council for investment in the social and private housing sector and a further £84 million paid directly to Glasgow Housing Association, and believes that this high level of investment will play a significant role in the effort to tackle the deep-seated housing problems, including slum housing, that afflict parts of Glasgow and should be welcomed by all with the city’s best interests at heart.
