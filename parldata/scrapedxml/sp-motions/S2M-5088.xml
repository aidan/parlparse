 *S2M-5088 Mr Jamie Stone: Changes to Welfare of Animals During Transport Regulation—That the Parliament notes with concern the serious implications in the Highlands and Islands and other parts of rural Scotland for farmers and crofters of EU Regulation 1/2005, which is due to come into effect from 5 January 2007; particularly notes that, from that date, anyone transporting animals over a distance exceeding 40 miles will have to have specific authorisation, that livestock hauliers will face bills of up to £100,000 to adapt their vehicles to meet the new stricter vehicle standards and that many trailers currently used by farmers and crofters for local stock movement without any adverse animal welfare implications, which cannot in practice be altered to meet the new standards, will become illegal, and calls on the Scottish Executive urgently to request a derogation from the European Commission from the damaging aspects of this regulation. Supported by: Mr Alasdair Morrison*, Alex Fergusson*, Alex Johnstone*, Mr Jamie McGrigor*, John Farquhar Munro*, Mr Jim Wallace*, Nora Radcliffe*
