*S2M-3160# Mark Ballard: Keep Studio 24 Open—That the Parliament recognises the success of Franz Ferdinand and many other Scottish indie bands, highlighted in a Members’ Business debate last year; notes the importance of music venues in providing a platform for bands to establish themselves; is concerned at the decline in the numbers of such venues in Scotland; compliments Glasgow on its success in supporting a variety of different venues; notes with concern the recent announcement that The Venue on Calton Road in Edinburgh is to be closed and converted to flats and that La Belle Angele and other venues in Edinburgh’s Cowgate have yet to be replaced, despite the fact that the fire which devastated them took place almost three years ago; believes that the future of Studio 24, also on Calton Road, must be secured to ensure the future of live music in Edinburgh, and believes that all local authorities in Scotland should consider how they can help support live music through support for new and existing venues, in particular by resisting planning applications that will affect live music venues.
