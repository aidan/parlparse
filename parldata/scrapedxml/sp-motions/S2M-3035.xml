*S2M-3035 Bruce Crawford: Andrew Murray—That the Parliament recognises the superb effort made by Scots tennis player, Andrew Murray from Dunblane, in reaching the third round of this year’s Wimbledon tennis tournament; applauds him for the skill, tenacity and maturity that he displayed throughout the tournament which will stand him good stead as he goes on to represent Scotland and win major grand slam tennis tournaments in the future; is dismayed at the apparent lack of resources made available to support young sporting talent from Scotland, and urges the Scottish Executive to review the level of resources made available and how best existing resources can be used to identify, develop and support young sporting talent from Scotland to achieve its full potential. Supported by: Alex Neil*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Rob Gibson*, Fergus Ewing*, Tricia Marwick*, Christine Grahame*
