 *S2M-4276 Pauline McNeill: Rock the Kelvin! Restore the Kelvingrove Park Bandstand and Amphitheatre—That the Parliament congratulates the Friends of Kelvingrove Park for their excellent campaign to have Glasgow’s last remaining bandstand restored to its former and deserved glory; notes the proposals to have Edinburgh’s Ross Bandstand upgraded as a major new cultural facility; further notes that Historic Scotland has declared that the Kelvingrove Park Bandstand has cultural and social significance; welcomes the support for the campaign from contemporary Scottish music acts Belle and Sebastian, Franz Ferdinand and Teenage Fanclub; further notes that the Heritage Lottery Fund, which is currently considering a funding application, has previously provided support to some 50-plus bandstand restoration projects across the United Kingdom, and calls on Glasgow City Council to lead the way in ensuring that a viable and sustainable future can be secured for this proud piece of the city’s heritage and so create a unique open air venue in the heart of Glasgow’s West End.
