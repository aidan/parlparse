*S3M-123 Jackie Baillie: Peninsula 24 Seven—That the Parliament recognises the disruption caused to the people living on the Rosneath Peninsula due to illegal road blockades carried out by the Faslane 365 protestors; acknowledges that the local community supports the right to peaceful protest; notes however that local people are adversely affected by the road blockades; believes that the protests should not delay or prohibit pupils from getting to school or from sitting examinations and should not delay carers reaching their clients, doctors treating their patients, emergency vehicles accessing the peninsula and teachers getting to school; welcomes the formation of Peninsula 24 Seven, reflecting the voice of the local people in calling for peaceful protest and an end to the road blockades, and believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure that these protests are conducted legally and do not prevent local people going about their daily lives.
