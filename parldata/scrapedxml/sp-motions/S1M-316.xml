*S1M-316 Phil Gallie: Law and Order—That the Parliament expresses concern over the substantial drop in the number of serving police officers over the last two years, the reversal of the falling crime rates inherited, the rising number of drugs-related deaths, the shortsighted and ill considered prison closure programme and staff redundancies instigated by the Executive’s £13 million raid of Scottish Prison Service funds, the Executive’s lack of emphasis on and support for the victims of crime and the shambles in our courts resulting from Her Majesty’s Government’s decision to incorporate the European Convention of Human Rights into Scots Law, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to live up to its Partnership Agreement promise to be "tough on crime and the criminals who blight our communities". Supported by: Lord James Douglas-Hamilton*, Bill Aitken*, David McLetchie*, Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh*
