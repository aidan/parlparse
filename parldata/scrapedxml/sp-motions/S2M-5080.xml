*S2M-5080 Mr Kenny MacAskill: WHSmith and Scottish Publishing—That the Parliament recognises the huge contribution made by literature and the wider publishing industry to Scottish culture and the Scottish economy; notes that the cultural and economic benefits which they provide are particularly important for the capital city, Edinburgh, UNESCO World City of Literature; condemns, therefore, the overly centralised buying system operated by high street bookstore WHSmith from its Swindon headquarters; notes that the company’s buying policies result in very few Scottish titles finding their way on to WHSmith shelves; recognises that, as WHSmith has a 20% share of the Scottish consumer book market, its policy of directing all book-buying from outside Scotland has a detrimental effect on Scottish writers, the Scottish publishing industry and the Scottish book-buying public; considers that the Scottish Executive should set up a group to look at the question of asymmetric trading relationships, that is large companies declining to trade with small producers, a relatively common occurrence in Scotland, and further believes that the Executive should draw up a Scottish book retailers code of conduct which ensures that the buying systems of booksellers in this country take into account the distinctive culture and heritage of Scotland and its localities.
