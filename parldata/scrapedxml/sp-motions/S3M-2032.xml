*S3M-2032 Robert Brown: Supported and Semi-independent Accommodation for Young Care Leavers—That the Parliament is greatly concerned at the challenges facing young care leavers, particularly the high number of care leavers who are not in touch with aftercare services and who become homeless; notes the concerns about the shortage of semi-independent living units for young care leavers identified by the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland in her report, Sweet 16? The Age of Leaving Care in Scotland; is concerned that the Scottish Government has not made any assessment of the extent of the shortfall of supported and semi-independent living units for young care leavers, and urges the Scottish Government to carry out a full survey of need in this area and put in place arrangements to increase the supply of appropriate supported accommodation for young care leavers.
