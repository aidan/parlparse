 *S2M-3117 Mike Pringle: Benefits of Dialogue between Steiner and Mainstream Education Sectors—That the Parliament commends Steiner Schools in Scotland for providing education which focuses on a child’s spiritual, physical and moral well-being as well as academic progress; notes the recent research publication, Steiner Schools in England, by Professor Woods of the University of West of England, which compared Steiner Schools with those in the state sector; agrees with him that "there is great potential benefit from mutual dialogue and professional interaction between Steiner and mainstream educators"; welcomes high-level dialogue between the Steiner Fellowship (the UK Steiner accreditation body), local education authorities in England and the UK Government which has led to the prospect of the United Kingdom’s first publicly funded Steiner Academy in Hereford, and calls on the Scottish Executive to engage actively with local authorities in Scotland and encourage the schools to be brought within the publicly funded sector, in a similar fashion to other European countries such as Norway, Sweden, Finland and Denmark.
