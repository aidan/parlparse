*S3M-3246 Sarah Boyack: Lothian Buses’ Passengers are Paying More for Less—That the Parliament expresses dismay at the increase in all fares offered by Lothian Buses that took effect on Sunday 18 January 2009, particularly the increase to £1.20 for an adult single ticket and £3.00 for an adult day ticket; also voices disappointment at the accompanying reduction in the frequency of the bus service to routes across the capital; believes that the measures will contribute to discouraging the use of public transport across Edinburgh and fails to help promote buses as a cheaper, more convenient and cleaner alternative to car use; notes the difficulties faced by bus companies across Scotland due to the fluctuations in the price of oil last year and believes that the Scottish Government’s failure to increase the Bus Service Operator’s Grant (BSOG) in line with fuel duty further exacerbated these difficulties, and calls on the Scottish Government to act to avoid bus fare increases and reduced services across Scotland, particularly given the economic pressures on bus passengers due to the current economic downturn.
