*S2M-677# Richard Baker: Crisis in Scottish Football-That the Parliament expresses its concern at the current financial predicament of many of Scotland's football clubs; notes that in the past week Dundee Football Club has gone into administration, as have a number of clubs over recent years; considers that the national bodies governing football, including the SPL, Scottish Football League and Scottish Football Association should encourage better financial management of football clubs and much greater involvement of supporters through football trusts, and believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure that any public money for football is invested at a grass-roots level to develop the game in Scotland.
