*S3M-3830 Bob Doris: Congratulating Glasgow Save Our Schools Campaigners—That the Parliament congratulates the parents, carers and children at the schools and nurseries proposed for closure under Glasgow City Council’s schools modernisation strategy; praises their dedication and tireless campaigning against the proposed closures and their constructive participation in the consultation process that closed on 18 March 2009; notes that campaigners from diverse areas, cultures and backgrounds are successfully working together to make their concerns heard; recognises the invaluable lessons that the children have learned by taking part in the democratic process, and very much hopes that Glasgow’s councillors and education officials reinforce these lessons by taking the concerns of the campaigners into account and that the councillors vote to save the schools.
