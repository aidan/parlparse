 *S2M-1106# Elaine Smith: Planned Extension of Dungavel-That the Parliament notes with concern recently announced plans to increase the detention capacity at Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre in Lanarkshire; recognises that immigration and asylum policy is a matter reserved to the UK Parliament; considers, however, that the existence and operational record of Dungavel poses a serious threat to the Scottish Executive's record of promoting equality of opportunity and social inclusion for refugees in Scotland and is contradictory to current efforts to encourage fresh talent to come to Scotland; agrees that the detention of innocent children and families is both inhumane and unnecessary; believes that the question of planning permission for the project should be considered carefully, and considers that concerns regarding the detention of asylum seekers in Scotland should be raised with the Home Office.
