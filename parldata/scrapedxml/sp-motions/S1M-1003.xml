*S1M-1003 Mr Adam Ingram: Dog Fouling—That the Parliament believes that the provisions of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 with regard to the offence of dog fouling are insufficient to control the behaviour of irresponsible dog owners and to protect the public against the growing health menace caused by dog fouling; notes that the provisions of Westminster legislation contained in the Dogs (Fouling of Land) Act 1996 make it an offence not to clean up after one’s dog in designated public places and allows local authorities to authorise contracted dog wardens to issue fixed penalty notices to offenders, and believes that equivalent legislation in Scotland should be introduced to effectively deter and punish dog fouling offences.
