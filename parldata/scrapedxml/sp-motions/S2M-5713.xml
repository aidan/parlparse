*S2M-5713 Ms Sandra White: Concerns over "Son of Star Wars"—That the Parliament expresses in the strongest possible terms its grave concern and condemnation of recently reported secret lobbying by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to have the US missile defence system known as "son of Star Wars" based in Britain, in light of the wide opposition in Scotland to the replacement of Trident and the intransigent position of the UK Government on this issue; believes that, as a peaceful nation, Scotland wishes to send a clear message to the rest of the world that it is fiercely opposed to these talks and the wider implications that any future "son of Star Wars" would have on world security, and urges the Scottish Executive to state its opposition to the "son of Star Wars" and allay any fears that people may have that this missile system could be based in Scotland by issuing an assurance that it will do everything in its power to ensure that this system will never be based in Scotland.
