*S3M-4143 John Wilson: 48 Hour Working Time Directiveâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern that the UK Government failed to reach an agreement with the European Union with regard to the decision to opt out of the 48 hour working time directive, which aims to ensure that workers have protection against negative effects on their health and safety that may be caused by working excessively long hours or having inadequate rest or disrupted work patterns and to provide other benefits including increasing the motivation and productivity of workers along with creating employment.
