*S3M-2773 Murdo Fraser: Ian McColl—That the Parliament expresses its sadness at the death of John Miller "Ian" McColl on 25 October 2008, aged 81; recognises his contribution to Scottish football and considers that he will be missed by all fans of the game of football; notes that he played for Rangers FC for 15 years between 1945 and 1960, made a total of 526 appearances for the Glasgow club and won 14 caps for Scotland; recognises his success as manager of Scotland when appointed in 1961 and that he had one of the best records as Scotland manager, with successes including winning the British Home Championships in 1962 and 1963 and securing famous victories such as beating Spain 6-2 in Madrid, and believes that Ian McColl was one of the true greats of Scottish football.
