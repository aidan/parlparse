 *S3M-4750 Jamie Hepburn: 70th Anniversary of the Beginning of the Second World War—That the Parliament notes that 3 September 2009 marks the 70th anniversary of the declaration of war that marked the beginning of the Second World War; remembers that this was a war that affected all strata of society and all individuals in some way, with hostilities across the globe; recalls that over 70 million people were killed on both sides in hostilities during the war, with around two-thirds of these deaths being civilian casualties and over 10 million people murdered by the Nazis as part of the Holocaust; believes that it is of the utmost importance that future generations continue to learn about this period of history so that its horrors are not repeated, and offers its gratitude to those men and women who were part of that generation that combined to defeat Nazism and fascism during the Second World War. Supported by: Hugh O’Donnell*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Anne McLaughlin*, Gil Paterson*, Paul Martin*, Maureen Watt*, Alasdair Allan*, Bob Doris*, Rob Gibson*, Bill Butler*, Brian Adam*, George Foulkes*, Robin Harper*
