*S3M-3197 Claire Baker: Congratulations to Scottish Universities on their Performance in the UK Research Assessment Exercise—That the Parliament commends the performance of Scottish universities in the 2008 UK Research Assessment Exercise (RAE); notes Research Fortnight’s analysis of the results; congratulates the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow for appearing in the top 20 of UK institutions, at number five and number 14 respectively; further congratulates the University of Aberdeen, the University of Strathclyde, the University of St Andrews, the University of Dundee and Heriot-Watt University on securing places in the top 50 of UK institutions; believes that this success is down to the hard work of university staff, combined with the significant investment provided by government since the last RAE, in 2001; notes that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning previously pledged to provide "something for something" regarding funding for universities; believes that Scottish universities have clearly kept their end of the bargain, and strongly urges the Scottish Government to provide the significant resources that universities in Scotland need to maintain their research performance and to remain generally competitive within the United Kingdom and across the world.
