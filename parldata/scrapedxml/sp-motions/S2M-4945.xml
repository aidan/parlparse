*S2M-4945 Frances Curran: Behic Asci and Friends—That the Parliament notes that Turkey’s authorities place many of the country’s prisoners in solitary confinement; is concerned to note that such prisoners are particularly vulnerable to abuse by guards and that, since December 2000, 128 prisoners and their supporters have been killed by state forces or have died on hunger strike while opposing solitary confinement; notes that Behic Asci, a lawyer in Istanbul, Gulcan Goruroglu, a woman in the city of Adana, and Sevgi Saymaz, a woman inmate in Usak Prison, are on hunger strike opposing solitary confinement in Turkey’s prisons; further notes that they are in danger of death like so many before them because the Turkish authorities have refused to give up their use of solitary confinement, and calls on the Turkish authorities to end these practices so as to prevent further deaths among prisoners and their supporters outside the prisons.
