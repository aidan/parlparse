*S3M-2009 Mike Pringle: Good Example Sent Through Tough Licensing Enforcement—That the Parliament welcomes the tough action taken by the City of Edinburgh Council’s Licensing Committee in suspending the license of an Edinburgh shopkeeper who was found to be selling alcohol to minors; recognises the importance of licensing law to public safety, particularly in the case of young people as a control on restricted substances; acknowledges that the vast majority of licence holders use their licences responsibly and are let down by a minority of offenders, and calls on other councils to look to Edinburgh’s example and take a tough stance on the minority who flaunt licensing law.
