*S1M-3992 Robin Harper: UN Resolutions on Iraq—That the Parliament acknowledges that the two legal opinions published by Matrix Chambers indicate that neither United Nations Resolution 1441 nor the draft second resolution presently before the United Nations authorise the use of military action against Iraq; recognises that the weight of public opinion is that war on Iraq is not justified at least until a second resolution, clearly authorising the use of military action against Iraq, is agreed by the whole United Nations; recognises that neither Resolution 1441 nor the draft second resolution is the justification that many people in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom are demanding before military action is taken; recognises that military action taken on the basis of either resolution could be illegal, leaving the UK and the United States of America governments open to action before the International Criminal Court; calls on Her Majesty’s Government to withdraw support for military action on the basis of Resolution 1441 or the draft second resolution; remains unconvinced that there is sufficient evidence of the threat from the Iraqi regime to justify a war on Iraq that is certain to result in many thousands of civilian deaths and casualties, and believes that peaceful means to resolve the crisis have not been exhausted and must be pursued.
