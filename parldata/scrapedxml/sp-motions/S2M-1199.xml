*S2M-1199 Pauline McNeill: Closure of the Queen Mother's Hospital-That the Parliament regrets Greater Glasgow NHS Board's decision of 20 April 2004 to close the Queen Mother's Hospital in Glasgow; notes that the Queen Mother's Hospital is an integral part of the Yorkhill campus model of care, deliberately co-locating specialist maternity and paediatric care and attracting world class medical and surgical expertise; further notes the proven record of excellence at Yorkhill in the development of ultrasound, innovative foetal therapy and developing a breast milk bank; believes that this service model has benefited women with difficulties in their pregnancies, sick babies and families throughout Scotland as well as providing an important general maternity service for the north west Glasgow corridor and that the hospital has been the hospital of choice for many more women in the west of Scotland for over 40 years; believes that the quality of specialist baby and maternal care services is threatened by this decision as reconfiguration may prove costly and difficult to implement; is concerned that the board has taken this decision in the face of overwhelming clinical, political and public opposition; believes that the decision was reached unfairly using inaccurate assumptions and that no other option was seriously considered, and considers that the Minister for Health and Community Care must (a) take steps to restore public confidence in consultation and decision-making processes in the NHS, (b) thoroughly review all of the factors that led to the Greater Glasgow NHS Board's decision on maternity services, (c) reject the decision to close the Queen Mother's hospital and (d) ensure that the integrated specialist care model is protected to continue to serve Scotland with the same quality of service and innovation that has been achieved over the last 40 years.
