*S2M-1925.4 Robin Harper: Ambitious, Excellent Schools—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1925) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from "supports" to end and insert "broadly supports the Scottish Executive’s intention to modernise Scottish schools but regrets the lack of significant detail and guidance in almost every section of Ambitious, Excellent Schools; notes that this document is little more than an expression of a general intent; in particular notes the lack of guidance on the content of the six-point HMIE quality indicator scale which should include a measure of schools’ commitments to developing all pupil intelligences, including emotional, social, musical, kinaesthetic and artistic intelligence, the quality of pupil councils and levels of commitment to education for sustainability, outdoor education and education in the outdoors."
