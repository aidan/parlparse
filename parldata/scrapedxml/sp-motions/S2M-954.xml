*S2M-954 Christine Grahame: The Viability of Care Commission Self-Funding-That the Parliament notes the response on 2 February 2004 from the National Association of Inspection and Registration Officers, the professional association representing care commission officers working for the Scottish Commission for the Regulation of Care, to the Scottish Executive consultation paper on proposals for maximum fees to be levied by the Care Commission; notes in particular that the response questions whether it is realistic that the cost of regulation be covered by fee income generation and that currently there is a significant shortfall between the cost of regulation and fee income generation; notes that, if full cost is implemented even incrementally as the Executive intends, the response doubts whether the current level of regulation and protection for service users can be sustained without making fees prohibitively expensive; notes that to make ends meet it may be necessary to reduce the levels of regulatory visits and workforce to meet available income, with "resulting consequences for the safeguarding of vulnerable service users"; refers to the answer to question S2W-4301 by Mr Tom McCabe on 5 December 2003 stating that a financial and management policy review of the Care Commission is not due until April 2007, and therefore, in all these circumstances, and given the informed source of these concerns and the increasing demands on the Commission, calls upon the Executive to abandon the self-funding principle now.
