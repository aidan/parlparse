S1M-38 Mike Watson: Bank of Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the Bank of Scotland to withdraw from its proposed joint venture with Dr Pat Robertson; abhors Dr Robertson’s expressed homophobic, racist and sexist views; notes with disdain his recent vitriolic and quite unfounded attack on Scotland and its people; believes that the Bank of Scotland ought to have foreseen the outcry which a link with Robertson would provoke across Scotland, and congratulates all those who, by speaking out against the proposed deal, made a major contribution to its demise and re-inforced the reputation of Scotland as a diverse nation with equality of treatment for all.
