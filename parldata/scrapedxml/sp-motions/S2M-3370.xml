*S2M-3370 Michael McMahon: Scottish Executive/Home Office Protocol on the Removal of Asylum Seekers from Detention in Scotland—That the Parliament notes that, while asylum is a matter reserved to Her Majesty’s Government, the Scottish Executive has responsibilities in respect of the welfare of children; welcomes the acknowledgement from the First Minister that we must take a responsible approach to these important matters; notes the positive impact children of asylum seekers have in enhancing the cultural diversity of Scotland’s schools, and the effect of removal of those children on classmates left behind; recognises the need to establish a protocol with the Home Office on the way that failed asylum seeker families are removed from detention in Scotland; requests that responsible departments within the Executive discuss with the Home Office an appropriate role in planning for deportations involving children, and further requests that discussions take place between immigration officials and local officials responsible for child welfare, in order to ensure that the dignity of, and respect for, all persons is upheld.
