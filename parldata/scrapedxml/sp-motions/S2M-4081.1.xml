 *S2M-4081.1 Mr Ted Brocklebank: Agriculture Strategyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-4081) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the aims for the Scottish agricultural industry set out in A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture: Next Steps and acknowledges that the vision outlined in that document is one with which we can all agree; notes that under Scottish Executive stewardship, Total Income from Farming statistics show that returns are down by 11% and average net farm incomes have fallen by 34%, indicating that the agricultural sector is beleaguered by uncertainty and despondency, and calls on the Executive to act to restore confidence to the sector in order to reverse the current trend of young people deserting the land."
