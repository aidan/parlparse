 *S3M-100 Joe FitzPatrick: Football in Dundee—That the Parliament notes with concern that the Scottish Premier League (SPL) and the Scottish Football League (SFL) appear to be unwilling to do anything to help Dundee FC and Dundee United FC avoid fixture clashes next season and supports the efforts of Dundee FC in lobbying the SPL and SFL to change their minds; further notes that Tayside Police has advised that having two fixtures over a single weekend stretches its resources and supports its efforts in lobbying the SPL and the SFL; believes that it would be in the interests of Scottish football for the SPL and SFL to engage in constructive dialogue on this and other matters, and calls on the Scottish Government to lobby the two organisations to ensure that common sense prevails.
