 * S2M-2322 Richard Baker:Beating Bowel Cancer - 6th Loud Tie Campaign—That the Parliament notes that approximately 3,500 Scots are diagnosed with bowel cancer each year and that it is the second most common cause of cancer death in Scotland with around 1,600 people dying from it each year; recognises that early detection can save lives and therefore welcomes the Scottish Executive’s commitment to planning for the introduction of bowel cancer screening; recognises the importance of access to services and welcomes the improvements in staffing and equipment that have resulted from the Scottish Cancer Plan, Cancer in Scotland: Action for Change; supports awareness-raising campaigns like those in the west of Scotland and Lanarkshire and Forth Valley areas and urges the development of similar campaigns across Scotland; supports Beating Bowel Cancer’s 6th Loud Tie Campaign and wishes the charity every success, and urges MSPs to help raise awareness of bowel cancer by wearing a loud tie or scarf.
