 *S3M-2133 Margaret Mitchell: Impact of Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005—That the Parliament notes with concern that the provisions of the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005 have resulted in increased costs of licences for small social and leisure clubs and organisations; recognises that a number of these small clubs and organisations are under threat due to the increases and may have to close their doors; is concerned about the detrimental impact that this will have on local community activity and life, and considers that this legislation is therefore having a negative impact in terms of encouraging positive pursuits and health lifestyles and should be reviewed at the earliest opportunity.
