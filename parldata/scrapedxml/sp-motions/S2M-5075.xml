*S2M-5075 Alex Fergusson: Threat to Less Favoured Area Support for Scottish Farmers—That the Parliament notes with considerable concern that the Scottish Executive cannot submit its Rural Development Plan (RDP) for 2007 to 2013 until agreement is reached between EU member states on the mechanism for administering voluntary modulation, the top slicing of farmers’ support payments to fund other schemes; further notes that, as the United Kingdom is the only member state wishing to implement voluntary modulation, agreement is unlikely to be reached in the foreseeable future; considers it unacceptable that payment of the £61 million of Less Favoured Area (LFA) support normally received by those Scottish farmers who make their living in the 85% of Scotland that is designated as "less favoured" cannot be paid until the RDP is submitted and agreed; further considers that the solution proposed by the Minister for Environment and Rural Development to make an interim payment of £10 million in the spring of 2007, with a full LFA support scheme payment in the autumn of 2007, will effectively bring about a reduction of £51 million in agricultural support during the 2006-07 financial year, and therefore calls on the Executive urgently to consider submitting a limited RDP leaving the subject of voluntary modulation to be agreed at a later date, thereby allowing existing schemes to be fully funded and LFA support to be paid in the spring when it is of critical importance to the farmers who receive it. Supported by: Alex Johnstone*, Mr Ted Brocklebank*, Miss Annabel Goldie*, Derek Brownlee*, Mr David Davidson*, Murdo Fraser*, Murray Tosh*, Dave Petrie*, Mr Jamie McGrigor*, Mrs Nanette Milne*
