 *S2M-5716 Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Promoting Race Equality through Education—That the Parliament acknowledges that the number of non-white ethnic minority pupils in Scotland’s schools has risen by 5% over the last year and that the number of white non-UK pupils has risen by 16%; recognises that ethnic diversity is a fact of Scottish life and that our schools, colleges and universities can play a unique role in creating an equal Scotland where every person can make their fullest contribution to our future economic and social life; notes the Commission for Racial Equality’s manifesto for the next Scottish Parliament, which identifies a range of actions that can help to ensure that our education system delivers for every young person in Scotland, regardless of their ethnicity; considers that, in particular, anti-bullying initiatives should be measured to ensure that they effectively curb racist bullying in schools, more training and ongoing support should be given to education staff at all stages in their careers to enable them to combat more effectively racist incidents in schools and promote race equality and specific equalities education should be built into the national curriculum for excellence to empower young people from all ethnic backgrounds to understand and deal with racial discrimination, and is committed to addressing the racial inequalities that persist in every area of Scottish life and to establishing a Scotland in which every individual feels that they have an equal share.
