 *S2M-3596 Shiona Baird: Scottish Parliament Crèche—That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) is currently reviewing, and considering making cuts to, its provision of crèche facilities within the Parliament; believes that the crèche has an important role to play in upholding the founding principles of the Scottish Parliament, especially with regard to equal opportunities, accessibility and openness; acknowledges that childcare facilities within the workplace exemplify best practice for employers, a standard to which the Parliament is essentially committed; notes the success of the Scottish Executive’s nursery at Victoria Quay, which currently has a waiting list in addition to space for 36 children, and suggests that the SPCB canvasses the requirements of MSPs, staff and all visitors in order to assess critically the structure and scope of the Parliament’s crèche provision, so that the service can be developed to meet the needs of all interested parties. Supported by: Mr Mark Ruskell*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Chris Ballance*, Eleanor Scott*, Ms Sandra White*, Robin Harper*, Tommy Sheridan*, Cathy Peattie*, Dennis Canavan*, Colin Fox*, Carolyn Leckie*
