 *S3M-3144 George Foulkes: SNP/Lib Dem U-turn on School Meals—That the Parliament welcomes the SNP/Lib Dem administration’s u-turn on closing school kitchens and removing school meals from our nurseries and schools across Edinburgh; congratulates parent councils, teachers, kitchen staff, cooks, parents, pupils and fellow Labour colleagues who successfully campaigned against these irresponsible and unjust cuts to the provision of healthy school meals; recognises however that five nursery schools remain without school meals and a number of school kitchens across the city remain closed, and considers that this was a shambolic and shameful decision by the SNP/Lib Dem council to deprive our children of nutritious, healthy school meals freshly prepared on site by qualified cooks.
