 *S3M-6759# Margaret Smith: £1 Drop-off Fee at Edinburgh Airport—That the Parliament notes the proposal by BAA to introduce a £1 drop-off charge at Edinburgh Airport; believes that this proposal has not been properly thought out; agrees with many people across the capital that this is an unnecessary and unfair charge; considers that the fee will have a disproportionately negative effect on older or disabled people; notes concerns that the fee may actually be more than £1, and believes that the fee, scheduled to start in October 2010, should not be introduced.
