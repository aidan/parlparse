 *S3M-4635 Bob Doris: My Creative Family and Adult Learning Week—That the Parliament welcomes Family Learning Week, to be held from 27 September until 3 October 2009 by Scotland’s Learning Partnership, and encourages families to enter the My Creative Family art competition currently being held by the Learning Partnership in the build up to the week; notes that the competition encourages two members of the same family to do either a drawing each or two together under the theme My Creative Family, and believes that such activities that promote whole family learning and learning as a lifelong pursuit should be supported and encouraged.
