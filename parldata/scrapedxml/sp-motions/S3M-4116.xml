 *S3M-4116 Trish Godman: National Thrombosis Week—That the Parliament supports National Thrombosis Week, from 11 to 15 May 2009; praises campaigners Jane and Gordon McPherson of Langbank and Lifeblood: The Thrombosis Charity for their continued and strenuous efforts to raise awareness in this area; notes that thrombosis has been and remains a major cause of death in Scotland; regrets that this fact is not widely known; further notes that members of the public and even many medical professionals have little or no understanding anent the causes and effects of thrombosis, particularly the dangers of hospital-acquired thrombosis, which kills in excess of 3,000 patients in Scotland every year, more than hospital-acquired infections, even though the majority of these deaths could easily be prevented with a simple mandatory risk assessment, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government, NHS boards and all other interested parties to implement mandatory risk assessments in the near future.
