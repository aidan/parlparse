*S3M-6660 Kenneth Gibson: Closure of Applications to the Independent Living Fundâ€”That the Parliament expresses concern that the Independent Living Fund, which provides financial support for disabled people, is now closed to applications in 2010-11, leaving many disabled people housebound and isolated, and believes that the UK Government, through the Department for Work and Pensions, must look urgently at providing emergency funding to address this distressing situation.
