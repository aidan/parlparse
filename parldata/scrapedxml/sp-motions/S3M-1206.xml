*S3M-1206 Ted Brocklebank: Congratulations to AL Kennedy—That the Parliament congratulates Dundee-born writer and former lecturer in creative writing at the University of St Andrews, (Alison) AL Kennedy, on winning this year’s prestigious Costa Book of the Year Award for her fifth novel, Day; notes that the novel triumphed over the books of established authors such as Simon Sebag Montefiore, and endorses the words of the chair of the final judges, Joanna Trollope, that "Day is an example of excellence in its category and a book ultimately to recommend. It is perfectly and beautifully written by an author who is an extraordinary stylist."
