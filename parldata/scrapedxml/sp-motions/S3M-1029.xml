*S3M-1029 Patrick Harvie: Councillors’ Freedom to Vote without Reprisals—That the Parliament recognises the differing views over the proposed development of a golf resort by the Trump Organisation; regardless of opinions on the development itself, considers that local councillors who exercise a role in the planning system must be free to vote as they see fit in the circumstances; therefore considers that the removal of Councillor Martin Ford from his role on Aberdeenshire Council’s Infrastructure Services Committee represents a dangerous precedent for the planning system as a whole, and calls on the Scottish Government to consider what steps can be taken to ensure that local councillors are able in future to exercise their planning functions with independence and without fear of reprisals.
