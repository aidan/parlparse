*S2M-479 Richard Lochhead: Recognising the Achievements of Professor John Mallard-That the Parliament recognises the outstanding contribution to science of Professor John Mallard and his team at the University of Aberdeen who were instrumental in the development of magnetic resonance imaging technology in the late 1970s and early 1980s; notes that this work was built upon across the world and was of fundamental importance to the 2003 Nobel Award in Physiology or Medicine being awarded to teams from the Universities of Nottingham and Illinois for developing new applications for this technology; further notes that Scotland has a proud record of world-beating science, and calls on the Scottish Executive to redouble efforts to encourage such scientific progress and to retain the benefits in Scotland rather than exporting technology and commercial advantage overseas.
