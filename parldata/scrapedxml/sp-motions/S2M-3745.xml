*S2M-3745 Robin Harper: ChildLine Scotland—That the Parliament congratulates ChildLine, who last year helped over 30,000 vulnerable children; notes that it was unable to answer another 22,500 calls from vulnerable and lonely children; recognises the need for both financial and practical aid; further notes the plans for ChildLine to join the NSPCC next year and for ChildLine Scotland to join the NSPCC’s sister organisation, Children 1ST; notes, however, that in Scotland, of the 170 children that call each day, counsellors can help only a little over half of these threatened young people; supports the proposal for ChildLine Scotland to join Children 1ST, and agrees that everything should be done to support those of our children who are lonely and vulnerable, especially at Christmas.
