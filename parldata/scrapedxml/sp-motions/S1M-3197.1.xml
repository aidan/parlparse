 *S1M-3197.1 Richard Lochhead: Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3197) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert ", while welcoming many of the developments in the revised Common Fisheries Policy, calls for the Scottish Executive and European Union to guarantee that Scotland’s historic fishing rights will be incorporated into the Common Fisheries Policy in perpetuity; believes that the proposed regional committees must have genuine decision-making powers to make a difference; notes that the EU continues to pursue damaging fisheries policies including the proposed inappropriate regulation of the deep-sea fishery, and calls on the Minister for Environment and Rural Development to demand that he leads the UK’s delegation during the forthcoming negotiations in order to secure Scotland’s objectives."
