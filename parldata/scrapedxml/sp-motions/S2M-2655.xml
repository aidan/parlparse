 * S2M-2655 Chris Ballance: M74 Decisionâ€”That the Parliament condemns the decision by the Scottish Executive to proceed with the M74 northern extension, despite the damning criticism of the project made by the reporters of the public inquiry; agrees with their findings that the road will have very serious and undesirable results and that the economic and traffic benefits of the project arising from the transfer of future jobs from other parts of Scotland would be much more limited than stated by the Executive; believes that the motorway will only create a long-term increase in traffic, will not reduce congestion, will have a damaging impact on already disadvantaged communities and will worsen climate change pollution; further believes that the Executive has shown utter disregard for its own planning procedures, and supports the campaigners who have pledged themselves to direct action to prevent the construction of the road.
