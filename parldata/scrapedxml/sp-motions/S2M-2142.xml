*S2M-2142# Rob Gibson: Counterdrift Index—That the Parliament notes the continued loss of population from rural and island areas and its harmful effects on many communities; believes that the Scottish Executive should create a "Counterdrift Index" that sets out the details of its achievements in tackling this issue, and considers that the index, published quarterly, should flag up all relevant indicators, including the number of affordable houses built and public jobs dispersed to areas of depopulation, the amount of land transferred for community use from both public and private sectors, the number of modern apprenticeships turned into permanent sustainable jobs and incentives delivered for tradespeople to work in the affected areas.
