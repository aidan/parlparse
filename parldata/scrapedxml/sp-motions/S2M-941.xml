 *S2M-941# Frances Curran: Association of University Teachers Industrial Action-That the Parliament supports the decision by an overwhelming majority of staff in the Association of University Teachers (AUT) to take strike action and boycott assessment activity in the week of 23 to 27 February 2004 and beyond; condemns proposals to overhaul the higher education pay framework so that academic, and especially academic-related, staff face the loss of thousands of pounds over coming years; condemns the universities' attempts to move towards a system of local pay bargaining; notes the refusal of the universities to re-open negotiations with the AUT on these issues; further notes that, whilst academic and related pay has fallen by 40% in real terms in the past two decades, vice-chancellors have been, since the mid-1990s, awarded pay rises twice as high as other staff; applauds the support of students for the AUT's action and simultaneous campaign against top-up fees, and considers that the Scottish Executive should act on the Enterprise and Culture Committee's report Scottish Solutions Inquiry recognising problems of staff recruitment and retention in Scotland and calling for additional funding for higher education, specifically by providing the additional £100 million requested by Universities Scotland, NUS and AUT Scotland. Supported by: Carolyn Leckie*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*
