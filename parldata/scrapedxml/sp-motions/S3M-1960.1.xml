 *S3M-1960.1 Ken Macintosh: Holocaust Education in Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1960) in the name of Jackson Carlaw, insert at end ", and while admiring the chutzpah of calling for a Member’s Business debate on this subject which does not commit ministers to take action, wonders why some MSPs did not feel able to support substantive amendment S3M-1768.2 on Holocaust Education on 24 April 2008, which might have resulted in funding being made available and stated that the Parliament "believes that Holocaust education, including visits to the Auschwitz concentration camp, is an important part of lessons on citizenship and international education; agrees that the Scottish Government should ensure that the Barnett consequentials of the £4.65 million in funding announced by the UK Government for visits to Auschwitz are used specifically to support Scottish pupils for this same purpose"."
