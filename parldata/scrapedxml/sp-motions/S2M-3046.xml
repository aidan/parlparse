 *S2M-3046 Shiona Baird: The Big Recycle and Zero Waste—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive’s Big Recycle initiative; further welcomes the recent advances that have been made in Scotland’s recycling rates; notes, however, that, while Scotland’s recycling figures are improving, they still lag far behind those of most of our European partners; acknowledges that most people in Scotland want to recycle more of their waste but lack the infrastructure to do so easily; believes that, while recycling is important, it is even more important to focus efforts on waste prevention; calls on the Executive to publish its national waste prevention strategy, and urges the Executive to follow the lead of other European countries and make extensive recycling facilities freely available to all households as part of a wider national policy of zero waste.
