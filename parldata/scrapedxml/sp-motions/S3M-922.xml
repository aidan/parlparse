 *S3M-922 Alasdair Allan: BBC Trust Report into New BBC Gaelic Channel—That the Parliament recognises the concerns expressed by many regarding the BBC Trust’s report into a new Gaelic digital television channel; notes that the BBC Trust has stated that more information needs to be forthcoming before it can support the new channel; believes that all those with the interests of Gaelic at heart should write to the BBC Trust during the consultation period into the new channel, and urges them to support the new channel and inform the trust of the benefits that it would bring, not only to Gaelic speakers but to many others who are supporters of the language and culture.
