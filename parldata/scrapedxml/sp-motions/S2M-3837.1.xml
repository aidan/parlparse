*S2M-3837.1 Murdo Fraser: Air Route Development Fund—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3837) in the name of Tavish Scott, insert at end “notes, however, that the ARDF represents a comparatively modest contribution to the massive expansion of air services over recent decades, which is chiefly due to the substantial deregulation of the industry achieved by the liberalising policies of the last Conservative administration, such as the privatisation of the British Airports Authority (BAA), the privatisation of British Airways (BA), the Airports Act 1986, the Civil Aviation Act 1980 and the pursuit of a European single market in aviation.”
