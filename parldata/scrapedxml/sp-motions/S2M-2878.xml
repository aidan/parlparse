 * S2M-2878 Christine Grahame:Tax Credits and Debts—That the Parliament notes the concerns of Citizens Advice Scotland anent the recovery of debts by the Inland Revenue directly from tax credit entitlement; further notes that such action can undermine a repayment plan negotiated with other creditors leading to financial instability and undermining what can be months or years of careful financial planning, including protected trust deeds, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to liaise with Her Majesty’s Government to ensure that the Inland Revenue uses its discretion not to recover overpayments of tax credits when to do so would prevent a creditor from participating in one of these schemes.
