*S3M-5833 Pauline McNeill: McLelland Cheeseâ€”That the Parliament notes the presence in Glasgow of A McLelland and Sons Ltd since it was founded in 1850; is disappointed that Lactalis McLelland is consulting on moving its centre of operations from the Townhead site to Surrey; recognises that 63 jobs could be lost by the move; is disappointed that the move could be complete by the end of 2010; is concerned by press reports that the Townhead site is already for sale, and hopes that every effort is made to ensure that the factory and jobs are saved or that the current workforce is redeployed.
