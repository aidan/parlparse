*S2M-5055.1 Derek Brownlee: The Financial Powers of the Parliamentâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-5055) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from "powers" to end and insert "and non-financial powers that it requires to have in order to maximise accountability, efficient government, economic growth, public services, infrastructure development and good social outcomes in Scotland and further encourages the business community, the trade unions, the public sector, the voluntary sector, academia and wider civic Scotland to participate in this debate, the objective of which must be to make Scotland a more prosperous country, able to deliver social justice to its people, and notes that a more effective and accountable devolved Scottish Parliament would strengthen the United Kingdom."
