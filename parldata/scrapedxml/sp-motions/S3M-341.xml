*S3M-341# Kenneth Gibson: Adopt a Roadâ€”That the Parliament agrees to consider introducing the Adopt a Road initiative which works so successfully in Canada; notes that under such a scheme individuals, companies and voluntary groups take responsibility for a length of road, usually in the vicinity of the sponsoring group or person, from one junction to the next; is aware that, while no money changes hands, the sponsor agrees to keep the sponsored road free of litter and reasonably clean, contacting their local authority to uplift any refuse gathered having given at least 24 hours notice; notes that the scheme recognises sponsors through the provision of signs on the sponsored road designed, provided and erected by their local authority, and believes that such a scheme could be successfully piloted in Cunninghame North. Supported by: Angela Constance*, Murdo Fraser*, Stuart McMillan*
