*S3M-6377♦ Aileen Campbell: Perspectives of Children and Young People with a Parent in Prison—That the Parliament welcomes the report, Perspectives of Children and Young People with a Parent in Prison, issued by the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland and Families Outside and which explores the experiences of children and young people who have had a family member sent to prison; welcomes the consideration that has already been given to this important issue during the proceedings of the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Bill; notes with concern the finding of the report that each year as many as 16,500 children across Scotland, including the South of Scotland region, will experience the imprisonment of a parent or carer, and believes that a cross-party approach is the best way to ensure that the rights of the children of offenders, who are often the innocent and forgotten victims of crime, are respected in the legal system. Supported by: Bill Wilson*, Rob Gibson*, Sandra White*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Jamie Hepburn*
