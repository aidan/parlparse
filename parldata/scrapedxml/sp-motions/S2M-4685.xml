 *S2M-4685 Murdo Fraser: Corporate Social Responsibility of RBS—That the Parliament congratulates the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) Group for its pledge to provide 50 new free-to-use cash machines in some of the poorest and most remote communities in Scotland, providing thousands of people with free access to their money; notes that RBS is already the largest provider of free-to-use cash machines in the United Kingdom and that the bank’s newest initiative recognises the need for free cash machines, particularly in poorer communities; welcomes RBS’s approach of providing the new bank machines through seeking advice on the location by asking the general public, local authorities, credit unions and community leaders, to ensure that the most appropriate communities in Scotland benefit, and believes that this action by RBS shows that one of Scotland’s most successful corporations understands it has a social responsibility for all Scots and is another example of a profitable business applying corporate social responsibility.
