 *S2M-4170 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Redundancies at James Watt College—That the Parliament deplores the behaviour of senior management at James Watt College, Greenock and Kilwinning, in announcing on 15 March 2006 their intention to make 70 full-time equivalent academic posts redundant with the intention of filling these places with staff under new terms and conditions; congratulates the academic staff for their 97% "yes" vote in favour of industrial action in opposition to the management proposals to reduce staff and diminish terms and conditions of employment, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure the future viability of the college by sending a clear message that this type of behaviour by college management is unacceptable and detrimental to the education of students in both campuses.
