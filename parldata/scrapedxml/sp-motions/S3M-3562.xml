*S3M-3562 Sandra White: Glasgow Furniture Initiative—That the Parliament commends the work of the Glasgow Furniture Initiative, which, after recycling unwanted domestic furniture and white goods, provides a one-stop-shop for Glasgow’s social welfare and housing agencies to supply furnishings for households on low incomes; welcomes the many benefits of the initiative, such as recycling goods previously sent to landfill, reducing levels of repeat homelessness and providing training opportunities for people previously affected by homelessness, and hopes that this initiative will go from strength to strength.
