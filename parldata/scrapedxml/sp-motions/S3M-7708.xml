 *S3M-7708 Nigel Don: Super-fast Broadband for Montroseâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the news that Montrose has been selected as one of four Scottish towns set to receive super-fast broadband; notes that this is due to a new investment programme in fibre broadband by BT that aims to give 47,000 businesses and households in Scotland access to broadband speeds of up to 40Mb/s by spring 2012, and looks forward to the full roll-out of super-fast broadband across Scotland.
