 * S2M-2636 Bruce Crawford: 1,599 Rosyth Job Losses—That the Parliament is deeply saddened by the announcement of 320 further job losses at Rosyth dockyard and is seriously concerned at the resultant effect that this will have on families of dockyard workers and their communities in Fife and across Scotland; calls on all political parties and trade unions to campaign to save the jobs and also calls on Her Majesty’s Government to end unfair and substantial government subsidies to English yards, which compete for the same MoD contract work as Rosyth; expresses concern that Rosyth dockyard’s operators, Babcock, will not have the critical mass of skilled employees available to deliver a successful future for the dockyard; congratulates the highly-skilled Rosyth workforce for making all the changes required of it to create a more flexible and cost-effective operation, and admires its dedication, particularly in the face of losing more than half the workforce since 1997, with a total of 1,599 people having lost their job since New Labour came to power.
