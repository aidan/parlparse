*S3M-1993 Rob Gibson: Scotland’s First Tidal Device on National Grid—That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in the creation and development of the OpenHydro tidal device situated in the waters off Eday, Orkney, which is the first such tidal device to produce energy for the National Grid in Scotland; recognises this achievement as a major milestone in the development of marine renewable energy in Scotland and considers it to be a triumph for Irish company OpenHydro and the European Marine Energy Centre; looks forward to an era of greater development of tidal devices which will make a huge contribution of clean, green energy to the nation, and further anticipates the economic spin-offs which will accrue to communities on both sides of the Pentland Firth as well as further afield.
