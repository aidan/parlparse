*S2M-2603# Shiona Baird: Disability Rights Commission Employment Campaign—That the Parliament congratulates the Disability Rights Commission (DRC) on its new employment campaign aimed at increasing confidence among small employers in the benefits of recruiting and retaining disabled staff and exploding some popular myths about the costs to businesses of doing so; believes that more support should be offered to the one million disabled people in Britain who are unemployed but who want to find work; recognises that, while people who become disabled during their working years may have to alter their employment patterns, they retain highly-valuable and transferable skills and experience, and considers that all employers should fully embrace the DRC campaign, recognise that disabled people represent a vast, untapped source of talent, and take positive steps to address under-representation of disabled people in the workplace.
