*S3M-5377 Bill Wilson: Lloyds Pays Huge Bonuses to Senior Managers and Cuts Everything Else—That the Parliament notes reports that Lloyds Banking Group, 43%-owned by the UK taxpayer, is to pay integration awards of up to 80% of basic salary to its senior managers, which would amount to £828,000 for its chief executive, Eric Daniels, that the integration with HBOS has already led to the loss of over 10,000 jobs, that Lloyds is reducing pension benefits for 56,000 of its staff, that it is unlikely to meet its commitments to increase lending to small businesses and that it is considering whether to serve notice on Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland to terminate the historic covenant, effectively ending the 25-year funding relationship between the banking group and the foundation; believes that the bank’s actions constitute gross insensitivity at a time of hardship for many, that the awards to its management break the spirit of the agreement between Lloyds Banking Group and the UK Government not to pay discretionary cash bonuses in relation to 2009 performance to any staff earning above £39,000, and calls for the hypothesis that organisations perform best when they are led by people who are attracted and retained only by enormous salaries to be objectively evaluated, not least in light of the considerable evidence that an unequal society is also an unhealthy and unhappy one, as mentioned in S3M-05273. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Hugh O’Donnell*
