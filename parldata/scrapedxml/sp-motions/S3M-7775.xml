*S3M-7775 Marilyn Livingstone: Joint Services for Victims of Sexual Abuse in Kirkcaldy—That the Parliament congratulates the Kingdom Abuse Survivors Project (KASP) and the Fife Rape and Sexual Assault Centre for providing services for survivors of sexual abuse in Kirkcaldy and the surrounding areas; notes that the two agencies have moved into joint premises in Kirkcaldy in order to achieve greater efficiency and further opportunity for joint working; recognises that, in total, the two agencies were spending £20,000 per annum in rental costs but that, having moved into premises together, they are now spending £5,000 jointly; commends the fact that this saving has resulted in more money being directed to client services and that being under one roof has enabled both groups to support each other and to deliver joined-up services; believes that the services offered by the two agencies are important frontline services, and commends both KASP and the Fife Rape and Sexual Assault Centre for cutting costs but protecting client services while under financial pressure.
