*S3M-6535 Bill Butler: Refugee Week 2010—That the Parliament notes that 14 to 20 June is Refugee Week 2010; congratulates the Scottish Refugee Council for co-ordinating a wonderfully diverse range of events across mainstream arts and cultural organisations along with a wide variety of community celebrations, and considers that, after fleeing persecution and making difficult and often dangerous journeys to Scotland, it is important that people seeking asylum are welcomed, treated fairly and feel safe from the day that they arrive and throughout their stay and that those recognised as refugees under the 1951 UN convention are helped to rebuild their lives and make a full contribution to Scotland’s future.
