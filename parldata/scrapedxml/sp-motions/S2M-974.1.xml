 *S2M-974.1 Mark Ballard: Civil Contingencies Bill - UK Legislation-As an amendment to motion (S2M-974) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from "and" to end and insert "but does not agree that the relevant provisions in the Bill should be considered by the UK Parliament because it considers that there are certain key elements of the Bill, such as the definition of an emergency in the Bill, that must be fully debated in the Scottish Parliament before it can consider a further Sewel motion on the issue."
