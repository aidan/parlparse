 *S3M-3773 Ian McKee: Capital Punishment and the EU—That the Parliament expresses deep concern over the alarming figures published by Amnesty International showing that in 2008 at least 2,390 people were executed by states across the globe, including China, the United States of America and Japan, compared to 1,252 in 2007; believes that capital punishment, which includes beheadings, electrocutions, hangings, lethal injections, shootings and stonings, is the most inhumane form of punishment and has no place in the 21st century; notes that Belarus is the only country in Europe where executions still take place; further notes that the European Union (EU) is the only major global economic and political power where capital punishment is illegal and condemned, and calls on the EU as a major promoter of peace in the world to stand by its principles of respect for human dignity and strongly condemn all forms of capital punishment in Belarus and across the globe.
