*S2M-2447 Richard Lochhead: Subtitling of Sweet Sixteen—That the Parliament notes the bizarre decision by the BBC to screen Ken Loach’s critically acclaimed movie "Sweet Sixteen" with subtitles on Saturday 19 February 2005; further notes that television programmes and movies from Wales, Ireland and the English regions are not subtitled when the characters are speaking with an accent; believes that the BBC decision gives the impression that people are incapable of understanding Scottish accents, and considers that the BBC should explain why it has treated a film made in Scotland as a foreign language feature.
