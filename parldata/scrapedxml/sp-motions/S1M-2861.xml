 *S1M-2861 Mr Gil Paterson: School Repairs Fund—That the Parliament notes the considerable outstanding repair bill faced by Scottish schools; notes that in some cases schools have been allowed to fall into an unacceptable state of disrepair, simply because local authorities cannot afford the necessary investment for improvement; draws attention to Greenhill Primary School in Coatbridge as an example of a school whose major repair requirements have provoked a crisis, and calls on the Executive to provide an emergency fund so that councils are able to bring schools up to a decent standard so that our children are taught in safe and comfortable surroundings.
