*S2M-1560 Chris Ballance: Future of Chapelcross-That the Parliament regards the closure of Chapelcross nuclear power station as a significant milestone along the road to developing nuclear-free sources of energy and employment longer term in the south of Scotland; notes that over the next few years there will be more jobs created in decommissioning the plant than there would be in operating a replacement nuclear power station, and encourages Â the Corridor Regeneration Strategy Steering Group to convert the site into a centre for renewable energy as part of Scotland's long-term renewable energy future.
