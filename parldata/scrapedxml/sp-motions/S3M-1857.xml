*S3M-1857 Bill Wilson: Woolf Review Highlights UK Hypocrisy on Bribery—That the Parliament welcomes Lord Woolf’s review of BAE Systems plc, which calls for tougher anti-bribery measures, and BAE’s commitment to implement these recommendations in full; notes that in so doing the company would be an example to the UK Government in terms of fighting corruption; deplores the fact that the United Kingdom has, to date, not prosecuted a single company for foreign bribery offences, as required under the OECD Convention on Combating Bribery in International Business Transactions; further notes the highly critical assessments of the OECD regarding the failure of the UK to enact effective anti-corruption legislation for foreign bribery offences and to otherwise adequately enforce the convention, and considers that the UK stance in persuading developing countries to implement governance reforms whilst failing to act to curb corruption at home is hypocritical, thereby damaging the implementation of the UN Convention against Corruption, which depends on the global north and the global south pulling together to fight international corruption.
