*S2M-4240.1 Colin Fox: The Queen’s 80th Birthday—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4240) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, insert at end "; notes that even her government does not yet want people to work until they are 80; believes that this may be an opportunity for the Queen to consider retirement and to make room for Scotland to become a modern democratic republic, and further notes that her retirement should be made easier by the fact that she will not suffer the same pension shortfall as that faced by millions of ordinary workers."
