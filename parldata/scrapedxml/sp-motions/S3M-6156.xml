 * S3M-6156 Helen Eadie: Fife Perpetrators of Antisocial Behaviour Given Licence to Inflict Misery on Victims—That the Parliament is concerned that, despite an admission of long-term antisocial behaviour by Inverkeithing tenants, the behaviour has been allowed to continue unabated without resolute action by Fife Council to stop the perpetrators; further expresses serious concern that it is the victims of the antisocial behaviour who are being pressed to move house with all the financial costs and upheaval that this will entail; finds that in today’s Scotland this is simply not an acceptable state of affairs, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that victims of such abuse are provided with the protection to which they are entitled as provided by the powers enshrined in the legislation on antisocial behaviour.
