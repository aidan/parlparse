 *S2M-685.1 Miss Annabel Goldie: Modernising Access to Legal Advice, Information and Representation-As an amendment to motion (S2M-685) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end "; acknowledges, however, that improving confidence in our justice system means more than ensuring that people get legal advice, but is about creating a system of criminal justice in Scotland that works and in which the public has confidence, and therefore calls for an end to delays in cases coming to court, an end to automatic release of prisoners and the introduction of proper public accountability within our police forces."
