 *S3M-1113 Bill Kidd: Addressing Long-term Unemployment—That the Parliament supports the Child Poverty Action Group’s position that the way to assist long-term unemployed people is not to add further benefit sanctions, but rather to introduce positive measures such as tackling poverty pay, encouraging flexible hours and developing childcare, and in particular calls for positive measures to tackle poverty traps such as the loss of housing benefit at 65 pence in the pound and council tax benefit at 20 pence in the pound for every pound earned over the benefit thresholds, effectively a super tax on the poor, by changing the rules to allow people to keep more of their earnings before losing these benefits. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
