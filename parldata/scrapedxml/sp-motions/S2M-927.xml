*S2M-927 Patrick Harvie: GM Crops-That the Parliament expresses concern at the apparent decision by the UK Government to approve the commercial cultivation of GM crops and therefore ignore the results of its own GM Nation debate; considers that the farm scale trials were too narrow in their scope to provide robust evidence of environmental safety and that no scientific evidence exists that proves that genetically modified organisms (GMOs) pose no danger to human health; calls on the Scottish Executive to use its existing power to refuse permission for the growing of GM crops until GM technology has been proved as safe for both human health and the environment, and believes that liability for any environmental, economic or health consequences of the intentional or unintentional release of GMOs in Scotland must fall on the biotech companies that produce them.
