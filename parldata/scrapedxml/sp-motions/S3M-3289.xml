*S3M-3289 Bob Doris: Halting Wholesale School Closures in Glasgow—That the Parliament condemns Glasgow City Council for its sudden and savage proposal to close 25 primary and nursery schools across the city; notes that the manner in which parents were notified led to many of them learning of the proposed closures in the Glasgow Evening Times and believes this is a totally unacceptable and insensitive way to impart such devastating news; believes that the consultation period of only six weeks for those objecting to the closures is far too short; is worried that any consultation will be for cosmetic purposes only and that the ruling Labour group may be determined to push school closures through in the face of huge public opposition; is concerned that such proposals may be an attempt to undermine the Scottish Government’s efforts to reduce class sizes and threaten the capacity of some primary schools to deliver free school meals in primary school canteens to all primary one, two and three children; calls on Glasgow City Council to halt immediately the wholesale closure programme and enter into genuine and meaningful dialogue with parents, teachers, unions and communities before returning at a later date with a revised strategy to enhance primary education provision within the city, and insists that hard-pressed communities, such as those in Wyndford, Maryhill where two primary schools are set to close, are not left without educational provision in their community.
