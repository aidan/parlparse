*S2M-1277# Colin Fox: Prescription Charges and Penalty Charges-That the Parliament believes that significant numbers of patients are not accessing the health care they need because they cannot afford the £6.40 charged for each prescription item; further notes the Citizens Advice Bureau report, Penalising prescription poverty, in January 2004 which suggests that many people on incapacity benefits are confused as to whether or not they qualify for free prescriptions and are falling foul of penalty charges introduced by the Health Act 1999; believes that patients in poor health and on low incomes are being severely penalised by the present system, and considers that the Scottish Executive should look at outright abolition of prescription charges as one of the options in its forthcoming review.
