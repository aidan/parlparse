*S3M-801 Bob Doris: Glasgow Day Care Workers and Learning Disabled Adults—That the Parliament shares the concern of Glasgow MSPs Bob Doris, Sandra White, Bill Kidd and Bashir Ahmad regarding the future staffing and service provision for learning disabled adults in Glasgow; notes the ongoing strike by Glasgow City Council day care workers who care for such adults in the city and sympathises with their concerns regarding their new contracts as a result of single status negotiations, and believes that the council must clearly show a pathway for each worker to be lifted out of pay detriment by March 2009, when salary conservation ends, and that the current proposals to reorganise learning disabled services must both meet the needs of the learning disabled clients, their families and at-home carers as well as acknowledging and supporting the ongoing professionalism of learning disabled staff who are currently suffering hardship as a result of industrial action that they have reluctantly taken.
