*S2M-1014 Dr Jean Turner: Trolley Waitsâ€”That the Parliament deplores the increased trolley waits in certain Glasgow hospitals which resulted in a significant number of patients sleeping overnight on trolleys in Accident and Emergency units; further deplores the fact that severity of pressure on certain hospitals has resulted in them being regularly forced to divert GP referrals and 999 ambulances to other hospitals; considers that this places NHS trusts in an impossible position, and further considers that the failure of the Scottish Executive to engage with trusts to adequately resource acute receiving facilities will result in further deterioration in standards of patient care, clinical safety and staff morale.
