*S3M-4436 Jamie McGrigor: New Home in the Highlands for Mercedes the Bear—That the Parliament welcomes the news that Mercedes, the resident polar bear in Edinburgh Zoo since 1984, has, subject to funding, been allocated a new and greatly enlarged home in the Highland Wildlife Park at Kingussie, Inverness-shire; agrees that this will both place the bear in a more humane and comfortable environment and be beneficial to the Highlands tourism sector; congratulates the team of soldiers from 75 Engineer Regiment who contributed time, effort and equipment to the construction of the enclosure in order to reduce the cost from £300,000 to £75,000, and hopes that people will donate to the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland fund to help make up the remaining £50,000 that is required for the completion of the project.
