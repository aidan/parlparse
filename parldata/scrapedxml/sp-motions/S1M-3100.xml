*S1M-3100 Shona Robison: Scottish Local Government Funding Crisis-That the Parliament notes the publication of the report Grant Distribution and the Mismatch Effect: An Assessment of its Impact on Councils since Reorganisation by Professor Arthur Midwinter; recognises the report's conclusions that Argyll and Bute, Dundee City, Glasgow City, Inverclyde, Midlothian and West Dunbartonshire councils have suffered due to the reorganisation of local government to the tune of £50 million per annum; further recognises that this additional grant would allow an average reduction in council tax of £112, and calls on the Minister for Finance and Public Services to take account of this financial injustice in advance of the local government settlement for 2003-04.
