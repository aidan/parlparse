*S2M-1845# Linda Fabiani: Centre for Peace and Reconciliation in Scotland—That the Parliament agrees with the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, John Hume, that a Peace and Reconciliation Department should be established by the European Union, serviced by an EU commissioner and dedicated to the task of conflict resolution; notes that Scots have long contributed in troubled parts of the world as global citizens working towards peace and stability; believes that our country’s reputation for democratic and peaceful constitutional change means that Scotland could be established as a force in aiding conflict resolution, and considers that the Scottish Executive should promote the establishment in Scotland of a European Centre for Peace and Reconciliation.
