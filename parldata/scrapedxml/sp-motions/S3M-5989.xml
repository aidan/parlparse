 *S3M-5989 Elizabeth Smith: Morrison’s Academy, Crieff, 150th Anniversary Year—That the Parliament congratulates Morrison’s Academy, Crieff, on the 150th anniversary year of the school; notes that Morrison’s Academy was opened on 1 October 1860 following the death of Thomas Morrison, a native of the nearby village of Muthill and noted builder of a substantial part of Edinburgh’s Georgian New Town; notes the year-round programme of events for parents, former pupils and friends of the school to celebrate 150 years of education; considers that the school brings important cultural and economic benefit to the local Strathearn economy by supporting local businesses through the trade that is received from its staff and pupils; recognises the work and achievements of many Morrisonians; understands that the school encourages pupils to be socially aware and play their part in the local community by using their talents and skills to contribute to the colourful array of local life, whether it is the Pipe Band playing at the Crieff market, the Chamber Choir singing at BLESMA or pupils completing their Duke of Edinburgh Award who undertake their service in the local area, and wishes Morrison’s Academy staff and pupils every success in taking the school forward in the future, in the words of Thomas Morrison, to "promote the interests of mankind, having a particular regard to the Education of youth and the diffusion of knowledge".
