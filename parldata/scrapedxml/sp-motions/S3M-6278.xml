*S3M-6278 Dave Thompson: Moray Firth Radio, Station of the Year—That the Parliament congratulates everybody at Moray Firth Radio on winning Station of the Year (up to 300,000 listeners) at the Sony Radio Academy Awards on 10 May 2010; recognises that this would not have been possible without the hard work and dedication of the presenters and other staff at the station, and considers that Moray Firth Radio is a true local radio station, covering local issues, and that it is reassuring to see that these efforts are not being overlooked by the rest of the industry.
