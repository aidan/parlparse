*S3M-2845 Jamie Hepburn: A Tax on Your Identity—That the Parliament notes with concern the recent comments by the Home Secretary, Jacqui Smith MP, to the effect that most people cannot wait for the introduction of the Westminster Government’s proposed ID card scheme; believes that, in fact, there is large-scale opposition to the imposition of identity cards on the people of Scotland and that the cost of compulsory identity cards is nothing more than a tax on an individual’s identity, and expresses its concern about plans to use commercial retailers to roll out the card scheme, especially in light of the Home Office’s miserable track record of managing large data-handling and IT projects.
