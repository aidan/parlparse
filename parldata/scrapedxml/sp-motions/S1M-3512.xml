 *S1M-3512 Brian Fitzpatrick: Leukaemia Research Fund Campaign—That the Parliament notes that about 24,500 people are diagnosed with leukaemia or a related cancer of the blood in the UK every year; further notes that around 600 children in Britain develop leukaemia or lymphoma every year, accounting for about half of all childhood cancers; recognises that survival rates for the most common types of childhood leukaemia have risen dramatically, and warmly endorses the launch on 30 October 2002 by the Leukaemia Research Fund (LRF) of a major fund-raising campaign for a £2.25 million LRF centre to be sited at Gartnavel Hospital in Glasgow bringing together cancer scientists, clinicians and patients under one roof in order to better facilitate the cross-fertilisation of research ideas and to support improved research outcomes, better treatments and increasing survival rates.
