*S2M-2520# Bristow Muldoon: Outsourcing of Rail Call Centre Work from Dingwall and Edinburgh—That the Parliament condemns the proposed outsourcing from the United Kingdom, and outwith the European Union, of call centre work at Dingwall and Edinburgh carried out on behalf of Virgin Trains through Trainline and Vertex, putting in jeopardy hundreds of jobs; notes that Virgin Trains is the main shareholder of Trainline, that Virgin Trains received £578 million in subsidies from the taxpayer in 2003-04 and that the Dingwall call centre also received taxpayers’ support to be established through Highlands and Islands Enterprise; supports the campaign of the transport union, the Transport Salaried Staffs’ Association, on behalf of the call centre workers, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should use its influence directly, and through the UK Government, to encourage the three companies to reverse the decision to transfer jobs out of the United Kingdom that are supported by taxpayers’ money. Supported by: Dr Elaine Murray*, Pauline McNeill*, Elaine Smith*, Bill Butler*, Tommy Sheridan*, Mike Pringle*, Eleanor Scott*, Mark Ballard*, Mr Kenneth Macintosh*, Alex Neil*, Robert Brown*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Scott Barrie*, Fiona Hyslop*
