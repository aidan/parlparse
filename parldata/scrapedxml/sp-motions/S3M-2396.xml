 *S3M-2396 George Foulkes: Students Hit by Credit Crunch—That the Parliament notes with concern the rising cost of rent for students studying in Scotland and that the £71.06 spent on average on rent in Edinburgh has risen by 20% in the last four years alone; recognises that the scrapping of the graduate endowment does nothing to directly help those students most in need of financial help while at university; supports those Labour MSPs calling for student support funding to be boosted to bring it into line with England and Wales; believes that the SNP grandstands about its achievements in higher education while backroom cuts and efficiency savings leave Scotland’s poorest students worse off than their English and Welsh counterparts, and recognises that rent is the single biggest expense for students and that the Scottish Government must do more to alleviate the strains on the student housing market by ruling out HMO quotas, incentivising universities to build more publicly-owned student housing and helping first-time buyers so that there is less competitive pressure on the housing market.
