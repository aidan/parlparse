*S3M-6380 Joe FitzPatrick: Malawi Anti-homosexual Sentencing—That the Parliament condemns the sentencing by Malawian authorities of Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga to a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison with hard labour after being convicted of gross indecency and unnatural acts; believes that the conviction and sentencing violates the equality and non-discrimination clause 20 of the Malawian Constitution, the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and international human rights documents, and calls on the Scottish and UK Governments to work with their partners in Malawi to end the criminalisation and discrimination of people on grounds of sexual orientation and to urge the Malawian Government to release Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga immediately.
