*S3M-7339 Sarah Boyack: Herald Society Award for Edinburgh Care Tender Campaign—That the Parliament congratulates the Edinburgh Campaign for Choice in Care and Support Services on being awarded the Herald Society Award for Campaign of the Year in 2010; notes that the campaign opposed proposals by the City of Edinburgh Council to tender a number of care and support services for people with learning disabilities and other support needs that reportedly would ultimately have affected nearly 800 people receiving support from 30 different care providers and expressed concern at the lack of proper consultation; understands that the proposals in the tender would have removed hundreds of service users from carers with whom they had built up trusting relationships over time and severely restricted the level of direct payments available to people who wanted to organise their own care; further notes the findings of an independent review by Deloitte, which criticised flaws in the tender process, including inconsistent scoring of tender bids, inaccurate and incomplete pricing information and an execution that was "not as sufficiently meticulous or as thorough as expected"; further notes an internal report by the chief executive of the City of Edinburgh Council, Tom Aitchison, acknowledging the flaws in the process, and his apology for the distress caused to vulnerable groups, and recognises the contribution that the Edinburgh Campaign for Choice in Care and Support Services made, in highlighting the concerns of vulnerable people, to persuading the council to abandon the tender and prompting the above reviews.
