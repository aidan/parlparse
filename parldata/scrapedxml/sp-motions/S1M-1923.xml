*S1M-1923 Mr Brian Monteith: Cuts Affecting the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders and the Black Watch—That the Parliament notes with dismay the proposed cuts to the Scottish Regiments, in particularly the effect such cuts would have on the Argyll &amp; Sutherland Highlanders, with its historic links to Stirling, and the Black Watch, famously based in Perthshire, regiments which have a proud history of defending British interests in many conflicts in the 19th and 20th centuries; believes that plans for further mergers and cuts would seriously undermine the future of these historic frontline regiments which include regular troops, territorial army and cadet forces, and calls upon Her Majesty's Government to reject this unnecessary course of action.
