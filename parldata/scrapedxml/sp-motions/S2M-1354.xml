*S2M-1354# Rob Gibson: Local Healthy Food for Highland Schools-That the Parliament congratulates Highland Council for its decision to source locally as much of its £2.5 million contracts for foodstuffs, including fresh fruit and vegetables, as possible, to promote food education for children and parents alike; welcomes the decision of the council's Education, Culture and Sport Committee to raise awareness among local suppliers whose successful tenders included the supply of organic fruit and vegetables; believes that the proposed pilot in Strathpeffer Primary School based on the principles of "Food for Life" is a most welcome step that sets a good example by insisting that 50% or more food is sourced locally, with ingredients to include 30% organic and 75% unprocessed foodstuffs, and praises the council's public procurement policy as part of major moves towards the aim of maximum local sourcing to provide best quality school meals that can be produced within budget constraints.
