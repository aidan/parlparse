*S1M-2520.2 Irene McGugan: Improving Scotland's Youth Justice System to Build Safer Communities—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2520) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end "; calls upon the Scottish Executive to implement in full the recommendations of the Advisory Group Report on Youth Crime Review, focussing particularly on the proposed national strategy and the review of the age of criminal responsibility; notes the crisis in the recruitment of social workers for children and family services, and, given that the problem of youth crime needs to be seen in the wider context of social justice and in order to measure progress, further calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward an annual report to the Parliament on the status of all of Scotland’s vulnerable children.
