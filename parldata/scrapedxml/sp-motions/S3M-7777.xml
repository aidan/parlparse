*S3M-7777 John Wilson: Airdrie Savings Bank Leads the Way on Banking—That the Parliament congratulates Airdrie Savings Bank, Scotland’s only remaining independent bank, for recently announcing record lending figures, with the expectation of further growth in 2011; recognises that Airdrie Savings Bank loaned more than £36 million last year, which was an increase of 24% on the previous 12 months; considers that this demonstrates how small banks are leading the way in providing much-needed loans and financial assistance to small businesses and individuals during this difficult economic period, and further considers that this is in sharp contrast to the big banks that are providing fewer loans while continuing to pay huge bonuses to bankers.
