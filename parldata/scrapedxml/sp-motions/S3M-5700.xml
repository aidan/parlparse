*S3M-5700 Bob Doris: Community Ownership at Ledgowan and Cadder—That the Parliament expresses concern at the decision of Glasgow City Council to close community facilities across Glasgow; considers that Ledgowan Tenants’ Hall and Cadder Community Centre in Maryhill are valued by the groups that they serve, are important to the health and wellbeing of these communities and that these areas already lack a number of the amenities enjoyed by more prosperous locales; believes that this decision is consistent with the continued erosion of civic facilities in the area following the closure of St Agnes Primary School in 2009, and considers that these communities should now be supported by the local authority to explore the feasibility of community ownership. Supported by: Alasdair Allan*, Anne McLaughlin*, Sandra White*, Stuart McMillan*
