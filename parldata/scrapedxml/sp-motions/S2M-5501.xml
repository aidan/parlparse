 *S2M-5501 Shona Robison: Awareness of Long-Term Conditions—That the Parliament welcomes the role of the Long-Term Conditions Alliance Scotland, set up to give an independent voice to the concerns of the estimated two million people in Scotland who live with a long-term medical condition; further welcomes the success of the alliance in bringing together 150 voluntary and community organisations covering a wide range of conditions; understands that, according to the 2003 Scottish Health Survey, it is estimated that 39% of people in the Tayside NHS board area have a long-term medical condition; whilst recognising the Scottish Executive’s role in supporting the establishment of the Long-Term Conditions Alliance Scotland, notes with concern that in most industrialised nations and in many developing countries long-term conditions are now the most common cause of death and that social deprivation is strongly associated with the prevalence of long-term conditions; further recognises that long-term conditions affect all age groups in different ways and at different times throughout their lives, including the lives of friends, relatives and carers, and urges policy-makers to consider the impact of their policies on people with long-term conditions.
