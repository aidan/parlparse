*S3M-7612 Hugh O’Donnell: Restrictions on Sport and Athletics in Gaza—That the Parliament expresses concern at the contents of the open letter sent to Michel Platini, President of UEFA, on 20 November 2010 from Palestinian footballers, coaches and athletes regarding the current situation in Gaza, where sports and athletics have been disrupted and sporting facilities damaged or destroyed by Israeli bombardments and where Palestinian footballers, sportsmen and women and athletes are reported to have been prevented from participating in events outwith Gaza by Israeli authorities on the grounds that they pose security risks; notes that the letter commends Mr Platini for stating that Israel must choose between allowing Palestinian sport to continue and prosper or be forced to face the consequences for their behaviour, while expressing dismay that this is not currently being permitted; calls on international organisations such as UEFA to apply pressure on Israel to end what it considers to be this oppression, and recognises the work of Scottish Friends of Palestine and other Scotland-based organisations for advocating the rights of Palestinians and raising awareness of their cause and rights.
