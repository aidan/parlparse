 *S1M-1450 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Stone of Destiny: 50th Anniversary of Removal-That the Parliament recognises the 50th anniversary of the removal of the Stone of Destiny from Westminster Abbey; acknowledges that the four students who carried out that stirring and symbolic act at Christmas 1950, Ian Hamilton, Kay Matheson, Alan Stuart and Gavin Vernon, deserve their honoured place in Scottish history as those who lit a torch of hope for Scotland and a future Parliament in the darkness of the post war era; considers that their daring action sprang from the purest of motives and was one of great courage, as they risked their futures in those harsh times to alert the world to Scotland's needs; believes that the four helped to inspire the decision in 1996 that this symbol of nationhood should be returned to Scotland, and applauds the four for never losing the sparkle of their youthful idealism and continuing to serve Scotland and inspire others in the intervening 50 years.
