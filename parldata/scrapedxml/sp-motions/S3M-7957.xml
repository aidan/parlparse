*S3M-7957 Tavish Scott: Shetland has Europe’s Best Hostel—That the Parliament notes that Hostelling International has rated the youth hostel at Islesburgh House in Lerwick as the best in Europe and joint second best in the world; believes that these ratings are fully justified given what it considers to be the excellence of the facilities of the 64-bed hostel created in a historic merchant’s house in Lerwick; commends Shetland Islands Council for undertaking the development and refurbishment of the hostel in the 1990s, and congratulates the hostel’s staff for the warm welcome and first class service they provide for their many very satisfied visitors.
