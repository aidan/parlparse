 *S1M-1868.1 Bruce Crawford: Rural Transport—As an amendment to motion (S1M-1868) in the name of Sarah Boyack, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "recognises the crucial role an integrated and modern transport infrastructure can play in improving economic performance and quality of life in rural areas; expresses deep concern that increases in expenditure on Scotland’s transport infrastructure will rise at only half the level planned for England; calls upon the Executive to improve the strategic overview and infrastructure/funding delivery mechanisms, and regrets the complacency demonstrated by the Executive in failing to deliver the solutions needed to meet the very real problems being faced in rural Scotland as a result of inadequate transport provision."
