*S3M-886♦ Bill Kidd: Tackling Health Inequalities—That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the study of general practices in the west of Scotland which found that "the increased burden of ill health and multimorbidity in socioeconomically deprived areas results in high demands on primary care and is associated with poorer access to care, less time spent with the doctor, higher GP stress and lower patient enablement in encounters for psychosocial problems"; believes that projects such as the Community Health Shop in Barlanark, which provides a range of alternative therapies from massage and aromatherapy to yoga, reflexology, reiki and others alongside a number of other groups and facilities such as a parents group, a young persons counselling group, alcohol and drug counselling, money advice sessions and GP drop-ins among others is a wonderful example of how these problems can be dealt with at a local level; notes that the Community Health Shop in Barlanark provides services to many communities which otherwise would not normally have access to them or would have to be provided by the local health authority, and considers that, due to the huge benefits in terms of community wellbeing and cost savings to local health authorities, funding for these projects should be met in full and expanded throughout areas of deprivation.
