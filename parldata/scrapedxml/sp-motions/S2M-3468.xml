*S2M-3468 Mr Andy Kerr: Delivering for Health—That the Parliament commends the action plan for NHS Scotland, “Delivering for Health”, and its acceptance of Professor David Kerr’s report, Building a Health Service Fit for the Future, as the basis of NHS boards’ future service change proposals; welcomes the report’s emphasis on shifting the balance of care to provide more safe and sustainable local services, including intensive case management in the community for the most vulnerable; applauds the commitment to tackle health inequalities by developing anticipatory care in our most deprived communities and applying the approach to benefit people wherever they live; supports the steps to consolidate improvements in waiting times and to put highly specialist services on a sustainable basis, and commends the Scottish Executive’s policy of pursuing greater quality and productivity.
