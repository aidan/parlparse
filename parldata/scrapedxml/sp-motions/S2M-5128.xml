*S2M-5128 Tommy Sheridan: City Bonuses—That the Parliament notes the latest estimate for City bonuses from the Centre for Economic and Business Research (CEBR) to the effect that total payouts are expected to reach a record of £8.8 billion shared among high-flying City staff while the Office for National Statistics published low pay estimates for Spring 2006 which show that 336,000 working people are paid less than the national minimum wage; further notes the CEBR prediction that 4,200 City employees would receive a bonus of at least £1 million, compared with 3,000 last year, and considers that such obscene levels of bonus payments illustrate the massive inequality of pay and income across Britain which is unacceptable and unproductive, and believes that a fundamental redistribution of wealth and income is required to improve social cohesion and the standard of life of millions currently condemned to life in poverty and that an independent socialist Scotland should never allow such obscene levels of inequality to scar our country. Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Campbell Martin*
