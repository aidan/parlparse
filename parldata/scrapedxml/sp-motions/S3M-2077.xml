*S3M-2077 David Stewart: Centenary of the Vatersay Raiders—That the Parliament acknowledges that it is 100 years since the 10 fishermen from Barra and Mingulay, who sought to establish crofts as a way of life on Vatersay, appeared at the Court of Session in Edinburgh accused of breaching an interdict imposed upon them by the absentee landlord, Lady Gordon Cathcart; notes that their two month imprisonment caused an outcry across Scotland, leading the Government to buy Vatersay for crofting; further notes that today the descendants of the raiders still live on Vatersay with a causeway now linking them to the larger island of Barra, built in order to avoid abandonment by the population of Vatersay as befell Mingulay, and notes that it was the Labour-led Scottish Executive that led the way in introducing land reform measures to give communities such as Gigha and South Uist greater control of their land and how it is managed and giving them greater power to shape their own futures, following the example of the Assynt crofters and the people of Eigg and Knoydart. Supported by: Peter Peacock*, Rhoda Grant*
