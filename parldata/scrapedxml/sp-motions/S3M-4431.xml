 *S3M-4431# Anne McLaughlin: Iraq Inquiry Should be Public—That the Parliament believes that any inquiry into the invasion of Iraq should be a public hearing rather than one held behind closed doors; further believes that the thousands of Scottish soldiers who fought in Iraq, their families and the Scottish public deserve to hear the whole truth about this war discussed in public; applauds the persistent efforts of Rose Gentle, who is from Glasgow, and others from Military Families Against the War who have been calling for the UK Government to hold a public inquiry; finds it unacceptable that the UK Government’s proposals for an independent inquiry call for it to be held in secret, going against the principles of openness and transparency, and believes that the overwhelming sway of Scottish opinion backs the call for an immediate inquiry conducted publicly.
