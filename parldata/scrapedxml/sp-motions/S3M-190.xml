*S3M-190 Pauline McNeill: Violence in Gaza—That the Parliament expresses its deep concern about the state of emergency which has been declared on the Gaza Strip and the impact on Palestinians caught up in a nightmare of violence that has already resulted in more than 100 deaths; supports the call of the UK Foreign Secretary for all parties to the violence to agree an immediate ceasefire; acknowledges that the root of the problem is the poverty, isolation and hopelessness felt by the Palestinians living under 40 years of occupation and the failure of the international community to do more to bring about the creation of a Palestinian homeland, and calls on the international community to take the necessary steps to rebuild the peace process, bring an end to the occupation and work for a viable Palestinian state alongside a secure Israel.
