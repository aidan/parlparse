*S3M-4791# Elaine Smith: Highway Robbery—That the Parliament expresses concern at the growing trend for parking enforcement in private car parks and the vast amounts of money being taken from drivers in this regard, including in Coatbridge town centre; recognises that, while it may be legal for companies to charge for the use of their land for parking with appropriate planning consents, there is growing concern that many so-called fines for breaches of private parking rules are neither reasonable nor reflect a fair recompense for loss of business; notes that the law surrounding this issue is the common law of contract, involving companies making their offer by prominently and clearly displaying signs indicating that the relevant car parks are private property requiring payment or subject to time limitations, with the acceptance of the contract being implied by the client’s parking there; further notes that such offer and acceptance would require to be tested in a civil court if disputed; is disturbed by the apparent ease with which car parking companies can access the private details of car owners from the DVLA’s vehicle database to then issue fines to people at their home addresses; agrees with the recent comments by the Automobile Association that "the prevalence of bad and immoral practices is now shocking and unacceptable", and condemns the often threatening and predatory manner in which these modern-day highway robbers pursue payment of these charges.
