 *S2M-2135 Tommy Sheridan: Zero Tolerance to Drink-Driving—That the Parliament notes that over one-in-four fatal road accidents in Scotland last year were caused by drivers with alcohol levels above the legal minimum, while 560 people were killed and 2,600 seriously injured across Britain in drink-driving related accidents; further notes that the legal amount of 80mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood is greater than the maximum 50mg per 100ml in most other European Union countries; believes that a consistent, all-year message has to be communicated that drink-driving is unsafe and unacceptable; calls on the UK Government to remove the current and confusing legal limit and replace it with a zero tolerance approach, making driving while having consumed any alcohol illegal, and believes that such an approach could save lives and make drink-driving even less socially acceptable than is currently the case.
