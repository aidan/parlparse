 *S1M-2910 Brian Adam: Transport Infrastructure in Aberdeen-That the Parliament recognises that Aberdeen is the only city of its size in the UK that does not have a by-pass; further notes that, according to the Aberdeen branch of the Institute of Directors, the cost to the community of Aberdeen's inadequate transport infrastructure is in the region of £20 million per year and that others estimate the cost to be nearer £100 million; recognises that Aberdonians living near the current trunk roads suffer from the effects of air and noise pollution from heavy traffic and have their safety put at risk; notes that the Labour group on Aberdeen City Council have decided to close the Grandholm Bridge from 10 July 2002, which will cause further traffic chaos in the city, and calls on the Scottish Executive to recognise that Aberdeen and the north east are an economic powerhouse whose future well-being is vital to Scotland and to allocate the resources necessary to construct a western peripheral route, with a third bridge over the River Don.
