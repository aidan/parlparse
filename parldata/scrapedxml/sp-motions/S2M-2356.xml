*S2M-2356 Pauline McNeill: Catholic Education Week—That the Parliament believes that the education of children is about much more than preparing them for their careers and is also about preparing them for life generally; believes that parents are the principal educators of their children, but recognises the invaluable role of all those involved in teaching and supporting Scotland’s children; notes that the week of 30 January to 6 February 2005 is Catholic Education Week which has as its theme the concept of playing a full and positive role in society; recognises the contribution of Catholic schools in Scotland’s education system and the contribution of many denominational schools in fostering a strong school ethos and in improving academic achievement; affirms the rights of all parents to choose Catholic schools for their children, and further believes that the work of all Scottish schools in improving the life chances of children is the underpinning principle of education policy.
