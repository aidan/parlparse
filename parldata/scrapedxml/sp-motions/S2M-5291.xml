S2M-5291 Ms Rosemary Byrne: A Christmas Cheer for unFairpak Campaigners—That the Parliament congratulates the unFairpak campaigners on their continuing campaign against European Home Retail and HBOS; recognises the hard work and determination of the campaigners in their fight to gain justice for the thousands of low-paid families facing a desperate Christmas after the collapse of Farepak which cost some 300,000 customers estimated savings of more than £100 million; acknowledges that those customers saved in good faith, did not borrow money or use credit cards and, in short, acted in a prudent and financially responsible manner and believes that they have been effectively robbed as a result; notes that on Monday 11 December 2006 HBOS is holding a champagne reception for shareholders at its headquarters at the Mound, Edinburgh; further notes that the unFairpak campaigners intend to hold a dignified demonstration at the Mound to demand recompense from HBOS; calls on the directors of HBOS and European Home Retail to honour their moral obligations to their customers and to reimburse them in full; further recognises that the UK Government has failed to legislate to prevent this disgraceful situation from arising, and calls on the Scottish Executive to demand that the UK Government legislates now to prevent future families from facing the bleak Christmas that confronts the Farepak customers.
