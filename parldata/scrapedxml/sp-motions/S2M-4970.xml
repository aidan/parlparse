*S2M-4970 Tommy Sheridan: Glasgow - Deprivation City—That the Parliament expresses grave concern over the recent publication of Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2006: General Report which states that Glasgow City has one in four income-deprived people which totals 142,915 people; notes that Glasgow has the greatest concentration of income deprivation with the highest proportion, 48%, and number, 331, of Scotland’s 15% most income-deprived data zones; notes that over 70% of income-deprived people in Glasgow live in the 15% most income-deprived areas in Scotland, and considers that this is a sad indictment of the city which was once the industrial capital of Scotland and that Glasgow is becoming a tale of two cities with a huge underclass of the poor, unemployed and underemployed.
