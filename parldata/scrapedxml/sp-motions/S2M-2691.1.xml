 * S2M-2691.1 Alex Johnstone:Nuclear Power—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2691) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from first “UK Government” to end and insert “House of Commons Scottish Affairs Select Committee concluded in its report, Meeting Scotland’s Future Energy Needs, that it is “vital that decisions are taken now, to obviate the possibility of, quite literally, the lights going out in Scotland in the foreseeable future”; further notes that nuclear power is currently estimated to save the United Kingdom annual emissions of eight million tonnes, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to support any plans brought forward by the UK Government to replace current nuclear power stations with new nuclear power stations in order to protect our energy supply, protect existing jobs and reduce our CO 2 emissions.”
