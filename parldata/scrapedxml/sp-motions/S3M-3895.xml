*S3M-3895 Marlyn Glen: 40 Years of the Parkinson’s Disease Society, Funding Research for a Cure—That the Parliament welcomes the opportunity to mark the 40th anniversary of the Parkinson’s Disease Society during Parkinson’s Awareness Week, 20 to 26 April 2009; applauds the all-round support that the society gives to the 10,000 people with Parkinson’s in Scotland and the 120,000 people in the United Kingdom; particularly recognises the society’s £40 million contribution to advances in Parkinson’s research to date; commends the society on opening one of the first brain banks in the world dedicated to Parkinson’s, which undertakes vital research to understand what goes wrong when nerve cells in the brain die; acknowledges that there is a shortage of brain tissue for this essential research and that the brain bank needs donations from people without Parkinson’s as well as from those who have the condition; wishes the society every success in meeting its 2009 target to double the number of people who have committed to donating their brains for research into Parkinson’s, and wholeheartedly supports the society’s vision of continuing to fund research until a cure for Parkinson’s is found.
