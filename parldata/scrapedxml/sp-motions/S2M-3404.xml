*S2M-3404 Dr Jean Turner: HER-2 Testing: Herceptin Treatment for Breast Cancerâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the Department of Health for announcing that all patients with breast cancer must be prospectively tested for HER-2 gene status; applauds Professor Mike Richards for meeting the leaders of all cancer networks in England to lay down a timetable so that all patients will be tested in readiness for the availability of Herceptin within the next six months; also congratulates the Scottish Executive for putting in place similar plans for Scotland; notes that the important emphasis now is that HER-2 testing, at the point of diagnosis, is vital to avoid progression of the disease into metastatic advancement, and recognises that approximately 805 HER-2 positive patients in Scotland could benefit from Herceptin, allowing them a better quality of life and perhaps a chance to live longer.
