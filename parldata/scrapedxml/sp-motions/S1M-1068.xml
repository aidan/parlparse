*S1M-1068 Fergus Ewing: Scottish Consumer Representation for Gas and Electricity Markets—That the Parliament notes the exodus of decision-making power with regard to consumer representation for gas and electricity markets from Scotland to the south of England as a result of the Utilities Bill; further notes that whilst one Scottish office will remain open, staff and responsibilities will inevitably be reduced; expresses its concern that the quality of representation may suffer; further expresses its concern that this change will also deprive Scotland of existing jobs, and requests that the Scottish Executive reconsider its position and make representations to Her Majesty’s Government opposing the proposal in the Utilities Bill that the existing area electricity consumer committee be abolished and replaced with a single Gas and Electricity Consumer Council for the whole of the UK.
