*S2M-3779 Brian Adam: Scotland’s Potential New Gas Fields—That the Parliament notes the contents of the report by Professor Alex Kemp on the viability of tapping into 23 potential gas fields in the Atlantic, which are believed to contain 3 trillion cubic feet of gas; further notes that Professor Kemp’s study, which was carried out before the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s oil tax hike, makes it clear that these fields are marginal; recognises that supplies to western Europe are extremely precarious after Russia’s recent decision to switch off its gas pipeline, leading to the European Union holding talks on developing a new strategy on energy security, and calls on Her Majesty’s Government to take a strategic overview of the current situation and to review its shambolic tax policies which are impacting on oil and gas exploration.
