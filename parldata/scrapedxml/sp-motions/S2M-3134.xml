*S2M-3134 Mr Mark Ruskell: Asia-Pacific Climate Dealâ€”That the Parliament notes the signing by the United States of America (USA), Australia, Japan, India, China and South Korea of the Asia-Pacific Partnership for Clean Development and Climate, a regional pact to combat greenhouse gas emissions; welcomes all international efforts to tackle climate change, but feels that the Kyoto Protocol, an existing agreement to tackle climate change based on binding emissions reductions, is the best first step on the long road towards building a sustainable future and that any alternative grouping risks undermining the progress that Kyoto has already made; wonders just how committed the USA and Australia are to genuine progress on climate change, given that neither country has seen fit to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, and strongly believes that effective action to curb greenhouse gas emissions need not place an intolerable burden on the economy of any nation and will in fact be far less expensive in the long term than inaction.
