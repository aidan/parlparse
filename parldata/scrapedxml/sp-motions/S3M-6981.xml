*S3M-6981 Michael Matheson: Falkirk Council Charges are an Attack on the Most Vulnerable in Societyâ€”That the Parliament notes with dismay the charges for services used by older people, including the emergency care service, that have been introduced by the Labour/Tory-led administration of Falkirk Council; believes that these services are essential for many older residents; further believes that they are being imposed on some of the most vulnerable in society and will have a detrimental effect on their quality of life, and urges Falkirk Council to rethink what it considers to be this disgraceful set of new charges.
