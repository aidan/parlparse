 S3M-4677 Christina McKelvie: The Euan MacDonald Centre for Motor Neurone Disease Research—That the Parliament welcomes the opening of The Euan MacDonald Centre for Motor Neurone Disease Research and the arrival of Siddharthan Chandran as Professor of Neurology at the University of Edinburgh and director of the centre; considers that Professor Chandran’s appointment and the pooling of international expertise at the centre offers an excellent chance of advancing the knowledge of degenerative diseases and the practice of regenerative medicine, and looks forward to the centre producing novel interventions to improve the quality of life for patients suffering from degenerative diseases and to extend the time during which patients can enjoy that improved quality of life.
