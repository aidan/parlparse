 *S2M-4709 Ms Sandra White: Airport Securityâ€”That the Parliament notes that the increased terrorist threat and subsequent need for extra security is causing strain on already-stretched police resources which, according to police chief Ian Dickinson, can only be sustained in the short term and that, if the situation continues, forces will need extra resources or be forced to give less priority to other areas of policing and calls on the Scottish Executive to increase funding to police forces which have to provide increased airport security.
