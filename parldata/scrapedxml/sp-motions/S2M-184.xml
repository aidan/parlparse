*S2M-184 Christine Grahame: Anniversary of the Battle of Bannockburn—That the Parliament celebrates the anniversary of the victory at the Battle of Bannockburn on 24 June 1314 when King Robert the Bruce led his 13,000 troops, who were outnumbered 3 to 1, to victory against Edward II's army of 40,000 troops, marking a victory of lasting importance in the destiny of Scotland as an independent nation, and urges the Scottish Executive to ensure that all children of Scotland, whatever their colour, creed or background, learn of this seminal event in their nation’s history, an event that inspired the Declaration of Arbroath in 1320 with words affirming the sovereignty of the Scottish people above all else, words that have reverberated through the centuries and across nations and that affirm the democratic supremacy of the people, wherever, or whoever, they are.
