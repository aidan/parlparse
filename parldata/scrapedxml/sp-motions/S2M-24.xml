*S2M-24 Tommy Sheridan: Scottish Service Tax—That the Parliament notes the inherently unfair nature of the Conservatives’ council tax and believes that its ten-year existence has effected a wealth transfusion to the rich and wealthy from pensioners and low-paid workers; believes that a fair system to fund essential local government jobs and services must be introduced urgently to shift the burden of payment for local services from those least able to pay to those most able to pay, and therefore resolves to introduce a personal income-based tax to pay for local government jobs and services applied progressively and practically across Scotland as a priority designed to improve the disposable income of pensioners and ordinary workers while raising more revenue for local services.
