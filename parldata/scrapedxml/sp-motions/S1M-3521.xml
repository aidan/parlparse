*S1M-3521 Angus MacKay: Condemnation of the Attack on the Edinburgh Synagogue—That the Parliament condemns the attack on the Edinburgh Synagogue on Salisbury Road, South Edinburgh, on 24 October 2002; expresses its disgust at all manifestations of anti-Semitism and other intolerance; notes that, whilst the perpetrators as yet remain anonymous, Scotland, like the rest of the UK, has seen a rise in anti-Semitism and religious intolerance in the past months and that some extremist political groups and individuals have used the tragic situation in the Middle East as justification for attacks, verbal and physical, on Scotland’s Jewish and other communities, and asserts that the odious creed of anti-Semitism and intolerance runs counter to the principles of tolerance, pluralism and respect for all people which are the central tenets of a devolved Scotland.Supported by: Donald Gorrie*
