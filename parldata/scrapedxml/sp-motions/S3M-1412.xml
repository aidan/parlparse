*S3M-1412 John Farquhar Munro: The Glennie Report—That the Parliament is concerned about the potential impact of the implementation of the Glennie Report on rural dental practices throughout Scotland as it will require dental surgeries to have a separate sterilisation room, new equipment and more staff to meet its requirements; notes that many dental surgeries cannot physically be altered to accommodate these changes and acknowledges that, if enforced, these changes will hit NHS dental surgeries, particularly rural dental surgeries, hardest; is further aware of the existing acute lack of dentists in the Highlands and Islands and believes that, if the Glennie Report’s recommendations are implemented, it will mean the closure of some of the few remaining surgeries, leaving people to travel even further for treatment or being forced to go private, and calls on the Scottish Government not to enact Glennie and to take urgent action to halt the decline of the rural dentist.
