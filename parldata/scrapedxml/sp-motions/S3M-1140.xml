*S3M-1140 Helen Eadie: Baby Ryan Turner, Nine Months Old - Victim of SNP/Scottish Liberal Democrat Policies—That the Parliament notes that nine-month-old baby Ryan Turner of Rosyth has been hospitalised for the past nine months despite being clinically assessed as being fit to go home; acknowledges that baby Ryan is at risk from hospital acquired infection and is missing the vital months for bonding and development into his family; further notes that Ryan’s hospital care costs a minimum of £1,000 per day and that the costs for NHS Fife since his birth now amount to over £270,000 with case conference professionals saying that, if Fife Council does not find the family four bedroom accommodation, then baby Ryan will remain in hospital beyond next Christmas with the accruing costs amounting to a further £356,000, making a total of £626,000 costs and rising; expresses concern that the SNP/Scottish Liberal Democrat-controlled Fife Council is oblivious to the mounting costs to NHS Fife as a consequence of its lack of political will to source a four bedroom house and enable the Turner family to bond and share the crucial early development days of their new baby, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to take urgent action as custodian of the public purse with the consequential impact on health budgets.
