 *S1M-3081# Brian Adam: Transport Infrastructure in the North East-That the Parliament acknowledges that Aberdeen is the only city of its size in the UK that does not have a by-pass; notes that, according to the Aberdeen branch of the Institute of Directors, the cost to the community of Aberdeen's inadequate transport infrastructure is in the region of £20 million per year and that others estimate the cost to be nearer £100 million; recognises that Aberdonians living near the current trunk roads suffer from the effects of air and noise pollution from heavy traffic and have their safety put at risk; further notes that the Grandholm Bridge will close from 10 July 2002, which will cause additional traffic chaos in the city, and further recognises that Aberdeen and the north east are an economic powerhouse whose future well-being is vital to Scotland and that there is an urgent need to allocate the resources necessary to construct a western peripheral route, with a third bridge over the River Don, as part of an integrated transport system as proposed by NESTRANS.
