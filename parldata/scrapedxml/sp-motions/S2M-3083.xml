*S2M-3083# Shona Robison: Work Permit for Jason Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament is concerned at the decision of the Home Office to refuse to renew the work permit for Dundee United player, Jason Scotland; believes that Jason is an asset to both Dundee United, the city of Dundee and Scotland; is concerned that this decision flies in the face of attempts to bring fresh talent to Scotland through the Fresh Talent initiative, and believes that the Home Office should reconsider its decision as a matter of urgency.
