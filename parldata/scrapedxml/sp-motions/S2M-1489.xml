*S2M-1489 Mike Rumbles: Sir Patrick Geddesâ€”That the Parliament notes the increasing importance of the work and philosophy of the Scottish polymath, Sir Patrick Geddes, who was born in Ballater on 2 October 1854; recognises that Geddes was a botanist, environmentalist, educator, planner, conservationist, internationalist and patron of the arts; notes that he combined all these aspects in his designs for reviving the High Street in Edinburgh, for the Armenian community in Cyprus, for the University in Jerusalem, for various cities in India and for the Scots College in Montpellier; further notes that he foresaw the dangers of forest clearance as a cause of drought, and welcomes the fact that the Ballater Geddes Project 2004 has adopted the quotation "By Leaves We Live" as its motto for the exhibition they are planning from 7 August to 2 October 2004.
