 *S3M-1906 Robin Harper: Better Policies for Giant Panda Conservation, Breeding and Welfare—That the Parliament expresses its concern at the proposal by the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) to lease two giant pandas from a research centre in China for exhibition and captive breeding at Edinburgh Zoo; considers that there are serious animal welfare problems attached to the keeping of giant pandas in zoos; notes that captive breeding of giant pandas has resulted in no successful reintroduction to the wild; believes that the best way to conserve the giant panda population is to support in situ projects such as panda reserves and habitat conservation; urges the RZSS to reconsider this plan, and requests the Scottish and UK governments not to become involved in using live animals as currency in the course of diplomatic exchange.
