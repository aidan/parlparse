*S3M-725 John Park: Employment Legislation and the Council of Economic Advisers—That the Parliament is concerned by the recent comments from Sir George Mathewson, chair of the Council of Economic Advisers (CEA), regarding the impact of employment legislation on the Scottish economy; recognises that while there have been significant improvements in workers’ rights, such as the national minimum wage, new entitlements to paid holidays and increased maternity leave, employment in Scotland is at record levels; is further concerned that, while the World Bank ranks Scotland, in the United Kingdom, as sixth of 178 countries for ease of doing business, the chair of the CEA chooses to attack rights at work, and calls on the CEA to base all of its future advice to the First Minister on independent evidence and to concentrate on real issues facing the Scottish economy, such as skill shortages, low levels of business research and development investment and security of energy supplies.
