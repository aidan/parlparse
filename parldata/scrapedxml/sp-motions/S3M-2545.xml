*S3M-2545 Jackie Baillie: SNP U-Turn on Single Status—That the Parliament deeply regrets the actions of SNP-controlled West Dunbartonshire Council in reversing an earlier council decision about the single status agreements reached with employees; considers that its actions in diminishing the benefits available to its employees will leave as many as 2,000 staff out of pocket; believes that this demonstrates a complete disregard for those who are the lowest paid; acknowledges the hard work of the trade unions in attempting to arrive at a collective agreement with the council; believes that the basis of the council meeting that reversed this decision is questionable and is currently the subject of independent investigation, and, notwithstanding this, calls on the SNP government to encourage its councillors to reconsider their position and support their hardworking employees. Supported by: Des McNulty*, David Whitton*
