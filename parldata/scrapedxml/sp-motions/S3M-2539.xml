*S3M-2539# Des McNulty: Aircraft Noise—That the Parliament believes that increased protection is needed for communities directly under airport flight paths, such as Whitecrook, Linnvale and Drumry in Clydebank, which are affected by aircraft noise, a problem which also affects adjacent areas such as Drumchapel, Bearsden and Milngavie, and considers that there should be an examination of what fresh legislative or administrative steps might be taken to prevent any forced sale of Glasgow Airport leading to a worsening of noise pollution experienced by local residents.
