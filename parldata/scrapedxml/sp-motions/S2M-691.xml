 *S2M-691 Carolyn Leckie: Nursery Nurses on Strike at Christmas-That the Parliament salutes the courage and determination of nursery nurses continuing to strike after seven months on the picket line; affirms its support for the nursery nurses' claim; regrets that nursery nurses and their families are forced to face a Christmas on the picket lines by intransigent employers and a Scottish Executive that is content to place increasing demands on nursery nurses but not prepared to use its powers to ensure a proper career and salary structure across Scotland that recognises the extremely valuable contribution nursery nurses make to the development of our children; recognises that the Executive's failure to engage in the issues at the heart of this dispute gives credence to those who argue that it demonstrates a lack of vision and hesitancy, and calls on the Executive to restore confidence in the Parliament by intervening to secure a settlement to this dispute agreeable to nursery nurses and UNISON before Christmas.
