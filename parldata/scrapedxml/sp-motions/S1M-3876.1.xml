*S1M-3876.1 Mr Brian Monteith: Funding for Local Roads—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3876) in the name of Dr Sylvia Jackson, leave out from "for a number of decades" and insert "this sum, though welcome, is but a fraction of the amount needed to address the problem; notes that capital spending on the construction and improvement of local roads across Scotland during the four years up to 1997 was £562 million, compared with £326 million in the four years after 1997; further welcomes the report of Stirling Council’s cross-party scrutiny group and its call for the Scottish Executive to reduce its ring-fencing of funding allocated to local authorities; further notes that the scrutiny group highlighted the policy decision of Stirling Council’s current Labour/SNP administration to reduce the share of roads grant-aided expenditure (GAE) allocated to roads, so that in 2001-02 only 65% of it was allocated to roads maintenance, compared with 126% in Perth and Kinross Council and a Scottish average of 103%; notes that, had Stirling Council’s expenditure on roads maintenance been at 100% of roads GAE over the last six years, a further £9.8 million would have been spent on local roads in the district; understands that the SCOTS roads condition survey report, part-funded by the Scottish Executive, is now complete and believes that it should be published, and recognises that solving the problems affecting Stirling’s roads requires a change of policy, from both the Scottish Executive and Stirling Council."
