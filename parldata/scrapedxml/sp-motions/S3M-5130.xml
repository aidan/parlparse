*S3M-5130 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Sir John Crofton—That the Parliament notes with sadness the passing of health pioneer Sir John Crofton, who died on Tuesday 3 November 2009 in Edinburgh, aged 97; highlights Sir John’s inspirational health career that included his development of a new and effective way of treating tuberculosis (TB) in the 1950s and the reduction of TB in Edinburgh to almost zero in six years with his groundbreaking and revolutionary Edinburgh method of treatment with a combination of drugs; further notes that his work led to the mass BCG vaccination that reduced TB in Britain from 50,000 recorded cases in the 1950s to just 5,500 in 1987; acknowledges that Sir John spent much of his life fighting to raise awareness about the harm caused to public health by tobacco and called for smoke-free legislation long before it became law in Scotland, and notes that Sir John and his wife, Dr Eileen Crofton, played a pivotal role in founding the tobacco control charity, ASH Scotland, in 1973 and that a Crofton Award was recently launched by ASH Scotland and the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland, recognising the achievements of young people in reducing tobacco and smoking-related harm in Scotland.
