 *S3M-6751 Rob Gibson: Inverary and District Pipe Band Successâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Inverary and District Pipe Band on its participation at the Festival de Cornouaille in the Breton town of Quimper; notes that the pipe band took part in the defile en fete, which saw a procession through the streets with 3,000 dancers and around 40 other bands from Brittany; congratulates all those involved in the band on their rapid rise through the ranks, which started after Stuart Liddell started forming the band in 2003 with the aim of encouraging and teaching children to play the pipes; notes that the first performance of the band contained three members and Stuart Liddell at a remembrance day service in the town in 2003 and that in 2010 the band have achieved grade-1 status, winning a string of prestigious titles along the way; contends that their invitation to the festival de Counouaille and their grade-1 status shows that they are a credit to themselves, their town, Argyll, and Scotland, and wishes the band every success for the future.
