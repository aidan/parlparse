*S3M-3979♦ Cathy Peattie: Local Newspaper Week 2009—That the Parliament notes that 11 to 17 May 2009 is Local Newspaper Week, which has the theme of building stronger communities, highlighting the important roles played by the 120-plus weekly, bi-weekly, paid-for and free newspapers that serve local people and businesses throughout Scotland’s cities, towns and villages; acknowledges the local press as Scotland’s most socially inclusive local mass communication medium; applauds the significant investment made by publishers to deliver to an increasingly digital agenda and increase their digital audience; notes that members of the Scottish Newspaper Publishers Association are facing the most severe crisis in revenue generation and profitability in living memory, attributable to the long-term decline in paid-for newspaper circulations, the emergence of advertising-dependent internet services and the loss of recruitment advertising and licensing revenue to initiatives such as myjobscotland, developed under the auspices of the Scottish Government’s Local Government National Shared Services Board and led by COSLA, and is extremely concerned about the collateral damage to the democratic process and to the local newspaper industry that would result from the proposed introduction of a publicly funded web portal for the publication of public information notices.
