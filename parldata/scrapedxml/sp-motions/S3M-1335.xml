*S3M-1335 Patrick Harvie: Minority Government and the Budget Processâ€”That the Parliament notes the contents of Choices for a Purpose: Review of Scottish Executive Budgets, also known as the Howat report, published in 2007; notes that the review commented on the view that any coalition partnership agreement, regardless of the political parties involved, would be "a mixed bag of commitments, ranging from very general, strategic statements to some very specific policy commitments" and stated that this could be seen as "an inevitable consequence of conflating two political manifestos"; recognises that the dynamics of minority government were not explicitly covered by the Howat report; recognises that any minority government will need to engage in ongoing negotiations throughout its term to secure a majority for its spending plans; further notes that the Howat report suggested that "the current arrangements need to be reviewed to allow the parties forming an administration to develop clearer statements of desired outcomes that can lead to better costed programmes for the new administration"; considers that this analysis has further implications in a period of minority government and that new arrangements must be in place to take account of inter-party dynamics throughout a Parliamentary session rather than merely forming part of any post-election negotiation, and calls on the Scottish Government and all political parties in the Parliament to begin an open-minded discussion about changes that could be made to the budget process making it more appropriate for a Parliament composed of minority parties.
