*S3M-5588 Iain Smith: Cleaning Systems UKâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Cleaning Systems UK, based at Prestonhall Industrial Estate, Cupar, Fife, on being awarded a royal warrant for carrying out specialist floor cleaning services at Holyrood Palace; considers that this distinction is as a result of the dedication and hard work of the chairman and founder, Sandy Pearson, and his staff, and further considers that the entitlement to display By Appointment to Her Majesty the Queen on its literature and fleet of vehicles is a great boost in terms of prestige for Cleaning Systems UK and for Cupar.
