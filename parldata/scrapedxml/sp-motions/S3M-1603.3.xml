*S3M-1603.3 Stewart Maxwell: Housing—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1603) in the name of Johann Lamont, leave out from "the SNP government’s" to end and insert "the failure of the Labour and Liberal Democrat administration to tackle the chronic shortages of housing; notes the Scottish Government’s commitment to increase the rate of house building across all tenures from 25,000 to at least 35,000 houses per year by the middle of the next decade; welcomes the fact that the Housing Supply Task Force has brought together stakeholders from all sections of the housing sector to tackle blockages in the housing system; recognises that it is important to achieve value for money in, and increase the provision of, social rented housing while retaining the benefits of community-based provision and encourages the Scottish Government to continue to work with social housing providers to achieve that goal; further recognises the efforts of the Scottish Government to work together with housing associations, local authorities and the private sector to tackle the legacy of housing shortages; endorses the Scottish Government’s commitment to the 2012 target on homelessness, and calls on the Scottish Government to make a statement on Firm Foundations by the summer recess." Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon*
