 *S3M-4706 Duncan McNeil: IBM Pensions Proposalsâ€”That the Parliament expresses concern that IBM, a highly profitable company with substantial revenues and cash reserves which employs around 18,000 staff in the United Kingdom, including many in Scotland at its base in Greenock and other locations, is proposing changes to its final salary pension scheme that will see it closed to existing employees by 2010; believes that this will have a devastating impact on future pensions, and calls on IBM management to address the genuine concerns of loyal and hard-working employees and protect their pension benefits.
