*S2M-70# Pauline McNeill: Maternity Services in Glasgow—That the Parliament expresses support for the unique child and maternal healthcare link at Yorkhill NHS Trust, Glasgow; notes that the Queen Mother's Hospital at Yorkhill currently caters for 3,400 births each year and is expected to take on extra births from other NHS boards; further notes that the Royal Hospital for Sick Children is a national centre of excellence in many fields of paediatric care; is concerned that the review of maternity services, announced by Greater Glasgow NHS Board on 20 May, 2003, may threaten the long-term future of both the Queen Mother’s Hospital and the Royal Hospital for Sick Children; notes the vigorous campaign involving parents, the local community and elected representatives only four years ago against the proposed removal of Yorkhill NHS Trust from its existing site in the west of Glasgow, and believes that the Greater Glasgow NHS Board should consider responses to its previous consultation on the future of Yorkhill NHS Trust and the implications of breaking up the paediatric-maternity care link alongside any new consultation to be organised on the future of maternity services in Glasgow.
