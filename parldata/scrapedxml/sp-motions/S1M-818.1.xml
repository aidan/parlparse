 *S1M-818.1 David McLetchie: State of the Nation-As an amendment to motion (S1M-818) in the name of Mr Alex Salmond, leave out from first "notes" to end and insert "regrets that the Scottish Executive has failed to address the issues that really matter to the Scottish people, which has led to growing public disillusionment with its performance; believes that far greater priority should be given to addressing rising crime, raising standards in our schools, improving our transport infrastructure and tackling the crisis in the countryside and the problems of our health service, and notes that the SNP, instead of addressing these issues, continues to promote further constitutional upheaval which would be deeply damaging to the interests of everyone living in Scotland."
