*S3M-7576 Nanette Milne: Asthma UK Scotland Youth Ambassadors—That the Parliament commends the work of Asthma UK Scotland’s Youth Ambassadors in highlighting the issues of concern to young people with asthma in Scotland; supports their calls for more understanding of asthma in schools, more school asthma policies and efforts to ensure that children are not excluded from day-to-day activities because of their asthma, and calls on NHS Quality Improvement Scotland to look again at the children’s standards for asthma and again ask NHS boards for their plans on how they are meeting the standard.
