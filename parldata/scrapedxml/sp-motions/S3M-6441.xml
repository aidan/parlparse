 *S3M-6441 Sandra White: Tragic Deaths Aboard Humanitarian Convoy—That the Parliament condemns in the strongest possible terms the attack by the Israeli navy on the freedom flotilla, a convoy of boats with over 600 passengers including 28 Britons and 10 MEPs carrying humanitarian aid to Gaza in an attempt to break what is widely considered the illegal blockade of Gaza, which has led to a number of deaths;considers that the attack occurred in international waters in clear contravention of international maritime law; believes that, regardless of viewpoints on the Israeli-Palestinian situation, such actions perpetrated against the international community and in clear defiance of international law are indefensible, and calls on the UK Government and the European Union to take appropriate actions including the consideration of sanctions.
