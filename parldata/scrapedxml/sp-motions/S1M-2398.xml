*S1M-2398# Shona Robison: Digital Hearing Aids-That the Parliament notes with concern that less than 1% of people in Scotland who need a hearing aid have access to free digital hearing aids through the NHS; recognises that many people are still given inadequate analogue aids by the health service which are based on technology which has not changed since the 1970s; is aware that people with inadequate hearing aids become increasingly isolated because they cannot communicate with others; further notes that free digital hearing aids have already been introduced into 20 NHS hospitals in England, and considers that the Scottish Executive should, as a matter of urgency, make a commitment to providing digital hearing aids for all on the NHS as advocated by the Royal Institute for Deaf People.
