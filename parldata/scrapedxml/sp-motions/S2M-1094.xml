 *S2M-1094 Mr Brian Monteith: Tax Freedom Day 2004-That the Parliament notes that taxpayers will have to work for an extra three days this year, compared to last, solely to pay their taxes before they can work for themselves; further notes that, following the Chancellor's recent budget statement and the consequential increase in government debt, "real" Tax Freedom Day, taking account of taxes and government borrowing, will fall on 11 June, and calls on Her Majesty's Government to reverse this trend to allow taxpayers to keep more of their own money.
