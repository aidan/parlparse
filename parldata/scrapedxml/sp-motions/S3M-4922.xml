*S3M-4922 Bill Wilson: Suicide Attempts by Female Asylum Seekers—That the Parliament notes the recent report by the Scottish Refugee Council and the Gender Violence Unit of the London School of Tropical Medicine on female asylum seekers that revealed that 70% had suffered physical or sexual violence, some of which they had experienced in the United Kingdom, 57% had suffered post traumatic stress disorder, a condition making it difficult to remember the details of their experiences necessary for their asylum claims to be accepted, and that 22% had attempted suicide; endorses the recommendation by the organisations that produced the report that the UK Border Agency staff and immigration judges undergo training in women’s issues and that the Scottish Government reviews all current health and domestic violence services to ensure that they are meeting the needs of female asylum seekers, and calls on the media to report asylum issues in a balanced and responsible way.
