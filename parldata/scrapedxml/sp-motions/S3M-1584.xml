 *S3M-1584 Alasdair Allan: Barra Lifeboatâ€”That the Parliament recognises the heroic work done by the Barra Severn class lifeboat, as immortalised on a new first-class stamp launched on the isle of Barra on Thursday 13 March 2008; recognises that this is part of a set of six commemorative stamps on the theme Mayday - Rescue at Sea; notes that since the Barra Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) lifeboat station opened in 1931 there have been 505 launches and 412 lives saved; recognises that these stamps highlight the brave actions of the men and women of the RNLI who regularly risk their own lives attempting to save the lives of others, and commends not only the Barra lifeboat crew, but those crews from around the coast, on their courage and dedication.
