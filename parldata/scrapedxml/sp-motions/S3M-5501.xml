 *S3M-5501 Jackson Carlaw: Holocaust Memorial Day 2010/Gaza Now Exhibition—That the Parliament reflects with sadness on the Holocaust Memorial Trust’s (HMT) statement that "the evils of prejudice, discrimination and intolerance continue to exist in Britain today. We categorise, stereotype, discriminate, exclude, bully, persecute, attack - because of race, religion, disability and sexuality. We damage, and are damaged, as a result of our refusal to accept our common humanity"; welcomes the HMT’s work in organising Holocaust Memorial Day 2010 on 27 January 2010 as part of ongoing efforts to learn the lessons of the Holocaust and subsequent atrocities such as those perpetrated in Cambodia, Bosnia, Rwanda and Darfur; further notes the HMT’s observation that "Genocide does not just happen. It starts when we no longer celebrate and respect the differences between us"; unreservedly condemns the message displayed in the comments book at the Gaza Now exhibition in the Scottish Parliament during the week commencing 4 January 2010 calling on the international community to "wipe Israel off the face of the map", and calls on as many Scots as possible to participate in Holocaust Memorial Day 2010 events (http://www.hmd.org.uk/events), to learn the lessons of previous genocides and to strive to live by these lessons all year round.
