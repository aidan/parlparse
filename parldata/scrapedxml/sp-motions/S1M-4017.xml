*S1M-4017# Iain Smith: Proposed Closure of Civic Amenity Sites in Fife—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed closure of community civic amenity sites in Fife; further notes that these closures are caused by requirements being imposed by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) which require that all such sites should be permanently staffed; believes that this will result in the loss of valuable community facilities across Scotland, particularly at weekends and evenings, which will result in increased fly-tipping and greater risks to the environment, and further believes that SEPA should cease imposing these requirements with immediate effect.
