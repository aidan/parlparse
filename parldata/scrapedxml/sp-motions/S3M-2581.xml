*S3M-2581 Jamie Hepburn: Post Office Closure Programme—That the Parliament notes with disappointment the decision by Post Office Ltd to close all but one of the branches identified for closure in its Ayrshire, Inverclyde, Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire area plan, including those branches in Kildrum, Queenzieburn, Banton and Plains; further notes that these closures come in the face of massive public opposition and criticism of Post Office Ltd’s case for the closure of these outlets; believes that post office branches are community assets that provide more than simple commercial operations, and encourages all interested parties to work together to explore what options may exist to ensure affected communities can still access the vital services provided by their local post office.
