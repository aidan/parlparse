*S3M-6245 Patrick Harvie: Govanhill Streetland Festival—That the Parliament congratulates the hard working organisers of Govanhill’s Streetland festival, which took place over May Day weekend, on a highly successful event; notes that Streetland has been a highlight of the excellent Glasgow International Festival of Visual Art, and thanks all the artists, poets, musicians, cooks, DJs, tour guides, cake bakers and hula-hoopers who generously gave their time and talents to turn Govanhill into a buzzing centre of community spirit, culture and colour.
