 *S3M-6641 Bill Butler: Co-operatives Fortnight—That the Parliament notes that 19 June to 3 July 2010 marks the first ever Co-operatives Fortnight, which will see 14 days of events, workshops and activities aimed at promoting co-operative models and values across the country; acknowledges the estimated £3 billion that co-operatives contribute to the Scottish economy; welcomes the decision of the United Nations to recognise the major role that co-operatives play in society by designating 2012 International Year of Cooperatives; considers that Scotland is of huge significance to the co-operative movement, given the international significance of the Fenwick Weavers and the UNESCO World Heritage site at New Lanark, and encourages the Scottish Government, local authorities, communities, schools and individuals to participate in both this year’s Co-operatives Fortnight and the UN International Year of the Cooperatives in 2012. Supported by: Ken Macintosh*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Trish Godman*, John Park*, Cathy Peattie*, Cathy Jamieson*, Brian Adam*, Robin Harper*, Jackie Baillie*, Sandra White*, Bill Wilson*, David Whitton*, Johann Lamont*, James Kelly*, George Foulkes*, Rob Gibson*, Marlyn Glen*, Hugh Henry*, Hugh O’Donnell*
