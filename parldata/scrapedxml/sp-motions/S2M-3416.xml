*S2M-3416 Patrick Harvie: Protect the Human—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Amnesty International’s (AI) new initiative, Protect the Human Week, from 16 to 22 October 2005 which will see schools across Scotland lobby the Home Office to implement key recommendations from AI’s report, Seeking Asylum is not a Crime; notes AI’s concerns regarding the detrimental effects of detention, especially on those who are particularly vulnerable such as elderly people, mentally ill people and torture survivors; notes the growing momentum in the Parliament and Scottish civic society to ensure that the children of asylum-seeking families are treated humanely; calls on the Scottish Executive urgently to conclude negotiations with the Home Office regarding a protocol on the removal of asylum seekers and to ensure that it includes an endorsement of children’s rights as defined in the UN Convention on the Rights Of The Child, and congratulates children and schools across Scotland who participate in the AI campaign in defence of human rights.
