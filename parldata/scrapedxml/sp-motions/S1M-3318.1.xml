 *S1M-3318.1 Mr Brian Monteith: Scotland vs Israel Under 21s Football Match-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3318) in the name of Pauline McNeill, leave out from "expresses" to end and insert "acknowledges the importance that sport plays in building relationships between different cultures and nations all over the world and therefore supports the decision of the Scottish Football Association to arrange a friendly fixture between the Scottish and Israeli under-21 football teams; recalls that Scottish teams have in the past played the Soviet Union, Iran, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Argentina, East Germany and Egypt and many other teams where grounds for political objections existed without so much as a whimper; suggests that politicising Scottish sporting events could leave a Scottish-based Euro 2008 tournament open to political blackmail by other nations just as the 1986 Commonwealth Games was; celebrates the right to peaceful protest outside a sporting fixture as an integral part of any democracy but unreservedly condemns as undemocratic and counterproductive any attempts to stop a sporting event by physical or violent means, and believes that ultimately participation is a matter for the individual conscience of any sportsmen and women involved."
