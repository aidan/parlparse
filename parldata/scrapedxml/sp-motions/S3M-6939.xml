*S3M-6939 Anne McLaughlin: Congratulations to Castlemilk Stress Centre, A Phoenix Risen from the Ashes—That the Parliament recognises the tenacity, passion and sheer determination of the board, the staff, volunteers and service users of the Castlemilk Stress Centre in their fight to save the centre from permanent closure; congratulates them on winning that fight and on the centre’s reopening; acknowledges that the centre has, for 14 years, helped people in the south east of Glasgow deal with mental health and addiction problems; considers that a service like this cannot, as Glasgow City Council was planning to, simply be struck off without consulting local people; further considers that the original decision to close the centre was an entirely flawed decision, and wishes all those involved with the Castlemilk Stress Centre every success for the future. Supported by: Joe FitzPatrick*, Bob Doris*, Bill Aitken*, Bill Kidd*
