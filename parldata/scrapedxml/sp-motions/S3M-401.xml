*S3M-401 Patricia Ferguson: Collapse of a Tenement Property in Maryhillâ€”That the Parliament notes the collapse of a tenement property in the Maryhill constituency and offers its sympathy to those made homeless by this incident; further notes the need to find the cause of such catastrophic structural failure and calls on Glasgow City Council to work with the Health and Safety Executive to establish the cause, and congratulates the emergency services for their response and the staff of Community Central Hall for assisting, once again, those affected by an incident in the area.
