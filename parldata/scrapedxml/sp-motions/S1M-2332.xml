*S1M-2332 Michael Russell: Devolution of Broadcasting-That the Parliament notes the threat to 16,000 media jobs in Scotland caused by a downturn in advertising revenue; recognises that of particular concern arising from this downturn is the call for voluntary redundancies at STV and Grampian by the Scottish Media Group and the possible reductions in regional programming on these stations, despite the fact that the level of such regional programming is set within current broadcasting licences; recalls that legislative responsibility for broadcasting was an original part of the devolution package although later removed at the insistence of New Labour; accepts that the best context for helping broadcasting and the other media in Scotland can only be created by a Scottish Parliament with appropriate powers to do so working in partnership with the media and within a modern European regulatory context; is persuaded that without such powers Scotland will have no ability to influence the development of digital media and developing global structures, and therefore calls upon Her Majesty's Government to legislate to devolve responsibility for broadcasting legislation to the Scottish Parliament at the earliest possible date.
