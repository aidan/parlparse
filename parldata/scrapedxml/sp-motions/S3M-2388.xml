 *S3M-2388 Bob Doris: Congratulations to Councillor Dornan—That the Parliament congratulates Councillor James Dornan on his election to the post of leader of the SNP group on Glasgow City Council; notes that the vacancy was created by the stunning success of the SNP in having former group leader, John Mason, elected as Scotland’s newest Member of the UK Parliament; wishes Councillor Dornan and his team well; is confident that he can lead the group to victory in Glasgow at the next council elections; calls on all council groups in Glasgow City Council to work with the Scottish Government to deliver on the joint concordat commitments; hopes that the ruling Labour group in Glasgow City Council will make a genuine attempt to implement the historic concordat with the Scottish Government, and is confident that the SNP opposition group will keep the pressure on Labour in Glasgow to deliver on a range of commitments including reducing class sizes and kinship care payments, two areas where Glasgow Labour has been too slow and SNP MSPs and councillors have been pushing for action.
