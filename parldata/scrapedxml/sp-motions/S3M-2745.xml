*S3M-2745 Tavish Scott: Lerwick Port Authority Achieves Highest Environmental Certification—That the Parliament notes that Lerwick Port Authority has been awarded an ISO 14001 certificate, the highest environmental standard certificate in the world, in recognition of the efforts that have been made to improve the environmental practices of the operation of the port; further notes that this has been achieved by introduction of new management procedures with built-in environmental benefits, including the monitoring of all fuel and electricity used in port premises and vehicles and the recycling of all waste; recognises that, as the same standards have been achieved by the Peterson SBS oil service base in the port, Lerwick is now the only UK port capable of decommissioning oil and gas rigs while upholding the same environmental standards as the oil industry, and congratulates the port’s management and staff on the efforts they have made in order to reach the high environmental standards that holders of the ISO 14001 certificate have to achieve.
