*S3M-3228 Stuart McMillan: Naming of New Prison—That the Parliament notes the ongoing debate within the community of Bishopbriggs regarding the naming of the new prison; acknowledges the fact that the prison is to be built using public money and not the discredited PPP/PFI scheme, saving the taxpayer millions of pounds; notes that the title HMP Bishopbriggs is described as a working title being used by the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) and that a final name has not yet been decided; calls on the SPS to consider as a matter of urgency the working title of the prison, and recommend that the new establishment be called HMP Low Moss, both as a working title and once it is complete. Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Sandra White*, Bob Doris*, John Wilson*, Ian McKee*, Angela Constance*
