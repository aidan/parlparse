 *S2M-585 Frances Curran: Ghost Ships-That the Parliament supports the stance taken by Hartlepool Council in refusing to allow the break-up of American ghost ships, which contain toxic chemicals, in their community; recognises that these ships contain a massive amount of asbestos, a hazard to any community, and believes that these ships are not in a good condition and should be sent back immediately and not stored in a port over the winter.
