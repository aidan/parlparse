*S3M-182♦ Jim Hume: Microgeneration in the Home—That the Parliament notes the opportunity through building regulations to put Scotland at the forefront of micropower generation; further notes that even one small micropower device in every household would generate 17% of our electricity needs from renewable sources; notes that from 2010 all new buildings, private and public, should have on-site micropower facilities; notes that the example set by Berwickshire Housing Association in developing microgeneration in part of its housing stock demonstrates that the technology is workable in the home; recognises not only the environmental benefits but also the resultant reduction in energy bills for consumers, and considers that the introduction of a new energy efficiency and microgeneration strategy with targets must be taken forward.
