*S3M-495 Bill Kidd: Support for the College of Piping in Glasgow—That the Parliament supports the continuing good work of the College of Piping in Otago Street in Glasgow which, since 1944, has propagated the development and spread of the national instrument of Scotland within this country and across the world; notes that without its influence piping tuition in schools leading to higher exams and university degrees would not have been established; further notes that it has been instrumental in the establishment of the Professional Pipers Association, the Institute of Piping, the College of Piping in Canada and the Piping Centre in Glasgow, and requests that the Scottish Government looks at the provision of support for the development programme of the College of Piping which is presently ongoing.
