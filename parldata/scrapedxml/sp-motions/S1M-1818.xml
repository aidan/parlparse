*S1M-1818 Mr Jack McConnell: Looked After Children and Adoption Servicesâ€”That the Parliament endorses the principles contained in the Adoption and Children Bill concerning restrictions on bringing children into the UK for the purpose of adoption and on advertising children for adoption; agrees that the relevant provisions to achieve these principles in the Bill should be considered by the UK Parliament; recognises the importance of the place of adoption services within the spectrum of care for children and young people looked after by local authorities; agrees that a review of adoption policy and practice is desirable; supports the drive towards more integrated services for the benefits they bring to all children and young people within the care system, and agrees that the Executive should seek to promote the interests of such children with quality educational and other opportunities.
