*S3M-2082 Christine Grahame: Stamp Duty—That the Parliament, in light of increased household and fuel costs and the so-called "credit crunch" with its increasingly devastating effects on house sales in Scotland, itself impacting on small businesses such as removal firms, building trades and many others and blocking the movement of house sales so that first time buyers are effectively barred from the property ladder, considers that a review of Stamp Duty, which has remained constant since 2006, is imperative and that such a review should consider increasing the threshold for the 0% band and, on subsequent bands, making duty payable only incrementally and not on the entire purchase price and that this is one small method of easing the burden on first-time buyers and freeing up the housing market.
