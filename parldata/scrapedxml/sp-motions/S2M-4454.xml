*S2M-4454&lt;&gt; Mr Jamie Stone: Bank Charges—That the Parliament notes the opinion issued by the Office of Fair Trading on 5 April 2006 that default charges from credit card issuers, mortgage providers and banks above the level of £12 are unfair; believes that high charges exacerbate debt and cause distress to Scottish consumers, particularly in rural areas such as the Highlands where it can exacerbate existing problems of income deprivation; commends the campaigns from Scottish student unions to recover charges, and considers that financial services should work towards protecting consumers by providing 14 days’ advance written notice of the issuing of any charge, ensuring that no default charges are set above £12, ending the practice of imposing charges on charges, doing more to promote financial literacy, making the terms of contracts clearer to consumers, investing in Citizens Advice Bureaux and other financial advice services and ensuing that poverty prevention is at the core of their business practice.
