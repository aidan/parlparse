 *S1M-3623.1 Mr Alasdair Morrison: Glasgow to Barra Air Link Public Service Obligationâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-3623) in the name of Mr Duncan Hamilton, leave out from "with concern" to end and insert "the deep concern of the residents of the Island of Barra about the future of the vital air link between the island and Glasgow; recognises the strength of feeling expressed at a public meeting held on the island on Monday 9 December 2002 where the clear view was expressed that any loss of the service would result in damage to the local economy and tourism and create hardship for those attending hospital and receiving life-saving treatment in Glasgow and beyond; considers that the Scottish Executive should conduct its review of the air service with urgency and, following this review, put procedures in place to tender the service for an additional two years, and believes that, once this current contract period ends, the Executive should seek to tender the service for a period of three years in the future, bringing it into line with the provision for Campbeltown and Tiree."
