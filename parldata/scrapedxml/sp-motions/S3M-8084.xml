*S3M-8084 Malcolm Chisholm: Congratulations to Finola Education Trust—That the Parliament recognises Leith teenager, Finola Forman, who has cerebral palsy, has chosen a specialist residential further education course requiring her to travel to Nottingham; congratulates the Finola Education Trust on raising £30,000 towards the second year of the three year course; notes that this brings the trust’s contribution for the first two years to £66,300, in addition to contributions by the City of Edinburgh Council; congratulates Finola on raising £3,500 by selling her own artwork; notes that, as part of Contact a Family Scotland’s Brill-Art exhibition, Finola’s painting of Edinburgh Castle will be on display in the garden lobby on 8, 9 and 10 March 2011; acknowledges the support of many others in promoting the campaign, and regrets that teenagers, such as Finola, have to rely on extensive fundraising to fulfil such choices.
