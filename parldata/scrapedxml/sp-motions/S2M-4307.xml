*S2M-4307 Colin Fox: The Venue—That the Parliament is disappointed that the Edinburgh music club, The Venue, on Calton Road, is to be sold to developers; acknowledges that The Venue has long been a supporter of both signed and unsigned bands and is one of the most famous music clubs in the city; recognises that this is a further erosion of the Capital’s music scene and represents the loss of an important Edinburgh facility in which to see and hear a wide and diverse range of bands; acknowledges that this is indicative of the increased emphasis placed on development to the detriment of popular culture, which is out of keeping in a city with the reputation of Edinburgh, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take a lead in protecting cultural venues from the worst ravages of developers.
