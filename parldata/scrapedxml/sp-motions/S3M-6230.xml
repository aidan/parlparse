 *S3M-6230 Helen Eadie: Abolition of Special Train Fares for Pensioners in Fifeâ€”That the Parliament notes that Fife Council has approved the minutes of its meeting of 11 February 2010 that indicated that councillors agreed to end the provision allowing older people resident in Fife travel to Edinburgh, Dundee and Glasgow by rail for 50p per journey; further expresses concern that the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change, in answer to a question about rail travel on 22 April 2010 (S3O-10179) responded about bus travel and then stated that "inaccurate misrepresentations" had been made on Labour election material in Fife, and calls for the minister to acknowledge the fact that a decision to alter the rail travel concession in Fife was made and that his response to the Parliament on this issue was erroneous and misleading. Supported by: Michael McMahon*, Dr Richard Simpson*, Mary Mulligan*, Jackie Baillie* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
