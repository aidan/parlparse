 *S1M-1238.1 George Lyon: Fuel Duty-As an amendment to motion (S1M-1238) in the name of Mr Kenny MacAskill, leave out from "acknowledges" to end and insert "notes that fuel is a reserved matter to the UK Parliament; recognises that rising fuel prices and haulage costs create particular financial and social difficulties for individuals and businesses, especially for remote, rural and island areas of Scotland, and further recognises that the Liberal Democrats have opposed all fuel duty increases since the introduction of the fuel escalator under the last Conservative government and support (a) a cap on fuel taxes in real terms for five years, (b) investment of additional resources acquired through increased VAT in public transport, (c) the encouragement of fuel-efficient cars by abolishing Vehicle Excise Duty for the most fuel-efficient vehicles and (d) targeted assistance for Scotland's remote, rural and island communities to alleviate the additional fuel price that these areas incur."
