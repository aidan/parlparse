*S3M-149♦ Jim Hume: Food in the Parliament—That the Parliament notes the high quality of food grown and produced in Scotland; notes the nutritional value of quality, local fresh produce and the environmental benefits of reducing transport costs; recognises the huge importance of food production to the rural economy in the south of Scotland and across Scotland; notes that it is vital for small producers to be encouraged to bid for public sector contracts; recognises the importance of effective marketing and branding in ensuring a sustainable future for Scottish producers; notes the success of Bord Bia, Ireland’s food board; considers that Scotland should have its own similar Scottish food and drink promotion and marketing board, and believes that a Scottish Food in the Parliament event, similar to the annual Business in the Parliament event, should be held in the Parliament to showcase Scottish produce and to improve the dialogue between all sections of the food industry and the Parliament.
