 *S3M-7382 Liam McArthur: Kirkwall the UK’s Best Port in Cruise Awards—That the Parliament notes the growing numbers of cruise ships visiting ports in the Highlands and Islands and the important business that it considers they bring to the area; is delighted to note that the attractions of the area have been recognised by Kirkwall being chosen as the Best UK Port of Call in the 2010 Cruise Critic UK awards; believes that this reflects the growing recognition of the multifarious attractions of the Highlands and Islands and, in particular, the special attractions of Orkney, with what it considers its unsurpassed scenery, archaeology, wildlife and welcome; considers that the hard work of all those involved in the Orkney tourist industry and in the development of the harbour in Kirkwall also played a key role in the port’s success, and congratulates them all on what it believes is a well-deserved award.
