 S3M-3222 Liam McArthur: Highlands and Islands Media Awards—That the Parliament notes the announcement of the winners of the Highlands and Islands Media Awards, which rewards journalists and photographers working in the print, broadcast and internet media across the region; believes that the strong competition each year is a reflection of the strength and importance of the local media in the Highlands and Islands, which covers news that the central belt-dominated national press tends to overlook and so plays a vital role in the community; congratulates all the winners and those whose work was highly commended, and particularly congratulates the winners who represent Orkney’s two local papers, Lorraine Shearer of The Orcadian, who won the Jim Love Memorial Trophy for Reporter of the Year, and Ken Amer of Orkney Photographic and Orkney Today, who won the Local Newspaper Photographer of the Year category.
