 *S3M-5575♦ Christine Grahame: Happy 20th Birthday, Radio Borders—That the Parliament recognises the important role of local radio such as Radio Borders, which is celebrating 20 years of broadcasting on Friday 22 January 2010; notes its invaluable role throughout the year in reporting on local issues and acting as an important messaging service, in particular in the recent bad weather, keeping people up to date with the travel and weather situation thanks to the presenters getting into work, and offers best wishes and thanks to all local radio stations but, in particular, Radio Borders.
