 *S2M-4896 Des McNulty: Global Call to Action Against Poverty Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Global Call to Action Against Poverty (GCAP) Scotland on 15 September 2006 as part of the worldwide GCAP alliance; notes that GCAP Scotland is made up of many of the organisations and networks behind the 2005 Make Poverty History campaign; further welcomes the global month of action to "Stand Up Against Poverty" from 14 September to 17 October 2006; notes that, while the 2005 G8 Summit in Gleneagles agreed to cancel most of the debt of 40 poor countries and promised $50 billion more in aid by 2010, significantly more international action is needed to deliver trade justice, full debt relief, more and better aid and to tackle the scourge of HIV and AIDS; notes that millions of people around the world are still united in the fight against global poverty and inequality, and calls on the people of Scotland to show solidarity by taking part in the Stand Up Against Poverty world record attempt on 15 and 16 October 2006.
