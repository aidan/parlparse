*S3M-38♦ Elaine Murray: Town Centre Regeneration—That the Parliament is concerned about the pressing need for regeneration of many of our town centres, including Dumfries, the county town of Dumfries and Galloway; believes that national and local agencies should work together to develop local plans, and further believes that the Scottish Executive should consider enabling the establishment of town centre trusts with legal powers to initiate compulsory purchase orders and also consider setting up a town centre turnaround fund as part of this year’s spending review.
