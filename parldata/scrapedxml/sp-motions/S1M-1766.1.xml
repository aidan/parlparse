*S1M-1766.1 Tommy Sheridan: Inquiry Into Drugs Misuse and Deprived Communities—As an amendment to motion (S1M-1766) in the name of Johann Lamont, insert at end "and welcomes the findings of the Report which, at long last, have conclusively established the clear link between problematic drug use and social deprivation and believes it is particularly encouraging to see that for once the relationship between poverty and social exclusion leading to drug misuse rather than the other way around has been identified; believes that attending to the strategies of regeneration and community planning in disadvantaged areas will benefit these communities far more than the continued reliance on a failed policy of reducing availability; further welcomes the Report’s findings which clearly state that the drugs causing serious problems in communities are heroin, tranquillisers and alcohol; supports the general thrust of the Report which highlights the need to regenerate communities and build decent recreational and sporting facilities which are accessible to all as a first priority in the strategy to tackle problematic drug abuse but also recognises that the Report makes it clear that criminalising drug users has failed as a deterrent and has actually compounded these problems; notes that it is time to recognise that drug use is a health issue and not a criminal justice one and, to this end, recommends that the example of other European countries such as Spain, Italy, Portugal, Belgium, Holland and Switzerland, which have all taken decisions to decriminalise the personal use of cannabis, should be followed; commends the findings of the Report which have established that the use of soft drugs like cannabis is not a serious problem and therefore believes that the licensing of the sale of cannabis would play a major role in breaking the link between the sale of cannabis and heroin in communities; further recognises from the Report that treatment facilities for heroin users are "woefully inadequate" across Scotland and that necessary funds are released to satisfy demand for these services and, while recognising the need for a comprehensive and widely available maintenance programme for recovering heroin addicts, further notes that the Report has failed to investigate the potential of pharmaceutical heroin being prescribed to registered heroin addicts; further recommends that a fact-finding mission be sent to Switzerland to study the results of clinical trials there which have been carried out on over 1,000 existing heroin addicts and where the initial results are even more dramatically successful than the methadone maintenance programme, in terms of stabilising the lives of heroin addicts, reducing crime and stabilising the communities, and recognises that the main thrust of drugs expenditure has to move away from law enforcement, such as the ill-conceived Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency, and into treatment, education and spending so as to alleviate social deprivation.
