*S3M-7568♦ Peter Peacock: Removing the Barriers to Private Sector Investment in Superfast Broadband Infrastructure—That the Parliament notes the restrictions that it considers have been placed on the telecoms industry by Ofcom in relation to access to BT poles and ducts; considers these limitations to be contrary to the UK Government’s commitment to remove barriers to private sector investment in superfast broadband infrastructure; believes that this action will make the Broadband Delivery UK superfast broadband pilot to be carried out in the Highlands and Islands more challenging for any potential competitors to BT, and believes that broadband policy would be better focused on removing barriers rather than imposing restrictions.
