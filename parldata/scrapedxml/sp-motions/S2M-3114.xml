*S2M-3114 Rosie Kane: Support for Native American Tribesâ€”That the Parliament condemns the dam development by PacifiCorp, an American subsidiary of ScottishPower, which has devastated more than 350 miles of historic salmon spawning grounds on the Klamath River in California and Oregon; calls on ScottishPower as the parent company to live up to its environmental responsibilities and scrap the future dam proposals at its annual general meeting on Friday 22 July 2005, and applauds the Karuk, Yurok, Hoopa and Klamath people on their stance and gives unqualified support to their campaign.
