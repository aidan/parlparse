*S3M-4985.1 Robert Brown: Volunteering—As an amendment to motion (S3M-4985) in the name of Johann Lamont, insert at end "considers that young people are a huge pool of untapped talent and potential who are at risk of becoming a lost generation as a result of the current economic downturn; notes that engaging young people in the voluntary sector would provide a valuable resource for the organisations concerned; recognises the pressures put on the voluntary sector by the local government concordat and single outcome agreements, as well as local authorities’ tight financial settlement, and believes that, with proper, structured and sustainable funding from central and local government, the current economic downturn presents an opportunity for a strong and active voluntary sector to play an enhanced role in the delivery of frontline services."
