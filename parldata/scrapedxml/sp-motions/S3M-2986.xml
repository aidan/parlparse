 *S3M-2986 Peter Peacock: Bull Hire Schemeâ€”That the Parliament recognises the enormous benefits brought to cattle quality and cattle health throughout the Highlands and Islands as a result of the Bull Hire Scheme operated by the Crofters Commission over many years; welcomes the potential for improved markets and prices obtained from good-quality, health-certified stock; notes the practical arrangements that the scheme offers to allow good over-wintering provisions and health checks for the bulls, which might otherwise be beyond the reach of many crofters; regards the scheme as a sensible and practical way that government can support small-scale and remotely-located crofting enterprise; notes the widespread concern of cattle-breeding crofters about the proposal to end the scheme, and urges the Scottish Government to reconsider its decision to end the Bull Hire Scheme and commit to retaining a scheme as a sound and practical way of supporting crofters and quality cattle production in some of our most remote Highlands and Islands areas.
