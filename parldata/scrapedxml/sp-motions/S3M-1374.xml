*S3M-1374 Tavish Scott: 20th Anniversary of Da Voar Redd Up—That the Parliament notes that Da Voar Redd Up, Shetland’s groundbreaking community-based environmental clean-up project, continues, after 20 years of operation, to provide Shetland’s environment with an annual spring clean; further notes that, while 20 tonnes of rubbish were collected from Shetland’s beaches, roadsides and other public spaces in 1988, 50 tonnes were collected last year by some 4,000 volunteers; believes that Da Voar Redd Up is an excellent example of a well-supported community project, involving a wide range of individuals, families, youth groups, sports clubs, hall committees, schools, church groups, boating clubs and many other community groups, and sends its congratulations to all those involved in the event over the last 20 years, who have collected more than 1,000 tonnes of rubbish, and its best wishes to all those who plan to take part in the 21st Voar Redd Up later this spring.
