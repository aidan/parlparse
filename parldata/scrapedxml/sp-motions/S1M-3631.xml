*S1M-3631# Ms Sandra White: Glasgow City Council's Withdrawal of Bulk Refuse Uplift Serviceâ€”That the Parliament notes with deep concern the decision by Glasgow City Council to withdraw its bulk refuse uplift service from back court areas of property managed by housing associations and housing co-operatives and to only uplift bulk items when housing associations agree to purchase back court cleaning services from the council; further notes that this decision was imposed despite representations that the decision be deferred until the end of the current financial year and that the new arrangement to leave bulk refuse on the pavement on specific days for collection is a recipe for disaster, with the consequence that bulk refuse is now accumulating in back court areas, constituting a nuisance, danger and environmental hazard to residents and property, and considers that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the council that it should, as a matter of urgency, come to an agreement with housing associations to restore the bulk refuse uplift service.
