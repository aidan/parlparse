*S1M-2547 Mr Brian Monteith: Physical Education in Primary Schools—That the Parliament welcomes the HM Inspectorate of Education report on improving standards of physical education in primary schools in Scotland; notes that the report states that schools with very good programmes often used flexible curriculum time to ensure a minimum of two physical education (PE) sessions of around 40 minutes weekly for pupils, provide broad and balanced programmes which include games, sports, gymnastics, dance and swimming and that the programmes in these schools often extend beyond the school day; compares this with provision at independent schools where PE is often given more time, regular input from specialist PE teachers and additional extracurricular opportunities are provided, and believes that the provision of more specialist PE teachers providing education in individual and team sports, dance and games would increase the number of schools achieving HM Inspectorate of Education’s ‘very good’ status and lead to improvements in the health and well-being of Scotland’s children.
