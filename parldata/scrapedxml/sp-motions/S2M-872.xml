*S2M-872 Christine Grahame: Homelessness in East Lothian—That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the Pathfinder Inspection Report in January 2004 regarding the performance of East Lothian Council in its functions as a social landlord, particularly in relation to its homelessness obligations; further notes the indictment of services delivered to homeless people, that the council (a) operates a quota system for the allocation of re-lets to homeless people so that only one in four is so allocated, resulting in a high number of households being placed in bed and breakfast accommodation for "significant periods of time", (b) is failing to offer any accommodation to a small number of households to whom it owes a statutory duty, and (c) could not provide inspectors with reliable figures on the provision of permanent accommodation for homeless people; recognises that the report recommends, inter alia that the council (a) provides access to suitable temporary accommodation for all homeless people to whom it has a duty, (b) must publish a policy setting out its rules for allocating houses to homeless people to whom it has a duty and ensure that that policy complies with statutory requirements, and (c) should ensure that homeless applicants are always referred to an appropriate officer for assessment and that any discussion of an applicant’s circumstances is appropriate, adequate and is conducted in private; further notes that the report found "a general lack of enthusiasm on the part of the council to consider any change to its current approach to the allocation of permanent accommodation to homeless people", and calls on the Scottish Executive, as a matter of some urgency, to take appropriate steps to ensure that the council complies with its statutory obligations in the interests of the vulnerable homeless people in East Lothian.
