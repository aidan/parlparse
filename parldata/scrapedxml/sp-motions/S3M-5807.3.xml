*S3M-5807.3 Liam McArthur: Brian Pack Inquiry - Single Farm Paymentâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-5807) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end "; notes concerns over the possible removal of funding from active farmers and crofters; recognises, however, that the report makes a strong case for the ongoing direct support of agriculture and food production and therefore believes that the overall level of Single Farm Payment funding should be maintained, and opposes any reduction in agricultural spending through the CAP."
