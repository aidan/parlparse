 * S2M-2673 Dr Jean Turner: Europe’s Obesity Epidemic—That the Parliament welcomes the research conducted by the International Obesity Task Force which has prompted the European Commission to pledge joint action through the European Platform for Action on Diet and Physical Activity with the food industry, health experts and consumer groups to tackle Europe’s “obesity epidemic” and notes that more than 200 million adults across Europe may be overweight or obese, with a rapid rise amongst children, that obesity can cause many serious illnesses including respiratory disease, arthritis, heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes and certain types of cancer, that it is estimated that obesity accounts for between 2 and 8% of healthcare costs; that obesity is rising at the rate of 1% per annum in the United Kingdom and that a small reduction in weight loss of 10lbs can reduce risk of type 2 Diabetes by up to 30%.
