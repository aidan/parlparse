*S1M-3835 Ms Wendy Alexander: Hillington Park Innovation Centre-That the Parliament applauds the contribution Hillington Park Innovation Centre (HPIC) is making in supporting new companies with significant growth potential to establish themselves, take root and diversify the Renfrewshire economy, increasing the potential for indigenous small and medium enterprise growth; believes that, since Scottish Enterprise Renfrewshire supported the establishment of HPIC in 2000, the centre's high-quality building and infrastructure have been helping secure Renfrewshire's attraction to businesses seeking a strong, supportive and entrepreneurial environment supported by an on-site innovation team providing business development support; congratulates those responsible for a £16 million rise in turnover and an employment level of 240 people created by 36 tenants occupying over 80% of the lettable space with further employment opportunities anticipated; supports HPIC's development of good relationships internationally and with the University of Paisley and other universities, resulting in the award of a Department of Trade and Industry Internet Incubator Fund project, "UNISP", which has so far provided support to five new e-commerce-related businesses coming out of universities; notes that HPIC is a recipient of the prestigious Scottish Property award for innovation, and would like to add its own recognition to this exciting enterprise.
