*S2M-5165 Tommy Sheridan: World Support for Cuba—That the Parliament notes last week’s United Nations General Assembly vote, by 183 votes to 4 with one abstention, to urge the United States of America to end its 45-year-old trade blockade against Cuba; further notes that last week’s vote represents the 15th year in a row that the UN General Assembly has voted against the US trade blockade and that this year’s vote was a one vote improvement on last year and was secured after the Cuban Foreign Minister, Felipe Perez Roque, addressed the assembly in the following terms: “The economic war unleashed by the US against Cuba, the longest and cruellest ever known, qualifies as an act of genocide and constitutes a flagrant violation of international law and the Charter of the United Nations”; concurs fully with Felipe Perez Roque’s remarks; condemns the US for continuing to ignore the will of the world, as expressed via the UN General Assembly, and adds its support to the world’s call for economic justice for Cuba and an end to the illegal blockade by the US.
