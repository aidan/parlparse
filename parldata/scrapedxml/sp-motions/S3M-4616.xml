*S3M-4616 Bob Doris: Help for Heroes World Record Attempt—That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in the Help for Heroes fundraising initiative on Saturday 25 July through to Monday 27 July 2009, which is being hosted by the High Access Rescue Team (HART), a charity based in Springburn, Glasgow; believes that Help for Heroes makes a significant contribution to our ex-servicemen and women who risk so much for us in the line of duty, and notes that the event will see teams from the Royal Air Force, the British Army and the police, fire rescue, ambulance and coastguard services attempt a world record in abseiling, with teams climbing 45 metres on a tower crane’s vertical ladder, walking 45 metres on the crane’s horizontal jib and then abseiling 45 metres back to the ground so that, at the end of the event, the various teams will have completed the equivalent of walking, climbing and abseiling the height of Mount Everest and that, with a total of approximately 1,680 abseils, there will be an attempt to break the current record for the longest continuous abseil and raise funds of up to a million pounds for Help for Heroes.
