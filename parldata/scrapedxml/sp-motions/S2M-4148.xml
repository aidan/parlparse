*S2M-4148 Mr Adam Ingram: In the Footsteps of Robert the Bruce—That the Parliament notes and commends the efforts to establish a heritage trail in memory of Robert the Bruce, King of Scots, whose remarkable and historic victory over a superior English force at Bannockburn reinstated Scottish national independence; notes that Bruce’s struggle against the "chains and slavery" of English domination was a defining mark in the history of Scotland; notes that 700 years after he came to power the desire of Scots to be once again free remains unabated amongst those of us who appreciate the real value of liberty and freedom; notes that the Ayrshire-born Bruce had many challenges and obstacles on the road to delivering independence for Scotland but that his commitment to our nation and his leadership of the Scots lie in stark contrast to the pinstriped political leadership Scotland has today, and calls on the Scottish Executive to back the proposed heritage trail and remember the man whose vision, charisma and military prowess led our nation to independence.
