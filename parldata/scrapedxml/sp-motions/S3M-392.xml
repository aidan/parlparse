*S3M-392# Rob Gibson: International Recognition for Scottish Island Writers—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish island writers who attended the ninth international book festival of island writers held on Ouessant island in Brittany from 22 to 26 August 2007; celebrates the 11 writers from Shetland, Fair Isle, Orkney, Lewis, Skye and Raasay whose work in Shetlandic, Gaelic and English provided the focus for this year’s event; in particular welcomes the prize won by the poetry of Christine de Luca whose volume, Parallel Worlds, in Shetlandic dialect, has been translated into French; believes that works of excellence from our Scottish island authors should feature in future Scottish book festivals, and considers that appropriate support and encouragement should be given to nurture this internationally recognised talent and the translation of Scottish literature into other tongues. Supported by: Sandra White*, Kenneth Gibson*, Keith Brown*, Bill Wilson*, Bill Kidd*, Tavish Scott*, Jamie Stone*, Christine Grahame*, Dave Thompson*
