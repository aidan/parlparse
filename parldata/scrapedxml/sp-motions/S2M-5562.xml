*S2M-5562 Tommy Sheridan: Widespread Support for Airgun Ban—That the Parliament notes that the result of a recent System Three opinion poll indicated that 82% of Scottish citizens would support a ban on airguns and that only 8% are opposed to such a ban; further notes that the support for such a ban is highest, at 85%, among both the oldest and youngest sections of Scots; believes that this widespread support for an airgun ban should result in support for the member’s bill proposal to ban air guns in the name of Tommy Sheridan or in the Scottish Executive agreeing to take over the proposal and deliver such a ban, and also notes the recent comments of senior sheriff, Richard Davidson, who said in Dundee Sheriff Court in relation to a woman found guilty of misusing an airgun, "It is simply intolerable for anyone to be walking around the streets of this city, or indeed any city, with such a dangerous weapon and to be prepared to use it in the manner in which she did. What I don’t understand is what our legislators are thinking about in permitting such an item to be available over the counter without requiring a firearms certificate".
