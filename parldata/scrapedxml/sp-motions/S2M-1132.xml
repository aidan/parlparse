*S2M-1132 Nora Radcliffe: Chardon LL Maize-That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by Bayer Crop Science that it will not attempt to grow Chardon LL GM maize in the UK commercially; notes that this is the result of the tough, restrictive regime supported by the Scottish Executive; believes that this announcement fully justifies the precautionary approach, based on scientific evidence, that the Executive has taken; further believes that calls for an illegal blanket ban on GM could have been challenged in the courts and led to court approval for commercial planting of a GM crop, and calls on the Executive to continue to deliver more sustainable agriculture, promoting organic farming, consumer choice and quality Scottish produce. Supported by: George Lyon*, Robert Brown*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Margaret Smith*, Iain Smith*, Sarah Boyack*
