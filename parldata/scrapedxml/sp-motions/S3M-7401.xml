*S3M-7401 Margaret Mitchell: Circle Lanarkshire’s Addiewell Project—That the Parliament congratulates Circle Lanarkshire on its HMP Addiewell Project, which supports offenders through their transition from prison back into the community, working to reduce the possibility of reoffending and to strengthen the relationships between offenders and their families, in particular their children; acknowledges that the project helps offenders access other services such as counselling, drug agencies, employment and education; considers that Circle Lanarkshire’s workers provide extensive and flexible support both inside prison and in the community and commends them on their efforts; notes the contribution of the Robertson Trust and Kalyx to the project, which has now completed its first year, and hopes that the project will continue to help those offenders in HMP Addiewell and inspire the development of other throughcare projects.
