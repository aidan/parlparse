*S3M-7427.2 David McLetchie: AV Referendum and 2011 Scottish Parliament Election Clash—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7427) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from first "with" to end and insert "that holding a referendum on voting reform for UK Parliament elections on the same day as elections to the Scottish Parliament and other devolved institutions in May 2011 will save the taxpayer £17 million and commends Her Majesty’s Government for its wise stewardship of public finances in this respect."
