*S3M-6951 Irene Oldfather: World Alzheimer’s Day, 21 September 2010—That the Parliament expresses support for World Alzheimer’s Day, Tuesday 21 September 2010; notes that the theme for this year’s event is "Dementia. It’s time for action!", which seeks to focus on the need for governments and the general public to take any action that they can to raise awareness of dementia and improve service provision for people with dementia and their carers; recognises the efforts of charity groups to raise awareness of the need to support the estimated 30 million people who have dementia around the world; further notes that this year’s World Alzheimer’s Day lecture, held by Alzheimer Scotland, will focus on the challenges that hospitals represent for patients with dementiaandwill seek to identify a model of good practice for dementia care in the general hospital environment and considers that the National Dementia Strategy can play a vital role in improving general hospital care but requires to be appropriately resourced and monitored in order to be effective, and believes that a better understanding of dementia as an illness can reduce the misunderstandings and stigma that exist about the condition and work toward promoting the highest standards of health and community care, both in Scotland and elsewhere in the world.
