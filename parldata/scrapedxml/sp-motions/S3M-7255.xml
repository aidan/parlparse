 *S3M-7255♦ Elaine Murray: Launch of A76 Five Point Action Plan—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the A76 Dumfries to Kilmarnock trunk road five point action plan on 19 November 2010; considers the improvement of the A76 to be essential for the economic regeneration of the corridor from Dumfries to Kilmarnock as it will enhance job opportunities and economic growth in the former coalfield regeneration area; notes that the accident rate on rural sections of the A76 is nearly 50% above the national rate for this type of road and believes that improvements to the road are necessary to improve road safety and regrets therefore the decision not to proceed with the Ellisland improvement scheme, and congratulates Dumfries and Galloway Council, East Ayrshire Council, Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary, Strathclyde Police and the South West and Strathclyde Regional Transport Partnerships for working in partnership to produce the five point plan and to promote its implementation.
