*S3M-946.3 Malcolm Chisholm: St Andrew’s Day—As an amendment to motion (S3M-946) in the name of Linda Fabiani, insert at end "and, recognising that St Andrew’s Day is the start of Scotland’s Winter Festival which includes Christmas Day and New Year’s Day and concludes on Burns Night, looks forward to the success of all components of the Winter Festival starting with the events on St Andrew’s Day, and in this context regrets that the Scottish Government has overturned the decision of the previous Parliament to commission a study into the impact of a ban on large retailers trading on New Year’s Day."
