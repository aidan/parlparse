*S3M-5281 Dr Richard Simpson: Congratulations to Alloa Community Enterprises—That the Parliament congratulates Alloa Community Enterprises (ACE) on its recent success on being named Large Best Scottish Social Enterprise in the Social Enterprise Coalition Awards in recognition of its continuing hard work in the community and success in recycling; considers that the success of ACE has been built on a strong partnership with local authorities and businesses and has provided jobs for the local community in Clackmannanshire; believes that ACE’s activities have, in large part, led to Clackmannanshire Council remaining at the top of the table for best recycling rates in Scotland; wishes the company well for the future and hopes that its achievements will be recognised in the UK final of the Social Enterprise Coalition Awards, to be held in London on 3 December 2009, and further hopes that the company will continue to lead the way in environmental awareness and supporting the social needs of the local community as a business that other companies can aspire to.
