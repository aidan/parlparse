*S3M-6662 Robin Harper: Ship-to-Ship Transferâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the Merchant Shipping (Ship-to-Ship Transfers) Regulations 2010 laid before the UK Parliament in April 2010; warmly welcomes the completion of a regulatory framework for transfers building on measures taken by the Scottish Parliament in response to proposals for cargo transfers in the Firth of Forth that were supported by all parties; supports the principle that transfer operations should be permitted only in harbours that have been licensed by ministers as safe; believes that the new regulations are necessary in order to meet the requirements of international environmental law; is concerned at lobbying by the shipping industry to annul these regulations, and urges UK ministers to ignore these efforts in favour of defending our coastal environment and communities.
