*S3M-6338 Irene Oldfather: Dementia Awareness Week 2010—That the Parliament acknowledges that Dementia Awareness Week 2010 takes place from 7 June to 13 June; notes that Alzheimer Scotland estimates that there are currently 71,000 people in Scotland with dementia; further notes the prediction that the number of people with dementia is set to double over the next 25 years; acknowledges that, since Dementia Awareness Week 2009, the Scottish Parliament’s Cross-party Group on Alzheimer’s produced a Charter of Rights for People with Dementia and their Carers to ensure that individuals and their families have a clear set of rights from diagnosis through to end of life; believes that a fundamental culture change in care services, community support and hospital care is required if Scotland is to be adequately prepared for this increase in the number of people with dementia, and therefore welcomes the publication of the Alzheimer Scotland manifesto, which calls for a £15 million change fund to assist local authorities and NHS boards to unlock and redirect resources into early intervention and personalised support for people with dementia and their carers.
