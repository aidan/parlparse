 *S1M-3210# Cathie Craigie: Causing Death by Dangerous Driving—That the Parliament notes the publication of the report by the Transport Research Laboratory, Road Safety Research Report No.26, Dangerous Driving and the Law, which examines the use and application of the law on careless and dangerous driving throughout the UK; supports the report where it states that in Scotland a "clearer message regarding the seriousness of these offences would be sent to both defendant and society if all causing death by dangerous driving cases were tried in the High Court" rather than sheriff courts, and considers that the Scottish Executive should (a) commission specific Scottish research in this area to take on board the report’s conclusions and recommendations and (b) take the necessary steps to ensure that dangerous driving offences are heard in the appropriate court and not downgraded.
