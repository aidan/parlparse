*S2M-514# Mr Brian Monteith: Call for Public Local Inquiry into Park of Keir Planning Application-That the Parliament notes that Stirling Council has granted permission to a planning application to build a golf course and hotel at Park of Keir on greenbelt land between Dunblane and Bridge of Allan, contrary to the existing development plan, and as such the application will now go before Scottish ministers, and believes that there is sufficient public concern and confusion over the decision-making process in this particular case to warrant the holding of a public local inquiry by the Executive's Reporter so that future decisions on the merits of this application are seen to be open and transparent and so that confidence in the planning process can be restored.
