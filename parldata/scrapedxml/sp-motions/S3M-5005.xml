 *S3M-5005♦ Johann Lamont: International Credit Union Day—That the Parliament recognises International Credit Union Day, taking place on 15 October 2009; congratulates Scotland’s credit unions for their continued growth; recognises the important role that credit unions play in tackling financial exclusion in the Pollok constituency, across Glasgow and throughout Scotland, serving 250,000 members with £200 million in savings and lending £170 million; notes the potential for credit unions to serve even more of the population with a full range of financial services; encourages support for more credit unions to offer new services such as current accounts, and believes that, as trusted co-operative enterprises, credit unions can play a valuable role in the future of Scotland’s financial services industry.
