*S3M-7811♦ Christine Grahame: Gatepost—That the Parliament recognises and values the work of Gatepost, the Scottish Farming Charity, which offers a confidential listening and support service for the farming and land-based community in Scotland; considers that life in farming, crofting and related industries can be very stressful and isolated with long hours and pressures that are hard to escape as work and home life are often intermingled; notes that the helpline is operated by trained staff who have a good understanding of these particular pressures, and congratulates Dr Maurice Hankey of Lauder on the recognition of his commitment to this service by the Scottish Countryside Alliance at its recent awards ceremony.
