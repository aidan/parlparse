 *S1M-1626.1 Linda Fabiani: Local Authority Housing Capital Debt—As an amendment to motion (S1M-1626) in the name of Tommy Sheridan, leave out from "also" to end and insert "notes that the imposition of the capital receipt set aside rules is only one example of the attack on public investment in housing that began under the Conservatives and has been continued by the present UK Government and Scottish Executive; regrets that the Labour Government and this Labour/Liberal administration have continued this Conservative policy, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to rescind the capital receipt set aside rules with immediate effect and so inject much needed funding into Scotland’s public sector housing." Supported by: Fiona Hyslop*, Mr Kenneth Gibson*
