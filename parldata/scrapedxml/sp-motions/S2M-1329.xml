*S2M-1329# Iain Smith: Affordable Housing in North-east Fife-That the Parliament notes with concern the shortage of affordable housing for rent or sale in many communities in north-east Fife; recognises that this is due to many factors including the decline in the amount of public sector rented accommodation, the popularity of many communities as retirement and holiday locations and, in the case of St Andrews, the accommodation needs of the growing student population; expresses its concern about the difficulties faced by many people in trying to obtain affordable accommodation in their own communities and the pressures on rural services such as schools, and considers that Fife Council, Communities Scotland and the Scottish Executive should develop an effective housing plan for north-east Fife that addresses these concerns to ensure viable, vibrant and sustainable communities throughout north-east Fife.
