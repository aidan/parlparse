*S1M-3314 Dr Sylvia Jackson: Ordnance Survey - Education Initiative-That the Parliament notes Ordnance Survey's new education initiative which will provide around 50,000 primary 7 pupils in 1,500 Scottish schools with a map of their local area, along with explanatory leaflets, homework help and direct educational support; recognises that these maps can assist students in a number of subjects, including geography, environmental studies, local history and citizenship, helping children to understand and interpret the environment in which they live, and congratulates Ordnance Survey for the success of the initiative and their commitment to education.
