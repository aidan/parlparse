 *S3M-2027 Irene Oldfather: North Ayrshire Carers Centre - 10th Anniversary—That the Parliament welcomes members of the North Ayrshire Carers Centre to the Parliament on 5 June 2008; recognises that it has been 10 years since the centre opened and began to deliver high-quality support and advice for carers throughout North Ayrshire; notes that an estimated one-in-five people give up employment in order to care for a loved one and that Carers Scotland estimates that carers save the country £5 billion a year, yet three-out-of-four carers say that their health has worsened since becoming a carer; therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to guarantee that that the health of carers in Scotland is made a priority and to ensure that carers are fully aware of their rights and are given the opportunity to continue working if they so wish; commends the hard work and dedication of staff at North Ayrshire Carers Centre, and looks forward to another successful 10 years.
