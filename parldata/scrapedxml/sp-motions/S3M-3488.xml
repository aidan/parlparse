*S3M-3488 Liam McArthur: Ken Rundle, Winner of the Inaugural NFU Scotland Ambassador Awardâ€”That the Parliament notes the important role that Ken Rundle has played in Scottish agriculture, both as a journalist for the BBC and as head of communications at the Scottish Agricultural College; recognises that, for over two decades, he has championed the Scottish agricultural industry, working tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure that farming stories were not forgotten by the general public while, at the same time, ensuring that even the difficult stories were covered with fairness and integrity; believes therefore that he is a worthy winner of the inaugural NFU Scotland Ambassador Award, and offers him congratulations for winning the award.
