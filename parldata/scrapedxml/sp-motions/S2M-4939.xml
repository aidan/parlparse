 *S2M-4939 Frances Curran: Adult Obesity Highest in Europe—That the Parliament notes that, according to government data released on 10 October 2006, some 24% of people in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are obese, compared with 8% in Italy, 9% in France and about 12% in Ireland, Germany and Spain; is concerned that obesity costs the NHS about £170 million per annum and that a "north-south divide" persists with regard to obesity; believes that the Campaign For Free School Meals and the encouragement of better diets in general play a vital part in combating obesity, and further believes that less talk and more action by the Scottish Executive is needed to reduce the obesity statistics in Scotland.
