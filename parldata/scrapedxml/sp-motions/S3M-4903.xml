*S3M-4903 Stewart Maxwell: Smoking Bans Cut Heart Attacks—That the Parliament is pleased to note that studies suggest that heart attacks are cut by almost one third by smoking bans; also notes the findings that this "heart gain" is much greater than earlier studies have suggested and that heart attack rates drop for three years following smoking bans, going from a 17% drop in the first year to 36% after three years; is pleased that Scottish figures bear this study out, with a 17% drop in heart attacks in the 12 months after the smoking ban was implemented, and is delighted that the cumulative effects of the 2006 smoking ban are still being felt. Supported by: Stuart McMillan*, Alasdair Allan*, Aileen Campbell*, Brian Adam*, Bill Kidd*, Ken Macintosh*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Kenneth Gibson*, Rob Gibson*, Robert Brown*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Christine Grahame*, Anne McLaughlin*
