*S2M-1340.1 Fiona Hyslop: Skills and Continued Learning-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1340) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, leave out from "supports" to end and insert "regrets the absence of a national skills and lifelong learning strategy from the Scottish Executive as part of the Smart, Successful Scotland policy; recognises the contribution of the Scottish Union Learning Fund, the Scottish Credit and Qualifications Framework, the Determined to Succeed programme and the Modern Apprenticeship programme, but notes that these individual elements by themselves will not deliver the appropriate skills and continued learning requirements for Scotland in the 21st century."
