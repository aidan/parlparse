*S1M-2647 Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Rail Link to Edinburgh Airport-That the Parliament notes that the Strategic Rail Authority's 10-year plan includes a study into potential improvements in rail access to Scottish airports and that in Edinburgh options range from a new airport station on the nearby main rail route, with a shuttle into the airport, to a new tunnelled main line and station under the heart of the airport; further notes that either station could provide for further integration and stimulate economic activity, and, in the light of the recent decision by Her Majesty's Government to place Railtrack into administration which has cast considerable doubt and uncertainty on the willingness of the private sector to fund such investment, calls upon the Scottish Executive to outline how such a link could be financed in the best interests of Edinburgh and Scotland.
