 *S2M-4696 Ms Wendy Alexander: University of Paisley—That the Parliament notes that the University of Paisley is holding a consultation exercise on the future name of the institution; further notes that Paisley is Scotland’s largest town and has given the university its original existence and identity; acknowledges that other established universities have been able to expand and open up new campuses in other parts of the country without sacrificing their names; also acknowledges that the University of Paisley is already very successful in attracting students not only from other parts of the United Kingdom but also from overseas, particularly the Far East, and believes that the university can build on its reputation and strengths gained over the years as the University of Paisley and that a change of name would be a mistake for the university and Paisley.
