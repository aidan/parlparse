 *S3M-5699 Robin Harper: Sir John Dankworth—That the Parliament notes with sadness the death of Sir John Dankworth; recognises his huge contribution to jazz, arguably as Britain’s leading exponent of the art of modern jazz; expresses sympathy to his wife Cleo Laine, his children, Alec and Jacqui, and his friends, and shares the sentiments of modern jazz musician Jamie Cullum who called him a genius and said "Sir John Dankworth - a great man and one of our finest musicians and composers has died. Rest in peace, sir".
