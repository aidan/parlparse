*S3M-6276 Dr Richard Simpson: Smoking in Films for Under-18s—That the Parliament notes the research published in Volume 65, Issue 4 of the British Medical Journal publication, Thorax, which states that children and young people watching films in the United Kingdom are still exposed to frequent and at times specifically branded tobacco imagery; expresses disappointment that 92% of films containing a depiction of tobacco use or smoking of at least five minutes, a tobacco interval, were rated as suitable for those under 18, with 61% classified as suitable for under-15s; notes that the researchers state that smoking in films is a potent driver of youth and adult smoking, and calls for the British Board of Film Classification to take smoking into account for films targeted at young people.
