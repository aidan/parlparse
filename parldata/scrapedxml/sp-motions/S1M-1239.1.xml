*S1M-1239.1 Mr Keith Harding: Proportional Representation in Local Government-As an amendment to motion (S1M-1239) in the name of Mr Kenneth Gibson, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "resolves that no alteration to the voting system for local authority elections should be considered until after the publication of the report of the Ministerial Task Group being chaired by the First Minister; agrees that this report, together with the McIntosh and Kerley recommendations, should be debated as a whole, and, in view of the limited timescale, resolves that the next local authority elections should take place on the basis of the existing first-past-the-post electoral system which delivers accountability, a clear link between elected member and voter and puts the power to create administrations in the hands of voters rather than politicians.
