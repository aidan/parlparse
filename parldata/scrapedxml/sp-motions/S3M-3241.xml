*S3M-3241 Cathie Craigie: Value of Local Newspapersâ€”That the Parliament recognises the value of local newspapers, the important role that they play in the community in delivering local news and the benefits that they bring to the local economy; is extremely concerned about the proposal of Johnston Press to close the long-established office of the Kilsyth Chronicle, and believes that this will severely restrict the ability of people living in Kilsyth and the surrounding villages to engage with the paper and will cause a significant reduction in advertising revenue from the Kilsyth area, placing the future viability of the Kilsyth Chronicle as an independent publication, a paper that has been published since 1890, at risk.
