*S1M-868 Iain Gray: Community Care—That the Parliament commends the Executive’s approach to community care, which aims to put the people using services and their carers at the centre, building on Modernising Community Care: an Action Plan; welcomes progress on the Strategy for Carers in Scotland, published in November; welcomes the work of the National Care Standards Committee to ensure the quality of care provision through national standards; welcomes the consultation on proposals for the independent regulation of care services and staff; welcomes the setting up of the Joint Future Group in December; welcomes the publication of the Learning Disability Review report The same as you? on 11 May 2000, and calls upon the NHS, local authorities and the voluntary and private sectors to make joint working a reality in every aspect of community care, in a Scotland where everyone matters.
