 *S3M-85♦ Hugh O’Donnell: Water Rates and Charitable Organisations—That the Parliament notes the likely impact of water rates on charitable organisations across central Scotland, such as Kildrum Parish Church and the British Heart Foundation in Cumbernauld, once the present rate exemption scheme ends in 2010; acknowledges that a wide range of voluntary and church-based organisations in central Scotland and nationwide have enjoyed rate relief on water and sewerage charges for activities on their premises, and considers that the excellent work done by charities in communities all across Scotland should be recognised and that the long-term future of the many organisations that would be burdened with water and sewerage rates should be supported and safeguarded by the exemption period being extended beyond 2010.
