*S3M-3871 Richard Baker: Grampian Police Knife Amnesty Successâ€”That the Parliament notes the success of the recent knife amnesty held by Grampian Police over the last nine months, during which more than 1,000 knives and other weapons were anonymously handed in to police; congratulates Grampian Police for its proactive approach and success in taking knives off the streets of Aberdeen; believes that the number of knives handed in during a knife amnesty is likely to represent only a fraction of those that are being carried; agrees that these figures are a stark reminder that knife carrying is not just a west coast or a central belt problem but a problem that affects every part of Scotland; believes that one knife on the streets of Scotland is one knife too many; notes that the last Scotland-wide knife amnesty was held under the previous administration, between May and June 2006, during which a total of 12,642 knives were taken off the streets, and calls on the Scottish Government to hold a properly resourced high-profile Scotland-wide knife amnesty to help rid the streets of knives.
