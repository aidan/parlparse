*S3M-1141 Helen Eadie: SNP/Lib-Dems’ Shopping Charges Hit the Most Frail and Vulnerable People—That the Parliament deplores the fact that the weakest and most vulnerable people in Fife have been compelled by Fife Council to face charges of £7 per trip for their shopping to be done and regrets that it is the vulnerable, the voiceless and the most frail victims of Fife who are having to balance the books of the new SNP/Liberal Democrat-controlled Fife Council, against a background that on the day a budget was agreed by Fife Council early in 2006 the SNP proposed a budget of £1 million less than the previous Labour administration.
