*S3M-1522 Aileen Campbell: Biggar - Scotland’s Third Transition Town—That the Parliament congratulates Biggar on becoming Scotland’s third official "transition town", joining Portobello and Dunbar; notes that the "transition town" network of towns, cities and islands across the world have recognised the urgent need to prepare for and mitigate the impact of peak oil and climate change in the near future; welcomes the community-based nature of the movement; believes that transition towns provide an important model for the approach of wider society to climate change, and encourages as many towns and communities in Scotland as possible to consider adopting the transition town approach.
