*S3M-6169.2 Lewis Macdonald: Transmission Chargingâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-6169) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from "opposes" to end and insert "recognises the importance of the British Electricity Trading and Transmission Arrangements in balancing supply and demand across the electricity networks and in supporting future energy development; acknowledges that the current charging regimes provide some advantages to Scottish consumers as well as some disadvantages to Scottish generators; recognises that Scottish and UK targets for reducing carbon emissions are likely to increase demand on the electricity networks, requiring significant new investments and changes to these charging regimes; welcomes the current review of transmission charges for intermittent renewable generation, which could lead to significant savings for wind generators in Scotland, and calls for a wider review of network charging regimes to support low-carbon electricity generation while protecting the interests of consumers."
