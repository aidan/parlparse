 *S3M-5353 Robert Brown: Success of Scottish Scouting—That the Parliament congratulates the Scout movement on another successful year in delivering an exciting and adventurous programme to young people in almost 600 local Scout groups across Scotland; commends the dedication and hard work of the volunteers who support the movement; is greatly encouraged by the increase in membership numbers for a third consecutive year, including a 12% rise in female youth members, and believes that, with almost 37,000 members across the country, Scottish Scouting makes a huge contribution not only to the young people involved but also to communities around Scotland as a whole.
