 *S3M-5353 Robert Brown: Success of Scottish Scoutingâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the Scout movement on another successful year in delivering an exciting and adventurous programme to young people in almost 600 local Scout groups across Scotland; commends the dedication and hard work of the volunteers who support the movement; is greatly encouraged by the increase in membership numbers for a third consecutive year, including a 12% rise in female youth members, and believes that, with almost 37,000 members across the country, Scottish Scouting makes a huge contribution not only to the young people involved but also to communities around Scotland as a whole.
