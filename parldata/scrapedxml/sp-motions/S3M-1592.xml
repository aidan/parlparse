*S3M-1592 George Foulkes: Standing Up for Edinburgh’s Youngest and Poorest—That the Parliament expresses considerable concern at the decision of the SNP/Liberal Democrat-led City of Edinburgh Council to cut £300,000 from the Edinburgh Leisure budget, resulting in all but two crèches at city leisure facilities closing; believes that the provision of crèches is vital for some families with more than one child to enjoy council leisure facilities; considers that crèches provide a vital role in improving and promoting the health of young parents and are particularly important to mothers suffering from post-natal depression, and further believes that these cuts to crèche facilities, combined with earlier cuts to full-time nursery places, cuts in hours of care in part-time nursery places, cuts to Sure Start funding in Edinburgh totalling £966,000, cuts of £850,000 to Community Learning and Development funds and substantial cuts to grants for local voluntary groups and organisations, including £357,000 being removed from the council’s previously acclaimed Youth Services, demonstrates that the youngest and poorest people across the city of Edinburgh are suffering at the hands of the SNP in power.
