*S2M-762.2 Nicola Sturgeon: Delivering a Quick, Effective Youth Justice System-As an amendment to motion (S2M-762) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from "acknowledges" to end and insert "however notes with concern the contents of the Audit Scotland report, Dealing with Offending by Young People, published in November 2003, that too many children placed on supervision for reasons of offending are not receiving the required level of service and considers that efforts to encourage rehabilitation and prevent re-offending are being undermined as a result; further notes that the shortage of places in secure units constrains the ability of children's hearings to make the most appropriate decisions, and considers that the Scottish Executive must guard against complacency and redouble its efforts to provide both the leadership and resources that will enable its partners in local authorities and the voluntary and statutory sectors to make the progress required to deliver an appreciable reduction in youth crime".
