*S3M-3033 Dr Richard Simpson: Agenda for Change Pay System—That the Parliament notes that at the end of October 2008 there were 1,991 substantive staff still to be assimilated to the Agenda for Change pay system and 12,598 bank staff in the same position; believes that reaching a conclusion on the banding of these staff is important in maintaining staff morale in the NHS, and calls on the Scottish Government to do all in its power to require NHS boards to tackle this issue with the greatest priority and to have completed the process for both substantive and bank staff by February 2009.
