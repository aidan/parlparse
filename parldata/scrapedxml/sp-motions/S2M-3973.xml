*S2M-3973 Tommy Sheridan: Condemnation of First Minister and Demand for Apology—That the Parliament notes the prominent article in The Herald on Saturday 18 February 2006 which carried several alleged quotes from the First Minister, Jack McConnell, concerning the tragic case of the 11-year-old child being admitted to hospital in Glasgow after misuse of heroin; believes that the comments attributed to the First Minister which refer to the "incompetence" of the professionals involved and that such incompetence was "either down to stupidity or a lack of caring or both" are entirely inappropriate and that, if the First Minister did indeed use such language, he should apologise to Glasgow’s Social Work Services staff and indeed to social work staff across Scotland for the damage inflicted on their profession and professionalism; condemns the derogatory and disrespectful language attributed to the First Minister, and believes it is not only unacceptable and inaccurate to describe Glasgow’s Social Work Services staff as stupid and uncaring or both but also highly irresponsible, given the complexity and seriousness of the case in question.
