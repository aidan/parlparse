*S2M-629# George Lyon: Medical Services in the West Highlands-That the Parliament recognises the deep concern of the communities in Fort William and Oban regarding the threat to future provision of acute medical services in the west Highlands; notes that over 3,500 people, so far, have turned out at public meetings to express their opposition to Argyll and Clyde and Highland NHS boards' plans to downgrade Oban and Fort William hospitals to community status; recognises that, if the proposals go ahead, patients from the West Highlands would be forced to travel hundreds of miles to Glasgow or Inverness to access treatment, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should reject these plans and give a commitment that the current service provision will continue to be delivered locally to communities in the West Highlands.
