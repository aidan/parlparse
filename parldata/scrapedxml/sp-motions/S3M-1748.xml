*S3M-1748 Jamie Hepburn: Support for Scottish CND from James—That the Parliament notes that this represents the 50th year of activity by Scottish CND; welcomes the support of the band James for the work of Scottish CND, and hopes that its support will make people more aware of the work of Scottish CND and encourage more to join the campaign against the replacement of the Trident nuclear weapons system by the UK Government at an estimated cost of up to £100 billion.
