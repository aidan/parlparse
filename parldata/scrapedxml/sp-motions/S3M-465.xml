*S3M-465♦ Cathie Craigie: NDCS Change Your World Consultation—That the Parliament congratulates the National Deaf Children’s Society (NDCS) on its groundbreaking Change Your World consultation exercise, which represents the first ever discussion with young deaf and hearing-impaired people in Scotland and the United Kingdom about the issues and challenges which affect them; believes that deafness and other hearing impairments should not be a barrier for children in achieving their true potential; acknowledges the work of the NDCS in representing the interests of all deaf children and young people from birth until they reach independence; welcomes this opportunity to engage with young deaf Scots, and considers that as many young people as possible in Cumbernauld and Kilsyth and across Scotland with a hearing impairment should be encouraged to get involved and make their voice heard.
