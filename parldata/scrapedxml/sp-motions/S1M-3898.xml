*S1M-3898# Dr Richard Simpson: New Forth Road Bridge Crossing Near Kincardine—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Scottish Executive to proceed with the new Forth road bridge crossing upstream from the Kincardine Bridge; welcomes the decision by the Forth Valley NHS Board to recommend to the Executive that there should be a new single site acute hospital and notes the board’s unanimous recommendation that the favoured site for the hospital should be at the Royal Scottish National Hospital (RSNH), Larbert; recognises the difficulties at present in access to the RSNH for residents in Clackmannanshire, west Fife and Stirling, and considers that the Executive should do all in its power to ensure that the bridge is completed as soon as possible and that, in considering the proposed site for the new hospital, the road networks should provide equity of access to all residents in Forth Valley.Supported by: Cathy Peattie*, Mr Tom McCabe*, Brian Fitzpatrick*
