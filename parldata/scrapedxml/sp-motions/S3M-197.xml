*S3M-197 Hugh O’Donnell: Debt Education—That the Parliament notes with concern the recent report from the Royal Bank of Scotland’s education initiative, Face2Face with Finance, which states that almost 90% of adults said they have never received any formal lessons on issues such as budgeting and saving and that more than two-thirds of those surveyed said that classes would have helped them cope better when dealing with banks and other organisations; further notes the report in February 2007 by Citizens Advice Scotland which found that personal debt in Scotland had reached record levels, and believes that the inclusion of financial education at an early stage in schools may contribute towards an improvement in children’s understanding of money management which could serve them well in their lives.
