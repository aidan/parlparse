*S3M-1842 Robert Brown: Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman Centenary—That the Parliament notes that Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, the first Glasgow-born Prime Minister and the first to be officially known by the title "Prime Minister", died 100 years ago this year; recalls that Sir Henry’s father had been Lord Provost of Glasgow; applauds the achievements of Sir Henry as Leader of the great Liberal Government of 1905 to 1915, his landslide election victory of 1906 and the introduction of the foundations of much modern welfare provision, notably the first old age pensions; recalls his criticisms of Britain’s involvement in the Boer War which he memorably described as being waged by "methods of barbarism"; recalls his service as MP for Stirling Burghs from 1868 to 1908, and calls for the life and achievements of Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman to be appropriately commemorated in his native city.
