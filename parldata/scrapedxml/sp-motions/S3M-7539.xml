 *S3M-7539 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Lothian and Borders Police Festive Campaign—That the Parliament approves the Lothian and Borders Police festive role model campaign, which will target violence against women by seeking to make men think about how their actions influence their children; understands that all frontline police officers are set to wear a white ribbon during the festive period as new figures show that 5% of all annual domestic abuse incidents in the Lothians are reported between Christmas Eve and 4 January; further approves the support being offered by Hibernian and Heart of Midlothian football clubs, with the players wearing white ribbons at the New Year’s Day derby match and a bluetooth message about the campaign being broadcast at Tynecastle stadium for fans to receive on their mobile phones; further notes that the campaign will also be featured in the Derby Day programme and highlighted on posters and postcards showing a father and son playing football with the slogan, You’re his role model. Teach him violence against women is never OK, and wishes all campaigners supporting Rape Crisis Scotland and White Ribbon Scotland every success. Supported by: Karen Whitefield*, Bill Kidd*, Malcolm Chisholm*, Rob Gibson*, Angela Constance*, Ian McKee*, Christina McKelvie*, Kenneth Gibson*
