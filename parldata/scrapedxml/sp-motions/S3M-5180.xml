*S3M-5180# Jamie McGrigor: Future of Mid Argyll Community Swimming Pool—That the Parliament notes with concern the threat of closure facing the Mid Argyll Swimming Pool in Lochgilphead due to a financial shortfall; believes that this community-owned social enterprise, owned and operated by Mid Argyll Community Enterprise Ltd, plays a vital role in providing the communities of Lochgilphead and Mid Argyll with a first-class public swimming pool and all the associated benefits to mental and physical health that come from the activity of swimming; considers that the pool is well used by pupils from many local primary schools and by local recreation clubs and many of the tourists and visitors who come to Mid Argyll; notes further that the new Lochgilphead High School does not have a swimming pool and that closure of this pool would mean that the nearest public swimming pools were many miles away in Oban, Rothesay, Dunoon or Campbeltown; is aware that the funding shortfall facing the pool amounts to around £10,000 in this financial year and £30,000 in subsequent years, and believes that all available funding options should be explored in order to secure the future of this well-used and much-loved community asset. Supported by: Bill Aitken*, Jackson Carlaw*, Nanette Milne*, Mary Scanlon*, Ted Brocklebank*, Mr Frank McAveety*
