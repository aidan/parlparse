*S1M-3482 Elaine Smith: In-House Provision of Public Services—That the Parliament congratulates Lanarkshire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust on its decision to transfer the catering, portering and domestic staff at Monklands Hospital, formerly employed under Medirest’s facilities management contract, back into the employment of the NHS Trust on 6 October 2002, a decision which was taken with a view to achieving improved patient care and best value; further congratulates UNISON on its ‘Positively Public’ campaign, which includes support for the principle of having public services of the highest quality provided by an in-house team, and believes that the in-house model of public service provision should be extended right across Scotland.
