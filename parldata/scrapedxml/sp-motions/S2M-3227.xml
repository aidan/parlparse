*S2M-3227 Margo MacDonald: Exclusion of MSPs—That the Parliament believes that, after the opportunity for reflection afforded by the summer recess and in the interests of establishing consistent and appropriate precedents in terms of its decisions following behaviour by MSPs which is deemed unsuitable and/or unacceptable, it is essential that it should revisit its decision to exclude for one month Frances Curran, Rosie Kane, Carolyn Leckie and Colin Fox, as the timing of the incident leading to this decision did not allow for either a thorough investigation or a considered response on the nature and duration of the disciplinary measure imposed on all four MSPs. Supported by: Campbell Martin*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Tommy Sheridan*, Mike Rumbles*
