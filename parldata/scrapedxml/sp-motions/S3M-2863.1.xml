 *S3M-2863.1 Nicola Sturgeon: Health Funding—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2863) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from "condemns" to end and insert "notes that the Scottish Government’s spending plans are set against the background of the 2007 spending review settlement from the UK Treasury that represents the lowest increase for Scotland since devolution; recognises that the NHS has received a fair share of the financial settlement and that the Scottish Government is increasing spending on health in Scotland; further recognises that in this context it is right that the NHS should strive to make sure that resources are spent as efficiently as possible; commends the NHS’s record in achieving efficiency savings linked to good quality care; welcomes the Scottish Government’s decision to continue the practice whereby all efficiency savings generated by the NHS will be retained by the NHS for local reinvestment in frontline services, and condemns the Labour Party, which instituted efficiency savings while in government but has irresponsibly attacked them in opposition."
