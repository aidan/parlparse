 *S3M-5911 Jackie Baillie: Minimum Unit Pricing, Is It Legal?—That the Parliament notes the ruling by the European Court of Justice that legislation in Austria, Ireland and France imposing a system of minimum retail selling prices for tobacco products may establish a competitive advantage for some manufacturers and importers and as such is not compatible with Article 9(1) of European Directive 95/59; further considers that this is consistent with the comments in the Law Society of Scotland’s submission to the consultation on the Alcohol etc. (Scotland) Bill that there are issues of compatibility raised by the imposition of minimum pricing at EU level under various aspects of EU law including Directive 95/59; believes that if the Scottish Government is confident that minimum unit pricing is fully consistent with EU law it should share the substance of that legal advice with opposition parties; further believes that failure to do so will undermine the credibility of the Scottish Government’s position on minimum unit pricing, and calls on the Scottish Government to concentrate on measures that will fairly, effectively and legally tackle Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with alcohol.
