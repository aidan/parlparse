*S3M-6531 Alex Neil: Violence Against Men—That the Parliament recognises that domestic abuse is a very serious and totally unacceptable problem in Scottish society; notes in particular that all victims, whether they be women, men or children, deserve appropriate support, and therefore welcomes the Scottish Government’s provision of funding for a support helpline for male victims, which will provide the further information about their needs that is required before any future decisions about services are made. Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon*
