*S3M-3815 Cathy Peattie: Extension of Concessionary Accompanied Travel—That the Parliament commends the Scottish Blind Persons’ Travel Card scheme, which gives free travel on all bus, coach, rail and ferry services throughout Scotland, and the fact that the card can cover a companion for those people who can use public transport only with assistance; notes that there are others who similarly can travel only if accompanied but that their provision for a companion is limited to bus travel, and considers that all those who need to be accompanied should be covered by the travel scheme, on all bus, coach, rail and ferry services throughout Scotland.
