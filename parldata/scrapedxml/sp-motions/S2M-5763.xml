*S2M-5763 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Reduce Class Sizes - Employ the Teachers—That the Parliament expresses its concern that so many of our recently qualified teachers are still without permanent teaching posts; is further concerned that the number of available places for postgraduate teacher training is falling year on year; believes that the Scottish Executive is missing opportunities to reduce class sizes by not ensuring that there are permanent posts for all recently qualified teachers and by reducing teacher recruitment, and considers that this is a missed opportunity to improve the education of all Scotland’s children.
