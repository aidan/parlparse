*S1M-2472# Richard Lochhead: Promoting Aberdeen as Europe's Energy Capital—That the Parliament recognises the City of Aberdeen’s role as Europe’s oil and gas capital and the long-term contribution that the offshore sector will continue to make to the Scottish economy; believes that every effort should be made to ensure that the city evolves into Europe’s "Energy Capital" thereby benefiting from the industry’s enormous economic and environmental potential that can place Scotland in the vanguard of renewable energy business internationally; considers that the Scottish Executive should produce specific strategies aimed at supporting Scotland’s oil and gas sector and renewable energy sector that also promote Aberdeen as Europe’s energy capital, and further considers that the Executive should promote measures to ensure that, as far as possible, the new energy revolution is driven by indigenous interests.
