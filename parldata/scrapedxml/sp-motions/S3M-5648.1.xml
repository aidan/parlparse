*S3M-5648.1 Alasdair Allan: Free Prescriptions for Cancer Patients—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5648) in the name of Jackie Baillie, leave out from "originally supporting" to end and insert "his unambiguous support for the SNP government’s plans to abolish prescription charges for all in Scotland; deprecates the risible efforts of Jackie Baillie MSP to deflect the well justified criticism of her own party’s opposition to free prescriptions for all in Scotland by citing a name that appeared beside a motion in Westminster as a result of a clerical error that has long since been corrected, and calls on Gordon Brown to belatedly keep the promise that he made in his speech to the Labour Party conference in 2008 to abolish prescription charges for all people with long-term conditions in England."
