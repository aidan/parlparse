*S3M-968.1 Alex Johnstone: A New Forth Crossing—As an amendment to motion (S3M-968) in the name of Jim Tolson, leave out from "regrets" to end and insert "further notes with concern the failure of the previous Labour-Liberal Democrat Scottish Executive and successive Liberal Democrat transport ministers to commission a new crossing which has resulted in valuable time being lost and may result in the existing bridge having to close before a new crossing is ready; further notes that it was former Minister for Transport, Nicol Stephen, who instructed the Forth Estuary Transport Authority to implement a variable tolls scheme on the existing bridge which could have resulted in tolls of up to £4 at peak times, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to repeal Part 3 of the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 so as to remove the possibility of such a scheme being revived." Supported by: Elizabeth Smith*, John Lamont*, Nanette Milne*, Ted Brocklebank*, Jamie McGrigor*, David McLetchie*, Murdo Fraser* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
