*S3M-3810 Rob Gibson: Celebrating the 10th Anniversary of Knoydart’s Land Buy-out—That the Parliament congratulates the Knoydart Foundation on the 10th anniversary of the successful buy-out; notes that the community buy-out model adopted for Knoydart provided expert outside support incorporated into the membership structure; recalls that Knoydart along with Assynt and Eigg applied community models that were not adopted in the land reform legislation subsequently passed by the Parliament; celebrates the progress in developing sustainable services such as the hydro scheme to serve the peninsula’s population; recognises the significant and well-deserved application of public support to aid the development of a severely disadvantaged community, which had suffered severe decline under the whims of private landlords, and offers fulsome praise for the recovery of one of the most deprived rural communities in Scotland.
