*S2M-1568 Mr Jamie McGrigor: Competitive Sport for Children-That the Parliament congratulates Portugal on hosting such a memorable and successful European Football Championships; further congratulates Greece on its victory in the tournament; notes that Greece has a population of just over 10 million people but has 2 million football players of all ages actively participating in official competitions of every kind; is concerned at reports that Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee, North Lanarkshire, Fife, Aberdeen and Falkirk local authorities have introduced the "potted" sports system that prevents children from losing in sporting competitions; supports comments by rugby legend, John Jeffrey, that Scotland has to encourage a winning culture if we want to have any success on the international sporting stage; further supports the comments of Olympic bronze medallist, Yvonne Murray, that she learnt more from losing than winning, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that all children of all ages in Scotland are given access to competitive sports and the opportunity to learn from the experiences of winning and losing. Supported by: Mr Ted Brocklebank*, David McLetchie*, Alex Johnstone*, Mike Pringle*, Mr David Davidson*, Murdo Fraser*, Mr Brian Monteith*, Mrs Nanette Milne*, Phil Gallie*, John Scott*
