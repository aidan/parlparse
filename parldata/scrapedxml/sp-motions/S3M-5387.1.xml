 *S3M-5387.1 Murdo Fraser: Viva la Revolution—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5387) in the name of Sandra White, leave out from first "Cuba" to end and insert "Human Rights Watch on the publication of its report, New Castro, Same Cuba, exposing ongoing abuses of human rights under the leadership of Raúl Castro; notes from the report that the Raúl Castro government has relied on the criminal code offence of dangerousness, which allows authorities to imprison individuals before they have committed any crime, on the suspicion that they are likely to commit an offence in the future and that this dangerousness provision is defined as behaviour that contradicts Cuba’s socialist norms; notes the reported case of Ramón Velásquez Toranzo who set out on a peaceful march across Cuba to call for respect for human rights and freedom for all political prisoners and was arrested and sentenced to three years in prison for dangerousness in January 2007; further notes the reported case of Raymundo Perdigón Brito, a journalist who wrote articles documenting abuses by the government and published them on foreign websites, who was sentenced to four years in prison for dangerousness in December 2006 and has endured repeated beatings by guards and solitary confinement during his incarceration; also notes the comments of José Miguel Vivanco, Americas director at Human Rights Watch, that "In his three years in power, Raúl Castro has been just as brutal as his brother" and that "Cubans who dare to criticize the government live in perpetual fear, knowing they could wind up in prison for merely expressing their views", and therefore considers that MSPs should desist from legitimising the Cuban regime by heaping praise upon Cuba."
