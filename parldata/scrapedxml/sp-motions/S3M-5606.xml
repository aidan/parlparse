* S3M-5606 Trish Godman: The Registration and Transfer of Youth Football Players—That the Parliament views with concern the child welfare and legal implications of professional Scottish football clubs entering into contracts with children aged under 16; considers that boys in the Scottish Football Youth Initiative Programme entering into a one-year contract with a Scottish Football Association (SFA) club are often unaware that this gives the club the right to hold player registrations for a further two years; understands that players can be released from their registration at any time, giving senior clubs the opportunity to "harvest" hundreds of players; further views with concern the practice of compensation payments between SFA clubs for the transfer of young players under 16; calls on the Scottish Government to work with the SFA to ensure that the legal and moral questions over the registration and transfer of youth players is addressed urgently; believes that there is an important balance to strike in the relationship between children and sport, and commends all those involved in grassroots football, such as Willie Smith of Erskine, who has devoted 43 years to youth football.
