*S3M-6040 Willie Coffey: Private Training Providers, Protection of Students’ Fees—That the Parliament notes with concern the impact on students of private training providers when their training provider ceases trading; understands that, in addition to the disruption to their training, many students also lose the course fee, which is usually paid in full at the beginning of the course; expresses particular concern at the case of Advent Consulting Ltd and associated companies, in which thousands of students have been left with no training provider after paying fees in some cases above £5,000; further expresses concern at the activities of funders that provide interest-free loans to pay course fees, which can see students face demands for repayment of over twice the sum borrowed for a course that no longer exists, and considers that there could be merit in a scheme for bonded training providers, similar to ABTA in the travel industry, to ensure that students are not hit by the double whammy of no training and a huge debt.
