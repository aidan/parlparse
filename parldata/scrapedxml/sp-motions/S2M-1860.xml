 S2M-1860 Richard Lochhead: Inappropriate Historical Commentsâ€”That the Parliament notes the comments made by the historian, Dr David Starkey, that "Scotland matters for a single reason, which is its involvement with England from the 17th century onwards. Then it becomes important"; believes that these comments are ludicrous and misjudged, and notes the innumerable contributions the Scots have made to the world that all too often are ignored by Anglo-centric commentators in the UK media and celebrity "so called" historians.
