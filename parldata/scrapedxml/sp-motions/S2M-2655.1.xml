 * S2M-2655.1 Mr Frank McAveety: M74 Decision—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2655) in the name of Chris Ballance, leave out from “condemns” to end and insert “welcomes the decision by the Scottish Executive to proceed with the M74 northern extension and recognises that, as a key part of the completion of the West of Scotland motorway network, it will alleviate congestion in the immediate communities and on the M8, will act as a critical economic regeneration tool for the Gateway Project and the West of Scotland economy and should be seen as complementing the Executive’s commitment for 70% of spending on transport to be on public transport.”
