*S1M-3105.2 Tommy Sheridan: National Waste Strategy-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3105) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "commends" to end and insert "believes that the Scottish Executive must take the lead on reducing waste and should refuse permission for all new landfill or incinerator applications until a national waste strategy is in place and that this strategy should have at its core a reduction of waste at the beginning of the stream, i.e. packaging, junk mail and a three-stream collection system aiming at a zero waste target such as is already being practised successfully in communities in the USA, Europe and England; further believes that waste must be dealt with in the local authority area where it is produced and not transported about the country to become someone else's problem, and finally believes that a further vital strategy must be the prevention of waste at the point of production which is already being implemented in other European countries, where manufacturers are fined heavily if they produce non-bio-degradable waste."
