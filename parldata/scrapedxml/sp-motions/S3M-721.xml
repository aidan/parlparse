 *S3M-721 Helen Eadie: Social Work Cuts Force Frail Fife Pensioners to Stay in Hospital—That the Parliament expresses profound concern that frail and vulnerable patients in Fife who have been clinically assessed as being suitable for return to their own homes or to a residential home are being denied the right to do so as a consequence of the policy change of the SNP and Liberal Democrat-led Fife Council, where a package of £600,000 cuts has been made to the social work budget; further notes that these cuts have resulted in at least one patient dying while in hospital against his will and that despite clinicians saying that he could go home he died before he could do so because of the policy decisions of the council; observes that there has been a dramatic increase since July 2007 in the number of beds being blocked for patients waiting for vital surgery, with the outcome that savings made by Fife Council are being transferred to NHS Fife, resulting in no overall saving for taxpayers who instead now have to cope with the personal tragedies that are impacting on patients, with the additional possibility that the beds being blocked will reduce capacity as clinicians seek to prepare plans for winter when increases in flu and chest infections can rise to very high levels, depending on a variety of circumstances, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to intervene in the outrageous situation where the savings by the SNP and Liberal Democrat-controlled council has not resulted in net savings to the taxpayer but has instead caused unnecessary misery and anxiety to the patients and relatives concerned.
