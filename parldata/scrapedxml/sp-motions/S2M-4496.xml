*S2M-4496 Colin Fox: West Lothian College Nursery—That the Parliament recognises the essential role that the on-campus nursery at West Lothian College plays in the development of the children who attend it and in facilitating students furthering their education; very much regrets the decision by the board of directors of West Lothian College to close this first-class facility; believes there has been insufficient consultation with the students affected; further believes that, as well as being a resource for parents, the nursery also provides essential training facilities for childcare students, and calls on the board of directors to reconsider its decision and the Scottish Executive to fund a much-needed expansion of this nursery facility.
