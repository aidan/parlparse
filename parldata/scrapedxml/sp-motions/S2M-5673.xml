*S2M-5673 Ms Sandra White: £110 Billion Real Cost of Trident—That the Parliament expresses concern at the findings of the House of Commons Defence Committee which heard that the price of a new Trident system would not be between £15 billion and £20 billion, as stated in the Government’s white paper, but that the total cost of maintaining and replacing Britain’s nuclear weapons would be between £90 billion and £110 billion; believes that, as a result, people have been misinformed as to the real cost of replacing Trident, further adding weight to the overwhelming arguments against replacement, and considers that this should serve to persuade those members in favour of replacement to reappraise their support and to help those members who have not expressed where they stand on this important issue to make a more informed decision.
