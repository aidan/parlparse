 *S3M-830 Karen Whitefield: Diabetes UK Scotland World Diabetes Day Report 2007—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Diabetes UK Scotland report, Getting our act together - supporting young people with diabetes in Scotland; recognises that Scotland has one of the highest rates in the world for Type 1 diabetes and that more than 90% of young people with diabetes in Scotland are at risk of serious health complications because they lack the information and support to manage their condition properly; acknowledges the report’s action points on sustaining paediatric services for children with Type 1 diabetes, providing structured education, psycho-social support and information about living with Type 1 diabetes and its consequences, informing patients about their treatment options, educating people working with young people in schools and elsewhere about Type 1 diabetes, improving transition from paediatric to adult services and improving communication among professionals; furthermore recognises that the report is part of a year-long worldwide campaign to raise awareness of the rising prevalence of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes in children and adolescents, and calls on the Scottish Government to make a response to the report and the campaign.
