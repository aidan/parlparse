 * S2M-2710 Rosie Kane: Dissent is not Dishonest or Dangerous—That the Parliament condemns Phil Gallie MSP’s misleading and inaccurate quotes regarding the activities at the recent Festival of Dissent in Lanarkshire, which stated that Dissent is “involved in this kind of deceitful, dishonest and dangerous activity”; recognises that Dissent met to plan resistance to the G8 summit, to further educate themselves and to build and discuss better ways of living and working together with their local communities; is concerned, however, that as Dissent was meeting to plan peaceful non-violent direct action against the forthcoming G8 summit at Gleneagles, police were preparing for violence at a nearby “boot camp” in Carluke and spent public money to deploy a helicopter to hover over the festival which was in stark contrast to the peaceful festival organised by Dissent; congratulates Dissent for its efforts and its openness, and hopes that the media, politicians and police will focus on the positive and peaceful activities being planned by those opposing the violent and negative activities of G8 members.
