*S3M-13 Richard Baker: Aberdeen Shortlisted to be Hub of UK Energy Technologies Institute—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that Aberdeen has been shortlisted under the Scottish consortium bid to host the hub of the proposed UK Energy Technologies Institute; congratulates local agencies and academic institutions on working together to make the case for Aberdeen; believes that, as the energy capital of Europe and home to over 900 energy-based companies, Aberdeen is the natural choice for the hub; notes that Aberdeen’s bid is supported by CBI Scotland and Oil and Gas UK; notes that the Scottish Executive’s own Intermediary Technology Institute for Energy is already based in the city; further notes the work of the Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group in developing and promoting renewable energy technology, and calls on the Executive to promote Aberdeen as its preferred location for the hub.
