 * S2M-2846 Margaret Smith: Edinburgh Airport Blueprint Development—That the Parliament welcomes the publication by BAA of a consultation on the long-term development blueprint for Edinburgh Airport; notes the importance of Edinburgh Airport to the local, regional and national economy, worth £287 million for the Scottish economy and supporting 2,300 jobs directly and 5,000 indirectly; welcomes the improvements being made to the access arrangements with tram, heavy rail and improved roads, but calls on BAA, the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society and the Scottish Executive to investigate the opportunities for co-existence of the Royal Highland Showground and airport, given the society’s willingness to give up significant quantities of land, cross-party support for co-existence and the considerable cost of relocation of the showground.
