 *S3M-3361 Jackie Baillie: Freedom of Dumbarton for Jackie Stewart—That the Parliament welcomes the proposal that West Dunbartonshire Council should award Dumbarton-born racing legend Sir Jackie Stewart the Freedom of Dumbarton; recognises the immense contribution that the three times world motor racing champion has made to Scottish sport, and believes that this would be a fitting tribute to a "son of the rock" and one of the world’s most famous Scots as he approaches his 70th birthday.
