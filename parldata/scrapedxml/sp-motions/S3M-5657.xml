*S3M-5657 Des McNulty: West Dunbartonshire Council Reserves—That the Parliament considers that the level of reserves now being held by West Dunbartonshire Council is irresponsibly low, following the budget set by the SNP administration, is not in line with Accounts Commission for Scotland guidance and leaves the council ill-equipped to meet future financial challenges or protect frontline services and jobs.
