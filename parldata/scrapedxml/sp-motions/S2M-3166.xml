 *S2M-3166 Alex Neil: A Commonwealth Games Lottery—That the Parliament conveys its best wishes to the team put in place to secure the 2014 Commonwealth Games for Glasgow and lends the weight of its full support behind the bid; believes that a successful bid would be in the interests of Scotland in terms of tourism, economy and the boost to Scottish sport and national self-confidence that hosting such a major event would bring, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty’s Government either for the creation of a new Commonwealth Games lottery game or to make the newly created Olympic lottery game a joint Olympics and Commonwealth lottery game, to assist with funding the creation of the necessary infrastructure for the 2014 games in the event that Glasgow’s bid is successful.
