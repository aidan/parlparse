*S3M-5838 Christine Grahame: No to Fascism in Lockerbieâ€”That the Parliament condemns the decision of what is considered to be the ultra-right-wing fascist group, the so-called Scottish Defence League (SDL), to hold an event in the town of Lockerbie on 27 March 2010 connected to the 1988 bombing of Pan Am flight 103; considers that the SDL and its parent organisation, the English Defence League, have a track record of instigating violence at events that they hold, requiring huge additional police resources and associated costs to the public purse, and condemns as insensitive and highly inappropriate the choice and focus of this event by the SDL, which it believes to be acting in the pursuit of narrow, extremist political objectives that have nothing to do with remembering the 270 victims of the PA flight 103 disaster and which is likely to face overwhelming objection from local Lockerbie residents.
