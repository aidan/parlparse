*S3M-3547 Ross Finnie: Full Reprieve for St Margaret’s Hospice—That the Parliament notes the decision of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to defer the transfer of 30 continuing care beds from St Margaret’s hospice to Blawarthill Hospital until 2012, believes that this confirms the provision of care at St Margaret’s Hospice to be satisfactory, and calls on NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to grant St Margaret’s hospice a permanent reprieve and instead locate the alternative care provision being suggested for St Margaret’s within Blawarthill Hospital.
