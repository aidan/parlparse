*S2M-4529 Murdo Fraser: Protecting the Red Squirrel—That the Parliament is concerned that the UK-native red squirrel is in decline and notes that Scotland is home to over 75% of the United Kingdom’s red squirrel population, an estimated 120,000 red squirrels; understands that the non-native grey squirrel, with a population of over 2.5 million in the UK, has displaced the red squirrel and is continuing to threaten and encroach on red squirrel territory; fears that the red squirrel will eventually become extinct in the wild in the UK unless action is taken to greatly reduce grey squirrel numbers, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive must explore all options to reduce the grey squirrel population in borderline areas with the red squirrel population, including offering bounties for capturing or killing grey squirrels in order to safeguard the future of the red squirrel.
