*S3M-2862.3 Andy Kerr: Scottish Futures Trustâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-2862) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from "notes actions" to end and insert "believes that the Scottish Government has failed to deliver a workable method of funding for public infrastructure projects, a view supported by, among others, the building industry, the financial services community and the trades unions; considers that this damaging hiatus is costing jobs and harming the Scottish economy, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to bring an end to its Scottish Futures Trust proposals immediately."
