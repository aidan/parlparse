 *S2M-1940 Nicola Sturgeon: A Better Deal for Pensioners—That the Parliament agrees that Scotland must face up to the twin challenges of tackling current pensioner poverty and ensuring decent living standards for future generations of pensioners; believes that removing the pensions means test would help to achieve both of these objectives, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to bring pressure to bear on Her Majesty’s Government to begin the process of replacing means-testing with a citizen’s pension.
