 *S3M-7226 Malcolm Chisholm: Face Equality for Children—That the Parliament congratulates the charity Changing Faces on its Face Equality for Children campaign; recognises that approximately 7,500 children in Scotland have a significant facial disfigurement and believes that negative assumptions about this often result in prejudice and discrimination that might lead to low academic achievement, reduced employability and a poor quality of life; supports the campaign’s objective of challenging those negative assumptions and in mobilising education, health and other public services to achieve that objective, and looks forward to the time when all such children are treated fairly and equally and able to realise their full potential.
