 *S3M-2980 Christina McKelvie: The Union Deficit—That the Parliament notes with concern the warning by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development that the United Kingdom is heading towards a "severe" economic downturn in 2009 and the forecast by the International Monetary Fund that foresees a 1.3% fall in output in 2009; is further concerned that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has failed to address the justifiable concerns about the economy and the deleterious effects on Scotland of the policies of Her Majesty’s Government; reflects that the supposed "union dividend" has been proven to be the "union deficit", and considers that Scotland would be better off independent.
