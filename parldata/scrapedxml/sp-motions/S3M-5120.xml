*S3M-5120 Nigel Don: Leonard Cheshire Disability Review 2009—That the Parliament welcomes Leonard Cheshire Disability’s research report, Disability Review 2009; notes that this is the third in a series of annual UK-wide surveys that detail the experience of disabled people by examining areas such as education, employment, social care and citizenship; further recognises that the report highlights that 9% of respondents report that they have been the victim of disability hate crime, 63% of respondents are in fuel poverty and 50% of respondents who are living in poverty and need social care support are having to pay towards their social care, in some cases covering all the costs of their care; therefore commends the report and encourages all political parties and the wider community to help remove the many barriers that are put in place for disabled people by working together to remove these barriers, and hopes that Leonard Cheshire Disability’s Disability Review 2010 will show a positive change in the experiences of disabled people.
