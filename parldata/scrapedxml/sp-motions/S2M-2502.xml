 *S2M-2502# Nora Radcliffe: Trial Reintroduction of the European Beaver—That the Parliament notes Scottish Natural Heritage’s proposal for a trial reintroduction of the European beaver, a proposal which follows the successful reintroduction of the species in 24 other countries, and considers that the Scottish Executive should give serious consideration to issuing a licence for the trial so that it can be determined, in a controlled and properly monitored way, whether the benefits to the environment and tourism observed after previous reintroductions elsewhere can be replicated in a Scottish context without significant adverse effects on existing land uses.
