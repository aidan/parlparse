*S1M-2605 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Retain Clive Fairweather-That the Parliament considers it to be in the interests of justice and human rights that Clive Fairweather remains as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland, and would be deeply concerned had he wished to remain but any unjust interference were found in whether his contract is renewed when it expires as Mr Fairweather has been an exceptional watchdog in his outspoken honesty and soundness of judgement on the state of Scottish Prisons; believes that vulnerable prisoners, and staff concerned about conditions, depend upon the integrity of Mr Fairweather who has used honest language in condemning matters affecting human life such as the high rate of suicides in prisons and in highlighting slopping out as a breach of human rights, and has worked diligently both to protect the public and to attempt to reform prisons, and calls upon all concerned in this appointment under a Royal Warrant, including Her Majesty The Queen, to ensure fairness prevails in appointing a key guardian in the justice system.
