*S1M-2652 Johann Lamont: Digital Audio in Visual Impairment Education (DAVIE)-That the Parliament congratulates Darnley Primary School in the Glasgow Pollok constituency, Glasgow City Council, and the Royal National Institute for the Blind Scotland (RNIB) on their excellent, pioneering and challenging work in supporting young people with visual impairment in mainstream education through the use of the innovative and much-praised RNIB equipment, Digital Audio in Visual Impairment Education (DAVIE); celebrates the work of the staff involved and the benefit experienced by all pupils in Darnley because of this project; notes that RNIB revealed in a recent research report, Shaping the Future, that, while 70% of blind and partially-sighted pupils in Scotland attend their local primary school, almost a quarter of such pupils do not receive the support they require; further notes the support of Scottish Power plc in underpinning the start of the Scottish roll-out of this initiative through the award of a £132,000 grant, following an initial £42,000 grant awarded by the Scottish Executive, to pilot DAVIE in Darnley Primary School, and urges the Executive and the appropriate committees of the Parliament to consider how this crucial work in the integration of, and support for, visually impaired pupils and students in mainstream education might best be supported and developed across Scotland.
