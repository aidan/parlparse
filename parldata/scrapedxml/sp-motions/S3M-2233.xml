*S3M-2233 Claire Baker: The Future of Scotland’s Universities—That the Parliament congratulates Scotland’s universities for their good showing in The Times Good University Guide; commends the University of St Andrews for its top-five place; notes that Scotland had St Andrews, Edinburgh and Glasgow universities in the top 20 and Aberdeen, Strathclyde, Stirling, Dundee and Heriot-Watt universities in the top 50 universities in the United Kingdom; further notes that the Scottish Government’s Joint Future Thinking Taskforce on Universities will report imminently; believes that the Scottish Government must ensure that universities have sustainable funding that at least matches funding in the rest of the UK to maintain and enhance Scottish universities’ UK and international standing, and further believes that, unless funding for Scottish universities and student support in Scotland keeps pace with the rest of the UK, the Scottish Government risks squandering the legacy of good performance in the higher education sector left to it by previous administrations. Supported by: Mary Mulligan*, Elaine Murray*, Patricia Ferguson*, Iain Gray*
