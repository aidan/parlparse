*S2M-3663 Roseanna Cunningham: Gaelic Digital Television—That the Parliament welcomes the reported increase in the Scottish Executive’s contribution to the establishment of a Gaelic language digital television channel; regrets that Westminster appears to be refusing to follow suit; believes that digital technology provides the opportunity for an exciting new era for Gaelic broadcasting, but notes with dismay that, while the new channel is expected to be broadcasting by the autumn of 2006, switchover to digital is not scheduled to take place until 2009 for the Grampian and Scottish television areas, leaving many people, particularly in those areas with the highest concentration of Gaelic speakers, without affordable access to Gaelic digital broadcasting for three years. Supported by: Michael Matheson*, Rob Gibson*, Jim Mather*, Fiona Hyslop*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Alex Neil*, Mr Adam Ingram*, Tommy Sheridan*
