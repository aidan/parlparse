*S2M-3431 Robin Harper: Fish Stocks in North Sea, ICES Reportâ€”That the Parliament notes the recent report from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) on fish stocks in the North Sea; commends the painstaking work that it and European marine scientists have done over recent years; notes that the threats to fish stocks in the North Sea are as serious as ever; recalls that the accord signed by European fisheries ministers last year committed to the possibility of instituting closed areas in the North Sea if the situation had not improved, and, in the interests of future fish stocks and of the fishermen themselves, calls upon the Scottish Executive to keep an open mind on the advisability of setting up no-take zones in order to allow stocks to regenerate, particularly in relation to the cod fishery, and to provide all consequent and sensible assistance to fishermen and their families to minimise the economic effects of any measures taken.
