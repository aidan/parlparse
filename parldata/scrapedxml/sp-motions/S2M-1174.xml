*S2M-1174 Patrick Harvie: Recycling in Glasgow-That the Parliament expresses concern at the loss of recycling facilities from supermarkets in Glasgow; considers that supermarkets have a responsibility to make provision for recycling, given the huge amount of packaging generated by their business, but that a reasonable level of service from local authorities is necessary in order to keep "bring sites" in good order, and urges Glasgow City Council to give greater priority to ensuring that Glasgow residents can access recycling services either from home or from local facilities in their community.
