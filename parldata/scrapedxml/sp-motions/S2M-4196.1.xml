 *S2M-4196.1 Mr Jamie McGrigor: Congratulations Team Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4196) in the name of Michael Matheson, insert at end "notes, however, the words of Simon Clegg, the Chief Executive of the British Olympic Association, who said that "the British Olympic Association...strongly believes that we are stronger collectively than as individual countries…Any distractions, dilution or further fragmentation of sport in the UK will seriously undermine the once in a lifetime opportunity British sport has to capitalise on the unique benefits of hosting an Olympic Games", and therefore believes that there is a need to support both grass-roots sport infrastructure and elite athletes through the valuable work of the Scottish Institute of Sport which aims to change the culture and raise the ambitions and aspirations within sport in Scotland."
