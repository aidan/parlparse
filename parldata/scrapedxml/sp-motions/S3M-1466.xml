*S3M-1466 Christine Grahame: Marie Curie Daffodils—That the Parliament congratulates Marie Curie Cancer Care on the 60th year of both the foundation of the NHS and Marie Curie Cancer Care; notes that the majority of people would choose to stay at home if terminally ill but that while 86% are aware that end of life care at home is available only 29% think this is free; recognises the invaluable contribution of Marie Curie nurses who already care for half of all cancer patients, and welcomes the campaign to double the number of terminally ill people who are supported to die at home and therefore wishes the annual Great Daffodil appeal every success, particularly in this anniversary year.
