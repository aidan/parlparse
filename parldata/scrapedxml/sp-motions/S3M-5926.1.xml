*S3M-5926.1 Margaret Smith: The Management of Schools—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5926) in the name of Elizabeth Smith, insert at end "; believes that any changes to the model of school organisation should be motivated by raising attainment and improving pupil outcomes rather than profit and dogma; recognises the benefits of greater community and parental involvement in the management of schools; notes that the implementation of a new curriculum, falling teacher numbers and straitened budgets remain key areas of concern for education professionals, and recognises the cross-party consensus behind the Education, Lifelong Learning and Culture Committee’s examination of the management of schools."
