*S3M-2301 Bill Kidd: Labour’s Super Tax on the Poor—That the Parliament expresses its concern at the continuing unfairness of the UK Government’s tax and benefit system whereby there is a loss of housing benefit at 65 pence in the pound and of council tax benefit at 20 pence in the pound for every pound earned over the benefit thresholds, effectively a super tax of 85%; calls for an improved tax and benefit system that does not penalise those experiencing poverty for small rises in their income, and notes that a local income tax would be part of such a fairer system.
