 *S2M-4706 Mr Jamie Stone: Equal Access to Children—That the Parliament believes that separated parents should each have an equal presumption of contact with their children, so that both parents can continue to parent their children and that children are able to benefit from being parented by both parents as well as from contact with any grandparents and extended family members able and willing to play a role in their upbringing, and urges the Scottish Executive to replace the word "contact" with "parenting time" and ensure that parenting time orders can be and are made and enforced by the courts, save where the child’s safety would be at risk.
