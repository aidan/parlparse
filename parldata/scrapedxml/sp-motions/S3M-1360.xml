 *S3M-1360 Michael McMahon: The Sports Development Foundation Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the creation of the Sports Development Foundation Scotland (SDF), a new charity based in Hamilton, Lanarkshire, which has been formed with the aim of increasing funding for local sports facilities by allowing individuals and companies to donate directly to a specific sports project either by location or type of sport that they enjoy; notes that the sports projects will then be showcased on the SDF website which will be developed by the end of April 2008; recognises that this is a cost-effective way of providing capital for grassroots sports facilities which will be available to all local sports clubs throughout Scotland, and believes that the charity should be considered by the Scottish Executive for any future sports projects where an alternative method of financing could be appropriate.
