 *S2M-243 Rosie Kane: Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd—That the Parliament recognises the vital role played by the workers of Caledonian MacBrayne Ltd (Calmac) in providing vital lifeline links to Scotland’s island communities; fully supports the action of the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers in balloting workers for potential strike action; calls on the Scottish Executive to fund fully the 3.5% pay rise to the workers and end the practice of long working hours, the use of low-paid agency labour and the disparity in workers’ conditions between the Clyde and Western Isles division, and further calls on the Executive to resist all attempts to privatise Calmac by the back door.
