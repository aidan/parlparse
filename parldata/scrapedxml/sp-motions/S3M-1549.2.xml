*S3M-1549.2 Des McNulty: Transportâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-1549) in the name of Jeremy Purvis, leave out from "commit direct funding" to end and insert "reinstate earmarked funding for the capital costs of the Borders railway with a view to taking forward the construction of the project without delay, and believes that ministers should be asked to appear before the relevant parliamentary committees to answer urgent questions over the delivery of the project, its escalating costs and the implications of the proposed funding arrangements for future transport and infrastructure projects."
