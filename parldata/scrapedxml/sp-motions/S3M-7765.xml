*S3M-7765 Elaine Smith: Breast is Best—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Government’s new strategy to improve maternal and infant nutrition; recognises that the Scottish Government has adopted as its policy the World Health Organisation’s guidance recommending exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of an infant’s life; believes that the benefits of breastfeeding are well documented for both mother and child and that breast milk provides babies with the essential nutrients that they need for healthy development and contains antibodies that help protect from common childhood illnesses; is concerned that there has been negative publicity surrounding a recent report in the British Medical Journal questioning the best time to introduce solid foods into a baby’s diet; understands that Baby Milk Action states on its website that three of the authors of the report in question receive funding from the baby food industry; therefore welcomes the new advertising campaign to promote the benefits of breastfeeding, and urges NHS Lanarkshire to develop a fresh action plan to take forward the implementation of the strategy.
