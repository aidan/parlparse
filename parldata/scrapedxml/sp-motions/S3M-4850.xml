*S3M-4850 Dave Thompson: Protecting and Encouraging Scottish Food and Drink—That the Parliament welcomes the 2009 Scottish Food and Drink Fortnight and its aims to encourage people to discover, buy and enjoy the produce produced on their doorstep, encourage the food industry, from restaurants to retailers and caterers, to source and champion quality Scottish produce, build Scotland’s reputation for excellent quality food and drink and raise awareness of and support for the people who produce Scotland’s food and drink; praises Scotland Food and Drink’s goal of growing the industry from £7.5 billion to £10 billion by 2017 and its vision of building Scotland’s international reputation as the land of food and drink; further welcomes the Scottish Government’s support for Scotland Food and Drink and their collaboration on Workstream 1 of the National Food and Drink Policy, driving forward sustainable economic growth across the industry and boosting the profile of Scottish produce, and finally welcomes the Scottish Government’s commitment to protecting the identity of iconic Scottish produce through Protected Food Name (PFN) status, with nine Scottish foods already designated PFNs, and extending the list with a number of applications currently being considered, including Stornoway black pudding, traditional Ayrshire Dunlop cheese and Scottish wild salmon, which will further cement Scotland’s reputation as the land of food and drink.
