S3M-4600 Helen Eadie: Scottish Ambulance Service Response Following the Death of Kirsty Fotheringham—That the Parliament finds it reprehensible that, more than a year after the death of Kirsty Fotheringham following an epileptic fit, the Scottish Ambulance Service has not responded to representations made on behalf of her mother, Mrs Fotheringham; notes that letters to the Chief Executive of the Scottish Ambulance Service have not been acknowledged, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to investigate as a matter both of urgency and importance to identify why prevarication and procrastination continue, with chief officials failing Kirsty’s mother and leaving all other epilepsy patients in West Fife at risk.
