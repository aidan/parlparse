 *S3M-4042 Mary Mulligan: National Epilepsy Week 2009—That the Parliament recognises the contribution made by Epilepsy Scotland and fellow Scottish members of the Joint Epilepsy Council of the UK and Ireland to raise awareness and combat the social stigma associated with epilepsy; supports these organisations in marking National Epilepsy Week, 17 to 23 May 2009, and in challenging discrimination and informing public attitudes; acknowledges that epilepsy should be higher on the Scottish Government’s and NHS boards’ agendas so that more epilepsy specialist nurses and doctors can be trained and patient care can be improved; acknowledges Epilepsy Scotland’s campaign for more nurses and a corresponding increase in specialist posts; calls on the Scottish Government and the NHS to ensure that sufficient epilepsy nurses work in each NHS board and to help them provide local transition arrangements for young people with epilepsy moving to adult epilepsy services; welcomes the Cross Party Group on Epilepsy’s current review of social work section 23 assessments of need for families with epilepsy; congratulates the Scottish Parliament for winning Epilepsy Scotland’s Employer of the Year Award, which recognises epilepsy best practice, and praises the ongoing awareness training provided for the Scottish Parliament’s own staff so that epilepsy is no longer hidden and misunderstood.
