 * S2M-2660 Rosie Kane: STUC Support for M74—That the Parliament notes with regret the STUC’s support for the M74 project and calls on the STUC to reconsider its position on the project and withdraw that support in light of the fact that there is no evidence that this project will create jobs and, indeed, that job creation will only come from investment in a properly integrated public transport system.
