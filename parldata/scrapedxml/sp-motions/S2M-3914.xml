 *S2M-3914 John Farquhar Munro: Ownership of Scotland’s Seabed—That the Parliament recognises the importance of Scotland’s coastal waters and of rights over the seabed to Scotland’s coastal communities; further recognises the importance to Scotland’s marine renewable sector of fair access rights to Scotland’s waters and seabed, and therefore believes that it is important that the extent of Scottish Ministers’ ownership of the seabed be clarified so that, if Scottish Ministers do indeed have ownership, and not the Crown Estate Commissioners, the seabed can be managed for the maximum benefit of Scotland’s coastal communities. Supported by: Donald Gorrie*, Christine Grahame*
