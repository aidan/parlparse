 *S2M-4755.1 Robin Harper: Education Firstâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-4755) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from "believes" to end and insert "notes with regret that the curriculum for excellence makes no direct reference to the creative arts and the central part that they could and should play, both in their own right and as a direct contribution to the aims of the curriculum for excellence, confidence, responsibility and effectiveness and successful learning, and acknowledges that art, drama, music, movement, kinaesthetic creativity and empathy are all necessary for the development of fully rounded human beings and should be afforded a more central place in our thinking as the curriculum for excellence develops.
