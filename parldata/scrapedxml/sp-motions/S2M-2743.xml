*S2M-2743# Carolyn Leckie: Nursery Nurses: Still No Justice—That the Parliament notes that it is now a year since the end of the long and heroic struggle of the nursery nurses; commends the contribution that they continue to make to our children’s future; recognises that they still do not receive appropriate rewards for the job that they do; further notes that nursery nurses and women in general are still discriminated against in terms of pay and that pay for nursery nurses remains fragmented and inconsistent in Scotland; recognises that now, as was the case last year, they still deserve national pay for a job delivered under national guidance; remembers and commends the stand they have taken and the struggle they continue to pursue, and believes that the Scottish Executive should deliver national pay for nursery nurses commensurate with their professional expertise.
