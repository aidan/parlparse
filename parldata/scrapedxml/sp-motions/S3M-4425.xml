*S3M-4425 Robin Harper: Depression Alliance Scotland’s Getting On, Not Getting Down Campaign and National Depression Week—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Depression Alliance Scotland’s Getting on, not getting down campaign as part of National Depression Week, 17 to 23 June 2009; further welcomes the campaign’s aim of improving support and treatment for older people with depression in Scotland; recognises that depression is the most common mental health problem in later life, affecting one in seven older people in Scotland; recognises that older people face many challenges to their mental health, including the effects of poverty, social exclusion, retirement, bereavement and physical health problems; is concerned that eight out of 10 older people with clinical depression in Scotland do not receive any treatment whatsoever; notes that 96% of people surveyed in a recent poll believe that older people in Scotland should have equal access to care and treatment for depression, and calls for a review of relevant service provision for older people experiencing depression to improve access, promote recovery to good mental wellbeing and provide support to prevent people from becoming mentally unwell as they enter their later years.
