S3M-3217 Alex Neil: Pensioner Benefits—That the Parliament calls on all pensioners to make sure that they claim all the benefits and forms of assistance due to them, in line with a recent campaign by Age Concern Scotland; notes that the winter fuel payment, cold weather payment, pension credit, free television licence, council tax benefit, housing benefit, Christmas bonus, insulation grants and personal tax allowances are all available to eligible pensioners; further notes with concern that some pensioners do not claim what is due to them, instead relying on savings, and therefore urges all pensioners to check that they are receiving all the benefits and forms of assistance to which they are entitled.
