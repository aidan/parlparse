 *S3M-2716 Bill Kidd: Secrecy Over Real Nuclear Threat Revealed—That the Parliament condemns secrecy and misinformation surrounding the nuclear industry as illustrated by documents only released after freedom of information requests revealed that key radiation alarms at Burghfield in England, where Britain’s Trident warheads are dismantled and reassembled for maintenance, designed to detect an impending nuclear accident were disabled by last year’s floods; regrets that, despite the consortium that runs Burghfield describing the risk of a critical nuclear event as incredible, the full details were deliberately kept from the public and local authorities, with UK defence ministers telling MPs that there had been only minor disruption, and believes that such manipulation by UK Government officials and the nuclear industry aimed at concealing the true dangers of nuclear weapons and energy offer further proof as to why the Parliament is justified in asserting opposition to nuclear energy and weapons.
