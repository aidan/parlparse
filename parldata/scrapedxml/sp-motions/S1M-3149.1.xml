 *S1M-3149.1 Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Alternatives to Custody-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3149) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from "commends" to end and insert "warns against the widespread extension of soft non-custodial sentences simply to empty Scotland's overcrowded prisons without sufficient regard to the protection of the public; notes with concern the plans paraded by the Scottish Executive to send the parents of young offenders to jail, and calls upon the Executive to put in place sufficient resources to make Scotland a safer place in which to live and work."
