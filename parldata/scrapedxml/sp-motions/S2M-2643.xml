 * S2M-2643 Patrick Harvie: London School of Economics Study: The Identity Project—That the Parliament notes the findings in a recent comprehensive study by the London School of Economics (LSE), The Identity Project: an assessment of the UK Identity Cards Bill, that involved more than 100 academics and outside experts in the fields of law, technology, information systems, government policy, business, economics and security; is concerned that the authors of the study have concluded that the proposals for an identity card and database scheme are “too complex, technically unsafe, overly prescriptive and lack a foundation of public trust and confidence”; further notes that the report has warned that, rather than increasing UK security, the Bill may create greater security dangers than before as well as contravene the European Convention on Human Rights and exceed current cost projections; agrees with the main conclusion of the LSE study that the current identity card legislation must be abandoned, and calls on the Scottish Executive to comply with the terms of motion S2M-2463 by giving a full statement to Parliament on the intended use of the identity database by devolved institutions.
