 *S3M-4915 Pauline McNeill: Industrial Action at Capita—That the Parliament notes the industrial action being taken on 23 and 24 September 2009 by Unite members working for Capita Hartshead in Glasgow; considers that Unite members were previously forced into a one-day strike on 19 July 2009; is concerned that some of the lowest paid workers in the finance sector are compelled to take this action at a company that saw an 18% increase in operating profit in 2008 to £320 million and whose chief executive is the 9th highest paid chief executive in the United Kingdom, with earnings of £9.9 million according to The Guardian’s executive pay survey 2009, and calls on Capita to resolve this dispute with its workforce as soon as possible.
