 *S3M-2000 Patrick Harvie: Inquiry into the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route—That the Parliament notes the recent announcement by the Scottish Government to restrict the scope of what can be discussed at the forthcoming public local inquiry into the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route (AWPR), allowing only discussion on technical aspects of the road and disallowing any wider discussion on the AWPR project in principle or context; notes that the Scottish Government’s decision to restrict the scope of the public local inquiry into the AWPR means that a large number of the more than 10,000 objectors to the project will be disallowed from giving evidence to the public local inquiry, as their objections and arguments now lie outwith its scope; is concerned that the public local inquiry into the AWPR will not, therefore, consider the project’s spiralling and uncapped cost, its impact on local communities and the local environment, its context within wider transport policy, its impact on traffic levels and pollution, its proposed funding method through both and national and local government, and its relevance in the context of climate change and the spiralling cost of private motoring; considers the Scottish Government’s decision to restrict the scope of the public local inquiry into the AWPR to be a serious blow to public participation and local democracy, which undermines the aim of the Scottish Parliament to engage and involve the people of Scotland in planning and development issues, and calls on the Scottish Government to broaden the scope of the public local inquiry into the AWPR to include discussion and examination of all of the evidence available and relevant to it, including consideration of the principles underlying the proposal.
