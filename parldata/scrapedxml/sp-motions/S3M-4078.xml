*S3M-4078 Mike Pringle: Landlord Registration in Scotland, Three Years On—That the Parliament welcomes the report from Shelter Scotland, Landlord registration in Scotland: three years on, which examines the progress councils have made towards implementation of the landlord registration scheme to register all private landlords and agents; notes the concerns highlighted in the report that landlord registration is not yet fulfilling the expectations placed on it, and calls on the Scottish Government to review immediately the effectiveness of the landlord registration scheme in order to overcome the barriers preventing the system from working effectively, to clarify the aims of landlord registration to ensure that local authorities have the means and resources not only to administer the process of registering landlords but also to address worst practice and protect tenants, to ensure that tenants and landlords are fully aware of their renting rights and responsibilities and take action to get rid of the worst landlords and to introduce a mandatory tenant deposit scheme to protect tenants from rogue landlords.
