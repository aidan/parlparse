 *S3M-6063 Christina McKelvie: Making Children Participants, Not Pawns, in School Closure Consultations—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Participants, Not Pawns guidance by Scotland’s Commissioner for Children and Young People (SCCYP); believes that this guidance acts as an important complement to the Schools Consultation Act (Scotland) 2010 in helping local authorities to ensure that their schools closure consultations abide by the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, under which children are entitled to make their views known and have them taken seriously; agrees with SCCYP that it makes sense to give a central position to the views of children within a process that directly affects them, and commends SCCYP’s ongoing efforts to help Scotland’s public bodies engage more effectively, fairly and meaningfully with children and young people of all ages and abilities.
