 *S3M-7170 Jim Hume: ICC Cricket World Cup—That the Parliament notes with concern the International Cricket Council’s (ICC) Chief Executive Committee’s recent proposals to reduce the number of participants in the ICC Cricket World Cup from 14 sides to 10; considers that this will have a significant impact on the Scottish national side’s ability to qualify for the tournament to compete against the world’s best sides, as it did in 1999 and 2007; believes that the ICC Cricket World Cup performs an important function as an incentive to work toward for the largely amateur players who make up the national side as well as serving as a barometer of the national side’s progress on the international stage; considers it unfortunate that cricket’s premier international tournament is contracting when international events in competing sports are expanding, and calls on the International Cricket Council board to reject the proposal when it is brought before them for consideration.
