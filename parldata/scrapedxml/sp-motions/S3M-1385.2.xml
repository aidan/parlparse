*S3M-1385.2 Kenny MacAskill: Prisons Policy—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1385) in the name of Bill Aitken, leave out from first "with concern" to end and insert "that, while the offending rate has been falling, the number of people in prison currently stands at record levels and that Scotland has one of the highest imprisonment rates in the world; welcomes the McLeish Commission into Penal Policy and recognises that, in the case of serious and dangerous individuals, custody is the only appropriate punishment, and notes that the Scottish Government is committed to three new prisons and has increased investment in the prisons estate to an average of £120 million a year."
