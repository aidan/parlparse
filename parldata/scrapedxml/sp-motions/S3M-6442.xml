*S3M-6442 Pauline McNeill: Attack by Israeli Commandos on the Humanitarian Flotilla in International Waters Heading for Gaza—That the Parliament condemns the attack by Israeli commandos on the flotilla of six ships in international waters heading for Gaza and is shocked at the action that resulted in the deaths of innocent civilians and injury to others involved taking humanitarian aid to Gaza; notes with deepest concern the reaction around the world with an emergency meeting of the Arab League, protests from the Greek Government and condemnation from the Turkish Government and 27 European countries that have called on Israel to explain its actions; believes that this has critical repercussions for the peace process and world security; further believes that the blockade on Gaza has prevented most humanitarian aid reaching Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and that the ongoing siege is a key obstacle to peace in the region; believes that there must be an immediate and thorough investigation into this by the UN Security Council, and calls on the international community to wake up and take appropriate urgent action to hold Israel to account for its actions and save the peace process in the interest of world security and Palestinians and Israelis who want to live in lasting peace.
