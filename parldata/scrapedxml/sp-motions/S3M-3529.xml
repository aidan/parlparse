*S3M-3529 Cathie Craigie: Cumbernauld RFC—That the Parliament opposes the decision to eliminate Cumbernauld RFC from the Scottish Cup tournament; believes that it is a poor example to grassroots participants for clubs from the Scottish regional leagues to be removed from a competition in favour of teams from the national leagues; notes that research shows that matches at Murrayfield during the 2008-09 season will bring an estimated £50 million net spending to the Edinburgh economy; is disappointed that the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) does not recognise the economic benefits that Cumbernauld RFU’s participation in this tournament brings to the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth area, and calls on the SRU to reverse this unfair decision and allow Cumbernauld and St Boswell’s to play their postponed Scottish Cup matches.
