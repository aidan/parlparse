 *S3M-5479 Marlyn Glen: Parliamentarians’ Endorsement in Support of a Nuclear Weapons Convention—That the Parliament recognises the efforts of the UK Mayors for Peace Working Group and UK and Ireland Nuclear Free Local Authorities to support the signing of a nuclear weapons convention; asks Scottish parliamentarians to sign the Parliamentary Endorsement of the Nuclear Weapons Convention issued by these groups; believes that a nuclear weapons convention would incorporate, reinforce, link and build on existing non-proliferation and disarmament instruments, including the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, the Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty and the work of the International Atomic Energy Agency; encourages UN members to make a stronger commitment to develop a nuclear weapons convention by 2015 and to take steps to see the eventual abolition of nuclear weapons by 2020; notes that the Governments of Malaysia and Costa Rica have tabled a model nuclear weapons convention for this year’s Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference, and further notes that a large number of mayors and councillors from around the United Kingdom and all over the world have signed the similar Cities Appeal in Support of the Hiroshima-Nagasaki Protocol.
