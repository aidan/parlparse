*S3M-3064 Aileen Campbell: 10 Years of Crannog Services—That the Parliament notes the 10th anniversary of Aberlour’s multi-award-winning Crannog Service provision in the Dumfries and Galloway area; recognises the contribution that the service has made, through educational and social development, to the lives of many hundreds of vulnerable children and young people, most of whom are looked after and accommodated; applauds the good practice exhibited in its partnership with Dumfries and Galloway Council, which has led to considerable savings for the local authority; congratulates Aberlour’s Crannog Service on obtaining the status of preferred voluntary sector provider of choice of services to looked-after children and young people from Dumfries and Galloway Council; recognises the independent endorsements from HM Inspectorate of Education and from the University of Edinburgh, which praised it as "a good example of getting it right for every child in action", and believes that Aberlour’s Crannog Service’s relationship with Dumfries and Galloway Council is an excellent example of positive working relationships between local authorities and the voluntary sector.
