*S2M-4055 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Congratulations to Puerto Rico—That the Parliament congratulates the people of Puerto Rico on forcing the United States of America to remove its ships and planes from Puerto Rican waters in the face of local opposition to a major military exercise which would have resulted in the bombing and shelling of part of their coastline; recognises the benefits of having the powers to take such a decision that come from being an independent country and strongly regrets the fact that, due to the lack of these powers, the waters round the coast of Scotland are now being used for this military exercise; agrees that military exercises should not be dumped on Scotland when other countries assert their right to refuse to have them on their territory, and believes that the US military should use its own territory for bombing and shelling practice.
