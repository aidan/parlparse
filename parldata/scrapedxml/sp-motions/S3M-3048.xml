*S3M-3048 Alex Neil: North Lanarkshire Council Funding for Free School Meals—That the Parliament notes the overwhelming support in the Parliament for the provision of free school meals for children in primaries one, two and three; notes the success of such a policy in other countries such as Finland; notes that the administration spokespeople in North Lanarkshire Council have claimed that it has not been provided with the necessary funds by the Scottish Government to implement this policy; considers that this claim is without foundation as the Scottish Government is making the necessary funds available through the implementation of its historic concordat with local authorities, a position which has been confirmed by the leader of COSLA; believes that, in any case, North Lanarkshire has sufficient revenues to fund this policy as a result of its gross underestimation of its council tax receipts resulting from its underestimate of the number of houses in its catchment area, and calls on the administration of North Lanarkshire Council to stop its complaints and get on with the policy of implementing the Scottish Government’s progressive policy on school meals.
