*S3M-3056 Jackie Baillie: Rebuilding of Dumbarton Academy—That the Parliament acknowledges the urgent need to rebuild Dumbarton Academy, given that the condition of the building is in a significant state of disrepair; notes that this is the stated priority for West Dunbartonshire Council and is contained in its single outcome agreement, which is endorsed by the Scottish Government; welcomes the re-profiled capital spending of £260 million made available by the UK Government to the Scottish Government for 2008-09 and 2009-10; believes that the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth is right to prioritise this spending on schools, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to make the funds available to West Dunbartonshire Council to enable the rebuilding of Dumbarton Academy in 2009-10, recognising that any further delay will have a negative impact on the quality of the educational environment for a generation of young people from Dumbarton. Supported by: John Park*, David Whitton*, James Kelly*, Trish Godman* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
