*S2M-1245 Tommy Sheridan: Sunday Times "Rich List" and the Redistribution of Wealth-That the Parliament notes the findings of The Sunday Times annual "Rich List" survey published on 18 April 2004 which exposes the obscene and growing gap in wealth between the richest 1,000 and the ordinary people of Britain; recognises that the richest 1,000 are richer now than at any time in Britain's history and that their wealth has increased by 29.8% over the last 12 months to a collective amount of £202.4 billion, which is up from £115 billion over the last four years, and urgently demands the introduction of radical redistributive tax measures to close the obscene wealth gap in Scotland and fundamentally improve the living standards of the vast majority across Scotland, particularly pensioners and low-paid workers.
