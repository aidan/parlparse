*S2M-346 Christine Grahame: Borders Railway Fundingâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the lodging of the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill; notes that Stow is not to be included as a stop, although the projected time for the journey without that stop is now some 61 minutes from Galashiels to Edinburgh when in 1954 the same journey took 49 minutes; is concerned that this line requires to meet some, as yet unspecified, business case, a test not put with regard to other announced rail, road or tram developments and that accordingly no firm commitment has been given to this funding, and asks the Scottish Executive to detail the criteria for this business case now. Supported by: Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Mr Rob Gibson*, Ms Sandra White*, Brian Adam*, Michael Matheson*
