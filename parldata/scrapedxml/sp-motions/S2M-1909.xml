*S2M-1909 Susan Deacon: Parenting Across Scotland—That the Parliament notes that 25 to 31 October 2004 is National Parenting Week; notes the publication of a MORI poll, commissioned by Parenting Across Scotland (PAS), a multi-agency partnership led by Children 1st and funded by the Scottish Executive, the findings of which include that two-thirds of adults questioned believe that bringing up children today is more difficult than when they were young and that materialism and financial pressure, discipline, children’s safety and work-life balance are the main reasons for this, that love, affection and a good stable upbringing are seen as the most important factors in raising children and that over two-thirds of adults were not aware of any organisations that provide advice and support to parents, and believes that this poll, and other research being undertaken by PAS, should be used to inform policy and service development and help ensure that greater support is offered to parents and families across Scotland.
