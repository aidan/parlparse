*S3M-1824 Gil Paterson: Coinage for All Peoples—That the Parliament calls on the Royal Mint to think again with regard to its plans to issue coins using heraldic coats of arms that are exclusively English and condemns it for not including all constituent parts of the UK: Wales, Northern Ireland, Scotland and England, on any new issue; draws the attention of the UK Government to the fact that, if these plans go ahead, all legal tender will represent only one nation in the United Kingdom for the first time in history, and therefore demands that the UK Government intervenes to stop this insensitive decision.
