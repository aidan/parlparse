*S2M-1678 Robert Brown: Threat from Large Casinos—That the Parliament is concerned at the implications of the proposed new regime for casino and gambling regulation contained in the UK Gambling Bill and the worrying potential for an increase in gambling addiction; believes that large new casinos neither add long-term value to, nor create sustained economic benefit and lasting additional job opportunities for, local communities; notes the number of potential new casinos being proposed in the Glasgow area in particular; believes that large-scale casinos are not a good use of scarce urban land; does not wish to see Glasgow become the "Las Vegas" of Scotland, and urges the Scottish Executive and local authorities to put in place strict planning and licensing regimes that will discourage such developments.
