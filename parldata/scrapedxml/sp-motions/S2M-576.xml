*S2M-576# Elaine Smith: Proposed Closure of Queen Mother's Hospital, Glasgow-That the Parliament recognises the potential impact of the proposed closure of the Queen Mother's Hospital on maternity services provision in the Greater Glasgow area; notes with concern reports that suggest that the hospital's Breastfeeding Support Unit may be forced to close its breast milk bank as a result of such a move; acknowledges that the support unit has frequently been recognised as an example of best practice within this field, and considers that action should be taken to ensure that such a vital service is in no way jeopardised by the proposed changes to maternity services.
