*S3M-1214 Willie Coffey: Commemoration by the Scottish Clearing Banks of the 250th Anniversary of the Birth of Robert Burns—That the Parliament recognises the outstanding life and work of Scotland’s bard, Robert Burns; notes that the man, born in Ayrshire on 25 January 1759 to a Kincardineshire father and an Ayrshire mother, combined his inheritance of Scotland’s strong oral and musical traditions with a wide-ranging but restricted formal education; recognises his emergence as a poet through the publication of the Kilmarnock Edition of his poems on 31 July 1786 as a milestone in the development of Scottish culture; notes that, following his death in Dumfries on 21 July 1796, Burns was widely recognised as Scotland’s bard, a position he has commanded ever since; acknowledges that, through works such as A Man’s A Man for a’ That and Auld Lang Syne, Burns’ reputation and influence has spread across the globe, and calls on each of the note-issuing Scottish clearing banks to mark the 250th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns through the issuing of suitable commemorative notes.
