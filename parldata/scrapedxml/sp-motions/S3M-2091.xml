*S3M-2091 Alison McInnes: National Liftshare Day—That the Parliament regrets that there are approximately 38 million empty car seats on the United Kingdom’s roads every weekday; welcomes National Liftshare Day on 9 June 2008, which aims to raise the profile of car sharing and to encourage and enable more people to give it a try; believes that car sharing is a simple and effective way of increasing individual mobility, helping motorists keep down their travel costs, reducing congestion on the roads and helping the environment by cutting harmful exhaust emissions; notes that, as fuel prices escalate, car sharing offers the opportunity for individuals to save money as well as do their bit towards saving the planet, and encourages individuals, communities, organisations and businesses to make 9 June the day that they give car sharing a try.
