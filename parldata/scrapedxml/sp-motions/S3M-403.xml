*S3M-403♦ Cathie Craigie: End Unequal Scottish Home Loss Payments—That the Parliament notes that as of 1 September 2007 the maximum home loss payment to those displaced from their homes in England by compulsory purchase increased to £44,000, with the minimum amount paid increasing to £4,400; notes that the equivalent maximum home loss payment in Scotland is £15,000; views with concern that the last review of home loss payments in Scotland occurred in 1991; further notes that home loss payments in England have increased year-on-year since 2003; recognises that property values in Scotland have increased largely in line with those in England and Wales since 1991; regards with sympathy many people living in Cumbernauld who face compulsory purchase orders due to proposals such as the upgrade of the A80 and the demolition of the Ainslie/Maclehose scheme; believes that those facing compulsory purchase in Scotland deserve similar compensation to those in comparable situations elsewhere in the United Kingdom; strongly regrets the Scottish Executive’s disregard of a review of home loss payments initiated by the previous administration, and considers that an urgent review of the matter is necessary to end this Scottish inequity.
