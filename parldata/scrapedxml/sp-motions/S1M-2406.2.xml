*S1M-2406.2 Roseanna Cunningham: Reports into the Investigation, Legal Proceedings and Family Liaison Arrangements in the Case of the Murder of Surjit Singh Chhokarâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-2406) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, insert at end "; but further notes the serious concerns raised by both reports about the lack of resourcing of both the Crown Office and the Procurator Fiscal Service and the effect that has had on their ability to operate effectively; is concerned at the apparent confusion regarding the definition and existence of institutional racism emerging from the different conclusions of the two reports; deplores the personal attacks on named individuals contained within the Jandoo Report which seriously detracted from the important issues being investigated, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to establish a full public inquiry into the handling of the case, in order to restore public confidence in our prosecution services."
