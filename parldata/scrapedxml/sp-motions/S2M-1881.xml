 *S2M-1881 Shiona Baird: Energy Efficiency Week—That the Parliament welcomes Energy Efficiency Week between 25 and 31 October 2004 and recognises the report, Forecasting The Future, published by the Energy Saving Trust to launch the week; notes with concern the report’s findings that climate change could result in £200 billion of property and infrastructure damage from flooding and coastal erosion in the United Kingdom by 2050; notes with concern that Key Scottish Environment Statistics 2004, published by the Scottish Executive, shows that Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions which contribute to climate change are again increasing; notes with concern the lack of a specific Scottish target for reduction of greenhouse gas emissions; regards energy efficiency as an essential way of reducing emissions that contribute to climate change, and recognises that measures, such as improving the energy efficiency of Scotland’s housing stock, will also reduce the impact of fuel poverty but  also that any improvements in energy efficiency in the home are being undermined by transport policies that promote ever greater car use and more and more air travel and that support for action on energy efficiency by any group or political party must be matched by calls for abandoning road-building projects such as the M74 and the Aberdeen bypass and abandoning support for expanding air travel that will lead to increasing greenhouse gas emissions.
