 *S3M-1638.1 Margaret Smith: Fatal Accident Inquiries—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1638) in the name of Frank Mulholland, insert at end "considers that there is an urgent need to allow sheriffs to hold inquiries into the deaths of military personnel, normally domiciled in Scotland, who are killed in active service overseas, and therefore calls for this matter to be prioritised to allow urgent action to be taken so that the families of Scottish military personnel no longer have to suffer from the additional burden of attending coroners’ inquests in England."
