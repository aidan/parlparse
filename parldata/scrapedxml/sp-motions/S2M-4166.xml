*S2M-4166 Ms Sandra White: Early Morning Raids: Mary Semirimu—That the Parliament deplores the early morning raids which took Mary Semirimu and her two-year-old twins, Michelle and Michael, from their home to Dungavel detention centre and then to Yarl’s Wood from where they were due to be flown out to Uganda; recognises that Mary and her husband opposed the present Ugandan Government and campaigned vigorously for the Opposition; observes that in March 2003 their house was raided by Chief Military Intelligence officers where Mary, pregnant at the time, was given a serious beating and her husband taken away; records that Mary has not seen nor heard of him since; further recognises that the President of Uganda has blamed Ugandans abroad for spreading lies against his government; notes that whilst in Scotland Mary was a leading member of Karibu (welcome) in the African community, and suggests that to forcibly return her to Uganda where she will be in danger, not only from the Ugandan state authorities but also from a general lack of human rights, will blacken the good name of this country.
