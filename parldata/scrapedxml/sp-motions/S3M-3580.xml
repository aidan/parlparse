 *S3M-3580 Aileen Campbell: President Obama Announces Withdrawal of US Troops from Iraq—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by President Barack Obama that US forces will be substantially withdrawn from Iraq by August 2010 and that all US troops will have left by the end of 2011; notes that this decision implements one of President Obama’s key election promises; believes that the announcement will be widely welcomed by all those who, along with President Obama, have consistently opposed the conflict in Iraq, unlike UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown MP, who voted for military action in 2003, and calls on all interested parties to continue working for stability and peace in Iraq and the wider Middle East.
