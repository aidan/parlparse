 *S3M-3035 Bill Wilson: European Parliament Civil Liberties Committee’s Recognition of Right to be Educated in and Speak Scots and Gaelic—That the Parliament, further to motion S3M-3022 in the name of Jamie Hepburn (European Parliament Committee’s Concern at Human Rights Abuses), welcomes the desire of the European Parliament’s Civil Liberties Committee to promote regional or minority languages, and specifically the statement that it believes that "the right to speak and to be educated in one’s mother tongue is one of the most basic fundamental rights", and accordingly expresses the opinion that failure to provide education in Scots and Gaelic to the children of native speakers of these languages should be considered a breach of human rights.
