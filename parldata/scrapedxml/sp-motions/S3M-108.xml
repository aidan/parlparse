*S3M-108 George Foulkes: Tesco Distribution Depot Workers, Livingston—That the Parliament expresses its deep concern that drivers at the Tesco distribution plant, Livingston, have been threatened with dismissal unless they accept new terms and conditions under a plant relocation proposal; notes that the proposed new depot is to be located just 500 yards from the existing site; further notes that it is possible that drivers will lose up to £5000 from their annual incomes despite the supermarket giant recently announcing record annual profits of £2.5 billion; strongly supports the drivers’ unanimously approved industrial action to uphold their terms and conditions and the drivers’ union, Unite T&amp;G Section, in its ongoing efforts to uphold the local agreement and reach a negotiated settlement; condemns Tesco’s attempts to break the strike through use of non-union and unaware migrant labour, and acknowledges that Tesco may be using the Livingston site to undermine the workforce’s terms and conditions and that failure to reach a mutual conclusion could result in prolonged national industrial action.
