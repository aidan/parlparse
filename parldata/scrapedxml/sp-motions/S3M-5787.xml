* S3M-5787 Jamie Stone: Highland Rheumatology Unit in Dingwallâ€”That the Parliament notes the high quality work being carried out at the Highland Rheumatology Unit in Dingwall; recognises that this unique service is vital to many people right across the Highlands; is deeply concerned, however, that a review of the service by NHS Highland would potentially reduce the service drastically and believes that this would seriously impact on locally accessible patient treatment and care, and, accordingly, urges the Scottish Government to liaise with NHS Highland to ensure that this service is maintained at its current level.
