 *S3M-6560 Sandra White: The Dead Deserve Dignity—That the Parliament expresses concern over the practice of local authorities burying the dead in communal graves of up to five bodies because the families cannot afford their own funeral due to poverty and the recession; believes this to be a Victorian-era practice of paupers’ graves that has no place in today’s society, and calls on local authorities to reconsider their burial practices out of respect for the dead and their families.
