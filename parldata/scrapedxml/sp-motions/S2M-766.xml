*S2M-766# Helen Eadie: Workers' Educational Association-That the Parliament notes that the Workers' Educational Association (WEA) is celebrating its centenary year; admires the significant contribution that the WEA has made across the UK in its history in helping to shape the lives of so many individuals, many of whom have progressed to make a real difference to their community and wider society; notes the confidence that has been built as a consequence in socially and economically deprived communities where family and social problems are acute, and, in recognition of the significant achievements that have been made and continue to be made by the WEA, encourages all public agencies across Scotland to help and support the WEA in the coming century in every way possible.
