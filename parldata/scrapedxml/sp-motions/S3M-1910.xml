*S3M-1910 Bill Wilson: National Staff Dismissal Register—That the Parliament deplores the establishment of a National Staff Dismissal Register by Action Against Business Crime; agrees with trade unions and civil liberties campaigners that the scheme has great potential for abuse as it allows unscrupulous employers to make unsubstantiated accusations that could devastate the lives of innocent people; further notes that victims of this scheme might be unaware that they had been blacklisted and would have no right of appeal, and therefore believes that in order to protect human rights the scheme should be scrapped immediately.
