*S2M-4783 Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Action on Anti-Semitism—That the Parliament notes the findings of Westminster’s All Party Parliamentary Inquiry into Anti-Semitism which was established to investigate the nature and extent of contemporary anti-Semitism throughout the United Kingdom; is disturbed at the rise in anti-Semitic incidents in the UK and the fact that this has been exacerbated by the war in the Middle East, and calls on the Scottish Executive to implement the group’s recommendations, including applying the same victim-orientated standard to identifying anti-Semitic incidents as to other racist incidents, better education about anti-Semitism in schools, a crackdown on anti-Jewish activity on university campuses, action to prevent the spread of anti-Semitic material online, the provision of funding for physical security measures at minority places of worship and the provision of funding for projects that aim to develop good interfaith and intercommunal relations.
