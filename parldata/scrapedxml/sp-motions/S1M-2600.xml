*S1M-2600# Ms Sandra White: Glasgow to Edinburgh Rail Service—That the Parliament notes with concern the current ScotRail dispute and the resulting cut in the Glasgow to Edinburgh route to a half hourly rail service; urges the Scottish Executive to make urgent representations to ScotRail to resolve the dispute and to ensure the earliest possible reintroduction of the 15 minute service, and recognises the necessity for Scotland’s largest two conurbations to be linked by the best possible rail service.
