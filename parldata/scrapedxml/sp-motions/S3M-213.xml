*S3M-213 Pauline McNeill: Affordable Housing for All—That the Parliament reaffirms its commitment to making housing affordable for all; notes that, despite increases in funding over the last 10 years and limited reform of the right to buy, many families living in overcrowded accommodation are currently waiting years for suitable offers from social landlords; believes that there is a severe shortage of housing for social rent in some areas, such as in the west end of Glasgow and other high-demand areas where housing provision is driven by developers’ desire to provide only high-return accommodation, resulting in families and individuals being forced out of areas where they have a strong family or community connection; further notes that there are no legal requirements on local authorities or any other agencies to ensure a sustainable housing mix that would include affordable housing to both buy and rent, and calls on Scottish ministers to examine urgently affordable housing policy in order to ensure the availability of affordable homes in every part of Scotland.
