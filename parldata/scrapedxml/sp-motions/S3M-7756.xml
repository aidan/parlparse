*S3M-7756♦ Sandra White: Healthy Living Centres and Community Empowerment—That the Parliament supports the work of healthy living centres such as the Annexe in Partick, Glasgow, in their promotion of community-led approaches to health improvement in disadvantaged communities; notes the publication of Health in Scotland 2009 Time for Change: Annual Report of the Chief Medical Officer, which suggests a more community-based approach to health promotion that focuses on empowering people in society to cope with everyday stresses as opposed to the current deficit-model of healthcare which, the report argues, tends to produce high levels of dependence on hospital and welfare services; believes that healthy living centres have been hugely successful in promoting the self-empowerment of local communities, allowing them to identify and respond to their specific needs; believes that, in turn, this increases the sense of health and wellbeing in communities and decreases their reliance on external support, and would welcome proposals being brought forward to ensure that healthy living centres remain at the heart of community empowerment.
