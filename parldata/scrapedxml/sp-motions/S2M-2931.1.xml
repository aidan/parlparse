*S2M-2931.1 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Health Issues with Specific Reference to the Kerr Report—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2931) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from "believes" to end and insert "commends the staff within the NHS for their hard work and dedication; believes that, to tackle waiting times more quickly, there is a need to set up fast-track diagnostic and treatment centres within the NHS, and welcomes the Kerr report’s emphasis on addressing health inequalities in order to close the health gap that currently exists in Scotland."
