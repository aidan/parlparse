*S3M-8191 Elaine Smith: Hypothyroidism—That the Parliament notes that 17% of women over the age of 60 will experience some form of hypothyroidism; considers that the issue of thyroid disorders is an important gender issue as women are five times more likely to have such a disorder than men; believes that many very ill people with thyroid dysfunction are not being correctly diagnosed by general practitioners; notes that Dr Anthony Toft, a world-renowned and highly respected Scottish endocrinologist, believes that doctors should take a whole-picture approach that takes into consideration all of the patient’s symptoms and does not rely entirely on test results; believes that this approach is particularly important in patients who have a lack of triiodothyronine as tests can show that their thyroxine levels are satisfactory thus leading to GPs’ wrongly concluding that a patient’s thyroid function is within the normal range; understands that variations in the strength and quality of a drug such as thyroxine can impact negatively on a patient’s health thus making it unsuitable for generic prescribing; believes that it is vital that the views of the patient are taken on board in the spirit of partnership in patient care; considers that in many cases it may be more effective to prescribe a combined course of triiodothyronine (T3) and thyroxine (T4), and calls for more research into the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid disorders.
