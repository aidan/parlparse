 *S2M-5525♦ Scott Barrie: Switch Off Energy Debt—That the Parliament expresses concern at the high level of energy debt in Scotland; notes from the most recent figures published by Ofgem that 343,617 customers in Dunfermline and elsewhere owe their energy supplier an average of £181; further notes that energy prices remain high, with Scottish consumers typically paying more than £1,000 per year for their gas and electricity; is concerned that, according to Ofgem, the number of disconnections from energy supply has risen by 285% between September 2005 and September 2006, and believes that all energy suppliers should take urgent action to address the burden of debt on Scotland’s most vulnerable households.
