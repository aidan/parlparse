*S3M-970# Sandra White: Labour Failure to Act Against Post Office Closures—That the Parliament shares the continuing concern of Glasgow MSPs Sandra White, Bill Kidd, Bob Doris and Bashir Ahmad at the uncertainty and distress created by the proposed post office closures in Glasgow; further notes the recent consultation presented to the Post Office and the Scottish Government on behalf of the Glasgow SNP MSPs, which found that over 99% of respondents felt that their local post office was an essential service and that they would have difficulty accessing post office facilities if their local post office closed; condemns the behaviour of the Glasgow Labour MPs for their failure to even turn up for the debate on Post Office restructuring on 29 November 2007 in the House of Commons; considers that this further compounds their earlier disingenuous stance of informing Glasgow residents that they were against the closures when in fact Glasgow Labour MPs voted in favour of recommendations for closure, and believes that the people of Glasgow have been let down by their elected representatives and that actions such as these and others by the Labour Party serve to further erode public trust and confidence in politicians. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Michael Matheson*, Alasdair Allan*, Bashir Ahmad*, Kenneth Gibson*, Christine Grahame*
