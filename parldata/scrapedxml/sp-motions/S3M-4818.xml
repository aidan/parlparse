 *S3M-4818 Jackie Baillie: Urgent Investment Required for the A83 and A82—That the Parliament notes the current landslip at the Rest and Be Thankful that has resulted in the closure of the A83; acknowledges that this is the second occasion in recent times that a similar problem has caused this road to be closed; further notes that a diversion of some 60 miles is in place for motorists; believes that the road closure will have a detrimental impact on those residents and businesses that rely on this route; recognises the vulnerability of trunk road links to the West Highlands, including the A82, and believes that the case for investment has been well made, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that the A83 is reopened quickly and that investment is provided without further delay to ensure that, where possible, there is no repetition of the problems on the A83 and that the A82 is upgraded.
