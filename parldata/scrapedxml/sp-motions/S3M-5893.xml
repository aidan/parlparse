 *S3M-5893 Mary Scanlon: Congratulations to Moray Carers’ Project—That the Parliament congratulates Moray Carers’ Project, part of the Princess Royal Trust for Carers Network, on its recent £50,000 award from the Long-Term Conditions Alliance; considers that this award will enable it to further develop support for unpaid carers in Moray; notes that through the appointment of a digital storyteller the project will be able to produce films in which carers share their experience, concerns and needs, and believes that this will have a number of outcomes, including the creation of a resource that can be used to raise carer awareness among professionals and the wider public, while supporting the sustainability of the project through a possible social enterprise venture.
