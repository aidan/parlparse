*S2M-358 Campbell Martin: Dr Henry Faulds - Pioneer of Fingerprintingâ€”That the Parliament acknowledges the pioneering work carried out by Scotsman Dr Henry Faulds in the scientific study of fingerprints; recognises that Dr Faulds, who was born in Beith, Ayrshire, in 1843, first published his findings on the forensic application of fingerprinting in the Nature Magazine in 1880, some years ahead of contemporaries in the field, and therefore should be recognised as the true pioneer of fingerprinting, and acknowledges the work of the Dr Henry Faulds - Beith Commemorative Society in seeking to recognise the work and achievements of Dr Faulds by securing funds to provide a permanent memorial in the town.
