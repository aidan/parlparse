 *S3M-1750 Peter Peacock: Lewis Windfarm Proposal—That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Government to recognise the loss of economic opportunity, local jobs potential and income to local communities that will result from the Lewis windfarm proposal not proceeding; notes that ministers refused the application on grounds founded on protection of the environment; urges the Scottish Government to ensure that the Western Isles receives additional capital investment and additional annual income to balance that which would have arisen from the project proceeding; further urges conservation organisations which opposed the application to invest significantly more of their assets in the Western Isles and to work with government and local people to invest in better management and enhancement of the habitat of the moorland and to ensure better interpretation, leisure opportunities for more visitors and local jobs, and urges the Scottish Government to work closely with Comhairle nan Eilean Siar to secure investment in windfarm and other renewable energy proposals that they will be prepared to approve.
