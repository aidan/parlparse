*S2M-4902 Bill Butler: Concern Over Continuing Use of Dawn Raids—That the Parliament expresses profound concern in respect of the dawn raid which was carried out on Wednesday 27 September 2006 on the Benai family from Algeria; notes that Oussama Benai, who is 11 years old and attends St Brendan’s Primary School in the Glasgow Anniesland Constituency, was removed from his home during this raid, along with his mother and sister; recognises the trauma that the use of such unacceptable methods of removal causes to the children of asylum seeker families and the wider local community of which they are part; urges Scottish ministers, in discussion with their Westminster counterparts, to ensure that the agreement announced on 27 March 2006 be strictly adhered to and not, as in this case, ignored, and encourages the Scottish Executive to make certain that, in future, the professional input from health, social work and education professionals, a central aspect of the agreement, be followed to the letter.
