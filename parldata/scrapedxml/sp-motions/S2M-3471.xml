*S2M-3471 Trish Godman: Tribute to Rosa Parks, American Civil Rights Campaigner—That the Parliament pays tribute to Rosa Parks, the black American civil rights campaigner, who died on 24 October 2005, named by Time magazine as one of the 100 most important people in the history of the United States of America; acknowledges that, from that historic day in 1995 when she refused to move from the “white” section of a bus in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks was, for all of her life, a staunch, courageous and passionate advocate of a peaceful strategy of non-violence in the campaign to secure civil rights for black American citizens, and is of the view that this advocacy, combined with her moral courage, inspired millions of other people peacefully to support the Civil Rights Movement, that she rightly deserved the Congressional Gold Medal, awarded to her by President Clinton, and that she will long remain an inspirational figure for all those committed to a non-violent strategy for democratic advancement.
