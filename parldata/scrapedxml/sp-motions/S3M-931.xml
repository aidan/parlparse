*S3M-931 Murdo Fraser: Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders in Aden 40th Anniversary—That the Parliament notes that the 27 November 2007 marks the 40th anniversary of UK withdrawal from Aden after the Aden Emergency; praises and commemorates the British soldiers that served in Aden and recognises the important role that Scottish regiments played in the war; in particular notes the famous actions of Lt-Col Colin Mitchell and the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, which saw Mitchell lead the regiment back into the Crater area of Aden in July 1967 to recover the bodies of fallen British soldiers and take control of the district of about 80,000 people without a single British casualty; recognises that the regiment’s actions helped avoid a security breakdown in the area which was happening elsewhere in Aden, and believes that the Ministry of Defence must do more to remember and commemorate the lesser-known wars that the United Kingdom fought in during the 20th century and that the valour and actions of the soldiers who fought in Aden and other lesser-known wars must never be forgotten.
