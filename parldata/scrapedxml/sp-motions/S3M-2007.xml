*S3M-2007 Keith Brown: Sort it out - Securing the Future of the Postal Service—That the Parliament expresses its support for the Communication Workers Union (CWU) in its campaign to protect the future of Royal Mail Group plc and its workers; agrees that the introduction of competition has had seriously negative effects, as outlined by both CWU and the independent review of the process; believes that this is highly relevant after further post office closures have been announced across a swathe of Scotland from Alloa to Aberdeenshire; supports CWU’s call for a wholesale examination of the funding package received by Royal Mail Group, and hopes for a conclusion to the current disagreement over employees’ pensions between the Royal Mail Group and CWU that is rapid, constructive and successful.
