 * S2M-2947 Patrick Harvie:Glasgow Air Safety Plan—That the Parliament notes with concern the Scottish Executive’s failure to submit a detailed air safety plan for Glasgow to the European Commission, despite the deadline for this submission passing more than a year ago; notes that the Executive and the UK Government may now face significant fines for ignoring the European Commission’s demand for a detailed air safety plan; notes that levels of PM10 pollution in Glasgow exceed government safety limits; is concerned that Glasgow has the worst record in the United Kingdom in terms of growth in air pollution; finds it unacceptable that in one part of the city levels of air pollution have actually soared by more than 25%, despite the introduction of an Air Quality Action Plan by Glasgow City Council; believes that the council must introduce stronger traffic reduction measures and radically improve public transport in Glasgow so as not to continue endangering the health of Glaswegians, and calls on the Executive to explain why it missed the deadline for the submission of an air safety action plan to the European Commission, to commit to a timescale for submitting the plan and to state how much this is expected to cost the taxpayer if fines are sought by the Commission.
