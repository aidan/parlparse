 *S1M-3839 Trish Godman: The Madrid Declaration-That the Parliament commends the active involvement of Scottish members of the European Disability Forum in publishing the Madrid Declaration in this European Year of Disabled People; agrees with its authors that disability is a human rights issue, that people with disabilities seek equal opportunity, not charity, and that people in Scotland with disabilities are invisible citizens; supports their view that local authorities, employers, trade unions, educationalists and national authorities should be doing much more to ensure that people with disabilities enter the labour market as equals and that their employment should be based on equality in relation to terms, conditions and opportunities for promotion; endorses the Madrid Declaration, and calls on the Scottish Executive to pledge its support for the declaration.
