*S2M-4097 Margaret Smith: Sportscotland—That the Parliament recognises the findings of a report by PMP Consultants that moving sportscotland from its current location in Edinburgh would result in the loss of personnel; understands that the particular expertise of sportscotland’s professional and technical staff means that loss of personnel would make the agency’s role more difficult to execute; is concerned that any move could be detrimental to Scotland’s bid to host the Commonwealth Games in 2014, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should give further consideration to the case for retaining sportscotland at its current location.
