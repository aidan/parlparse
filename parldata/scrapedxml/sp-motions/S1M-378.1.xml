*S1M-378.1 Andrew Wilson: Draft 2000-01 Budget - Level Two Figures—As an amendment to motion (S1M-378) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, leave out from "commends" to end and insert "notes the increased pressure being placed on the Scottish budget through the effects of the "Barnett Squeeze", which means that spending is increased two and a half times quicker in England than in Scotland despite the fact that there is no evidence of a reduction in relative need; calls upon the Scottish Executive to prepare a detailed assessment of the impact of the "Barnett Squeeze" in consultation with the Finance Committee; regrets the fact that the Parliament is not responsible for raising the revenue it allocates, and notes that normal fiscal autonomy would secure maximum fiscal responsibility and accountability and would allow the Scottish Parliament to allocate the required resources for Scottish public services".
