*S2M-27 Tommy Sheridan: Fire Service Dispute—That the Parliament applauds the professionalism of Scotland’s fire service personnel who deliver daily a first-class service to Scotland’s citizens; supports the right of free trade unions to negotiate and bargain on behalf of their members and to engage democratically in collective action up to, and including, strike action; rejects any plan to impose a settlement of the current fire service dispute as a profoundly undemocratic and provocative action unacceptable in a modern democracy, and believes that the finance must be found to reward properly the fire service personnel for the essential job they do without reducing the quality and resources of the service.
