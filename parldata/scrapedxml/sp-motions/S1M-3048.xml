*S1M-3048 Cathy Jamieson: Helping Scotland's Youth Participate in Communities—That the Parliament notes the Scottish Executive’s commitment to valuing young people and reflecting their aspirations and needs; recognises the importance of the Scottish Youth Summit and the follow-up launch of the consultation toolkit "Re:action" in contributing to this agenda; agrees to support constructive work with young people as they engage in civic society and democratic processes whether at local level through local authority youth councils, or at national level through organisations such as the Scottish Youth Parliament, and welcomes work by the Executive alongside other devolved administrations and UK departments to develop the UK approach to the European Union white paper on youth and to ensure that young people from Scotland can contribute in the wider arena of international affairs. Supported by: Ms Margaret Curran*, Nicol Stephen*
