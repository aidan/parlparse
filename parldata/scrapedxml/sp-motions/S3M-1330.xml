 *S3M-1330 Jackson Carlaw: Proposed Go Ape High Wire Adventure Facility in Pollok Country Park—That the Parliament accepts the idea of a Go Ape high wire adventure facility in an appropriate location but, given that Pollok Country Park is environmentally, socially and culturally unique, is extremely concerned by Glasgow City Council’s decision in February 2007 to grant a 21-year lease of sites in the North Wood, a natural unspoilt forest within the park, to Adventure Forest Ltd without consulting Pollok Country Park users or the local councillor at the time; questions the validity of the public consultation subsequently carried out by the council’s Land and Environmental Services in the summer of 2007 in which local residents considered that they were denied their proper right to have a say on the proposal; believes with dismay that Glasgow City Council politicians and officials have shown a complete disregard for the overwhelming opposition to this proposal from the local community and residents across Greater Glasgow, and urges Glasgow City Council to reconsider these ill-thought-out plans by going back to the drawing board and conducting a fresh consultation which would allow a new site to be considered as more appropriate for Go Ape, thus ensuring that the people of Greater Glasgow and the many visitors from elsewhere across the country can continue to enjoy the peace and tranquillity of the North Wood of Pollok Country Park, one of the greatest gifts given to the people of Glasgow, the west of Scotland and beyond.
