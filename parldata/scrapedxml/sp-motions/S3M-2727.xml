*S3M-2727 Shirley-Anne Somerville: No Place for BNP in Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament is pleased to note that the British National Party (BNP) was unable to find a candidate for the council by-election for the Edinburgh Forth ward on 6 November 2008; believes there is no place for racist and fascist ideology in Scottish politics; welcomes the fact that the many ethnic minority citizens in the area will not be faced with BNP propaganda stirring up racial division, hatred and fear; believes that all members of Scottish society must stand together against the politics of fear and hatred and work to tackle the common enemy of poverty, and calls on politicians from all parties to unite in opposition to any presence in Scotland of the BNP.
