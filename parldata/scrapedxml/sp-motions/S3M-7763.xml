*S3M-7763 John Scott: Potential Disadvantage for Scottish Egg Producers—That the Parliament is concerned that EU animal welfare legislation introducing a ban on the use of conventional cages for laying hens might not be enforced equally across the EU member states from 1 January 2012; believes that this will be disadvantageous to the Scottish and British egg industries, which it understands have already incurred significant costs in meeting the requirements of the legislation by investing in enriched cages or non-cage systems of egg production; notes that the United Kingdom is already the largest free-range egg producer in the EU; further notes that eggs produced to a lower animal welfare standard are cheaper to produce and might be allowed access to Scottish and British markets post-2012, and is of the view that, once again, Scottish and UK farmers will be put at a competitive disadvantage by producing eggs to the highest EU-agreed animal welfare standards while farmers in other member states are unlikely to be able to meet the deadline and that they might be allowed additional time to phase out the use of conventional cages post-2012.
