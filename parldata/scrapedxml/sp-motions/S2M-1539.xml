*S2M-1539 Mike Pringle: Death Sentences Imposed on Medical Staff in Libya-That the Parliament expresses great sympathy and support for the children affected by the tragic HIV infection at al-Fateh Children's Hospital, Benghazi, Libya; urges the Libyan authorities to recognize the evidence and address the possibility that the children were infected with HIV because of poor health care resources and practices at the above hospital and not by intentional transmission by the accused Bulgarian and Palestinian health workers; notes that the Benghazi Criminal Court ignored testimonies of expert witnesses such as Professor Luc Montagnier, who stated that the epidemic was caused by the poor hygiene at the hospital and had begun before any of the accused had started work there; further notes the deeply disturbing reports that the health workers were tortured into false confessions, and condemns the death sentences imposed on the five Bulgarian nurses and a Palestinian doctor.
