 *S1M-1243.1 Robin Harper: SSSI, SPA and SAC Designations-As an amendment to motion (S1M-1243) in the name of John Scott, leave out from "notes" to end and insert "welcomes the significant increase in proposed designation of Sites of Special Scientific Interest, Special Protection Areas (SPAs) and Special Areas of Conservation (SAC) made during the last year under Natura 2000 and covering more than 8% of Scotland's landmass; notes that the position is modest when compared with, for example, Denmark which has over 22% of its land designated as SPAs and Finland where 14% of its land is proposed as an SAC; asks the Scottish Executive to confirm the scientific basis for these designations, which are selected according to European law; further notes that future European funding will be targeted at such Natura 2000 sites, and therefore regrets the relatively small designation rate in Scotland given our outstanding natural heritage and the opportunity to benefit from such European funding."
