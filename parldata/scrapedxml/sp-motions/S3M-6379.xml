 *S3M-6379 Jim Tolson: Electrical Safety Council—That the Parliament recognises the work of the Electrical Safety Council (ESC), a charity committed to reducing the number of deaths and injuries resulting from electrical accidents at home and work; welcomes the publication by ESC of the Landlords’ Guide to Electrical Safety, published to help protect tenants and property from the dangers of electric shock and fire, and further welcomes the charity’s new campaign to increase the use in properties across Scotland of residual-current devices to automatically cut the power when electrical dangers arise.
