 *S3M-4963 Bob Doris: United Against Racism—That the Parliament expresses deep concern at the activities of the group calling itself the English Defence League, which was recently involved in a demonstration outside the Harrow Central Mosque in London; notes the stated intention of this group to demonstrate in Glasgow in November; applauds the efforts of Manchester City Council in its attempts to halt the group from repeating such scenes in Manchester and offers to support any similar action by Glasgow City Council, Strathclyde Police and local community groups in minimising the chances of such an unedifying disturbance going ahead in Glasgow; affirms that protesters of all opposing persuasions are encouraged to make their voices heard in Scotland’s democracy, and distinguishes clearly between legitimate causes and trouble-making gangs whose sole pursuit is to intimidate and cause hurt. Supported by: Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Alasdair Allan*, Aileen Campbell*, Patrick Harvie*, Rob Gibson*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Brian Adam*
