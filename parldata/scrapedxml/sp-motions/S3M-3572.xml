*S3M-3572 Hugh Henry: Access to Small Claims—That the Parliament notes Ian Hamilton’s claim of negligence against the Royal Bank of Scotland; regrets the decision by Sheriff Simon Pender that prevents Ian Hamilton from pursuing his case in the small claims court; believes that this prevents ordinary people from pursuing legitimate claims at reasonable expense, and calls for a review of procedures to allow such claims to be heard in the small claims court.
