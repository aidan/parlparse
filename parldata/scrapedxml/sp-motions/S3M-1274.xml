 *S3M-1274 Alex Neil: Keeping Accident and Emergency Services Local—That the Parliament welcomes the recent decision by NHS Lanarkshire to retain full accident and emergency services at Monklands Hospital; further welcomes the NHS board’s commitment to move towards the delivery of the new Airdrie health centre, the Monklands mental health unit and the Lanarkshire cancer centre; notes that none of this would have been possible had an SNP Government not been returned at the elections in May; condemns the previous administration’s attempt to push through an ill-thought out proposal against the express wishes of the people who elected it; notes that majority medical opinion supports the retention of Monklands accident and emergency, and congratulates the residents of Lanarkshire for their long and hard-fought campaign to keep their accident and emergency services local.
