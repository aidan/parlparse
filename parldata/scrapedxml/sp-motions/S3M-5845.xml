*S3M-5845 Joe FitzPatrick: Celebrating 10 Years of Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency—That the Parliament notes that the Cross-Party Group in the Scottish Parliament on Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency will mark its 10th anniversary on 5 April 2010; considers that it has a unique role as a forum for the exchange of ideas and development of policy, bringing together parliamentarians and representatives from industry, academia, non-governmental organisations and civic society over the first 10 years of the Parliament; congratulates its 700-plus membership for their support for the efficient use of sustainable energy for the economic, environmental and social good of Scotland, and applauds Robin Harper’s role as the longest continuously-serving convener of a cross-party group in the Scottish Parliament.
