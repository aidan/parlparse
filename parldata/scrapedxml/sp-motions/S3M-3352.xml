*S3M-3352# Bob Doris: Good Morning Glasgow Doing a Great Job for Glaswegiansâ€”That the Parliament acknowledges the tremendous contribution that the Good Morning Project, also known as Good Morning Glasgow and based in Possilpark in the north of Glasgow, has made to the lives of many vulnerable Glaswegians; congratulates it on its award-winning telephone-based befriending service whereby trained staff call clients at a pre-arranged time each morning and often in the afternoon and evening; believes that the service contributes to better mental health, reduces isolation, promotes social inclusion and potentially enables elderly and vulnerable people to stay in their own homes for longer; notes that formal evaluations show that 100% of clients reported reduced feelings of isolation and exclusion along with improved feelings of safety; further acknowledges that the lowest rating was 97% of clients who believed that the service gave peace of mind to family and friends; believes that this demonstrates the invaluable contribution Good Morning Glasgow makes to individuals and the community as a whole, and considers that similar services could benefit people throughout Scotland.
