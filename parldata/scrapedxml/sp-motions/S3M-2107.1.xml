 *S3M-2107.1 Aileen Campbell: The Scottish Government’s Welcome U-Turn—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2107) in the name of Claire Baker, leave out from first "u-turn" to end and insert "decision to close the legislative loophole left by the previous administration which would have required immediate repayment of the graduate endowment by postgraduate students; believes that it was wrong of the previous administration to fail to legislate for the position of postgraduate students faced with the graduate endowment tuition fee; further believes that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning’s actions represent speedy and decisive action by a government committed to the principle of free education; recalls that it was the Labour Party that abolished free higher education in the first place, and urges all parties in the Parliament to support the principle of free education."
