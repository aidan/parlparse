 *S1M-3125# Johann Lamont: National Carers' Week, 10-16 June 2002-That the Parliament notes that 10-16 June 2002 has been designated as National Carers' Week and welcomes the opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate the crucial role of carers within the Glasgow Pollok constituency, in Glasgow and across Scotland; recognises the central role of carers in providing support for people who are frail or who have a disability which otherwise would cost social and health care services in Scotland in excess of £5 billion and, as shown in recent research by Carers Scotland, in contributing to the broader life of local communities; accepts that the demands of caring can often lead to social exclusion; invites the Scottish Executive and MSPs to ensure that the role of carers is addressed across all Scottish Executive departments and across the responsibilities of the committees of the Parliament, and asks all those with a statutory responsibility to consult and engage with carers so as to do everything in their power to ensure that the expertise, knowledge and commitment of carers are harnessed in the important work of securing social justice for carers and those for whom they care.
