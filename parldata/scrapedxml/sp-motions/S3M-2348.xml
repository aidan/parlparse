 *S3M-2348 Joe FitzPatrick: Unjust Youth Football Team Demotionsâ€”That the Parliament expresses concern over the unjust decision by the Scottish Football Association (SFA) to demote the Dundee youth team, along with Dunfermline Athletic and Ross County, from the elite performance level of its Youth Football initiative; notes that the decision to demote Dundee was made on a technicality as a second youth licence holder was not employed at the club for a few weeks due to an employee moving on and a new licence holder taking time to recruit; understands that the decisions made against Dunfermline and Ross County were due to a technicality in disclosure of which they were not informed until an audit but have now rectified; notes with concern reports that the SFA have allowed Scottish Premier League (SPL) clubs to remain at performance level even though these clubs do not meet the criteria; regrets the impact that this decision will have, leading to reduced playing opportunities for budding young local footballers in Dundee, a reduction in youth development creating a gap between clubs outwith the SPL and the possible demise of youth development at Dundee FC; calls on the SFA to revisit its decision on the demotion of these three teams, and urges the Scottish Government, which provides the funding for the elite performance level Youth Football initiative, to investigate this matter.
