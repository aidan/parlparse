*S2M-361# Richard Lochhead: Lack of Affordable Rural Housing in North East Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament is concerned by the lack of affordable housing available for renting or buying in rural communities in the north east and elsewhere in the country; notes that in Aberdeenshire alone 6000 households await suitable housing; further notes that local people are often priced out of their own communities due to the rising and exorbitant cost of property and land, and considers that the Scottish Executive should bring forward radical and innovative measures to address those issues at the root of this situation such as a review of planning regimes, diversification of land ownership, appropriate funding mechanisms and the need for more compulsory purchase orders.
