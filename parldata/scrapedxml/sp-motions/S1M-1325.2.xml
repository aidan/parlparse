 *S1M-1325.2 Mr Brian Monteith: Sport-As an amendment to motion (S1M-1325) in the name of Mr Sam Galbraith, insert at end "and urges the Executive to consider how it may best assist the objective of Euro 2008 being held in Scotland; recognises that sports such as swimming will require additional investment if participants are to realise their full potential, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to lobby Her Majesty's Government to use the ending of the Millennium Fund to return the share of lottery funds going towards sport in Scotland to the levels that existed when the share of National Lottery funding for sport, art, heritage and culture was 20% rather than the 16.7% that has been in place since the Labour Government introduced its New Opportunities Fund."
