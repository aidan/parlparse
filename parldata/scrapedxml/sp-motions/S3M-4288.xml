*S3M-4288 Sarah Boyack: The Edinburgh Diversity Cup 2009—That the Parliament welcomes the third annual Edinburgh Diversity Cup, a five-a-side charity football competition to be held on Saturday 20 June 2009 at the Edinburgh Corn Exchange; notes that the proceeds from this event will go towards the Hope into Homes project in Malawi, an Edinburgh-based project operating with the assistance of the Edinburgh Inter-Faith Association in partnership with Habitat for Humanity to fund a multi-faith and multi-cultural team from Edinburgh to travel to Malawi to work in partnership with local families to build new homes; further notes that the 2008 event involved 19 teams and 130 players representing diverse backgrounds, beliefs and professions from across Edinburgh, raising £770 in the process, and lauds the event for its core aims of bringing people from different cultures and faiths together through sport, building friendship and cooperation, promoting respect and equality and celebrating diversity.
