*S3M-3214.2 Patrick Harvie: Forth Crossing—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3214) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from "notes" to end and insert "believes that a road crossing across the eastern Firth of Forth remains a vital part of Scotland’s transport infrastructure; notes that a replacement crossing was originally justified on the basis of concerns about the integrity of the existing Forth Road Bridge; believes that the existing bridge is repairable and notes that the Scottish Government has recently committed to its long-term future, and further believes that no new Forth Road Bridge should be built at Queensferry unless and until it is conclusively proven that the existing bridge cannot be repaired."
