*S3M-6066 Helen Eadie: Fair Fares for Fifers—That the Parliament is dismayed to learn that Fife Council is increasing by 1,340% the concessionary rail fares for all Fife senior citizens who, it is considered, have over many years benefited enormously from the previous Labour-controlled administration’s policy of 50p journeys to Glasgow, Edinburgh or Dundee in Fife; considers that, in many instances, this will mean that pensioners will have to severely limit their contact with the close family in these cities and face insurmountable costs of travel to the major hospitals for outpatient treatment or visits to patients, and hopes that the council will reverse this monumentally wrong decision and restore this policy that is the envy of pensioners across other parts of Scotland and that this policy may be rolled out right across Scotland, furthering the sustainability of public transport while at the same time recognising that, in the majority of cases, all those disabled people who are unable to mount the steps of intercity coaches find the relatively easy access of trains a major boon to making travel much easier for them.
