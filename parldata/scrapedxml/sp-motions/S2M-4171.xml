 *S2M-4171&lt;&gt; Jim Mather: Ensuring the Independence of Scottish National Statistics—That the Parliament, in light of the proposals from HM Treasury for the establishment of an independent UK Office for National Statistics, notes that no proposals were made for Scotland; further notes that such proposals for Scotland are the responsibility of the Scottish Executive, and considers that, in light of previous statistical issues such as the loss of Objective 1 funding for the Highlands and Islands through statistical error, the Executive should take similar measures to place the production of Scottish statistics on a statutory basis, incorporating the National Statistics Code of Practice, and establish an independent Office of Scottish Statistics with independent governance answerable directly to the Scottish Parliament. Supported by: Mark Ballard*, Brian Adam*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Mr Andrew Welsh*, Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Richard Lochhead*, Rob Gibson*, Mr Adam Ingram*, Eleanor Scott*
