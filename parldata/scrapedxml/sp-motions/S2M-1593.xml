*S2M-1593# Brian Adam: North East of Scotland Sports Facilities—That the Parliament regrets that the Scottish Executive and sportscotland felt unable to come up with the monies requested by Aberdeen City Council and its partners to create modern sports facilities in the city; believes that this will compromise the project; notes that there is a dearth of top-class facilities in the north and north east of Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive should rethink its decision and come up with the resources that are needed to allow this project to progress.
