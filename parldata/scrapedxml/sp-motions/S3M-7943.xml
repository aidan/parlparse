 *S3M-7943 Patrick Harvie: Proposed University of Glasgow Cuts—That the Parliament expresses deep concern regarding cost-cutting proposals at the University of Glasgow in a number of areas including a reduction in the number of modern languages available for study to two or at most three, which it understands would mean the cessation of the teaching of Russian, Polish, Czech, Portuguese, German and potentially Italian; considers that potentially affected staff and students were given alarmingly short notice of these proposals; also considers that the proposals do not take account of the importance of language learning in higher education for the health of Britain’s economy and future business prosperity that has been highlighted by a number of recent reports; believes that many universities feel forced to make cuts because of the political choices made by the Scottish and UK governments to cut higher education funding, and calls on the Scottish Government to protect higher education against this agenda of cuts and to work with the Principal of the University of Glasgow to prevent the destruction of entire courses in modern languages, nursing, anthropology, social work and adult education and to begin a new, meaningful consultation process with staff and students to seek mutually acceptable alternatives that would safeguard university education for the long term.
