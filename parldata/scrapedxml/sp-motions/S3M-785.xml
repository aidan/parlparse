*S3M-785# Jamie McGrigor: Congratulations to the Showmen’s Guild Scottish Section on its 100th Anniversary—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish section of the Showmen’s Guild of Great Britain on its 100th anniversary this year; notes the enjoyment that generations of Scots have gained through fairs and shows across Scotland during this time and their importance to Scotland’s tourism, culture and economy; further notes the concerns of the Showmen’s Guild Scottish section in relation to the fact that Planning Circular 22/91 is not applicable in Scotland and about a possible lack of sites for shows and fairs and storage in Scotland, and hopes that local authorities and the Scottish Executive will engage positively with the travelling show sector to ensure that fairs and shows can continue to be enjoyed for many decades to come.
