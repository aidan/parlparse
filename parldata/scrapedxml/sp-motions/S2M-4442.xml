*S2M-4442 Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Offside! Labour Rights and Sportswear Production in Asia—That the Parliament welcomes Oxfam International’s report, Offside! Labour Rights and Sportswear Production in Asia; notes that, as top sportswear brands prepare to showcase their wares at this year’s FIFA World Cup finals in Germany, many sportswear workers in Asia face discrimination, intimidation, violence and dismissal for joining unions to fight for better pay and conditions; further notes that the majority of these workers are women from poor communities supporting children and families and who are being paid as little as 32 pence an hour; urges global sports brands to do more to improve labour conditions, and believes that Scotland should show leadership in the fight for trade justice by realising the Scottish Executive’s international development policy ambition for Scotland to become a fair trade country.
