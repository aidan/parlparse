*S3M-2846 Karen Whitefield: Airdrie Remembers—That the Parliament congratulates the staff and pupils of Caldervale High School on the success of their recent Airdrie Remembers event, an evening of music, songs, poems and memories involving the history, geography, music, French and English departments, that commemorated the lives of all those who fought and died for their country during the two world wars, and recognises the cross-curricular benefits of this approach to making history real and relevant to pupils, in which business studies pupils handled publicity and tickets for the event, school technicians produced a film of the pupils’ Flanders visit, home economics pupils provided a World War One purvey of tea, cakes and scones and art department pupils put on a display of paintings.
