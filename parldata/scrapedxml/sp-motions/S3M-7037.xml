 *S3M-7037 Anne McLaughlin: Carers’ Centres in Glasgow—That the Parliament applauds the work of the Princess Royal Trust for Carers carers’ centres in Glasgow in supporting Scotland’s carers and young carers; considers that they have a significant impact on the lives of over 2,200 unpaid carers and young carers in Scotland; understands that, without the emotional and practical support that they offer to carers, it would cost statutory services an estimated £22.8 million per annum to replace this care and support, and wishes the centres the best of luck with their continued good work in the future.
