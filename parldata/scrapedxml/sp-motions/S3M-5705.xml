*S3M-5705 Des McNulty: Freeze out Fuel Poverty for Cancer Patients—That the Parliament notes that cancer patients can pay higher fuel bills because they spend long periods at home during recovery and the effects of the illness and treatment can mean that they face higher bills because they feel the cold more and need to use more heating; is concerned, however, that this comes at a time when, for many patients, their income has fallen dramatically; understands that the Scottish Government’s Energy Assistance Package does not include cancer patients as a vulnerable group that can benefit, and believes that a diagnosis of cancer should be a key point at which patients are referred to sources of help such as the Energy Assistance Package and that cancer patients should have the same rights and support as other vulnerable people.
