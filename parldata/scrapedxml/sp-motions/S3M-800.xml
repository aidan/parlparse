*S3M-800 Keith Brown: Cross Party Report on Leukaemia—That the Parliament notes the report of the Westminster cross-party inquiry into childhood leukaemia and electric and magnetic fields (EMFs), which investigated the effects of EMFs, such as those caused by power lines, on the incidence of leukaemia in childhood; further notes the forthcoming Health Protection Agency report on the same topic; recognises that a debate is ongoing in the scientific community with rigorous, peer-reviewed epidemiological papers on both sides; expresses concern that the International Agency for Research on Cancer has therefore classified EMFs as "possibly carcinogenic"; observes with caution ongoing developments such as the Beauly to Denny power line that will place new EMFs in close proximity to existing settlements and would therefore not comply with the moratorium proposed in the cross-party report; expresses support for the precautionary principle in relation to what may plausibly be significant threats to life, and calls on the Minister for Public Health to work with relevant stakeholders to investigate this problem, to address and act on concerns and to adequately safeguard Scotland’s citizens from this risk.
