*S1M-3582 Fergus Ewing: Personal Care-That the Parliament notes with concern that The Highland Council has considered tightening the rules covering eligibility for free personal care because of a funding shortfall of about £300,000; further notes that more than 75,000 people in Scotland are estimated to be eligible for free care following the decision by the Parliament and the Scottish Executive to provide such free care; recognises that the council received just over £4 million from the Executive to meet the costs of providing free personal and nursing care in its area but that demand has proven to be higher than predicted, and calls on the Executive to fulfil its commitment to free personal care by meeting the shortfall in funding as soon as possible.
