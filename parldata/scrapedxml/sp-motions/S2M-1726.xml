*S2M-1726 John Farquhar Munro: Delay in Tenant Farmers’ Right to Buy—That the Parliament is concerned by the delays to the implementation of Parts 2 and 6 of the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 2003 that will give a pre-emptive right to buy to tenant farmers; is further concerned that this delay is allowing landowners to rush through sales of agricultural land in order to evade the will of the Parliament, and calls on the Scottish Executive to give a high priority to its consideration of the responses to the current consultation on the implementation of this measure so that tenants’ right to buy can be implemented without further delay.
