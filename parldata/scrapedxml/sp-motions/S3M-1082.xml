*S3M-1082 Bill Wilson: Moorpark Youth Centre Healthy Eating Projectâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Moorpark Youth Centre in Renfrew on its year-long healthy eating project; notes that the project involved between 60 and 100 young people between the ages of eight and 16, providing them with information about, and practical experience in, producing healthy alternatives for snacks and beverages, and further notes that the hard work invested in increasing the awareness of the importance of healthy eating among the young participants will be more than justified by the lifelong benefits that should result.
