*S1M-2669# Elaine Thomson: World Heritage Site Status for the Cairngorms-That the Parliament congratulates the United Nations on its co-ordination of the International Year of Mountains; believes that an appropriate way to celebrate the year would be to ensure that the Cairngorm Mountain Range, the largest continuous area of high ground above 1,000 metres in Britain, is designated a World Heritage Site, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should speedily propose discussions with Her Majesty's Government to achieve the ultimate international acclaim of World Heritage Status for this beautiful and environmentally unique part of our heritage.
