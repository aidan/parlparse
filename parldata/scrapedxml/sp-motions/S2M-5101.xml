 *S2M-5101 Donald Gorrie: Kinship Care—That the Parliament recognises that kinship care is often the best way to look after children from disintegrated families and is concerned about the uneven financial support given by local authorities to kinship carers, ranging from 12 authorities which pay a full fostering allowance to three which pay nothing, and encourages Scottish ministers and local authorities to work together to provide a system whereby all kinship carers are paid the same rate as foster carers and a new status of "looked after in kinship care" is created, as proposed in the report, Looking After the Family: A Study of Children Looked after in Kinship Care in Scotland, by Professor Jane Aldgate and Miranda McIntosh.
