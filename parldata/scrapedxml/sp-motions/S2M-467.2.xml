*S2M-467.2 Tommy Sheridan: Creating an Enterprise Culture in Scotland's Schools—As an amendment to motion (S2M-467) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert, "believes that the trade union movement has much to contribute to the development of education for work activity in its broadest sense, not only in making young people aware of the realities of work from a worker’s perspective and the individual and collective rights they should expect at work, but also about how work relates to wider issues within society, such as equality, environmental sustainability, lifelong learning and community development and participation, which are areas of longstanding trade union activity, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward detailed proposals for trade union involvement in education for work activity across all sectors of Scottish education that include the identification of the resources necessary for their implementation and their possible sources."
