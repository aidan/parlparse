*S3M-305 Cathy Peattie: Herald Group of Newspapers—That the Parliament views with concern recent developments within the Herald group of newspapers; notes that there has been a significant reduction in editorial staffing levels with further job cuts now proposed and that this has clear implications for the quality and content of publications and along with other health and safety concerns, for stress and staff health; notes that these developments are taking place despite increased profits and assurances given by Newsquest to the Competition Commission, and believes that this is to the detriment of the long term future of the titles and the Scottish newspaper industry.
