*S3M-1359 Cathy Peattie: Local Television—That the Parliament congratulates Ofcom on finding a means to deliver local television through Freeview to virtually every household across the United Kingdom; looks to the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to introduce a licence in the near future to enable the provision of local public service television to be offered in each area at digital switchover, and urges the Scottish Government to consider how it can support the establishment of local public service television throughout Scotland.
