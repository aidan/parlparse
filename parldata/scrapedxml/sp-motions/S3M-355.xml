*S3M-355 Kenneth Gibson: Audio Trail of Largs—That the Parliament congratulates St Columba’s Parish Church in Largs on the launch of its Audio Trail of Largs on 11 August 2007, which allows one to experience and enjoy the rich history of the town, soaking up its atmosphere while hearing amusing tales and interesting facts; recognises the hard work of parishioners and friends of St Columba’s in making this a reality on a site which has been a place of Christian worship since at least 1253; acknowledges the innovative ventures planned by the kirk, which will include entertainment, an open air market, restaurant and a host of other activities while continuing to provide traditional services including weddings, christenings and funerals, and wishes St Columba’s every success with its Audio Visual Trail of Largs and its future plans.
