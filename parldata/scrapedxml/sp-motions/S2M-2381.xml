 * S2M-2381 Chris Ballance:Scottish Civic Forum—That the Parliament recognises that Scottish Civic Forum was established, in line with the Constitutional Steering Group’s recommendations, as a key element for encouraging and enabling civic engagement with the Parliament and that its role was reaffirmed by the Procedures Committee in 2003; notes that over 2,500 people have participated in forum events in 32 areas of Scotland over the last two and a half years and that the Forum publicises Scottish Parliament consultations, publications and issues independently and neutrally to over 5,000 contacts each month; further notes that the forum acts as an independent commentator on public participation and the Parliament and forms a conduit for civic society to articulate its own agenda to politicians, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to guarantee continued funding to Scottish Civic Forum and indeed consider increasing funding in order to enable the forum to establish participatory hubs across Scotland.
