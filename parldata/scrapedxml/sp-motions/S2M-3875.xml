*S2M-3875 Carolyn Leckie: Solidarity with the PCS—That the Parliament sends solidarity greetings to members of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union taking strike action in defence of public services, their jobs and to resist privatisation; recognises that 15,000 jobs in the Department of Work and Pensions have already been eroded, leading to one million calls for help, with benefits going unanswered, eight-week delays for vulnerable people entitled to benefits, pensioners and those most in need not being able to travel required distances to centralised offices and frustration and anger compromising the health and safety of workers; commends the PCS for its constructive attempts to negotiate a solution; recognises that members have no alternative but to strike; believes their employers, the UK Government, should seek meaningful talks and take action to reverse the cuts, centralisation and privatisation, and, until that happens, wishes every success to the members of the PCS in their action.
