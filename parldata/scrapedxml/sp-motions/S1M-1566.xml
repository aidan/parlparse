 *S1M-1566 Christine Grahame: Borders textile job losses—That the Parliament notes the loss of a further 40-45 textile jobs with the closure of the Borders textile firm of Murray Allan in Innerleithen, which has now suffered three major mill closures in the last ten years, devastating a close-knit rural community; further notes that the transfer of production to Hawick is to be accommodated in premises sold to Clan Douglas, the sister company, in October 1999 for a bargain price and on highly favourable repayment terms by Scottish Enterprise Borders (SEB), an arrangement which at the time was described by them as "allowing Clan Douglas to grow its export business and increase employment" and "good news for the Borders economy"; further notes that not a penny of the £10 million textile aid package announced by the Scottish Executive in June 2000 has been spent, and considers that the Scottish Executive should act now to stop further haemorrhaging of Borders textile jobs and to call to account the management of public funds by SEB.
