*S1M-2578.2 Mr John Swinney: Scottish Executive's Priorities-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2578) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, leave out from "and that" to end and insert "notes the failure of the Executive since its inception to deliver both those first class public services and to create a country in which all children can reach their full potential; recognises that the Parliament has undertaken impressive work but regrets the loss of trust in government caused by the actions of the Executive; calls on the Executive to dramatically improve its performance in delivering public services on health, education, transport and jobs, crime and on the environment, and agrees that only by equipping this Parliament with the powers of a normal independent Parliament will Scotland be able to reach its full potential."
