*S3M-1515 Bob Doris: Queen’s Park Football Club: FIFA Order of Merit—That the Parliament supports the Scottish Football Association’s campaign to have Queen’s Park awarded the FIFA Order of Merit; notes that the recommendation will be made by SFA President George Peat when he attends an International FA board meeting at Gleneagles on Saturday 8 March 2008; recognises that the Order of Merit has only been awarded to two clubs, Real Madrid and Sheffield FC, the oldest club in the world; further notes that Queen’s Park is the world’s second-oldest club, having formed in 1867, and that it arranged the first international match when Scotland met England in 1872, and agrees that Queen’s Park fully deserves the honour "in recognition of their outstanding role in the development of the modern game and for 140 years of service to football".
