 *S3M-5525.1 George Foulkes: The Illegality of the Invasion of Iraq and the Detention of Anthony Charles Lynton Blair—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5525) in the name of Bill Wilson, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "recalls delegations of Kurds and Marsh Arabs who visited the United Kingdom in the 1980s and 1990s describing the torture, murder and genocide of their people by Saddam Hussein and their calls on British politicians to take action to help them; further recalls the feeling of impotence at Britain’s inability to help, and therefore believes that the action taken by the UK Government led by Tony Blair and supported by a vote in the House of Commons was not only justified by the UN resolution and convention on genocide but was morally right in ridding the world of one of its bloodiest dictators and giving the Iraqi people the opportunity to elect their own government and move towards peace and prosperity." Supported by: David Whitton*
