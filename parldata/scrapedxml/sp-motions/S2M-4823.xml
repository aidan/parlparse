*S2M-4823 Carolyn Leckie: Pay Up for Equal Pay—That the Parliament expresses profound concern that local authorities have still not achieved equal pay for women despite decades of legislative requirement and a specific seven-year commitment included in the single status agreement; is appalled that, through the failure of authorities and government to plan for and resource equal pay, workers across Scotland, including women workers who are already low paid, are facing pay cuts and people who depend on services are facing service cuts; believes that, given the comparatively low levels of pay in Scotland for all workers, equal pay should be achieved by levelling up rather than down and that local authorities and the Scottish Executive have a duty to make the funding available to achieve that by negotiation; considers that, if sufficient funding is not made available, the employers and the Executive will be culpable for the industrial disputes and legal challenges that arise, and believes that it is in the Executive’s and local authorities’ interests to avoid such disputes and legal challenges and that they should pay up for equal pay.
