*S1M-1334# Pauline McNeill: Funding of Glasgow's Museums and Galleries-That the Parliament is disappointed that Glasgow's museums and galleries were left out of the new funding for the arts announced on 2 November 2000; considers that the omission of support for Glasgow in arts funding disregards Glasgow museums' "special circumstances" as outlined in the Scottish Executive's National Cultural Strategy; believes that Glasgow City Council's cultural, social inclusion and educational strategy is second to none in Scotland; notes that the city's museums are the most visited in the UK outside London and that Glasgow holds the greatest civic collection in Europe, all of this being funded by the council tax payers of Glasgow, and calls for the inequity in funding of museums in Scotland to be redressed and the east-west divide in arts funding to be ended.
