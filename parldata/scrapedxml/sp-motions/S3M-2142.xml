 *S3M-2142 Des McNulty: Train Transport—That the Parliament notes with concern the withdrawal of all catering from services north of Edinburgh by Cross Country Trains, which means that passengers using these trains can get nothing to eat or drink; points out that passengers travelling north of Edinburgh and south of Plymouth into Cornwall are being discriminated against by this policy; urges the company to think again about the withdrawal of catering for passengers on these routes, and asks ministers to investigate whether this move represents a breach of the franchise agreement.
