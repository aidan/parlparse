*S3M-6634 Kenneth Gibson: Drug Dealers Are a Blight on Communities—That the Parliament disagrees with the report, Drugs Research: An overview of evidence and questions for policy, by Charlie Lloyd and Neil McKeganey for the Joseph Rowntree Foundation; is appalled at statements that identify a potentially beneficial relationship between communities and local drug-dealing activity; does not equate thriving markets of stolen goods as a viable solution to poverty nor vigilante drug lords as a solution for crime; joins with Assistant Chief Constable George Hamilton in noting that the overall impact of the drugs trade is negative and highly damaging to every community; supports local law enforcement in its efforts to combat the drug trade, and seeks well reasoned solutions to help remove this blot from the country.
