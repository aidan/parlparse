 *S3M-2955 Robin Harper: Scotland’s Forests—That the Parliament considers that the Forestry Commission Scotland has a central role with regard to sustainable development and to combating climate change; recognises the Scottish Government’s commitment to increase forest cover from 17% to 25% by 2020; expresses its dismay at the proposal to lease Scottish woodland to commercial companies for up to 75 years, a decision that could, in the long term, threaten productivity, employment, sustainable use of woodland and environmental policy making, and calls on the Scottish Government to withdraw forthwith from any negotiations that may have been started and to renew its commitment to continue to support the Forestry Commission Scotland’s important work on both climate change and sustainable development.
