S3M-4605 Bill Kidd: Public Opposition to UK Government Plans to Renew Trident—That the Parliament notes the recent findings of an ICM poll, carried out on behalf of The Guardian newspaper, that show that a majority of the UK population is now opposed to the £76 billion Trident replacement programme, with 54% of voters indicating that they would prefer the UK Government to abandon nuclear weapons completely; believes that the obstinacy of the UK Government with regard to the renewal of Trident poses a major hurdle on the path towards international nuclear disarmament; considers that nuclear weapons provide little or no defence against the most immediate contemporary global security threats, namely climate change and terrorism, and, as such, calls on the UK Government to abandon immediately its misguided plans to lavish billions of pounds of scarce public resources on the renewal of this antiquated weapons system.
