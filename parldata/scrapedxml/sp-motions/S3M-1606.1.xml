*S3M-1606.1 Alex Neil: Sparrowhawk Relocationâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-1606) in the name of Robin Harper, leave out from "ostensibly" to end and insert "welcomes this long overdue initiative aimed at dealing humanely with the problem of the predation of homing pigeons by sparrow hawks at their lofts; recognises that relocation will only proceed on the basis of appropriate licences being issued by the relevant authorities; totally condemns the scaremongering and misinformation being visited on this project, and calls on the Scottish Government to proceed with their balanced approach to this problem without fear or favour."
