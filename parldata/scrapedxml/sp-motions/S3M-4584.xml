 *S3M-4584 Mike Pringle: A Mixed Plastics Reprocessing factory for Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes WRAP Scotland’s invitation for bids for £5 million of funding towards the construction of Scotland’s first mixed plastics reprocessing factory; notes that when a factory is established it will allow Scotland to recycle an estimated 40,000 tonnes of plastic waste a year, 27,500 tonnes more that is currently recycled; further notes that plastic waste will no longer have to be sent elsewhere in the United Kingdom or abroad to be recycled, further reducing Scotland’s carbon footprint; acknowledges the vital importance of increasing recycling levels and reducing the volume of plastic waste that is sent to landfill as part of a wider environmental strategy, and hopes that Scotland can continue to increase its plastic recycling capacity to tackle the estimated 200,000 tonnes of plastic that is thrown away across the nation each year.
