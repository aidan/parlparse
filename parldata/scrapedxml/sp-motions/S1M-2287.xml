*S1M-2287 Michael Russell: Consuls and Consuls General in Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament notes the effective contribution made to Scottish public life by the Consuls and Consuls General in Scotland; encourages all nations to appoint such representatives pending the opportunities that will exist after independence to welcome Ambassadors and their staffs to Scotland, and, in particular, expresses its thanks to Dan Mulhall, Consul General of Ireland and Kare Hauge, Consul General of Norway, for their work over the crucial period of the establishment of the Parliament and wishes them well as they leave their Edinburgh postings.
