*S3M-1623 Brian Adam: Scottish World Cup Qualifier Broadcasts—That the Parliament notes with utmost concern that the BBC failed to broadcast Scottish World Cup qualifiers although it is able to spend an excessive £200 million on screening Formula 1; believes this to be unacceptable as football is Scotland’s national sport and should be made a priority in terms of sports coverage in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Government to apply pressure on the BBC to immediately address this problem and to persuade the UK Department for Culture, Media and Sport to add the home nations’ world cup qualifiers to its list of "crown jewels" of sporting events that must be available to terrestrial broadcasters.
