 *S1M-2276.1 Tommy Sheridan: Water Industry (Scotland) Bill—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2276) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end "but, in so doing, regrets that the Bill does not provide for a fair system of charging for water which is based on a person’s ability to pay, or give a guarantee of job security to water industry employees, or provide for a system of democratic accountability and control."
