*S3M-6869 Aileen Campbell: West Linton and District Rotary Club Award for Coulter Resident—That the Parliament congratulates Gillian McCamon, of Coulter, South Lanarkshire, on receiving the Ian Miller Award from members of the West Linton and District Rotary Club; notes that the award is made annually by the members of the club to someone who has contributed significantly to the local community of West Linton; further notes that, in Gillian’s case, this was for her work in caring for older citizens in the area, and that her work was described by the club as considerably exceeding what would normally be expected for this work, and welcomes the role played by rotary clubs across Scotland in recognising the contribution of individual citizens to the life of their communities.
