 *S3M-1234 Rob Gibson: Young Traditional Musician of the Year 2008—That the Parliament congratulates Ewan Robertson from Carrbridge on winning the BBC Radio Scotland Young Traditional Musician of the Year 2008 award, decided during the Celtic Connections festival at the City Halls, Glasgow on Sunday 27 January 2008, the first singer-guitarist to do so; commends all those who took part in what was a fantastic showpiece of young Scottish talent; recognises the quality of contestants fielded which made this year’s decision one of the most difficult for a decade; acknowledges the contribution that institutions such as the National Centre of Excellence in Traditional Music at Plockton High School and the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama can make in the development of young musicians, both of which Ewan Robertson attended as a student, and wishes Ewan the greatest of success in his musical career.
