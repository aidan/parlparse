*S1M-3684 Tommy Sheridan: Heroin and Cannabis-That the Parliament welcomes the shift in policy by Her Majesty's Government on drugs; notes that the Government is now moving towards prescribing heroin on the NHS, instead of criminalising addicts, and reclassifying cannabis as a Class C rather than Class B drug, and notes with regret that the Scottish Executive has no plans to follow suit in respect of heroin prescribing and is therefore likely to allow hundreds more young people in Scotland to die due to drug misuse.
