*S2M-4805 Ms Sandra White: Hidden Cost of Nursing Grantsâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the scheme to offer grants to internationally qualified nurses to overcome NHS skill shortages in rural areas but notes the damaging impact on developing countries of losing skilled doctors and nurses; further notes the example of Ghana, where life expectancy is 57 years and there are only nine doctors per 100,000 citizens, which since 1999 has lost more than it has trained, and believes that greater assistance must be offered to developing countries so that the healthcare of the most vulnerable people worldwide does not suffer as a result of the recruitment activity of wealthier nations.
