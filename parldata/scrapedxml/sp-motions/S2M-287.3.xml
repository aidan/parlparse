*S2M-287.3 Shiona Baird: The Scottish Economy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-287) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from "long term" to end and insert "sustainability as distinct from growth in the Scottish economy; supports the use of the terms "sustainable" and "sustainability" in accordance with the generally-accepted definition of "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs"; endorses the Scottish Executive’s establishment of a Sustainable Development Forum and Sustainable Development Indicators as initial steps in the direction of sustainability; recognises the need to create a spirit of entrepreneurship, promote innovations and encourage sensible risk taking; believes that this can be achieved by building on the strength of our education system and research and development capability and through development of specific initiatives such as a green jobs strategy; welcomes the Scottish Executive’s commitment to be responsive to ways in which its current strategy can be enhanced and refined, and affirms that long-term prosperity, first-class services and social justice are only achievable through sustainable development."
