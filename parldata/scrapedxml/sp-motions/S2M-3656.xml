*S2M-3656u Christine Grahame: Scottish Children and Fuel Poverty—That the Parliament notes with concern that there are approximately 10,000 fuel poor households with children with a poor energy efficiency rating and 5,000 households with children in fuel poverty with no central heating, including households in the Scottish Borders; notes that this equates to approximately 46,000 children living in fuel poverty; further notes that for every 5% increase in fuel prices a further 30,000 more households go into fuel poverty and that gas and electricity prices continue to rise against the background of a predicted severe winter, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should, as a matter of urgency and as a first step, extend the central heating programme to those 5,000 households at a cost in the order of £1.6 million against a budget of £97 million for the existing central heating programme and thereafter consider extending the programme to ensure that no Scottish child suffers from the consequences of fuel poverty.
