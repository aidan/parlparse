*S3M-8134 Bob Doris: Strictly for Charity—That the Parliament notes that Scottish Enterprise is hosting its annual (A Little Less) Strictly Come Dancing fundraiser on Saturday 2 April 2011 with all proceeds going to the Prince &amp; Princess of Wales Hospice in Glasgow, which it considers provides a first class, free service for patients and families, supporting them with dignity during distressing times; notes that six couples from the worlds of celebrity and business will compete with their Scottish professional partners; notes that contestants will include the actress, Kathleen McDermott Carberry, Clyde 1’s Romeo, Scottish footballer Gordon Smith, Scottish event rider Nicola Malcolm and Chief Executive of Scottish Enterprise Lena Wilson; believes this to be a worthwhile cause, and urges the public to support it by donating one pound by texting the name of the dancer whom they wish to support to 70100 on 2 April.
