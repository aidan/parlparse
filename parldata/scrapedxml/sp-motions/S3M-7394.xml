*S3M-7394 Marilyn Livingstone: Beatbullying’s The Big March—That the Parliament welcomes The Big March, a campaign by Beatbullying, the United Kingdom’s leading bullying prevention charity, which urges the UK Government to do everything in its power to tackle bullying, violence and harassment; understands that The Big March is the world’s first virtual march, mobilising hundreds of thousands of people to take action against bullying; notes that, on 15 November 2010, the first day of Anti-Bullying Week, supporters will "march" across the internet to deliver a petition to the UK Government encouraging it to do everything that it can to protect children and young people from all forms of bullying, violence and mistreatment by children and other young people; welcomes the fact that the campaign also asks the UK Government to commission a cross-departmental review investigating the best ways to tackle bullying, harassment and violence against children and young people, including the introduction of legislation where appropriate, and encourages as many people as possible to support the campaign and take action to beat bullying.
