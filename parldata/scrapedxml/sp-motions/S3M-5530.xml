 *S3M-5530 Willie Coffey: Eglinton Watercolours—That the Parliament congratulates East Ayrshire Council on taking delivery on 13 January 2010 of the Eglinton watercolours by James Henry Nixon, which were painted to commemorate the Eglinton Tournament that was held over three days in August 1839 and are considered to be of outstanding significance for the study of Scottish social history and of the 19th Century Gothic Revival; notes also that historic shields, used to furnish the knights’ tents at the tournament, have been purchased along with the watercolours; welcomes the support that the council received for this purchase from the Heritage Lottery Fund, The Art Fund, the Barcapel Foundation and the National Fund for Acquisitions, and considers that the watercolours and shields, which are important parts of Ayrshire’s heritage, will significantly enhance the council’s already impressive art collection.
