*S3M-3351.2 Peter Peacock: Retained Firefighters and the Working Time Directive Opt-out—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3351) in the name of Liam McArthur, leave out from "with regret" to end and insert "that the vote by the European Parliament on 17 December 2008 in favour of removing Britain’s working time directive opt-out was supported by Scotland’s Liberal Democrat MEP; also notes that the decision of the European Parliament represents a difference of view from that of the Council of Ministers and will now be sent for negotiation and conciliation before there is any question of its final approval or implementation; further notes that a failure to agree between the European Parliament and Council of Ministers will result in the proposal falling; notes the role played by Scotland’s retained firefighters and the vital service that these firefighters provide to their communities; considers that in any future potential change to the working time directive an appropriate provision to allow a continuation of fire services in the Highlands and Islands in particular will be required, and expresses confidence in those involved to ensure such an outcome."
