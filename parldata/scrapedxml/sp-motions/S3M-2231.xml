*S3M-2231 Bill Wilson: The Samson Chivatsi African Children’s Appeal and Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire Councils—That the Parliament congratulates Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire councils for supporting the Scottish tour of the Samson Chivatsi African Children’s Appeal youth choir of 25 children from the Kenyan village of Utange, a tour aimed at raising funds for their school and orphanage; notes that for many of these children this was their first experience of foreign travel and foreign climate, but that the level of performance was not compromised, despite the relative cold of Scotland, and further notes that the choir is generally recognised to have put on an excellent show and that the children comported themselves well as ambassadors for their village and country. Supported by: Keith Brown*, Bob Doris*, Patricia Ferguson*, Stuart McMillan*, Hugh Henry*
