*S2M-3325# Mr Kenny MacAskill: HMV/Waterstones Takeover of Ottakar’s Book Stores—That the Parliament voices its grave concern over, and opposition to, the proposed takeover of Ottakar’s book stores by HMV/Waterstones; notes that, if the takeover goes ahead, there will be effectively a monopoly on bookselling in many towns and cities in Scotland; regrets that, despite Edinburgh being the World City of Literature, in recent times it has witnessed the demise of independent Scottish-owned book stores such as Bauermeister and James Thin, meaning that there is now no Scottish-owned book chain in Edinburgh or indeed Scotland; recognises that the internal structure of Ottakar’s genuinely reflects the distinctive Scottish book market, with a Scottish range and marketing manager and two Scottish operating managers; contrasts this with the highly centralised structure and purchasing policy of HMV/Waterstones, which has led to a decrease in in-store diversity and availability of Scottish books through Waterstones; thus recognises that this takeover is potentially very damaging for the Scottish publishing industry, the Scottish printing industry and Scottish writers and will have the effect of limiting choice for the Scottish book-buying public and harming our national culture and identity, and considers that the Competition Commission should investigate this takeover on the grounds of market dominance in Scotland.
