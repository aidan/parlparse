*S2M-2585.2 Linda Fabiani: Housing—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2585) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "to increase the quantity" to end and insert "and, while welcoming the Housing (Scotland) Bill, notes that the target of 21,500 affordable homes over three years has to be offset against the 18,000 homes per year sold under the right to buy; therefore calls for the right to buy to be reformed for new tenants, while preserving the rights of existing tenants; further acknowledges the insurmountable difficulties for many young people in a first-time purchase, and calls for the introduction of a range of financial packages to assist first-time buyers, including a first-time buyers’ grant."
