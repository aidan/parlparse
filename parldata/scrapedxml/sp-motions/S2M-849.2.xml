*S2M-849.2 Colin Fox: Police Accountability-As an amendment to motion (S2M-849) in the name of David McLetchie, insert at end "; notes that the public has little faith in the "in house" police complaints procedure; recognises that there is a need for a wholly independent body to investigate complaints recorded against the police, and that this measure should form part of a wider strengthening of police accountability which includes replacing the joint police boards with police boards elected by the community as a whole."
