*S2M-4084 Tommy Sheridan: Withdraw Troops from Iraq—That the Parliament recognises the growing carnage, bloodshed and loss of life in Iraq and that 103 British soldiers and well over 100,000 Iraqi civilians have died as a direct result of the invasion of 2003, which many consider to be illegal and immoral; believes that the presence of British and American troops as illegal occupiers in Iraq is a huge cause of the conflict and no part of a peaceful solution, and therefore demands that all British troops are withdrawn immediately, which is the express wish of the majority of Iraqi citizens as expressed in several opinion polls, in particular those conducted by the UK Ministry of Defence.
