*S2M-3790 Carolyn Leckie: Health Services in Lanarkshire: Make it a Genuine Choice—That the Parliament notes the launch of NHS Lanarkshire’s formal consultation, A Picture of Health; believes that, for such a consultation to be genuine and meaningful, all alternative proposals for services, including acute services, should be put before local communities and all background information, including financial information and research, should be placed in the public domain; notes that NHS Lanarkshire’s own option appraisal exercise cites the status quo of maintaining three general hospitals providing the full range of services as the second most popular option and the cheapest capital option; recognises the desire of communities to maintain the full range of services locally; expresses support for the communities served by Monklands and Hairmyres hospitals in their efforts to maintain all services in their areas, and believes that the will of communities to maintain and improve the full range of emergency, intensive and trauma care at all three general hospitals within NHS Lanarkshire should provide the impetus to the board and politicians to take the necessary action to ensure that a new improved status quo is a genuine potential outcome of the consultation.
