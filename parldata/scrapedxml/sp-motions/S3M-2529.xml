*S3M-2529♦ James Kelly: Parkinson’s Disease Society - Get it on Time Campaign—That the Parliament congratulates the Parkinson’s Disease Society on its award-winning Get it On Time campaign highlighting the problems faced by people with Parkinson’s in hospital, with materials aimed at patients, health professionals and NHS managers; notes that there are about 10,000 people with Parkinson’s in Scotland, including in Rutherglen and Cambuslang, and that more than a quarter of them will be admitted to hospital at least once each year; is concerned that many people with Parkinson’s are unable to follow their medication regime in hospital; recognises that if people with Parkinson’s do not get their medication on time they can suffer serious and distressing problems, including being unable to move, speak or swallow and that extended hospital stays are needed to restore effective symptom control; believes that many of the barriers to receiving medication on time can be addressed through straightforward measures, including policies enabling people who wish to self-medicate to do so, involvement from a Parkinson’s disease nurse specialist or pharmacist on admission, education for hospital staff, listening to people with Parkinson’s, their carers and families and wider availability of anti-Parkinsonian drugs in hospital pharmacies, and believes that measures should be taken to ensure that people with Parkinson’s get their medication on time, every time.
