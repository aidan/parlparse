*S2M-4280 Irene Oldfather: Parkinson’s Awareness Week 24 to 30 April 2006—That the Parliament notes that 24 to 30 April 2006 is Parkinson’s Awareness Week; further notes that the focus of this year’s campaign, launched by the Parkinson’s Disease Society and entitled "Get it on time", is to raise awareness of the importance of medication management in the treatment of Parkinson’s disease; is aware that Parkinson’s sufferers need to receive their treatment at regular times, even when in care homes or staying in hospital as a result of other conditions; recognises that when patients do not receive their treatment on time their Parkinson’s symptoms become uncontrolled and they can become very ill, and therefore supports the Parkinson’s Disease Society’s campaign to raise awareness amongst nurses, doctors, pharmacists and care staff of the importance of continuity in administering Parkinson’s disease medication on time.
