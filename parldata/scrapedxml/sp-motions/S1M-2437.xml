*S1M-2437 John Farquhar Munro: Internet Access—That the Parliament notes with concern that, according to a MORI survey conducted for Oftel, the number of households in the UK with access to the internet has fallen for the first time, from 40% to 39% of households, welcomes the slight increase in the proportion of Scottish homes with internet access, but regrets that the Scottish figure is only 29%, which is still 10% lower than the UK average; recognises the critical role that the internet plays in promoting business and as a key access tool for vulnerable groups; notes that these vulnerable groups are still lagging behind the general population with regard to internet access, the number of households with annual incomes lower than £17,500 with internet access having dropped from 21% to 19%; welcomes the Scottish Executive’s Digital Communities initiative, but believes that the Executive should ensure that all low income and other vulnerable groups in Scotland are given every opportunity to connect to the internet, particularly by encouraging the use of fixed-price packages, in order to ensure that technology in the 21st century narrows the social and digital divide rather than expanding it.
