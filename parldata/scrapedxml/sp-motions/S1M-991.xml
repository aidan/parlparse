*S1M-991# Christine Grahame: Impact of Climate Change Levy on Borders Economy-That the Parliament recognises that many small- to medium-sized businesses, particularly those located in rural areas, are unaware that the Climate Change Levy (CCL) is due to be imposed on 1 April 2001 and that this will have a substantial negative impact on their operating costs and put many businesses in jeopardy; notes that it will affect, in particular, textiles, farming and electronics manufacture in areas such as the Scottish Borders, and urges the Scottish Executive, as a matter of urgency, to review the whole issue of CCL which will penalise even those who are already meeting Kyoto targets for carbon emissions and those who have no carbon emissions from their business enterprises.
