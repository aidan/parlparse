 * S2M-2746 Janis Hughes:International Nurses Day—That the Parliament notes that 12 May 2005 is International Nurses Day; celebrates the contribution made by nurses and other NHS staff; acknowledges that each day over 100,000 people in Scotland use NHS services, which are increasingly provided by nurses; notes with concern that nurses and their colleagues are frustrated with the often negative reporting of the work they do, and praises NHS staff for their efforts on our behalf.
