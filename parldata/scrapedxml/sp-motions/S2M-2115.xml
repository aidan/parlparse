 *S2M-2115 Alex Neil: Research Pooling for Chemistry and Physics—That the Parliament welcomes the initiative to pool physics and chemistry research groups in Scottish universities; notes that the aim is to create two world-class research alliances, ScotCHEM for chemistry and SUPA for physics, with over 380 researchers; notes that this collaboration is a bottom-up initiative from the chemistry and physics researchers with a £37 million investment from six universities, the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council and the Office of Science and Technology; believes that ScotCHEM and SUPA will help develop a distinctive, radically-new research landscape in Scotland with powerful, well-resourced research communities, attractive to leading researchers around the world, producing world-class research, and believes that this collaborative and creative initiative will be crucial to ensuring that the Scottish research base is able to maintain its competitive edge both internationally and within the United Kingdom and to support Scotland’s knowledge economy.
