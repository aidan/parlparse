 *S3M-1991# Margo MacDonald: Scanner Donation to NHS Lothian—That the Parliament believes that the Royal Bank of Scotland’s donation of a scanner to NHS Lothian, while generous and of undoubted value to the bank’s employees, the general public and medical researchers, nevertheless, if replicated by other companies or interests, represents possible external direction of NHS boards’ policies, priorities and resource management, and therefore calls for further debate on how donations are made to the NHS before precedents are established.
