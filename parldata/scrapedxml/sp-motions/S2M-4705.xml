*S2M-4705 Colin Fox: Crisis in the Middle East—That the Parliament is appalled by the continuing Israeli offensive in Lebanon; notes that the last four weeks of the conflict have marked a new escalation in violence, with 998 Lebanese and 102 Israeli people having been killed, and that diplomatic efforts have not yet secured an agreement on a UN resolution; believes that the UK Government’s current policy on the Middle East is fundamentally flawed, while the Israeli-Palestinian conflict continues to rage on; believes that the UK Parliament should be recalled to debate the situation and its effect on UK security, to instruct the UK Government to call for an immediate unconditional ceasefire and to exert every possible pressure on Israel to end immediately its invasions of Gaza and Lebanon and its threats against Syria, and sends its support and solidarity to all campaigners attending the demonstration to be held on Saturday 12 August 2006, in Edinburgh, to further the cause of a peaceful resolution.
