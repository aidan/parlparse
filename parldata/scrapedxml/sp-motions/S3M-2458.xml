*S3M-2458 Gil Paterson: Save Scotland’s National Team—That the Parliament notes the recent comments by the General Secretary of UEFA who has given the starkest warning so far that a British football team performing at the Olympic Games would jeopardise Scotland’s independent football status, stating that "It is the quickest way for Scotland to disappear off of the international stage", and calls on all members who wish to see Scotland continue to participate in international football to use their influence to defend Scotland’s footballing legacy and save Scotland’s national team status.
