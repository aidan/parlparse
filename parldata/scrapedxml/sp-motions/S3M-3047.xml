*S3M-3047 Alex Neil: Support the Merger Action Group’s Appeal to the Competition Appeal Tribunal—That the Parliament expresses its support for the initiative of the Merger Action Group in lodging an appeal with the Competition Appeal Tribunal against the decision by Lord Peter Mandelson, Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, not to accept the recommendation of the Office of Fair Trading to refer the proposed takeover of Halifax Bank of Scotland by Lloyds TSB to the Competition Commission; applauds the tribunal’s decision to hear the appeal under the auspices of Scots Law; criticises the bullying behaviour of HM Treasury and the UK Government in trying to undermine the initiative taken by the Merger Action Group, which further underlines the fact that, contrary to the promises made by the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the UK Government has made every effort to ensure that there is not a level playing field between the proposed takeover of HBOS by Lloyds TSB and alternative options; believes that if this takeover goes ahead up to 40,000 people will needlessly lose their jobs, and calls on the UK Government to reinstate the competition laws that it has suspended and ignored in this case by referring the proposed takeover to the Competition Commission in any case.
