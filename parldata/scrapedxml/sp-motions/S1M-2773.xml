*S1M-2773 Michael Russell: Scottish Place Names Surveyâ€”That the Parliament commends the excellent work undertaken by the Scottish Place Names Survey and by Ian Fraser who retired in autumn 2001; notes that the discipline of toponymy is of great benefit to a nation, particularly one which has three indigenous languages and whose place names are influenced by no less than six languages, more than in any other European country; accepts that state funding for toponymy is the norm in most European countries and that toponymists contribute valuable assistance to national and local government and to individuals in matters such as sourcing derivations of place names, suggesting appropriate names for new developments and preserving our cultural and linguistic heritage; agrees with the Principal of Edinburgh University that state funding could be expected for the survey while regretting that continued funding by Edinburgh University is no longer possible, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to provide appropriate financial assistance to the Scottish Place Names Survey to allow it to proceed with the next phase of the Scottish Place Names Database and offer a service to inquirers.
