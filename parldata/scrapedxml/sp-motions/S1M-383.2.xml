*S1M-383.2 Tommy Sheridan: Health—As an amendment to motion (S1M-383) in the name of Susan Deacon, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "recognises, however, the rock-bottom morale of NHS staff, most of whom are underpaid, overworked and undervalued; believes that the NHS continues to be under-funded and demands extra resources immediately to pay salary increases and millennium supplements without the imposition of further cuts in service provision and staffing levels; recognises that a huge winter crisis in the NHS is looming and commits itself to full winter relief for Trusts, many of whom already have severe deficits; recognises that the gross inequalities in health across Scotland can only be addressed through a combination of increased NHS spending and other anti-poverty measures to improve housing conditions, wage levels, benefit levels and pensions and accordingly agrees to make urgent representation to the Chancellor to demand the release immediately of the £12 billion surplus to improve the quality and standard of our public services; condemns the use of PFI to fund hospital building as an inefficient use of public resources, the continuation of health privatisation and an undermining of NHS workers’ jobs and conditions, and calls for proper public investment to renovate and re-build our hospitals and health facilities."
