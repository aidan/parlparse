 *S2M-456.1 Miss Annabel Goldie: Scottish Fire and Rescue Service - Proposals for Legislation—As an amendment to motion (S2M-456) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert, "notes that the consultation paper The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service: Proposals for Legislation builds on the responses received to the Scottish Executive’s first policy paper; is concerned, while commending the engagement of the Executive with stakeholders to modernise the service and work together to provide greater impetus to protect the public from fire to reduce Scotland’s poor record of fire fatalities, that the new National Framework, which includes centrally-driven top down targets, performance indicators, monitoring and guidance, will prejudice local operational flexibility, and calls on the Executive to confirm that it will not cut the number of fire brigades."
