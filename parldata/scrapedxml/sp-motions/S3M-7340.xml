*S3M-7340 Aileen Campbell: Increasing Police Numbers in Clydesdale Subdivision of Strathclyde Police—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Strathclyde Police South Lanarkshire Division to increase the number of officers in the community policing teams in the area; notes that among the areas to benefit will be the Clydesdale subdivision in the South of Scotland region, where increased officer numbers will allow for full police coverage every day of the week in some areas where previously such coverage has not been available; believes that the ability of the police force to deploy officers in this way is a result of investment by the SNP-led Scottish administration, which has provided resources to employ more than 1,000 additional officers across Scotland since May 2007, and hopes that these new arrangements in the Strathclyde Police South Lanarkshire Division will help to reduce crime and the fear of crime in the area.
