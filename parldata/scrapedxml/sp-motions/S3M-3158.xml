*S3M-3158 Christine Grahame: Last Train on the Waverley Line—That the Parliament notes that 40 years ago, on 5 January 1969, the 21.55 from Waverley station to St Pancras was the final journey of the last train on the Waverley line; also notes that its closure was not without a fight, with protesters blocking the line at Newcastleton causing the Night Midland sleeper to be several hours late; regrets that its closure left the Scottish Borders as the only region in mainland Britain without passenger railway stations; notes further that, in June 2000, the Scottish Parliament voted unanimously to restore the line and that the Scottish Government has already provided £1 million to allow preparatory work to begin for construction, and, on this anniversary, reasserts its commitment to reinstatement of the line. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Stuart McMillan*, Christina McKelvie*
