*S3M-2934 Christine Grahame: For £12 Billion Big Brother Bugs You—That the Parliament condemns the British Government’s estimated £12 billion Interception Modernisation Programme currently being developed at Government Communications Headquarters, GCHQ, in Cheltenham that would intercept every telephone call, every email and retain a log of every website visited by every person in the United Kingdom; believes that this unnecessary project seriously undermines our democracy and represents a complete affront to our rights to privacy and freedom and hands the terrorists the victory that they seek by substantially changing our way of life by imposing a system that would spy and snoop on a population whom the British Government clearly no longer trusts, and urges the British Government to halt the programme and instead invest the relevant resources in vital public services and the fight against fuel, pensioner and child poverty.
