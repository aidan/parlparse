 *S2M-4718.1 Ms Sandra White: 150th Anniversary of the Birth of James Keir Hardie—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4718) in the name of Bill Butler, insert at end "but notes, however, that the present policies of New Labour must have Keir Hardie birlin’ in his grave, with one third of all Scotland’s children still living in poverty, the development of a new generation of nuclear power stations, the abolition of Clause Four and the retention of Thatcher’s anti-trade union laws, women still earning a lower average wage than men, the use of PFI/PPP in school and hospital building, the invasion of Iraq, which many consider to be based on a lie, the failure to oppose aggression against Palestine and Lebanon and the introduction of a new generation of Trident on the Clyde, all a sad legacy to Keir Hardie’s vision of egalitarianism and internationalism from today’s generation of Labour politicians."
