 *S2M-4270.1 Patrick Harvie: Planning etc. (Scotland) Billâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-4270) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "recognises the need to restore public trust in the planning system; considers that a greater emphasis on consultation and public involvement is to be welcomed but does not negate the need to rebalance the rights which can be exercised in the system, such as the right to take part in public inquiries, the right to select the form in which a hearing takes place or more equal rights at the appeal stage; considers that a hierarchy for planning must be designed to give clarity over the categories of development to ensure that all interested parties know what to expect from the system; considers that a statutory national planning framework is a positive move but that the procedures for its approval and for public and parliamentary scrutiny must be greatly enhanced; is not satisfied that the Planning etc. (Scotland) Bill meets these requirements of restoring trust, rebalancing rights, giving clarity and enhancing scrutiny, and therefore does not agree to the general principles of the Bill."
