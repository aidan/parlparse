*S3M-2467 Elaine Smith: Auchengeich Colliery Disaster—That the Parliament notes the 50th anniversary of the Auchengeich Colliery Disaster which claimed the lives of 47 miners on 18 September 1959; recognises that the tragedy not only directly affected the 41 widows and 76 children left fatherless but also impacted on all of the people of Chryston and surrounding communities; appreciates that this devastating event continues to be significant to the people of the area; commends the local community for the dignity and respect that it has shown to the memory of the victims and their families during commemorative events held annually at the disaster memorial; considers that such events play an important role in ensuring that those who die as a result of work are not forgotten; commends the trade unions for their work in building trade union organisation and campaigning for stricter enforcement with higher penalties for breaches of health and safety laws to help in the struggle for safer workplaces, and supports the call for recognition of International Workers Memorial Day as a national day of remembrance for those who have been killed, injured or made ill by their work. Supported by: George Foulkes*, Christina McKelvie*, Karen Gillon*, Cathy Jamieson*, Rob Gibson*, Bill Wilson*, John Park*
