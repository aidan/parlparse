*S3M-1042 Joe FitzPatrick: Fur Farms—That the Parliament notes that 85% of the fur industry’s skins come from animals that have lived captive on fur factory farms where conditions are often overcrowded and inhumane practices are regularly documented; considers the slaughter of animals for their fur to cause unnecessary cruelty and calls for an end to this abhorrent trade, and congratulates animal rights agencies who are campaigning this Christmas to urge the public to boycott all real fur products.
