 *S2M-4196 Michael Matheson: Sport—That the Parliament congratulates Team Scotland for winning 29 medals at the 18th Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, which is the largest number of medals ever won by a Scottish team at an overseas games; recognises that this success is due to the hard work and dedication of our athletes and coaching staff; believes that Team Scotland’s success in Melbourne should act as a springboard to ensure even greater success for our sportsmen and women in the international sporting arena and will also inspire many young Scots to participate in sport; recognises that access to good sporting facilities plays a significant role in the development of our nation’s sporting talent, and calls on the Scottish Executive to publish sportscotland’s audit of local sports facilities to ensure that the necessary facilities are in place to develop our future sporting talent.
