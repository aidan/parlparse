*S3M-2144 Keith Brown: Approaches to Alcohol and Drugs in Scotland: A Question of Architecture—That the Parliament agrees with the recent report of Scotland’s Futures Forum that social and attitudinal change as is being sought with alcohol and tobacco also has a role to play in the problem of drug use; believes that implementing the recommendation of an improved method of informing the public, especially young people, of the dangers of substance abuse would increase the ability of people in that age group to make better choices; further agrees that the drinks industry has a part to play in reducing alcohol abuse and in changing public attitudes to drinking by seeking to end irresponsible drinks promotions; commends Diageo, which has a significant presence in Clackmannanshire, for the great deal of work it has already done in that field; supports the rigorous enforcement of legislation by local licensing boards that will encourage improvements in drinking culture, paving the way for a transformation in attitudes to all form of substance abuse, and, despite not supporting all its recommendations, welcomes the report as at the very least a valid contribution to the debate on substance misuse in Scotland.
