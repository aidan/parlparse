*S2M-5297 Christine Grahame: Breathalyser Pilot Scheme—That the Parliament notes that the introduction of the ignition interlock system for breathalysing people in Canada has resulted in a reduction of 75% in the number of persistent drink drivers getting behind the wheel; notes that curbing such offending behaviour brings benefits by reducing the resource pressure on hospitals and emergency staff and ultimately on the courts; acknowledges that the ignition interlock system does not offer a panacea in terms of ending the scourge of drink driving but would be a significant tool in preventing and helping to prevent some of the 50 deaths and 270 injuries per year directly attributed to drink driving behaviour, and therefore calls on the Scottish government to introduce an extensive pilot scheme using the ignition interlock system, which would be fitted to the vehicles of those convicted of drink driving offences as a way of significantly reducing the number of deaths and injuries on Scotland’s roads as a result of drink driving offending and further acting as a deterrent.
