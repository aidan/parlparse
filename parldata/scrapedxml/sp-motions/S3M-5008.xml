*S3M-5008 Stewart Maxwell: Scotland Invented Rugby Sevens and Must Be Allowed to Compete—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) that rugby sevens will be admitted to the Olympic programme in 2016; is proud of the fact that rugby sevens was invented in Scotland, where the game was started by Melrose butcher, Ned Haig; disagrees with the proposal put forward by the International Rugby Board (IRB) that the Olympic competition should replace the Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament as the showpiece event in the international calendar, thereby blocking Scotland’s entry into the rugby sevens premier event; is concerned that the admittance of rugby sevens to the Olympics will result in the country that invented the game being barred from competing; believes that Scotland, as the country that brought rugby sevens to the world, should be allowed to continue to compete in the game at the highest level, and therefore calls on the IOC immediately to agree to admit a Scotland sevens team to the 2016 Olympics and for the IRB to scrap any plans to drop the Rugby World Cup Sevens tournament.
