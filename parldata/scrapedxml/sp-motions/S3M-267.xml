*S3M-267 Ian McKee: Fundo Mhura, Scotland’s Brightest Boxing Prospect—That the Parliament expresses concern that Fundo Mhura, one of Scotland’s brightest boxing prospects, missed out on the chance of representing Scotland at the 2006 Commonwealth Games and now risks missing the chance of selection for Team GB in the coming Olympic Games due to delays in processing his request for citizenship, despite having lived in Scotland since the age of five months and other members of his family being naturalised, and calls on the UK Government to deal urgently with his application.
