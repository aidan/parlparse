*S2M-1029 Bruce Crawford: Remember Dunblane - Conservative’s Insensitive Remarks—That the Parliament believes that, with the devastating outcome of the Dunblane tragedy still etched on the minds of the Scottish public, the comments in relation to the slackening of the handgun regulations attributed to Patrick Mercer MP, Conservative spokesman on homeland security, are entirely inappropriate and offensive, and further believes, following Mr Mercer’s comments, that David McLetchie MSP, leader of the Scottish Conservatives, should unreservedly condemn these insensitive comments and should ensure that Mr Mercer is removed from his Tory spokesman responsibility by Michael Howard MP, leader of the opposition party at Westminster, with immediate effect.
