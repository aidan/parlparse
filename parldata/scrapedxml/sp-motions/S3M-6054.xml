 *S3M-6054 Rob Gibson: BBC Alba Freeview Decision Delay—That the Parliament notes with disappointment the decision by the BBC Trust to delay announcing a decision on whether BBC Alba will be made available on Freeview; notes the success of the station so far and considers that the vast majority of people in Scotland responding to the trust’s consultation on the issue were overwhelmingly supportive; further considers that there is cross-party political support for such a move as well as support from BBC management, and therefore urges the trust to make a speedy decision to make the station available on Freeview.
