*S3M-2090 Keith Brown: Veterans Day—That the Parliament welcomes the two weeks of activities being held nationwide for Veterans Day 2008, and in particular those in Stirling running from 29 June to 13 July, to commemorate and raise awareness of the issues facing ex-service personnel; looks forward to the bagpipe procession through the city as part of the pipers’ trail on 12 July; believes in addition that there is particular poignancy to the inclusion of a screening of an Argentinean film about the Falklands War as part of the film festival; recognises the inputs of the wide range of charities doing excellent work to support this large, important and often extremely vulnerable section of Scottish society, and wishes both the organisations and the local authority the very best for the events.
