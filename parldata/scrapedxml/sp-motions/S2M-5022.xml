*S2M-5022 Frances Curran: Blockade of Coca Cola Bottling Plants in Venezuela by Employees Seeking Severance Benefits—That the Parliament notes the blockade of Coca Cola bottling and distribution plants throughout Venezuela by former employees of the company seeking their rightful severance benefits which the company has refused to pay; believes that Coca Cola’s failure to pay such benefits when its net worldwide profits for the last quarter were over $1.46 billion illustrates the total lack of social responsibility shown by global multinational companies whose only concern is to maximise profits at the expense of workers, and expresses its support for the courageous stance of the ex-employees and wishes them success in their action.
