*S3M-272 Robert Brown: HMIE Report on Services for Children of Asylum Seekers—That the Parliament notes the HM Inspectorate of Education report, Joint Inspection of services for children of asylum seekers in the Glasgow City Council area; welcomes the recognition of the good work done by staff to meet the needs of children of asylum seekers and their parents and the strong leadership shown across the partner services; recognises the considerable challenges to children’s services in this field; supports ongoing work towards achieving the improvements identified in the report, and believes that the Scottish Executive should respond to aspirations among asylum seeker children to undertake degree level studies, as identified in the HMIE report.
