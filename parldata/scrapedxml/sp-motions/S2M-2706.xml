 * S2M-2706# Ms Sandra White: Gulf War Veteransâ€”That the Parliament notes with deep concern the apparent and sustained efforts of the UK Government and unionist members of the Scottish Parliament in not supporting an independent public inquiry into the causes, and the medical treatment, of Gulf War Syndrome; notes the derisory tone of UK ministers with regard to the jurisdiction of the Scottish Parliament to intervene over the health implications of this syndrome; notes with regret that NHS boards in Scotland do not appear to be following agreed arrangements for war pensioners in terms of offering priority treatment; notes that many veterans are still suffering ill-health, notably autoimmune osteoporosis caused by the concoction of drugs administered to soldiers in the run-up to the first Gulf War; notes that the dismissive approach adopted by unionist members of both the Scottish and Westminster Parliaments to Gulf War Syndrome is adding to the distress and suffering of the affected veterans, and believes that the members of these Parliaments should adopt a more moral and courageous attitude and support the campaign for a full independent public inquiry.
