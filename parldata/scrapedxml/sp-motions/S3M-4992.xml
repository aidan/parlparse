*S3M-4992 Cathy Peattie: Trade Union Week—That the Parliament recognises the central role of the trade union movement in the campaign for a Scottish parliament and its continuing contribution throughout the first decade of devolution; welcomes the participation and involvement of the trade union movement in the Scottish parliamentary process and, in particular, the constructive engagement with parliamentarians and staff that is reinforced through Trade Union Week; congratulates the STUC on its Agenda for Rebuilding Collective Prosperity, which argues for a new economic architecture that reconnects a strong flexible economy to the living standards of all, with more income equality, sustainable and healthy jobs, investment in manufacturing, housing and green technologies, a strong, innovative public sector delivering equality of opportunity and outcome and a just transition to a greener economy built on fairer international development, and believes that the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Government should work with trade unions and encourage others in the voluntary, public and private sectors to work together to create a vibrant economy based on principles of equality, fair taxation, strong public services, sustainable employment and support for a just transition to a low-carbon economy. Supported by: Karen Whitefield*, David Stewart*, Christina McKelvie*, Sandra White*, Ken Macintosh*, Malcolm Chisholm*, Patrick Harvie*, Des McNulty*, Marlyn Glen*, James Kelly*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Cathy Jamieson*, Patricia Ferguson*
