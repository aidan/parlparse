*S3M-6439 Kenneth Gibson: The Sinking of the Cheonanâ€”That the Parliament condemns North Korea for what it believes to be the completely unnecessary and unprovoked torpedoing and sinking of the South Korean warship, ROKS Cheonan, on a routine mission in the Yellow Sea 10 miles off the North Korean Coast and 120 miles from the South Korean mainland; notes that this hostile act resulted in the death of 47 of the 104 South Korean sailors on board; recognises the extremely fragile nature of relations between North and South Korea; notes that the two nations officially remain at war as the informal ceasefire that was reached on 27 July 1953 failed to produce an official armistice and that this constitutes a situation that results in any military incursions being highly volatile; notes that North Korea has a history of antagonising South Korea and that this is the most deadly attack carried out by North Korea since the 1987 bombing of a South Korean passenger jet that killed 115 people; considers these actions to be wholly unacceptable, and agrees that a full trade embargo of North Korea will help bring what it considers to be a despotic regime to its senses.
