*S3M-5282 Helen Eadie: Parliament’s Mole Hunters—That the Parliament applauds the work of Skin Care Campaign Scotland in organising the Mole Hunters event at which more than 10% of the people on the Parliament campus had their moles checked for malignancy; considers that there is a need to change patient referral times to urgent in all cases of suspected melanomas, recognising that swift diagnosis is essential; congratulates clinicians in the NHS Lanarkshire phototriage, where there is high-quality digital imaging with medical photographers that has improved the early diagnosis and treatment of malignant melanomas, and hopes that the Scottish Government will agree to the call of Skin Care Campaign Scotland that urgent action be taken to co-ordinate a major awareness-raising campaign for recognition of moles that may have changed appearance and may be malignant, knowing of the high mortality rates for such cancerous tumours.
