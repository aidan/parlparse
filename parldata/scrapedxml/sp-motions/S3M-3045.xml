*S3M-3045 Irene Oldfather: Daily Mail - Action on Alzheimer’s Christmas Campaign—That the Parliament commends The Daily Mail for its Action on Alzheimer’s Christmas Campaign; recognises that dementia is no respecter of social class, intelligence or ability; notes that Scotland will see the number of people with dementia increase from 65,000 to an estimated 108,000 in 2031; acknowledges the commitment made by President Sarkozy of France to make dementia a priority during his six-month presidency of the European Union; therefore recognises the importance that campaigns such as these can play in removing the stigma and social isolation that people with Alzheimer’s and dementia can face, and agrees that more work needs to be done to support research into the disease and improve the quality of care for people with dementia and their carers.
