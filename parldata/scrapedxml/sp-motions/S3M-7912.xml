*S3M-7912 Bill Wilson: The Bush Torture Indictment—That the Parliament welcomes the Preliminary Bush Torture Indictment, which could serve as a basis on which to prepare country and plaintiff-specific indictments against George W Bush for condoning the use of torture in the form of waterboarding; notes that, according to international law experts at the New York-based Center for Constitutional Rights and the Berlin-based European Center for Constitutional and Human Rights, former presidents do not enjoy special immunity under the Convention Against Torture; believes that, as the UK has reportedly used information obtained from this torture, its leaders are also complicit and should face similar indictment, and is of the opinion that it is particularly important for countries claiming to believe in democracy and human rights to ensure that their nationals do not take part in, or condone, torture in any form.
