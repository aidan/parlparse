 *S2M-3236 Patrick Harvie: Software Freedom Day—That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of Software Freedom Day for working to highlight the Free and Open Source Software movement; notes that a Software Freedom Day event will take place in Edinburgh on Saturday 10 September 2005 at which members of the public will be able to try free and open source software such as Ubuntu, OpenOffice and Firefox for themselves; recognises the benefits which could exist for the public sector in making greater use of such products, including those produced by Scottish software developers; further recognises that free and open source software is founded on principles with important political concepts which have the potential for application to other areas of society and the economy, and urges the Scottish Executive to examine the scope for free and open source software throughout the public sector. Supported by: Robin Harper*, Nora Radcliffe*, Mark Ballard*, Ms Sandra White*, Mr Bruce McFee*, Eleanor Scott*, Mr Mark Ruskell*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Rob Gibson*, Chris Ballance*
