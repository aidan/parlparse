 *S3M-4689.1 James Kelly: The Arc of Recovery—As an amendment to motion (S3M-4689) in the name of Linda Fabiani, leave out from "is being" to end and insert "has benefited from action taken by the UK Government to avoid the worst effects of the global economic downturn through a fiscal stimulus package including an increase in tax allowances equivalent to £145 less tax over this year, a 2.5% cut in VAT equivalent to a 1% cut in interest rates, accelerated increases in child benefit to £20 per week and child tax credits by 25% above inflation, a one-off payment to support pensioners during the downturn in addition to the annual Winter Fuel Allowance and an increase in Pensions Credits to £130 per week for single pensioners, UK-wide action to avoid home and business repossessions as well as action to avoid the potentially catastrophic consequences of a banking collapse including avoiding potential liquidation of the Royal Bank of Scotland, HBOS and the Dunfermline Building Society; notes that, while the global economic downturn has been painful in Scotland and the UK as a whole, the effects have been considerably less severe than the experiences in Iceland and the Republic of Ireland, two of the three "arc of prosperity" counties cited as appropriate economic comparators for an independent Scotland in the SNP’s Manifesto 2007, in which the global economic downturn has resulted in not just economic recession but official depression, defined as economic contraction of at least 10%; further notes in this regard that that OECD 2009 Economic Outlook cites the collapse of Iceland’s three main banks, the required bail-out by the International Monetary Fund followed by official interest rates of 18%, as well as, what it terms "substantial spending cuts and increases in taxation" in the Republic of Ireland, which has been forced to commission a public cuts study by "An Bord Snip Nua" proposing €5.3 billion of cuts including 17,300 public service job cuts, a 5% drop in social welfare and closure of police stations among other examples, and believes that, although the so-called "arc of prosperity" was always a deeply-flawed, simplistic and contradictory economic prescription for Scotland, having cited the Republic of Ireland and Iceland as appropriate models prior to the downturn, the SNP cannot now credibly claim that a separate Scotland would have escaped a similar economic fate as those countries that have been hit far worse than Scotland within the United Kingdom and that the SNP’s selective memory of the global downturn serves to underline not just its economic ineptitude but also its insincerity with the people of Scotland."
