*S3M-1047 Alex Neil: Fuel Povertyâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern that nearly a quarter of all Scottish households are now experiencing fuel poverty, an increase of 5% since 2005; considers that the current rate of VAT on building repair work prevents people, particularly those on low incomes, from maintaining their homes; further notes the recommendation from the Federation of Master Builders that VAT on home improvements be reduced from 17.5% to 5%, and calls on the UK Government to implement this recommendation which would enable thousands of families to ensure that their homes are energy-efficient and lift them out of fuel poverty.
