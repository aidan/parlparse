*S3M-7036 Jackson Carlaw: School Trips to Auschwitz—That the Parliament considers it crucially important to ensure that the Holocaust never slips from public consciousness; applauds the work of the Holocaust Educational Trust, among other organisations, for the role that it plays in educating young people about the Holocaust, and welcomes the Scottish Government’s announcement that school trips to Auschwitz, as organised by the Holocaust Educational Trust, are to be exempted from budget cuts resulting from efforts to eradicate the United Kingdom’s record debts.
