*S3M-773 Tavish Scott: Why Shetland is Better than the Bahamas—That the Parliament notes that the recent survey of the best island destinations in the world, carried out by National Geographic, rated Shetland as the third most desirable island grouping to visit, well ahead of Hawaii, Barbados, Bermuda, Capri and Mauritius; further notes that the judges stated that Shetland had "everything with bells on", including spectacular sea cliffs, pristine beaches, fascinating geology, more than a million breeding seabirds, the highest density of otters in Europe, regular sightings of killer whales, superb displays of rare sub-Arctic flora and extremely high integrity in all aspects of heritage and ecology; believes that this news will come as no surprise to anyone who has visited Shetland; commends all those involved in the tourist industry in Shetland for adding a warm Shetland welcome to the natural and cultural assets that make Shetland a world-class visitor destination, and looks forward to the future growth of the Shetland tourist industry built on the firm foundation of its current success.
