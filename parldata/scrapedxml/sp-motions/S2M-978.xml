*S2M-978 Margaret Mitchell: BT Internet Green X Code-That the Parliament congratulates BT for producing the internet safety leaflet The Internet Green X Code and for establishing the online quiz to test children's knowledge of the code; commends the way in which BT has used innovative, interactive and educational ideas to make children aware of internet safety; notes that the code has been endorsed by the Children's Society, Barnardo's, Childline, National Children's Homes, the NSPCC, the Internet Watch Foundation, Parents Online and the Home Office, and is deeply concerned that the Scottish Executive has to date failed to introduce sexual grooming legislation to ensure that Scottish children are protected from the potential dangers of grooming over the internet in line with children in other parts of the UK. Supported by: Mr Ted Brocklebank*, Murdo Fraser*
