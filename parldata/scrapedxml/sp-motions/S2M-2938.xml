 *S2M-2938 Mike Watson: Parliament Welcomes Jobs Fair in Glasgow—That the Parliament expresses its concern at figures published by the Scottish Executive which show that only 48% of non-whites in Scotland are currently in full-time employment compared with 71% of whites in full-time employment and, in particular, the fact that there are less than half the number of non-white women in work than there are white women in work; notes that a recent survey by the Race Equality in Housing Forum revealed that black and minority ethnic employees accounted for just 0.8% of staff working for registered social landlords, but that that was twice the percentage for local authority employees; acknowledges the urgent need to improve these figures, and therefore welcomes the job fair specifically for Scotland’s black and minority ethnic population organised by the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations, the Chartered Institute of Housing and Hanover (Scotland), Bield and Trust Housing Associations taking place in Glasgow on 11 June 2005.
