 *S2M-3123 Patrick Harvie: ChildLine Funding Crisis—That the Parliament congratulates the staff and volunteers of ChildLine on providing a 24-hour helpline for children in need for almost 20 years; notes with concern the news that lack of donations may mean that the night service may have to be axed; further notes that children who access the night service are often in considerable distress; recognises ChildLine’s key role in referring cases to the relevant emergency and social services; urges MSPs and members of the public to make a donation to the emergency appeal to maintain the night service in the short term, and calls on government bodies to review their current statutory funding arrangements with the charity with a view to safeguarding the future of the service in the longer term.
