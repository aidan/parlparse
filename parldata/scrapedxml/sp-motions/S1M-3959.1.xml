 *S1M-3959.1 Richard Lochhead: The Sea Fishing (Transitional Support) (Scotland) (No.2) Scheme 2003-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3959) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end "but, in doing so, supports the views of the fishing industry, fishing communities and the Rural Development Committee that the overwhelming emphasis of any Scottish Executive aid package should be on transitional aid for the fleet and onshore sectors rather than the decommissioning of vessels, and urges ministers to respond positively to the proposals by industry representatives on how this can be best achieved."
