 *S3M-5381 Robin Harper: Domestic Abuse in SOAs—That the Parliament notes the Scottish Women’s Aid analysis of local authority Single Outcome Agreements 2009 and expresses its concern at the appallingly low level of engagement through single outcome agreements (SOA); notes in particular that fewer than one in three have specific reference in the area profile to children affected by domestic abuse, only 13 SOAs refer to specific domestic abuse or violence against women action plans, only five SOAs make any reference to violence against women in relation to gender equality despite half of the councils highlighting an increase in reported incidents of domestic abuse and only 11 state addressing this as a priority; considers that it is not clear how the implementation of national policy at a local level is monitored and evaluated or even how local authorities and their community planning partners can be held to account, and calls on the Scottish Government to address and report on this situation as a matter of urgency.
