 *S2M-2566 Alex Neil: Mismanagement at Kilmarnock Prison—That the Parliament notes the BBC’s revealing investigation into the management practices of Premier Custodial Group Ltd at Kilmarnock Prison which indicates that there is a problem with low staff morale, understaffing, numerous instances of drug abuse by prisoners and significant concerns about the lack of proper procedures in relation to suicide watches; believes this to be as a result of mismanagement and notes that the Prison Officers’ Association has grave concerns about the way in which Kilmarnock Prison is run; contends that the experiment with the privatisation of prisons, where profit is put before prisoner punishment and rehabilitation, has been a dismal failure, and calls on the Scottish Executive to immediately cancel the contract with Premier Custodial Group Ltd for running Kilmarnock Prison and bring it under the direct control of the Scottish Prison Service.
