*S2M-4121 Carolyn Leckie: Support the Strike for Pension Rights on 28 March 2006—That the Parliament notes the overwhelming mandate from local government workers to strike in defence of their contractual pension rights on 28 March 2006; regrets that the actions of the Westminster Government and the Scottish Executive in pressing for the abolition of the Rule of 85 have directly caused this trade union revolt; believes that there is no justification for this erosion of the pension rights of local government workers, most of whom are low-paid and women who already suffer pay discrimination; wholeheartedly supports the trade unions in their campaign, and calls on the Executive to stick up for workers in their jurisdiction by declaring their support for the retention of the Rule of 85 and, by so doing, to exert pressure on the Westminster Government to draw back from the biggest confrontation with workers since 1926.
