*S2M-4101&lt;&gt; Richard Lochhead: Post Office Card Accounts—That the Parliament notes the recent announcement that Post Office Card Accounts are to be phased out by 2010; notes that this news has come as a shock to pension and benefits claimants in north-east Scotland, many of whom rely on the service especially where there are no local bank branches, as well as to Post Office staff who view the scheme as a vital service; believes that the phasing out of this service could put the future of some rural post offices in severe jeopardy and lead to many of these lifeline services being lost to communities already being stripped of other vital services; supports the National Federation of SubPostmasters’ campaign to have Post Office Card Accounts retained, and considers that the Scottish Government should make appropriate representations to the UK Government on behalf of Post Office Card Account users in Scotland. Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Ms Sandra White*, Fiona Hyslop*, Brian Adam*, Shiona Baird*
