*S2M-5578 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Recognition for Kashmiri Workers—That the Parliament recognises and applauds the struggle of public sector workers in Pakistan-administered Kashmir to force the government to implement promises of compensation for losses suffered during the earthquake; notes that since 6 February 2007 these workers, organised under the Employees Action Committee, have been involved in an indefinite strike; further notes that women workers from the social welfare and education sectors have also joined the strike; condemns the government’s decision of 7 February to declare the strike illegal and to issue a "Section 144" on the capital city, Muzaffarabad, which makes any meeting of more than four workers in the street illegal; acknowledges that leading activists in the strike, who are also members of the Trade Union Rights Campaign – Kashmir, could face severe government repression as a result of their role in the strike; notes that at the time of the October 2005 earthquake the government praised these public sector workers as "heroes" because they saved the lives of thousands and eased the suffering of many more, despite the losses they themselves incurred, and that as a result the federal Pakistan and the Kashmir governments offered to wipe out bank loans taken by workers during that time and also give them a bonus equivalent to three months pay; understands that none of these promises have been implemented and that compensation for damage and destruction of houses has not yet been paid, and is concerned that millions of rupees of earthquake relief funds have disappeared into the pockets of corrupt government officials and army officers who are associated with the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority.
