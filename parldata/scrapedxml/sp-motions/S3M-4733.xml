*S3M-4733 Elaine Smith: Auchengeich Colliery Disaster—That the Parliament notes the 50th anniversary of the Auchengeich Colliery disaster, which claimed the lives of 47 miners on 18 September 1959; recognises that the tragedy not only directly affected the 41 widows and 76 children left fatherless but also impacted on all of the people of the Chryston area and surrounding communities; appreciates that this devastating event continues to be significant to the people of the area; welcomes local projects set up in memory of the tragedy including the opening of a memorial garden in St Michael’s Primary School, Moodiesburn and a fund-raising amateur boxing tournament in Auchengeich Miners Welfare, both of which ensure continued awareness of the disaster among future generations; commends the local community for the dignity and respect that it has shown to the memory of the victims and their families during commemorative events held annually at the disaster memorial; considers that such events play an important role in ensuring that those who die as a result of work are not forgotten, and urges support for the 50th anniversary commemoration event organised by the Auchengeich Colliery Memorial Committee which takes place on 20 September 2009.
