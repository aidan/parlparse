 *S2M-4480 Christine Grahame: Scottish Government and Scottish Ministers—That the Parliament considers that the use of the term "Scottish Executive" is misleading and confuses the Liberal/Labour government with the Scottish Parliament and, in particular, allowed the Liberal Democrats in the Dunfermline and West Fife by-election successfully to masquerade as being in opposition on issues such as hospital closures, transport and education; notes that section 44 of the Scotland Act 1998 states that "(1) There shall be a Scottish Executive, whose members shall be (a) the First Minister, and (b) such Ministers as the First Minister may appoint" and that "(2) The members of the Scottish Executive are referred to collectively as the Scottish Ministers"; further notes that parliamentary questions may be directed to the First Minister, and considers that as the terms "Scottish Executive" and "Scottish Ministers" are synonymous the Scottish government should be able to answer questions put down to "Scottish Ministers".
