*S2M-5669 Des McNulty: Dealing with Illegal Money Lenders—That the Parliament condemns the activities of illegal money lenders who prey on and exploit vulnerable individuals and communities; welcomes the Scottish Executive’s determination to work in partnership with the UK Government to tackle illegal lending through enforcement and by developing new approaches, such as the successful illegal money lending task force pilots, and supports the Executive’s activity to help affected individuals by increasing affordable credit from credit unions, by improving the availability of money advice, through citizens’ advice, local authority trading standards departments and other organisations which provide invaluable help to those with unmanageable debt, and by extending financial education in schools and in other settings such as the workplace and the community.
