*S2M-4167 Christine Grahame: Public Information Broadcasts in the South of Scotland—That the Parliament notes the decision by the Scottish government to stop public information broadcasts to the south of Scotland (Border TV) region, covering towns as far apart as Portpatrick in the west and Eyemouth in the east, and residents throughout the Scottish Borders and Dumfries and Galloway; further notes that over 5% of the Scottish population live in this TV region and are not now receiving public information broadcasts on issues such as anti-social behaviour, anti-racism, domestic abuse, the new legislation banning smoking in public places, fire safety and many other important notifications, and believes that the decision to halt broadcasts in 2004 has had a detrimental impact on the health and wellbeing of the people in the south of Scotland and that this decision is yet further evidence of the neglect of this region of Scotland by coalition ministers.
