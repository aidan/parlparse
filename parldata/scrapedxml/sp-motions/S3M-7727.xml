*S3M-7727 Margo MacDonald: PFI Exposed—That the Parliament congratulates the Rt Hon Margaret Hodge MP, Chair of the Public Accounts Committee on the committee’s investigation into PFI-funded housing and hospitals; notes that the committee’s findings echo opinions expressed years ago by opponents of PFI regarding any financial advantage that accrued to the public purse compared with the usual and traditional means of borrowing to finance such projects, but, to paraphrase, is nevertheless happy that one sinner has repented and admitted the error of her ways.
