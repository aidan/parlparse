 * S2M-3092 Christine Grahame: Transparency and Accountabilityâ€”That the Parliament notes the increased trend in written answers provided by ministers of giving reference to a Scottish Parliament Information Centre bibliography number without an electronic link; considers that this practice debars members of the public from easy access to such answers, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that answers either have an electronic link or, if this is not available, are printed in full in the Written Answers Report.
