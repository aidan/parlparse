 *S3M-6038.1 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Number Shop Cut Doesn’t Add Up—As an amendment to motion (S3M-6038) in the name of Sarah Boyack, leave out after "to the benefit of people across the city" to end and insert "; notes that this is only a proposal and that no final decision has been made by the council, and further believes that such proposals would have been avoided had Labour, Liberal Democrat, Conservative and Green party members not voted in both the Scottish Parliament and the City Chambers in favour of the plan for Tram Line 1a based on an entirely flawed business case, the consequence of which is that the city is having to pay the cost in next year’s budget and for many years to come."
