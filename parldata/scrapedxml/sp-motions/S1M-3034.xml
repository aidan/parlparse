*S1M-3034# Margaret Jamieson: Meares-Irlen Syndrome-That the Parliament notes that Meares-Irlen syndrome affects up to one-third of all young people and, in the worst cases, has a serious impact on their learning in the early years; further notes that, for many children, its effects can be mitigated by colour overlays or lenses but that the facilities within the Scottish health service to diagnose and treat this syndrome are few and far between, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should work with the NHS and the education authorities to ensure early diagnosis of this syndrome and to put in place cost-effective methods of treating it.
