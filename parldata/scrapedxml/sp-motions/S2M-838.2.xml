 *S2M-838.2 Patrick Harvie: Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Bill - UK Legislation-As an amendment to motion (S2M-838) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end "but, in so doing, expresses its concern that the creation of the new offence in clause 4 of the Bill may conflict with other provisions in clause 2 of the Bill which would inappropriately criminalise the victims of trafficking, many of whom will have entered the country without valid documentation, and believes that Her Majesty's Government should do nothing which causes victims of trafficking to be fearful of approaching the authorities for support."
