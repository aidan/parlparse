*S3M-4430 Pauline McNeill: President Obama Calls on Israel to Lift the Siege on Gaza—That the Parliament expresses its concern at the recent UN agency assessment that health conditions are worsening in Gaza; notes that the continuing siege of Gaza means that only 40 medical items are currently allowed to be imported daily when, before the 22-day conflict in December 2008/January 2009, some 4,000 medical items per day on average could cross into Gaza and that no reparation work has taken place in Gaza since the conflict; further notes the recent remarks by President Obama at a White House meeting with Prime Minister Netanyahu of Israel "that if the people of Gaza have no hope, if they can’t even get clean water at this point, if the border closures are so tight that it is impossible for reconstruction and humanitarian efforts to take place, then that is not going to be a recipe for Israel’s long-term security or a constructive peace track to move forward", and calls on the international community to bring an end to the siege in Gaza in tandem with a Middle East peace process.
