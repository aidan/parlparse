*S2M-4173 Jackie Baillie: Whisky Duty on Ice—That the Parliament warmly welcomes the Budget announcement by Gordon Brown MP, Chancellor of the Exchequer, that duty on whisky and other spirits will be frozen yet again; considers this to be a progressive move which helps support the industry’s competitiveness and productivity; notes that a fairer alcohol duty regime helps support a key British industry in its home market and sends a message of tax fairness overseas, as distillers look to develop new opportunities in emerging markets such as China, and congratulates the Labour Government on maintaining this freeze on duty on whisky since 1997.
