* S3M-6597♦ Robert Brown: Future of Stow College—That the Parliament notes the recent undertakings by the Scottish Funding Council to support the Glasgow Central Colleges Amalgamation project; considers that this development is likely to have a negative impact on Stow College, which has withdrawn from the planned amalgamation; believes that the progress towards this new consortium will threaten Stow’s ability to provide the valuable educational services currently proffered by the college to over 10,000 learners as resources will now be directed toward the new central facility; notes that Stow offers the most extensive range of SWAP Access programmes in Scotland, which are specifically designed to provide a route into higher education for mature adults with few or no qualifications; further notes that 40% of full-time students come from the most deprived areas in Scotland; congratulates Stow College on its 70 years of pursuing open access and social inclusion through its progressive educational outlook, and would welcome support for the continuing viability of Stow College.
