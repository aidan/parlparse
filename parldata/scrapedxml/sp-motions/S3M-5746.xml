*S3M-5746 Patrick Harvie: Robin Hood Tax—That the Parliament commends the campaigners behind the Robin Hood Tax, a proposal to levy an average 0.05% tax on speculative banking transactions and spend the many billions of pounds raised on protecting vital public services and on fighting poverty and climate change; notes that there is support for the Robin Hood Tax from organisations including Oxfam, the New Economics Foundation, People &amp; Planet, Barnardo’s and a host of others; believes that, after the crisis in banking and the huge public bailout that followed, this proposal is not only necessary but also an entirely desirable way of moving toward a fairer and more sustainable economy, and urges the Scottish Government to lend its support to the campaign, which can be found at http://robinhoodtax.org.uk.
