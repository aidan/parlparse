*S2M-1697 Carolyn Leckie: Children Deserve Justice—That the Parliament recognises that a small number of fathers may have had their access and custody claims unfairly considered but recognises that most fathers lose contact with their children within five years of divorce, even though there are no restrictions placed on contact, that most single parents are women and are placed in poverty as a result and that most incidences of restrictions of access or contact are made to protect the interests and well-being of children and women, significant numbers of whom have been subjected to domestic abuse, which can be manifested in various forms; regrets the disproportionate attention campaigns for fathers’ rights have attracted when the concerns, pressures and poverty of mothers and children have resulted in no significant action; regrets that the effect of that attention has induced a climate of misogyny, pushed the welfare of children off the agenda and shifted the political debate on families and children to the right, and believes that it is time that the interests of children are placed at the top of the agenda, starting with the removal of the massive amount of children of single parents in poverty out of poverty and offering decent, safe affordable housing for all in an environment that can offer adequate protection from abusive men as and when necessary.
