*S2M-1466 Chris Ballance: "Super Crabbers" on the Solway Firth-That the Parliament notes with concern the return of "super crabbers" to the Solway Firth; notes that last year industrial fishing in the Solway Firth endangered otherwise sustainable local fisheries; notes that "super crabbers" are prevented from fishing within three miles of the Solway Firth on the English side of the Firth and yet are not banned on the Scottish side; notes that the Scottish Executive, under the Inshore Fishing (Scotland) Act 1984, has powers to act to protect inshore fisheries and associated communities; congratulates the Executive on the measures that it has just taken under the Act to protect shellfish stocks in Luce Bay and Wigtown Bay; calls on the Executive as a matter of urgency to extend protection to the entire Scottish side of the Solway Firth fishery by imposing a three-mile exclusion zone similar to that on the English side of the Firth, and further calls on the Executive to ensure protection for all of Scotland's marine environment and the communities dependent on them through an integrated Marine Act and the appointment of a dedicated Marine Minister.
