*S2M-2529 Stewart Stevenson: Aberdeenshire Sports and Recreation Facilitiesâ€”That the Parliament deplores the inappropriate sense of priorities displayed by Aberdeenshire Liberal Democrat councillors in choosing to donate a six-figure sum to the development of swimming facilities for a city university outwith its own area while their own Mintlaw Academy has none and while Peterhead pool is in urgent need of new investment.
