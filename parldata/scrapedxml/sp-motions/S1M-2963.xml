*S1M-2963# Karen Whitefield: In-patient Paediatric Services at Monklands District Hospital-That the Parliament notes with concern the decision by Lanarkshire Primary Care NHS Trust to renege on its commitment to re-establish in-patient paediatric services within Monklands District Hospital; believes that the Trust should fulfil this commitment and return these services to the hospital as soon as possible and invites the Scottish Executive to make urgent representations to the Trust to ensure that the views of the people of Monklands are fully considered before any final decision is made regarding the future of these services.
