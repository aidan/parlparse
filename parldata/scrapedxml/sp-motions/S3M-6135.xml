*S3M-6135 Jamie Hepburn: Westminster Joint Committee on Human Rights’ Call for Inquiry into UK Complicity in Torture—That the Parliament notes the publication of a parliamentary report by the Joint Committee on Human Rights criticising the UK Government for continuing to reject calls for an independent inquiry into allegations of MI5 and MI6 complicity in torture; notes the committee’s finding that there is strong evidence to suggest that the Security Service was complicit in torture; further notes with concern what the committee chairman described as the UK Government’s entirely new definition of complicity for which the committee "cannot find any legal basis"; believes complicity or assistance in acts of torture to be heinous, and calls on the UK Government to listen to the urgent calls of the Joint Committee on Human Rights, Andrew Dismore MP, Lord Carlile QC and David Cameron MP, to name a few, to set up a full independent inquiry immediately and to follow the action taken by the Obama administration in putting significant Justice Department documents, including legal advice from the past and present on matters such as interrogation techniques, into the public domain.
