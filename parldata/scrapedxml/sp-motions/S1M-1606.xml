 *S1M-1606# Christine Grahame: A Pill in the Sandwich—That the Parliament notes that the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine Volume 93, August 2000, found that in a study of residential care 71% of residential homes UK wide admitted administering drugs surreptitiously, although almost none had a formal policy on covert care medication; further notes that in his answer on 29 January 2001 to question S1W-12430, which asked whether the Scottish Executive would commission research into allegations of surreptitious use of drugs in residential and nursing homes, the Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care stated that there are no such plans at present, that the arrangements that are in place and those that are planned for the future are designed to ensure high quality care and protection for all care home residents and that the need for this specific research would be kept under review; believes that the this issue must be investigated now, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to determine what research is available or ongoing both here and elsewhere in the UK and collate such information with a view to commissioning further research into the surreptitious use of drugs on elderly and infirm people.
