*S3M-3293 # Murdo Fraser: Combating Human Trafficking—That the Parliament recognises the need to develop appropriate strategies to combat the evil practice of trafficking people into Scotland; commends the important and continuing work of the International Justice Mission (IJM) to combat sex trafficking; notes that, in the 12 years since the organisation’s founding, the IJM’s investigations have resulted in freedom for hundreds of girls and women held by force in the commercial sex trade; also recognises that the IJM’s founding principle is the defence and protection of individual human rights for all people by bringing the law to bear on their behalf and by prosecuting perpetrators who violate local and international laws; also notes the important contribution of local groups such as Cupar Justice and Peace Group on this issue, and further recognises the international and interdependent characteristics of human trafficking and the need for an internationally coordinated approach to bring about the end of such crimes here in Scotland and across the world.
