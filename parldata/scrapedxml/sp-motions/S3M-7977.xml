 *S3M-7977♦ Mike Rumbles: Grampian Police—That the Parliament notes with concern comments from the Chief Constable of Grampian Police, Colin McKerracher, that merging Scotland’s police forces could lead to the loss of 4,000 police officers’ jobs, including up to 400 in Grampian; further notes Mr McKerracher’s view that there is not a shred of evidence that a single force would be the best option; welcomes the vote by Northern Constabulary officers and staff to reject a single police force by 86.6%, and expresses its disappointment that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice has, it considers, undermined and pre-empted the current consultation on the issue by stating that a strong case had been made for a single force.
