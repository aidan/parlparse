*S3M-5295 Nigel Don: Missing People—That the Parliament applauds the work of the charity, Missing People, in searching for those who have gone missing by securing publicity, manning three 24-hour year-round helplines and providing necessary resources and assistance to runaways, who are often contending with a wide range of personal issues; notes the recent research undertaken by Missing People in Scotland, with the support and assistance of the People’s Postcode Lottery (PPL), which highlights that 43,780 people were reported missing in Scotland last year; further notes the importance of the £380,000 that the PPL has donated so far to Missing People in helping it to ensure that families across Scotland receive specialist advice and practical support, and extends the Parliament’s deepest sympathies to those who have a family member or a loved one who is currently missing.
