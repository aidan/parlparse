*S3M-4375 Kenneth Gibson: Labour’s Cut Exposed by Channel 4’s FactCheck—That the Parliament deplores the most recent distinction of the Prime Minister, the Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP, having been awarded one of the worst possible scores by Channel 4’s FactCheck for factual accuracy in responses during Prime Minister’s Questions on 10 June 2009; is of the view that such a marked achievement was accomplished through misrepresentation, exaggeration and massaging of statistics; believes that the Prime Minister could not resist attempting to hide the fact that his budget mimics Tory plans for future cuts in public services though billions have flowed to city bankers; questions the Prime Minister’s resolve to undertake parliamentary reform when it appears that he is unable to control a seemingly never-ending need for fabrication; sees this exhibition of illusion as a befitting embodiment of Labour’s UK leadership whereby results are massaged to show gain but, in real terms, we have lost; wishes to remind the Prime Minister that no amount of spin can hide that £500 million will be cut from vital Scottish services in financial year 2010-11; looks forward to a time when Westminster can have grown-up discussions on how to protect frontline services, and hopes that the Prime Minister will emulate the SNP government’s example of transparency, honesty and delivery, which seemingly, as experienced so often under Labour, has been disregarded.
