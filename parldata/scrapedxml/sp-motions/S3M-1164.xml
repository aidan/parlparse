 *S3M-1164 John Wilson: Trade Union Democracy—That the Parliament expresses its concern about the fact that many trade unions link their political funds to only one political party; is concerned that this does not reflect the diversity of political opinion within the trade union movement, and therefore calls on trade unions to ensure that there is democratic renewal and to hold a ballot of trade union members on which political party, if any, their political fund should support.
