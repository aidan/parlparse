 *S2M-1208# Bill Butler: Back to School Day-That the Parliament welcomes the "Back to School Day" campaign organised by the Global Campaign for Education, a coalition of local and international non-government organisations and trade unions from 180 countries, including Oxfam, Save the Children and the EIS; notes that the campaign highlights the 100 million children throughout the world with no access to education, two thirds of whom are girls and young women, and that one quarter of the total adult population of the developing world cannot read or write; recognises that a basic, free education is a human right; commends the pupils of Corpus Christi Primary School in Knightswood, Glasgow, and, indeed, all Scottish school pupils who participated in "Back to School Day" on 23 April 2004, and believes that the Scottish Executive should do all in its power, along with Westminster and governments worldwide, to support basic, free education in the developing world.
