*S3M-1392 Jamie Stone: BMI Cutting Inverness to Heathrow Airlink—That the Parliament recognises the significance in the past of direct links between Inverness Airport and Heathrow Airport to the economic and social wellbeing of the Highlands and Islands, particularly in relation to tourism, exports, the business economy and employment; is deeply concerned by BMI’s decision to discontinue its flights to and from Inverness and Heathrow, believing this to be undermining tourism and the economy of the Highlands by dramatically downgrading access to London, the south and international flights, and believes that the Scottish Executive should pursue this matter vigorously with BMI and appropriate UK ministers with a view to restoring the Inverness to Heathrow link.
