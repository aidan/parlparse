*S2M-2468 Chris Ballance: Nuclear Non-Proliferation—That the Parliament warmly welcomes the national tour being conducted in February and March by the veteran and inveterate peace campaigner and CND Vice-President, Bruce Kent, to draw attention to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference taking place in New York in May; supports the theme of the tour, as organised by the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, to build the conditions to "Abolish all nukes now", recognises that the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) has, since 1968, formed the basis for a near-universal non-proliferation regime, with a commitment to nuclear disarmament at the heart of this; recalls that, under the NPT, the nearly 200 non-nuclear weapons states promised not to obtain nuclear weapons in exchange for disarmament by existing nuclear weapons states, which unfortunately has not been implemented despite the requirements of Article Six of the NPT upon the nuclear weapons signatory states, comprising the United Kingdom, United States of America, Russia, China and France; recalls that, at the 2000 NPT Review Conference, the nuclear weapons states made ‘an unequivocal undertaking’ towards nuclear disarmament and agreed on 13 steps towards disarmament, and calls on the UK Government to honour this commitment.
