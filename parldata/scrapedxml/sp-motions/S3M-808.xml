*S3M-808 Dave Thompson: The Impact of HMRC Brief 50/07 on Sports Trusts in Scotland—That the Parliament calls on Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs (HMRC) to rethink its proposals that would allow it to reclaim VAT on membership fees to leisure trusts before 31 March 2007; notes the financial impact that this could have on sports trusts and councils across Scotland and the United Kingdom which in many cases may have to be passed on to leisure facility users or see services reduced; further notes that this goes against current policy which seeks to encourage more people to take part in sporting activities as part of a healthier lifestyle, and supports the Sport and Recreational Trust Association (SPORTA) in its next meeting with HMRC to discuss this issue.
