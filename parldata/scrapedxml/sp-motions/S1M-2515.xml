*S1M-2515 John Scott: Beatson Oncology Centre, Glasgow-That the Parliament notes with extreme concern and regret the decision by four senior consultants to leave the Beatson Oncology Centre in Glasgow as a result of major difficulties in the provision of cancer care services and low morale; notes that this leaves the Beatson Oncology Centre with 10 vacant posts which seriously impedes its ability to deliver cancer care and treatment, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take decisive action to address the situation.
