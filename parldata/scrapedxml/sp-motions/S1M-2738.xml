*S1M-2738 Pauline McNeill: Glasgow Underground-That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Strathclyde Passenger Transport Authority (SPTA) not to increase the fares on the Glasgow Underground from 90p to £1.00; notes that this fare freeze will ensure that the Glasgow Underground remains an accessible, environmentally friendly and affordable alternative to cars for many Glaswegians and visitors to the city; further notes that 95% of passengers report their satisfaction with the Underground service, confirming that it remains the quickest and most reliable way of getting around Glasgow, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work with SPTA to find alternative means of securing the extra £220,000 to cover the costs of essential repairs and to upgrade the system.
