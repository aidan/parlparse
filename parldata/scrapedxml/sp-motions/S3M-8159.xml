*S3M-8159 Rob Gibson: New Life for Trad Music Centre at Plockton—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Government on what it considers to be the imaginative package of measures that it has put together to save the Plockton-based National Centre of Excellence in Traditional Music from the threat to its funding by Highland Council; considers that these solutions are innovative and have helped to bail out Highland Council in what it sees as a lack of commitment to excellence in traditional music by the authority; praises the musical protests that were held to save the centre; notes that these protests gathered support locally and nationally; calls on Highland Council to show more sensitivity in its duty of care to the centre’s director, staff, students and students’ families; applauds what it sees as the greater co-operation with partners to place beyond doubt the local authority’s commitment to Scotland’s traditional music and culture that, it believes, will help the centre, alongside the Féisian movement, to flourish in challenging financial times, and wishes all associated with the centre a harmonious and successful future.
