*S3M-98 Brian Adam: Education Authorities Inspection Report on Schools in Aberdeen—That the Parliament notes with concern the conclusions of the second education authorities inspection report on schools in Aberdeen which reveals a number of deficiencies in the provision of primary and secondary education in Aberdeen under previous council administrations, such as a dramatic increase in the number of exclusions and a general failure to support pupils with behavioural and emotional difficulties; also notes with concern that the report identifies a widening gulf between the academic achievements of pupils from schools in affluent areas and areas of greater social need; recognises that, although this report is highly critical, Aberdeen City Council has already taken great steps to address the main points for action, and wishes it well in its endeavours.
