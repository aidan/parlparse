 *S3M-7856 Alasdair Allan: SS Politician—That the Parliament notes that 5 February 2011 will mark the 70th anniversary of the sinking of the SS Politician after it ran aground off Eriskay; notes that Eriskay and the neighbouring island of Barra were propelled into the national spotlight following the subsequent salvaging of some of its 24,000 cases of malt whisky in an incident that would go on to become famous thanks to the film, Whisky Galore!, which was inspired by the novel by Compton Mackenzie; considers that the events surrounding the SS Politician still resonate strongly in the communities of the Sound of Barra and that they have now passed into legend, and believes that the SS Politician is a vital part of the rich cultural heritage of the Western Isles.
