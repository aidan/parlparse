 S3M-3204 Kenneth Gibson: Interest Rate Cuts—That the Parliament is concerned at the failure of the financial sector to adequately pass on to borrowers successive interest rate cuts made by the Bank of England; is aware that mortgage interest rates are now commonly three to four times the base rate and commercial rates often 3% or more above base rate; recognises that banks in which the UK taxpayer has a significant stake have among the highest rates of all; is aware that standard credit card interest rates now average more than 10 times the base rate and that interest on overdrafts remains at around 1.1% per month; acknowledges that savers face declining returns while borrowers continue to struggle, and urges the UK Government to exert pressure on the banking sector to reduce the burden on business and individual borrowers alike.
