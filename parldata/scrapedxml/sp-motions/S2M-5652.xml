*S2M-5652 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Congratulations to Greenpeace—That the Parliament congratulates Greenpeace on its recent blockade of a Trident nuclear submarine at its base at Faslane; considers that Tony Blair is pushing through the replacement of Trident, an immoral, illegal and unnecessary weapon, against the wishes of the majority of the British people; acknowledges that its replacement will pose a threat to the security of the world, both by the possibility of it being used and by encouraging other countries to maintain or develop their own nuclear weapons, and calls on the Scottish Executive to stand up for the people of Scotland and the world and put pressure on Tony Blair to scrap the Trident replacement.
