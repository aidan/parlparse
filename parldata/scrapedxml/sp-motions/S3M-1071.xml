*S3M-1071 Mike Pringle: Female Prisoners—That the Parliament expresses concern that the number of female inmates within Scottish prisons remains at an unacceptably high level and that over the last decade the number of female prisoners in Scotland has almost doubled, with the number of prisoners in Cornton Vale rising from 184 in 1997 to 365 in 2006; calls for cross-party consensus to take the measures necessary to ensure a significant cut in the number of female prisoners over the next decade, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to recognise that alternatives to custody such as drug rehabilitation programmes, effective community sentences and the appropriate use of mental health facilities and support should form part of a determined drive to address the particular issues relating to female prisoners in Scotland.
