*S1M-4057.1 Andrew Wilson: The Scottish Economy-As an amendment to motion (S1M-4057) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from "endorses" to end and insert "believes that a dramatic improvement on the underperformance of the Scottish economy should be the top priority of Scotland's leaders and calls for all parties to work together to place growth and competitiveness at the top of our national agenda; supports initiatives such as set out in Smart, Successful Scotland and effective investment in infrastructure and skills improvement but believes more must be done to deliver maximum growth and a competitive advantage for the Scottish economy; calls on all parties to support positive reform of the Scottish Enterprise network and a reduction in Scottish business rates to below the United Kingdom rate in the course of the next session of the Parliament, and believes that the optimal policy to release Scotland's full economic potential requires the Scottish government to be equipped with the same competitive policy tools as Scotland's independent competitors focussed on delivering the maximum possible competitive advantage for the Scottish economy."
