*S3M-5108 John Park: It’s Fun to Save—That the Parliament welcomes the work of members of the Association of Mutual Insurers in developing a UK-wide initiative entitled Fun to Save that encourages four to seven-year-old children to become more financially capable; celebrates the recent launch of the Fun to Save website: www.funtosave.org, which is the first UK-wide free resource designed to help children learn about the importance of savings and develop healthy attitudes towards money in everyday life; recognises that this is the only website that takes a holistic approach to savings by utilising learning games, by supporting activities for parents and by supporting lesson plans for teachers; notes the involvement of HM Treasury, the UK Government’s Department for Children, Families and Schools, the Financial Services Authority and the Personal Financial Education Group in the development of this initiative, and encourages parents and teachers to engage with the Fun to Save website, where learning about the core principles of money and the benefits of saving is both accessible and fun.
