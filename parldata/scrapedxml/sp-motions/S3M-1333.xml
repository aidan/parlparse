*S3M-1333 Patrick Harvie: Wilson Doctrine—That the Parliament notes the public debate on surveillance which has been sparked by revelations of the bugging of Sadiq Khan MP; further notes the existence of the Wilson Doctrine which affords MPs some protection from surveillance while carrying out their duties; believes that there are inherent weaknesses in the doctrine and that its application has not been consistent; recognises that debate on these issues seems likely to lead to new rules defining the limits of surveillance in politics; believes that any such rules must include an absolute ban on the political use of information gained from surveillance activity and must also protect the right of members of the public to consult confidentially their elected representatives at all levels, in particular those who have responsibility for aspects of the justice system; further believes that the same restrictions should also apply to confidential access to legal advice, and calls on the Scottish Government to initiate discussions with the UK Government to ensure that the role of MSPs is recognised as equivalent to that of MPs for these purposes and respected in the rules governing the use of surveillance.
