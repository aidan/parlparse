*S3M-5836 Bill Wilson: Royal Secrecy against the Democratic Systemâ€”That the Parliament considers that in any democratic system of government freedom of access to information is an essential safeguard of that democracy; further considers that freedom of information should apply to all individuals within the system of government, both elected parliamentarians and the head of state; notes that, at present, the UK system of government is a constitutional monarchy with the Queen as head of state; believes that, as such, royal papers should be available for inspection on an equal footing with any other government document, and therefore calls on the UK Government to drop plans to allow greater secrecy for the royal family than is proposed for any other government document.
