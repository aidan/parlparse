 * S2M-2407 Mark Ballard:Link Between Transport Choices and Income—That the Parliament notes the finding of the Scottish Household Survey that, in households with a net income of £5,000 to £10,000, only 20% of householders drive regularly while 55% use the bus regularly, whereas in households with an income of over £40,000, 74% drive regularly and only 29% regularly use the bus; further notes that the data ranges between these two extremes show that the wealthier the household, the more likely its members are to use a car and the less likely they are to use a bus; believes that this survey reflects the income distribution and transport choices of people who will be subject to Edinburgh’s congestion charge which will, therefore, be levied proportionately more on the rich and not the poor; commends the Yes to Edinburgh campaign and the Get Edinburgh Moving campaign for their brave work towards tackling gridlock in Edinburgh, and condemns the Scottish Socialist Party, the Scottish National Party, the Scottish Liberal Democrats and the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party for campaigning against action to prevent congestion, respiratory disease and road death, all of which disproportionately affect low income Edinburgh households without cars.
