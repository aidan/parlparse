*S3M-1205 Cathy Peattie: UN International Year of Languages—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the United Nations General Assembly to designate 2008 as the International Year of Languages; recognises the role of UNESCO in co-ordinating activities during the year; notes the views of the Director-General of UNESCO, Mr Koichiro Matsuura, that every linguistic community should be encouraged and permitted to use its mother tongue as widely as possible, including within education; calls on the Scottish Executive to mark and celebrate the international year of languages in ways which encourage the use of the Scots and Gaelic languages, and believes that the Executive should respond positively to UNESCO’s call for International Mother Language Day on 21 February 2008 to be used as an appropriate date for the introduction of language initiatives.
