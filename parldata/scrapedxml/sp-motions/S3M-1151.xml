 *S3M-1151 Helen Eadie: New Schools and Extensions to Existing Schools—That the Parliament notes that in the term of office of the last administration in Scotland record numbers of new schools were built; further notes that the new Scottish Government does not have a programme for replacing old schools or adding extensions to existing schools where demand requires modification; recognises that it is vital that schools in the most deprived areas like Lochgelly, Cardenden, Benarty and Cowdenbeath be rebuilt or modernised at as early an opportunity as possible; further recognises that in schools like Donibristle Primary School where the school has the highest number of primary school pupils in Fife there is an urgent requirement to address the needs identified by parents and teachers for a new assembly hall, and hopes that the Scottish Government will announce to the Parliament without further delay, given that it has now been in office for nine months, how it proposes to finance such new developments, how it will prioritise the developments and what steps it will take next to ensure that work starts without further delay to develop a programme of new building in Fife and elsewhere.
