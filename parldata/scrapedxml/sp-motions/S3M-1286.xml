*S3M-1286 Jim Tolson: Rising Energy Prices—That the Parliament notes the move from energy providers Npower, EDF and British Gas to increase prices over recent months and condemns the decision of providers to increase energy tariffs by up to 15%; acknowledges that such moves make it inevitable that the remaining power companies will raise prices by several times the rate of inflation, leading to increased levels of fuel poverty for many of Scotland’s most vulnerable people; further notes Energywatch’s belief that there is no reasonable explanation for the recent sharp increases in wholesale costs, and calls on gas and electricity suppliers to reinvest more of their profits, lowering prices for the most vulnerable customers.
