*S2M-957 Tommy Sheridan: Support for Nursery Nurses' All-Out Strike Action-That the Parliament notes that Scotland's nursery nurses deliver an excellent package of pre-school education and care to Scotland's children but receive a woefully inadequate salary in return; further notes that Scotland's nursery nurses have not had their pay reviewed for over 15 years, have been trying to negotiate an improved pay and conditions package for over three years and have been involved in selective industrial action in pursuit of their claim for over nine months, but sadly both the Convention of Scottish Local Authorities and the Scottish Executive have ignored the pleas of UNISON on behalf of the nursery nurses and the nursery nurses have now voted by an 80% margin to embark on all-out strike action; accepts that such all-out strike action will cause difficulties for thousands of parents, but believes that nursery nurses have been left with no choice; resolves, therefore, to support their action by visiting picket lines, attending rallies and meetings and organising financial donations, and calls on the Scottish Executive to intervene on the side of the nursery nurses in recognition of the fact that they are scandalously low-paid and deserve a starting salary of £14,000 per annum and an improved career structure.
