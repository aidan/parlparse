 *S3M-1263 Jackson Carlaw: Proposed Closure of Morton and St Fergus Nurseries in Renfrewshire—That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Liberal Democrat/SNP-led Renfrewshire Council to close the HMIE-commended Morton Nursery in Linwood and St Fergus Nursery in Ferguslie; notes that these decisions fly in the face of overwhelming opposition of staff, parents and the local community as a whole in each case, and urges the council to reconsider these ill-thought-out plans thus ensuring that the people of Linwood and Ferguslie can continue to benefit from the excellent standard of education, care and supervision that each nursery delivers for many years to come.
