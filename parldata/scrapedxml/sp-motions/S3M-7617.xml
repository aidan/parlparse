*S3M-7617 Kenneth Gibson: Green Gym—That the Parliament commends the continued work being done by the Kilbirnie Green Gym volunteers in their ongoing projects in the Garnock valley area of North Ayrshire; recognises what it considers to be the success of the recent completion of the Bridgend Community Centre Gardens project in Kilbirnie; believes that the Green Gym volunteers display a positive attitude towards the values of sustainability, health and wellbeing and community spirit; commends what it sees as the volunteers’ resourcefulness and success in securing donations as well as utilising recycled materials in order to beautify the local community; welcomes the Green Gym as a project in which people of all ages can increase their activity levels, become fitter, improve social skills and improve their overall health and wellbeing, and wishes the partnership of Healthy North Ayrshire and the British Trust for Conservation Volunteers the best of luck as they expand their Green Gym initiative across the Garnock Valley.
