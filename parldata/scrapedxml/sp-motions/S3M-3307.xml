 *S3M-3307 Des McNulty: Victims of Historic Child Abuse—That the Parliament expresses deep concern that many victims of historic child abuse are being denied formal redress through the courts or compensation for the abuse that they suffered while in the care of local government, health authorities and charitable organisations; recognises their anger at the continued barriers that they face in seeking restitution, and calls on the Scottish Government to match the support given to similar victims in other jurisdictions.
