 *S2M-4506 Carolyn Leckie: World Cup Germany 2006 - Yes to Football - No to Exploitation and Abuse of Women—That the Parliament expresses its profound concern for the women who will be abused and harmed by men through prostitution during the World Cup being held in Germany; is appalled that commercial sexual exploitation is a feature of this World Cup, due to the enabling legislation adopted by the German Government in 2002 which legalised prostitution and encouraged the proliferation of the view that women can be bought and sold, resulting in an explosion of profits for those who exploit women in an "enterprise" with a 14.5 billion Euro turnover, which is bigger than that of Germany’s biggest department store chain; expresses horror that an estimated three million "purchases" of women by men will be made over the course of the tournament, including in grotesque fenced-off compounds and "performance boxes"; supports the views of women’s groups, NGOs, human rights organisations and others that the German Government should review its legislation; calls on the Scottish Football Association and all British football associations to condemn such exploitation and actively discourage footballers, officials and supporters from abusing and exploiting women via prostitution, and believes that such a challenge to the demand by men for prostitution will help to assist the development of the Challenging Demand agenda in Scotland and Britain.
