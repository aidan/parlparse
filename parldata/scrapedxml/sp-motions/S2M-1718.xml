*S2M-1718# Colin Fox: James Keir Hardie—That the Parliament notes that this month is the 89th anniversary of the death of James Keir Hardie, first leader of the Independent Labour Party; acknowledges that he originally supported the Liberal Party before quickly abandoning them in favour of the idea that the working class needed a party of their own; notes that he was elected as the United Kingdom’s first socialist MP, campaigned for the abolition of the House of Lords and was an outspoken anti-imperialist opponent of World War I, and wishes every success for the Keir Hardie Memorial Lecture to be held in Greenmills Primary School, Cumnock on Thursday 30 September 2004.
