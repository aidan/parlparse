*S3M-3165 Pauline McNeill: Situation in Gaza—That the Parliament is gravely concerned at the tragic events that began in the Gaza Strip on 27 December 2008 and the subsequent ground invasion of Gaza by Israeli troops; believes that this response is disproportionate and is extremely concerned at the huge loss of life and the many thousands injured in the air attacks; condemns all acts of violence and aggression against civilians; believes that there should be an immediate ceasefire and withdrawal of Israeli troops as a first step in a process towards peace to bring about a lasting settlement for Palestinians and a secure Israel, and further believes that in the event of a ceasefire all crossings should be open to ensure the availability of humanitarian aid.
