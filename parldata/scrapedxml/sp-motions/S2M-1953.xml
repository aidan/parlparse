 *S2M-1953 Dr Sylvia Jackson: Motion on Enforcement of EU Directive 95/29/EC Amending Directive 91/628 on the Welfare of Live Animals During Transport—That the Parliament recognises that the full enforcement of EU directive 95/29/EC amending directive 91/628/EEC on the welfare of live animals during transport is essential for the protection of animal welfare; recognises that the UK Welfare of Animals (Transport) Order 1997 is generally observed and enforced; notes that, following the breakdown of talks on the issue of live animal transport in April, the Dutch Presidency of the European Commission intends to introduce a compromise proposal on transport, with an emphasis on enforcement, driver training and more flexibility for individual member states to set stricter regulations for domestic and sea transport; notes that certain member states fail to enforce the requirements of the current directive consistently, and calls on the Scottish Executive to express support for the Dutch Presidency’s proposal at the meeting of the European Commission Agriculture Council on 22 and 23 November 2004.
