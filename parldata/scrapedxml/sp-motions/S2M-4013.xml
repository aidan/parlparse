*S2M-4013 Frances Curran: Transfer of National Savings Jobs to Indiaâ€”That the Parliament believes that we are now witnessing the consequences of government privatisation of civil service departments; notes that in 1999 the UK Government privatised the National Savings Agency complex in Glasgow when 4,000 civil servants were transferred to Siemens Business Services; further notes that in 2004 the UK Government allowed Siemens to offshore 240 jobs and that now the company intends to offshore to India another 240 National Savings jobs which would mean that almost one-third of National Savings work will be carried out in India; believes that the company will not guarantee replacement work for displaced staff, and calls on UK Treasury Minister, Ivan Lewis MP, who will make the final decision on whether the jobs are transferred to India, to refuse to give his consent.
