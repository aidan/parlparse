*S2M-4895 John Swinburne: Flawed Statement on the Right to Buyâ€”That the Parliament deplores the fact that in the minsterial statement on the right to buy there was no mention of the right to retain after buying and that currently senior citizens feel that, in certain circumstances, their homes are being "stolen" from them by government to cover the cost of their residential care after being means-tested.
