*S2M-1591 Mary Scanlon: Financial Settlements for Islands Councils-That the Parliament notes with concern the Aggregate External Finance settlement for Orkney Islands Council whereby Orkney receives 20% per head less funding than either the Western Isles or Shetland Islands Councils; notes that all three Islands Councils face broadly similar difficulties and cost pressures in providing services; further notes that Orkney Islands Council has contributed Â£6 million pounds in the current year from the council's Relevant Services Contingency Fund, an oil industry-related fund, which will be needed to meet the very substantial costs of decommissioning the Flotta oil terminal and help stimulate economic development once the benefits of the oil industry are lost to the local economy, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take action to address this anomaly.
