 *S3M-7973 Hugh O’Donnell: USA Veto UN Resolution—That the Parliament deeply regrets the actions of the United States of America in using its veto to block a resolution of the United Nations (UN) condemning the ongoing building of illegal settlements by Israel in the West Bank and East Jerusalem; commends the 130 members of the UN who signed the resolution; believes that the actions of the USA are contrary to the rhetoric from the Obama administration in relation to events in Egypt and elsewhere, and that this exposes what it considers to be hypocrisy at the heart of the USA’s foreign policy.
