*S1M-314.2 Mr Alex Salmond: Social Justice Targets—As an amendment to motion (S1M-314.2) in the name of Ms Wendy Alexander, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "recognises the appalling poverty we have in Scotland and the need for immediate action to tackle this poverty; welcomes the publication by the Scottish Executive of Social Justice – a Scotland where everyone matters; believes however that the report lacks definition, range, focus and clear achievable targets, and agrees that the Executive should re-evaluate the report brought forward by the Evaluation Framework action team and bring forward revised targets and indicators to the Parliament."
