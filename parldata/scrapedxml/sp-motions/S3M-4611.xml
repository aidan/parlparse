 *S3M-4611 Bob Doris: Killie and Jags Rally Behind Diageo Workersâ€”That the Parliament applauds the support given to Diageo workers in Kilmarnock and Glasgow by both Kilmarnock and Partick Thistle football clubs; believes that this demonstrates the strong community links that the clubs have developed over the years; notes that Kilmarnock play Patrick Thistle in a pre-season friendly at Rugby Park on Wednesday 29 July 2009 and encourages people to attend this game to show their solidarity with the workers whose jobs are under threat; considers that the world-leading Johnnie Walker brand has been served loyally by workers at both sites for generations; believes that Diageo should recognise that the strength of the brand is owed largely to this hard work over many years, and calls on Diageo to support these communities by reconsidering its closure plans and by seriously considering alternative business proposals.
