*S2M-2184 Brian Adam: Failure to Mainstream Aberdeen’s Great Northern Partnership SIP Projects—That the Parliament recognises the admirable work carried out by the Great Northern Social Inclusion Partnership’s (SIP) community partners since its inception; commends the SIP projects which have delivered vital front-line services to some of Aberdeen’s socially-excluded communities over the years, and regrets that Aberdeen City Council feels unable to mainstream these projects.
