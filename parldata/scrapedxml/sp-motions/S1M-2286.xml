*S1M-2286 Tricia Marwick: Fife Rail Servicesâ€”That the Parliament recalls motion S1M-379 on rail services in Fife which it debated on 15 December 1999; is concerned that the rail services provided to the people of Fife and beyond are still appalling, that carriages continue to be overcrowded and that trains are still cancelled without notice; believes that the level of delays is still unacceptable and that at peak times insufficient carriages are being provided, and demands that ScotRail and Railtrack take immediate action and provide a service which is commensurate with the high levels of train fares extorted from the long-suffering passengers using these services.
