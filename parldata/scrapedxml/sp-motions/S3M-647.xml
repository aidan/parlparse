 *S3M-647 Hugh O’Donnell: Show Racism the Red Card Scotland, Fortnight of Action 16 to 30 October 2007—That the Parliament notes that Show Racism the Red Card’s (SRTRC) fourth annual Fortnight of Action takes place from 16 to 30 October 2007, involving concerted action that encourages participation from all sections of Scotland’s communities to celebrate diversity and tackle racism; is concerned that, despite a decrease in the number of racist incidents at football stadia since the SRTRC office opened in Scotland in 2003, racist and discriminatory incidents and excluding practices remain a problem in both professional and grassroots football; further notes alarming figures produced in March 2007 by the Scottish Executive that show an increase of 13% in racist incidents recorded by the police, from 4,536 in 2004-05 to 5,124 in 2005-06, in the wider community in Scotland, and commends SRTRC for providing this focal point for all those who are committed to challenging racism and discrimination in Scotland.
