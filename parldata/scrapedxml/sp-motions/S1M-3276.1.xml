 *S1M-3276.1 Tommy Sheridan: Gourock to Dunoon Ferry Service—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3276) in the name of George Lyon, leave out from "and satisfies" to end and insert "as part of publicly owned and operated ferry service for all the islands; further notes that this network should protect the wages, conditions and pensions of all the ferry employees and provide low-cost travel to the people of Scotland, and believes that any EU directives which appear to restrict Scotland’s ability to support the ferry network should be ignored."
