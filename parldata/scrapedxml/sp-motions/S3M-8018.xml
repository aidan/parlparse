*S3M-8018 Marilyn Livingstone: Congratulations to the Cottage Family Centre—That the Parliament notes the Care Commission inspection of the Cottage Family Centre crèche in Kirkcaldy in an unannounced visit on 30 November 2010; commends the centre staff for achieving a score of six, the highest score possible and which ranks services as excellent, for the quality of care and support offered at the Cottage Family Centre; understands that the crèche aims to provide a safe, secure and nurturing environment suitable and appropriate to meet the needs of children and families and that the Care Commission found that these aims were being met; notes that relationships between staff and the children and families were seen to be supportive and that this was confirmed by parents who expressed a high level of satisfaction with the quality of care that their children receive, and commends the contribution made by the Cottage Family Centre staff to the Templehall community, which was found to be one of the most deprived areas of Scotland in the most recent Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation report.
