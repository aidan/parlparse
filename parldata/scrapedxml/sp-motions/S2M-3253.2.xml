*S2M-3253.2 Mr David Davidson: Clyde and Hebrides Lifeline Ferry Services—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3253) in the name of Tavish Scott, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "believes that the proposed tendering of the entire Caledonian MacBrayne (CalMac) network as a single bundle will be a costly, disruptive and bureaucratic exercise which shall do nothing whatsoever to improve ferry services; further believes that there is scope for significant efficiency savings and improvements to the network and that tendering of any routes must be genuinely open to any operator who can ensure the best possible value for the taxpayer and ferry users; rejects the Scottish Executive’s implied assumption that no routes currently operated by CalMac could be run on a commercial basis, and, in light of this, calls on the Executive to issue proposals for smaller route bundles to attract commercial interest which could lead to efficiency savings and improvements to services."
