 * S2M-2949 Mr Mark Ruskell: The Big Ask for Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the “Big Ask” initiative by Friends of the Earth which calls for legislation to ensure that the UK Government is legally responsible for reducing greenhouse gas pollution that contributes to climate change; notes that the proposed legislation would require a 3% year-on-year reduction in climate change gas emissions which would meet an overall target of reducing emissions by 80% of 1990 levels by 2050; notes the Parliament’s Environment and Rural Development Committee inquiry report into climate change which concluded that “the current rate of progress in reducing emissions in Scotland is inadequate to meet both short and long-term targets” and “that very substantial action must begin now”; further notes the Committee’s conclusion that “A massive possibility for change exists at government, business and individual levels, given the right policy levers and leadership.”; recognises that the Scottish Executive has powers over climate change gas emissions in areas such as energy efficiency, including building regulations, renewable energy, transport, land use, including agriculture and forestry, and procurement, and therefore believes that similar legislation, setting targets for reducing climate change gas pollution, should be considered for Scotland.
