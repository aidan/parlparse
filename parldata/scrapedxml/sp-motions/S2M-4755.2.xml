*S2M-4755.2 Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Education First—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4755) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "believes that the Scottish Executive is failing too many valued members of school staff in that incidences of physical and verbal assault remain commonplace in Scottish classrooms to the extent that, according to the Educational Institute of Scotland, "Teachers continue to regard the matter of indiscipline and how to solve it as their number one priority"; believes that special schools should have an important and secure place in Scotland’s educational system and should not be under threat; believes that the Executive is failing parents by abolishing tried and tested school boards against the overwhelming weight of public opinion, and therefore calls on the Executive to reconsider its decision to abolish school boards, give stronger support to special schools and ensure that head teachers have the authority to permanently exclude persistently disruptive pupils".
