*S2M-414 Mr Adam Ingram: The Sun Newspaper and Frank Brunoâ€”That the Parliament condemns the ignorant and stigmatising headline by The Sun on Tuesday 23 September 2003, which reported on the ex-boxer Frank Bruno who was sectioned under the Mental Health Act 1983 in England; deplores the damage that this kind of extreme and ill-judged use of words can do both to those suffering from mental illness and to anti-stigma campaigns, and calls upon The Sun to extend its redress beyond the current appeal campaign to provide a platform for long running anti-stigma campaigns such as the "See Me" campaign.
