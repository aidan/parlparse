*S2M-3405 Mr Brian Monteith: The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Walesâ€”That the Parliament notes that, by Royal Charter of Queen Victoria on 11 May 1880, the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales was established as a corporate body; also notes the unbroken global convention from Nova Scotia to Scotland, Ireland, South Africa, Guyana, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Manitoba, Jamaica, Bermuda, Prince Edward Island, Sri Lanka, Zimbabwe, Nepal, Nigeria, the Caribbean, Australia and New Zealand that chartered institutes carry their country of origin in their names; further notes the intention of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales to amend its title to "The Institute of Chartered Accountants", creating market place confusion and asserting unjustified and inaccurate claims of pre-eminence, and calls on HM Privy Council not to approve the proposed name change.
