*S1M-151 Mr Murray Tosh: Transport—That the Parliament welcomes the increased profile that has been given to transport issues and the Scottish Executive’s commitment to continue reducing vehicle emission levels; recognises the importance of Scotland’s transport links by road, rail, sea and air to our markets in the rest of the UK, the European Union and beyond; expresses concern that the Scottish Executive does not attach sufficient importance to the strategic road network, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to: (a) increase the current level of spending on construction and maintenance of the trunk road network as part of the strategic roads review; (b) withdraw the proposals to levy new tolls and taxes on motorists and other road users; (c) initiate urgent talks with Her Majesty’s Government with a view to increasing the share of the UK budget devoted to transport to allow strategic road and rail investment to proceed so that Scotland’s needs are reflected in policies pursued at a UK level, and (d) urge Her Majesty’s Government to review the level of fuel taxes and vehicle excise duties.
