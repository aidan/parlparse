*S3M-7348 Jackie Baillie: Argyll and Bute School Closures—That the Parliament is disappointed to note that Argyll and Bute Council is proposing to close four primary schools in the Helensburgh and Lomond area as part of a wider programme of closing 26 schools across the authority over the next year; considers that the resulting amalgamations will cause young children to have long commutes to school, will threaten teaching quality and teaching jobs and will have a negative impact on rural communities; further notes that one of the schools threatened is a special educational needs school; believes that proper account has not been taken of the future demand for education due to the planned increase of capacity at HMNB Clyde; further believes that the financial savings that would be generated by the school closures are outweighed by the cost to children’s education and teacher employment and by the impact on these rural communities, and therefore urges Argyll and Bute Council to maintain all four schools, namely Luss Primary School, Kilcreggan Primary School, Rosneath Primary School and Parklands School.
