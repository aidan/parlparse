* S3M-6326♦ Maureen Watt: Barnardo’s Scotland’s New Directions Service—That the Parliament congratulates Barnardo’s Scotland’s New Directions Service in Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire on reaching its 10th anniversary; recognises the success of the programme in working with young people between the ages of 12 and 18 involved in persistent and serious offending behaviour to divert them away from care or custody; applauds the 70% of the young people who have completed the programme and reduced their offending behaviour, and further considers that the success of the programme is due to the close collaboration with its partners, Aberdeen City Council, Aberdeenshire Council, Grampian Police and youth justice strategy groups.
