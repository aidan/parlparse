*S2M-3505 Richard Lochhead: Save the Raeden Centre—That the Parliament notes the current uncertainty surrounding the future of the Raeden Centre in Aberdeen, which caters for pre-school children with special needs; further notes that the centre could be broken up into separate units under the recommendations of the Foster and Spalding report on the provision of pre-school services in Aberdeen, commissioned by NHS Grampian and Aberdeen City Council; believes that, while diagnosis, assessment, treatment, education and support are more important than bricks and mortar, the centre has developed something truly special which would not be easily replicated if it was broken up; notes the Save The Raeden campaign which is being run by the Evening Express and which has attracted huge support from the people of the north east; further believes that any moves to break up the centre into separate units would be nothing short of an act of vandalism, and considers that any replacement option should consist of a new stand-alone unit to prevent the fantastic efforts of the staff and the ethos of the centre from being irreparably damaged and potentially lost. Supported by: Frances Curran*, Rob Gibson*, Eleanor Scott*, Shiona Baird*
