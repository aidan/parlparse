*S1M-2972# Shona Robison: SPL-TV and the Financial Future of Football Clubsâ€”That the Parliament regrets the uncertain financial future facing the 10 non-Old Firm Scottish Premier League Clubs following the decision by Rangers and Celtic to effectively veto plans for SPL-TV; notes that the 10 clubs whose revenue risks being adversely impacted in a very significant way employ in the region of 1000 full-time staff, thousands more on a casual or part-time basis and contribute significantly to their surrounding local economies, and considers that the Scottish Executive should intervene so that the clubs can look forward to a degree of financial stability and the public can enjoy watching their teams on television.
