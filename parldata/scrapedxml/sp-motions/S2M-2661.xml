 * S2M-2661 Rosie Kane: M74 Undemocratic Environmental Injustice—That the Parliament condemns utterly the decision of the Scottish Executive to proceed with the M74 project; acknowledges that the Public Inquiry Reporter recommended that the project should not proceed; notes with deep outrage that the Executive has chosen to ignore the reporter’s recommendations; further notes that this comes after the Executive had ignored the wishes of the local communities who will be affected by this project; notes that the First Minister prejudiced the inquiry by announcing that the project would go ahead before the inquiry had been completed; recognises and condemns utterly the fact that this is another example of environmental injustice undemocratically foisted on the people of Scotland by the Executive, and calls on the Executive to uphold basic democratic principles and stop the M74 project immediately.
