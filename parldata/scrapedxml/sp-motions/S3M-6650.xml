*S3M-6650 Kenneth Gibson: The Family Fund, A Lifeline to Families with Disabled Children—That the Parliament commends the work of the Family Fund, a lifeline to families with disabled children across the United Kingdom; notes that, in Scotland last year, the Family Fund helped 4,556 families with grants worth £2.81 million for things to make life easier and more enjoyable; further notes that, in the UK as a whole, the Family Fund helped 55,000 families with £33 million in grants; recognises that this represents 23,000 much-needed holidays, 7,000 computers, 2,200 cookers and hundreds of driving lessons, giving families freedom and flexibility; applauds the Family Fund’s efficiency, as 91p in every pound received was distributed in grants; encourages the UK Government to continue funding the Family Fund’s operations, and looks forward to the fund continuing to make a difference and be a voice to all families caring for a disabled child. Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Anne McLaughlin*, Stuart McMillan*, Aileen Campbell*, Sandra White*, Bill Kidd*, Christina McKelvie*, Brian Adam*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Trish Godman*
