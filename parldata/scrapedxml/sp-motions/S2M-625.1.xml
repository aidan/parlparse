 *S2M-625.1 Murdo Fraser: Poverty in Scotland-As an amendment to motion (S2M-625) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from first "recognises" to end and insert "notes that socialism has caused more poverty and human misery than any other political ideology in modern history; further notes that socialist policies, where implemented, have singularly failed to remedy the lack of economic growth that is the root cause of poverty; believes that the best way to tackle poverty is to create a strong, dynamic, free enterprise economy with opportunity for all, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to reduce business rates and ease the burden of water charges on Scottish business thereby taking the first steps towards improving the Scottish economy."
