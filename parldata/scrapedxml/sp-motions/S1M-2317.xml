*S1M-2317# Richard Lochhead: Funding for Grampian Policeâ€”That the Parliament recognises the concern held throughout the north east of Scotland in respect of the funding formula for police services that leaves Grampian Police with considerably less than its fair share of the national allocation; believes that the Scottish Executive should make public any comparative studies carried out in relation to police resources, and further believes that appropriate steps should be taken to increase the level of resources available to the force in light of the high crime rate, escalating drug misuse and additional responsibilities that have an impact on policing in the region.
