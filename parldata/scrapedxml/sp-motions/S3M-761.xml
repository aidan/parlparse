*S3M-761 Kenneth Gibson: Police—That the Parliament notes that the Association of Chief Police Officers Scotland (ACPOS) has projected that 470 officers will retire during 2007-8; believes that it is important to develop a national strategy to attract experienced police officers from non-Scottish police forces to Scotland, and recognises that this is an ideal way to both increase overall police numbers and help bridge the forthcoming shortfall in experience due to the large number of officers who will retire over the coming years.
