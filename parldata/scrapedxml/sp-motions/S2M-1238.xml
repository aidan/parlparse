*S2M-1238# Mark Ballard: STUC and Advertising in Schools-That the Parliament notes the motion passed at the Scottish Trades Union Congress in April 2004, "That this Congress calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce legislation to ban all advertising and branding aimed at school students both within primary and secondary schools"; believes that the teaching and learning environment should be free from corporate advertising and devoted to educational materials, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should prohibit the promotion of brand names and commercial companies through sponsorship and advertising in Scotland's schools.
