*S3M-5384 Bill Wilson: EU Tax on Mobility Scooters is Tax on Disability—That the Parliament notes that in 2007 49% of Scottish disabled people were workless, that the risk of poverty in a household was far higher if the household contained a disabled adult and that, according to the Department for Work and Pensions report, Family Resources Survey, United Kingdom, 2007-08, 24% of individuals in disabled households were in poverty compared with only 14% of individuals in non-disabled households; further notes that the reclassification of mobility scooters by the European Commission means that they are now subject to a 10% import tax and that this could in many cases be passed on to the consumer; therefore believes that this reclassification amounts to a tax on disabled people, and joins the charity, Elizabeth Finn Care, in calling on the UK Government to press the commission to reverse this decision or introduce measures in the UK that will ensure that the hardship of some of the most financially vulnerable people in society is not increased.
