*S3M-6229 Nigel Don: Men’s Advice Line—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Scottish Government-funded Men’s Advice Line, which is Scotland’s first specialised helpline providing support and advice for male victims of domestic abuse; notes that 7,000 men in Scotland reported being abused by a partner last year, with 14% of all cases of domestic abuse reported to the police involving a male victim reporting abuse from a female partner; further notes that trained helpline advisors will provide advice and emotional support to men who are suffering abuse by their partners and will offer information about specialist services that can offer support on legal, housing, child contact and mental health issues; believes that domestic abuse is unacceptable and something that both men and women can be victims of, and urges all those experiencing abuse or worried about male friends or family to call the helpline on 0808 801 0327 for advice.
