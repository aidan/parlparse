*S3M-7625 Patrick Harvie: Postal Services Bill—That the Parliament offers its strong support to the Communication Workers Union in its protest against the UK Government’s planned Postal Services Bill, which would privatise approximately 90% of Royal Mail; agrees with the Communication Workers Union that this legislation would mean the end of a trusted and vital public institution, that there would be unacceptable price increases and that it would lead to the closure of yet more essential community post offices, and calls on the UK Government to learn what are seen as the lessons of failed privatisation drives of the past, such as the UK rail network, and to properly prioritise and fully fund Royal Mail and the Post Office as a national public service of the first order.
