 *S1M-2364 John Farquhar Munro: Cast Ewe Compensation Scheme—That the Parliament condemns the decision by the EU Standing Veterinary Committee to refuse to allow Scottish lamb to be exported to EU markets; notes that the cull lamb scheme established by the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department in the wake of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak has been substantially undersubscribed, and therefore strongly urges the Scottish Executive to consider allocating the surplus funding from the scheme to a disposal scheme for cast ewes and to address the animal welfare problems and environmental damage that the onset of winter is bringing.
