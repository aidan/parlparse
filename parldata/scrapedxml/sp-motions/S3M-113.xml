*S3M-113 Margo MacDonald: Adherence to Resolutions for the Parliament—That the Parliament, further to motion S1M-1745 in the name of Dennis Canavan which stated that the Parliament "is the national representative body of the Scottish people, with responsibility to make decisions on behalf of the people on devolved matters, and therefore, in keeping with Scotland’s democratic tradition, demands that the Scottish Executive implement all such decisions of the Parliament", notes that this motion was supported by Members across the Chamber, including those who have subsequently taken up ministerial posts in the Executive; re-affirms this position, and asks that all Members continue to have regard to it.
