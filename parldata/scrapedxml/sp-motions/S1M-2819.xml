 *S1M-2819# Karen Whitefield: North Lanarkshire Council - COSLA Award-That the Parliament recognises the devastating effect that anti-social behaviour can have on communities across Scotland; congratulates North Lanarkshire Council on winning the COSLA award for top performing authority in customer focus for its work in establishing an anti-social behaviour taskforce which has dealt with over 300 cases since its inception in January 2001, and believes that this example of good practice should be extended throughout Scotland.
