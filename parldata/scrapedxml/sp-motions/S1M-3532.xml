*S1M-3532 Fiona Hyslop: Friction Dynamex—That the Parliament notes with concern the case of Friction Dynamex in Caernarfon where 87 workers taking part in lawful industrial action became the first workers to be dismissed after eight weeks of industrial action under provisions introduced by Schedule 5 of the Employment Relations Act 1999; further notes that such provisions run counter to the intent of articles 5 and 6 of the European Social Charter and of article 11 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and therefore calls on Her Majesty’s Government to amend the Employment Relations Act 1999 to remove the eight week limit on protection for striking workers.Supported by: Linda Fabiani*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Christine Grahame*, Michael Matheson*, Michael Russell*, Kay Ullrich*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Ms Sandra White*, Brian Adam*
