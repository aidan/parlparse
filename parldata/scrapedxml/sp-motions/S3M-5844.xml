*S3M-5844 Joe FitzPatrick: COSLA Warning over Westminster Cuts—That the Parliament endorses the warning from COSLA President Pat Watters to all parties at the general election that a cut in funding by the UK Government to Scotland and Scotland’s local authorities following this year’s election would be catastrophic for services in Scotland; acknowledges the letter from Pat Watters to all parties and the letters from the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth and the First Minister to Labour, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats in Westminster, and urges all parties to ensure that any changes in the UK budget following the election do not effect budgets already set by the Scottish Government and Scotland’s local authorities.
