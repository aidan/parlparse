 * S2M-2946 Chris Ballance:Airline Tax for Africa Aid—That the Parliament condemns the rejection by the Liberal Democrat and SNP MPs of the French and German initiatives to raise money for Africa through introducing an international tax on aviation fuel; notes that the aviation industry enjoys tax breaks which give it unfair economic advantage over more sustainable forms of transport, equivalent to a subsidy of over £9 billion per year in the United Kingdom alone; agrees that the problems of Africa also require political solution; notes, however, the hypocrisy and inconsistency of these MPs in calling for climate change action and aid for Africa whilst objecting to this very worthwhile proposal, and further notes that, where vital air links such as those to some Scottish islands are identified, these could easily continue to receive subsidies to ensure that remote communities are not disproportionately affected by this necessary and urgently required tax.
