 *S3M-1985 Dr Richard Simpson: Foundation Year One Doctors—That the Parliament notes the repeal of sections sections 10 to 13 of the Medical Act 1983 which removes the statutory requirement for foundation year one doctors to be contractually resident in hospital unless they live close by; recognises that, as a consequence, those newly qualified doctors can now be faced with substantial charges for accommodation that was previously free; further recognises the particular needs of doctors rotating through different hospitals and those whose shift and travel requirements may make travel at the end of a shift unsafe, and calls on the Scottish Government to enter into discussions with the British Medical Association in Scotland to resolve this issue.
