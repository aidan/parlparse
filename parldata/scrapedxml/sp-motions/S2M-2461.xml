*S2M-2461 Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Top Marks for East Renfrewshire—That the Parliament congratulates East Renfrewshire Council and its Education Department on the outstanding report it has received from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Education; notes that in every single category of inspection the authority was given the highest rating of "very good"; recognises that this assessment and praise is a reflection of the level of service the department provides to schools and their staff and to pupils and their parents in East Renfrewshire; acknowledges the success the authority has had, measured not only in the achievements of its pupils, but in its support for inclusion and the ethos it has developed in its schools, and highlights the need for the Scottish Executive to continue to provide support to the local authority so that it can build on this success to help all young people in East Renfrewshire develop to their full potential.
