 *S3M-7599 Alasdair Allan: Western Isles School Leavers’ Success—That the Parliament considers that Scottish Government statistics show that school leavers in the Western Isles are more successful at finding a place in further or higher education, a job or training than those in the rest of Scotland, with 94.3% of pupils in the Western Isles leaving school between August 2009 and June 2010 going into these areas; notes that this figure is 7.5% higher than the Scottish average, and believes that this proves the benefits of the particular system of education in the Western Isles and counters the negative perceptions of after-school destinations in the Outer Hebrides.
