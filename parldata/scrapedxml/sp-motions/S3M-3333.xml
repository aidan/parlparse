 *S3M-3333♦ Margaret Mitchell: Congratulating Project Linus UK—That the Parliament recognises that Project Linus is a 100% volunteer non-profit organisation that aims to provide a sense of security and comfort to children who are seriously ill, traumatised or otherwise in need through gifts of new, homemade, washable blankets and quilts created by volunteer blanket makers; congratulates Project Linus on producing 75,000 quilts and blankets in the United Kingdom since April 2000 and specifically commends the Lanarkshire branch, which delivered 748 quilts and blankets in 2008 and has delivered a total of 2,508 since the creation of the group in 2004, and considers involvement with the organisation either by making quilts or donating materials and supplies to be extremely worthwhile and worthy of encouragement.
