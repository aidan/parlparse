*S2M-5686♦ Ms Sandra White: Executive to Deliver on Hospital Car Parking Charges Pledge?—That the Parliament, while welcoming the comments regarding hospital car park charges made by the First Minister at his latest "Ask Jack" event in Glasgow where he recognised the problem and stated that "If the health boards don’t sort it out, we will intervene", holds serious reservations as to whether this statement is a firm pledge of action rather than of electioneering; believes that the Scottish Executive has had ample time to address this situation which is of great concern to users and staff alike in hospitals such as at Yorkhill in Glasgow as, when questioned in September 2006 as to whether or not the Executive would consider legislating on this issue rather than simply issuing non-enforceable guidelines or, at the very least, admit that a problem existed, the Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care offered a rather curt "No", and further believes that the Executive should allay the fears of many NHS users and staff that the First Minister’s comments are little more than electioneering by informing the Parliament what measures it intends taking and when.
