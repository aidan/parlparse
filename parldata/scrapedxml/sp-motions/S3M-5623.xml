*S3M-5623 Cathy Jamieson: Girvan Swimming Poolâ€”That the Parliament regrets the decision taken by South Ayrshire Council that will see Girvan Swimming Pool demolished rather than handed over to the community in the form of Girvan Community Swimming Pool Ltd to enable that company to raise the necessary capital funding to refurbish and reopen the pool; notes that a motion to the council proposing the transfer of the pool, as well as requesting ongoing revenue funding, was moved by South Carrick Labour Councillor John McDowall and received support from South Carrick SNP and Conservative councillors as well as from the Labour group; believes that the decision to reject this motion, with no immediate plans for a replacement pool or leisure facilities, flies in the face of policies encouraging active, healthy lifestyles and the wishes of the vast majority of local people; regrets also that Girvan did not receive any award from the Town Centre Regeneration Fund, and urges the Scottish Government to enter into discussions with South Ayrshire Council regarding the regeneration of Girvan and the future provision of swimming and leisure facilities in the town.
