 *S3M-2717 Joe FitzPatrick: Dystonia Society’s Silver Jubilee—That the Parliament congratulates the Dystonia Society for its efforts over the past 25 years in raising awareness about this little-known but severely debilitating neurological disorder, which can cause involuntary, sustained and painful muscle spasms in various parts of the body; further congratulates the society on its sustained fundraising efforts, which have culminated in two specialist physiotherapists being based in Scotland working with those suffering from cervical dystonia; is concerned that, according to the Dystonia Society, there are at least 38,000 sufferers in the United Kingdom who sometimes have to wait years for a correct diagnosis due to a lack of awareness on the part of general practitioners (GPs), and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that adequate information is given to GPs so that a correct and timeous diagnosis can be made and to provide resources for research into the causes of dystonia.
