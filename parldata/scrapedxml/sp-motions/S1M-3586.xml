*S1M-3586 Mr Adam Ingram: Heartstart-That the Parliament welcomes Heartstart, the British Heart Foundation's Scottish schools initiative, which aims to develop emergency life support training programmes in our schools; congratulates those schools throughout Scotland that have already signed up to this programme and have benefited from teacher training free of charge and generous grants for training equipment, and urges local authorities to ensure that those schools that have not yet affiliated are encouraged to do so, in order to provide young people with invaluable lifesaving skills.
