 *S3M-3303 Pauline McNeill: BBC Refusal to Broadcast the Emergency Appeal for Gaza—That the Parliament condemns the decision by the BBC not to broadcast the Disasters Emergency Committee appeal for Gaza and the fact that this decision may have influenced the decision of other broadcasters; notes the statement by Douglas Alexander MP, the Secretary of State for International Development, in which he expresses his disappointment that the appeal will not be broadcast; believes that this decision will severely affect the ability of the aid agencies to respond to the extreme needs of the people in Gaza and will add to their immense suffering, and further believes that the BBC should reverse this decision immediately.
