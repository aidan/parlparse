*S2M-4483 Mark Ballard: Animal Testing of Drugs—That the Parliament, in common with Europeans for Medical Progress, expresses its concerns regarding the safeguarding of public health through data obtained from laboratory animals, particularly in light of large numbers of serious and fatal adverse drug reactions that were not predicted by animal studies; is concerned that the government has not commissioned or evaluated any formal research on the efficacy of animal experiments and has no plans to do so, and, in common with over 80% of general practitioners in a recent survey, calls on the government to facilitate an independent and transparent scientific evaluation of the use of animals as surrogate humans in drug safety testing and medical research. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
