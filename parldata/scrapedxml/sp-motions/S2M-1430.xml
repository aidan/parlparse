 *S2M-1430 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Support Scottish Cycling-That the Parliament observes that British Cycling has reinstated the Tour of Britain road stage race, after a five-year hiatus, from 1 to 5 September 2004; notes that 16 teams of the world's elite cyclists are taking part; further notes that this event has the support of the BBC with all the coverage that this entails both within the United Kingdom and throughout the world; sees great advantages for tourism for all areas included in this road race and notes that Richard Caborn, UK Minister of State for Sport and Tourism, said that this event can promote tourism in "the whole country"; notes however that this "Tour of Britain" involves the north-west of England, Yorkshire, the East Midlands and South Wales, finishing on the streets of Westminster, but does not include Scotland, and urges British Cycling to apologise for the omission of Scotland from this event and to ensure that as long as Scotland is still a member of the United Kingdom it is fully represented in any future Tour of Britain events.
