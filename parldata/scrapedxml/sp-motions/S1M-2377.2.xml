*S1M-2377.2 Linda Fabiani: Asylum Seekers and Refugee Integration—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2377) in the name of Jackie Baillie, leave out from "and further welcomes" to end and insert "; congratulates the host communities and Scotland’s civic society on the steps taken so far to enable integration; welcomes the appointment of a Scottish Minister with responsibilities in this area; notes that the statement by the Home Secretary in the Westminster Parliament on 29 October 2001 indicates a move by Her Majesty's Government contrary to the current direction of the Scottish Executive, particularly in the establishment of "accommodation centres" as opposed to sensitive dispersal and the imposition of "Smart Cards" as a form of electronic voucher for asylum seekers, and calls for the Scottish Parliament and the Scottish Executive to welcome asylum seekers and refugees into our communities and to have the power to provide appropriate services to promote true integration."
