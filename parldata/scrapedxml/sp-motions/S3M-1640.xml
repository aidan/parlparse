*S3M-1640 Sandra White: Scotstoun Primary Eco School—That the Parliament congratulates the work done by the pupils and staff of Scotstoun Primary School, Glasgow, in gaining their Eco Schools Bronze award, which has seen the establishment of an eco committee known as "The Eco Kidz" made up of pupils from primaries one to seven, parents, school staff and members of the local community who meet regularly to decide future action plans aimed at promoting a greater awareness of sustainability and ecology; notes that the current action plan is focused around the issue of recycling and has seen the school introduce a number of measures to encourage recycling, such as fruit bins in every class and composting in the garden, paper bins in every class and rag bag collections where parents and residents are asked to bring in unwanted clothes which are then reused or recycled; further notes the hugely successful Christmas tree recycling scheme initiated by the pupils in response to seeing many trees discarded in their local community; believes that the care and commitment shown by all those involved at Scotstoun Primary is invaluable in tackling and raising awareness of the many environmental challenges we face, and wishes the pupils continuing success as they work towards the Eco Schools Silver award. Supported by: Kenneth Gibson*, Robert Brown*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Stuart McMillan*, Patrick Harvie*, Bill Kidd*, Nanette Milne*, Bashir Ahmad*, Alasdair Allan*, Robin Harper*, Christina McKelvie*, Elaine Smith*, Christine Grahame*, Gil Paterson*
