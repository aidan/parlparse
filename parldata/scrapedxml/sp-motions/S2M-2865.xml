 * S2M-2865 Frances Curran:Scottish Power’s Obscene Profits—That the Parliament notes Scottish Power’s reporting of pre-tax profits of over £1 billion; notes that 134,000 single pensioners, 39% of the total, and 83,000 Scottish pensioner couples, 26% of the total, live in fuel poverty, meaning that they must spend 10% or more of their income to heat their homes adequately; notes that, between 1997 and 2002, Scotland registered 16,600 more deaths of over-65s between December and March than in the rest of the year; further notes that premature deaths are highest among pensioners in Glasgow with one in 36 of those aged over 65 dying during the winter months, and believes therefore that, in order to end the obscenity of a private company getting fat on the backs of pensioners living in poverty, Scottish Power should be taken back into public ownership and Scotland’s pensioners should receive gas and electricity free of charge.
