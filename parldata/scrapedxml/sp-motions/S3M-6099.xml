*S3M-6099 Elaine Smith: Remembering John Wheatley MP 80 Years Onâ€”That the Parliament pays tribute to John Wheatley MP on the 80th anniversary of his death on 12 May 2010; notes that he emigrated with his family from County Waterford in Ireland to spend his formative years in Bargeddie, near Coatbridge; acknowledges the pioneering work that he undertook in attempting to alleviate poverty and social deprivation through his 1924 Housing Act, which contained a visionary 15-year plan based on rising central government subsidies to local government; recognises with concern, however, that, although Wheatley fully understood the link between housing and health, many of the inequalities that he endeavoured to abolish still exist today; believes that the fact that large discrepancies in life expectancy in modern day Scotland between the most affluent areas and those that suffer from inadequate housing and ill health is a national tragedy; also believes that there should be an end to slum housing conditions, the introduction of rent controls and a massive building programme of new, modern, affordable council and social rented housing, and hopes that future housing legislation will be based on the premise that a house is a fundamental human right, not simply a commodity, and thus enshrine a right to rent.
