 *S2M-5509 Patrick Harvie: Microsoft Government Leaders’ Forum—That the Parliament notes the Microsoft Government Leaders’ Forum, taking place in the Parliament with the purpose of discussing the impact of ICT on governments, parliaments and citizens; considers that ICT has the potential to play a liberating role in developing a sustainable and just society; regrets that this event is taking place under the banner of Microsoft, whose products and business practices it considers undermine that liberating role; further regrets the widespread public sector reliance on closed-source and proprietary systems, which can threaten democratic accountability; welcomes the fact that the "KDE aKademy 2007" will be held in Scotland, bringing free software developers together to discuss their work; considers that the free software movement offers a more co-operative and democratic philosophy for the role of ICT and its impact on society, as well as bringing high-quality products to the consumer, and considers that government should endorse the principles of the free software movement and that the Scottish Executive and public sector should begin using non-proprietary document formats and free and open source software wherever possible.
