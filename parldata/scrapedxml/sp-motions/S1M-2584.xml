*S1M-2584 Tommy Sheridan: Scottish Power Industrial Dispute-That the Parliament supports the strike action of Scottish Power workers in pursuit of their agreement of 31 May 2000 with Scottish Power management which stated that no job losses and no fundamental changes to conditions would result from the trade unions' agreement to work in partnership alongside the company; regrets that Scottish Power management is now reneging on this agreement and is intent on fundamentally changing working conditions, which includes transferring staff against their will to a new joint venture company; notes that this has resulted in a democratic ballot of union members within Scottish Power; further notes union members' decision to take part in a series of two-day strike actions, and therefore calls on the management of Scottish Power to end its confrontational stance and honour the agreement it signed in good faith with the unions in order to avoid any further inconvenience to Scottish citizens, particularly in relation to power cuts and consequential safety issues.
