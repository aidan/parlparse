 * S2M-2909# Phil Gallie: Congratulations on Wise European Decisions—That the Parliament congratulates the citizens of France and Holland on expressing their views on the European Constitution so clearly; believes that, in doing so, they have demonstrated that the move towards European federalism has been a dream of politicians out of touch with the wishes of those they represent; notes that the support that has been signified through ratification of the constitution has come, with the exception of Spain, from governments which did not have the courage to give their citizens a voice on the matter, and considers that, should the forthcoming Council of Ministers not accept that the constitution is now dead, the UK Government should either make an unequivocal commitment not to ratify or alternatively put the issue to the British people in an immediate referendum. Supported by: Mr David Davidson*, Murdo Fraser*, Miss Annabel Goldie*, Alex Johnstone*, John Scott*, Alex Fergusson*, Murray Tosh*, David McLetchie*, Mr Ted Brocklebank*, Mrs Nanette Milne*, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton*, Mary Scanlon*, Margaret Mitchell*, Bill Aitken*, Mr Brian Monteith*
