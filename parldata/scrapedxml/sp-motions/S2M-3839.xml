*S2M-3839 Mr Andrew Welsh: Community and Village Halls—That the Parliament notes with concern the increased costs of water charges paid by new village and community halls and that these will also be imposed on older halls after 2010; recognises that these halls play a vital role as the hub of the community by providing a venue for educational classes, Scottish dancing, recreation, Scottish Women’s Rural Institute meetings, keep-fit classes, youth clubs, scouts, brownies and other activities; believes that these charges to charitable organisations are an undue burden on local rural communities in Angus; notes that the Scottish Executive has partly funded numerous new halls and refurbishments for many more which has caused an increase in the rateable value burden, and calls on the Executive to extend the exemption scheme to all community and village halls with charitable status and to introduce legislation to reinstate the exemption for community and village halls which have charitable status.
