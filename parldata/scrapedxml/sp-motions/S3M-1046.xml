*S3M-1046 Nigel Don: Police Pay Settlement—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Government on its commitment to implement the Police Arbitration Tribunal’s pay recommendations and to backdate the pay award in full; believes that the recommendations made by the tribunal are fair and affordable and that full implementation is crucial to maintain police morale; notes the vital role that police officers play in protecting our communities and tackling crime and the fear of crime, and urges the UK Government to follow the example shown in Scotland and review its decision to short-change England’s police officers.
