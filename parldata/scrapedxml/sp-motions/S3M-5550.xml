*S3M-5550 Sandra White: Haiti Earthquake Disaster—That the Parliament expresses its profound sadness for the victims of the Haitian earthquake, which has seen over 200,000 feared dead while over a million people have been left homeless and in desperate need of basic humanitarian aid; commends the spirit of compassion and generosity that has been shown by the Scottish people in their response to the disaster, and hopes that, through the immense efforts being made by people worldwide, immediate relief can be delivered to the people of Haiti and that lasting reconstruction can begin.
