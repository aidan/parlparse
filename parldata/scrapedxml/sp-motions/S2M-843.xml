*S2M-843 Christine Grahame: Dead Tired-That the Parliament notes the findings in the report endorsed by the British Sleep Society Dead Tired, in particular that the International Classification of Sleep Disorders lists some 84 sleep disorders placed in various categories including dysomnias (initiating and maintaining sleep), parasomnias (nightmares, sleep-walking, sleep-talking) and extrinsic sleep disorders such as alcohol-dependent sleep, that some 70,000 Scots are estimated to have some form of sleep disorder though the actual figure may be much higher, that sleepiness is estimated to be the cause of some 20% of motorway accidents, that sleep disorders have a direct impact on the workplace and employment prospects, that the direct costs to the NHS have never been properly assessed and that the impact on the individual and his or her family can be family break-up; notes that healthcare provision for sleep disorders in the NHS is, to say the least, inadequate; notes that there has been little or no training for professionals and little or no research into sleep disorders, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should issue, as a first step, guidance for professionals and the general public on sleep disorders and initiate research into the (a) scale of the problem, (b) cost to the public purse and (c) current provision in the public, private and voluntary sectors, of people with sleep disorders.
