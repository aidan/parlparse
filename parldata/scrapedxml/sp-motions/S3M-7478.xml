 *S3M-7478 Jackie Baillie: Christians Against Poverty—That the Parliament recognises the work of the free debt-counselling charity, Christians Against Poverty (CAP), in Scotland; considers that personal debt is a serious contributing factor to poverty in the United Kingdom; notes the recent research finding that a third of CAP’s clients struggled to feed their families before seeking help; further considers that CAP’s free, in-depth, face-to-face, holistic service complements the work of other debt advice agencies, such as Citizens Advice Scotland; believes that it provides workable solutions that are especially tailored to help the poorest people in society work their way out of unmanageable debt; commends the volunteers who work through their church to provide this free service to their local communities, and welcomes CAP’s expansion across Scotland.
