*S3M-2816 Jamie Hepburn: Free Public Tours of Parliament—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body on its decision to bring the contract for guided tours in-house and, consequently reintroduce free tours of the Parliament building for the general public; believes that this not only brings public tours into line with the range of free educational tours available in the Parliament, but also with many other parliament buildings across Europe that similarly offer free guided tours; further believes that this can only enhance public awareness and understanding of the Parliament and the Parliament’s status as a major attraction in Edinburgh, and encourages all users of the building to continue to extend a warm welcome to the many visitors who pass through each day.
