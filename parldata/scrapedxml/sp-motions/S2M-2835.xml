 * S2M-2835 Rosie Kane: EU Mercury Ban—That the Parliament condemns the attempts of the Westminster Government to seek a delay in the fixing of a date for the EU mercury export ban; recognises that over 12,000 tonnes of mercury from EU mercury cell chlor-alkali plants are expected to be dumped on developing countries over the next 10 to 15 years; acknowledges that mercury can travel long distances through the atmosphere, contaminating both local and global food supplies at levels posing a significant risk to human health; accepts that between 2001 and 2003 the United Kingdom, with Spain, exported over 470 tonnes of mercury to India; acknowledges that between three and 15 million Europeans are near to the international limit for mercury exposure and many are already exposed to unacceptable levels of methylmercury in the Arctic and Mediterranean fishing communities, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to put pressure on the UK Government to pledge full British support for an immediate ban on the export of mercury and to further pledge to give financial assistance to developing countries that have borne the brunt of this environmental injustice.
