*S3M-3836 Murdo Fraser: Mercy Ships—That the Parliament commends the important work carried out by Mercy Ships, an international charity that provides free medical and humanitarian services to the people of Africa using its hospital ship, the Africa Mercy, and a number of land-based projects; notes that the charity operates the world’s largest non-governmental hospital ship, staffed with volunteer doctors, nurses, engineers and agriculturists, which visits ports in some of the world’s poorest countries; understands that Easter 2009 marks the first Mercy Ships Easter Breakfast Campaign, which is a month-long initiative to raise awareness of the life-saving work carried out by the Mercy Ships volunteers and to raise vital funds needed to enable the charity to continue its work; recognises that the work of Mercy Ships is only possible through donations and dedicated volunteers from around the world, and commends Mercy Ships for bringing hope and healing to thousands of people in some of the world’s poorest regions.
