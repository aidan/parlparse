 * S3M-5855 Cathy Jamieson: Girvan Youth Trust Z1 Youth Barâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Girvan Youth Trust on the success of its showcase event to mark the formal opening of the Z1 youth bar; thanks everyone who has been involved in bringing this project to fruition after many years of tireless fundraising and hard work; considers that project manager Bill Logan and many local adults and young people have made a huge contribution over the years; recognises the contribution of John McClelland, who has volunteered weekly with the project since 1993 as a supporter of both the Oasis project and Girvan Youth Trust; further considers that, at 71, young Mr McClelland was a worthy and popular choice to perform the ribbon-cutting ceremony at the formal opening of Z1, and wishes him and Girvan Youth Trust every success in future.
