 *S3M-6818Lewis Macdonald:Forensic Service Modernisation Options Paperâ€”That the Parliament notes the withdrawal by the Scottish Police Services Authority (SPSA) of proposals for the closure of the forensic laboratory in Aberdeen in response to a campaign against those proposals by a range of stakeholders including staff, unions, customers and the general public; notes the recent publication by the SPSA of the Forensic Service Modernisation Options Paper, and welcomes the inclusion of two options which do not require the closure or severe downgrading of laboratories in Aberdeen or Edinburgh; regrets that Joe Fitzpatrick MSP asked colleagues to support an option which would lead to closure of both Aberdeen and Edinburgh forensic laboratories; believes that ministers should explain their view of this call to Parliament, and to the forensic staff whose jobs have been threatened, and hopes that Mr Fitzpatrick will see fit to retract the call for the closures he has made.
