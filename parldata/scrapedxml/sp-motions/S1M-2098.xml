*S1M-2098# Christine Grahame: Borders' Children with Special Education Needs—That the Parliament notes with concern that despite parental opposition Scottish Borders Council at its meeting on 1 August 2001 authorised, by a majority vote, further cuts of £1,579,255 to its education budget; notes that £200,000 was previously cut from the budget for the provision of special education auxiliaries; is concerned that part of these further cuts will impact on the provision of transport for children with special needs and that the intention to vire £525,000 from the Excellence Fund budget to the National Grid for Learning budget will impact directly on special education needs provision by raiding the budget for classroom assistants, early intervention and learning support; believes that this matter is causing undue distress and uncertainty to parents of children with special educational needs; further notes the recommendations in the 3rd Report 2001 by the Education, Culture and Sport Committee, Report on Inquiry into Special Educational Needs, in particular, recommendation 1 on "Maximising the participation of all children in mainstream schools", and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure that the provision of education for Borders children with special needs is not sacrificed to rescue the Borders administration from financial mismanagement and, if necessary, to provide additional, ring-fenced funding on appropriate terms in order to secure a fair and inclusive education for these vulnerable children.
