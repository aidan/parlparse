*S3M-2675 Alasdair Allan: West Harris Estates Buyout—That the Parliament welcomes the news that on Friday 3 October 2008 the people of the west side of Harris voted to progress towards a community buyout of their estate; notes that tenants of the West Harris estates in the townships of Luskentyre, Scarasta Mhor and Borve, which includes the villages of Seilibost and Horgabost, voted to proceed with the buyout of these estates, which would be the first community buyout of a government-owned estate in the history of land reform legislation, with 77% in favour of a buyout and all three estates voting yes on a turnout of 95%; hopes that this is the first step towards a better future for people in the west of Harris; believes that, like other examples throughout the Highlands and Islands, community ownership will provide a great incentive for these communities to develop economically and to retain and grow their population, and wishes the communities every success with the venture they have embarked on. Supported by: Sandra White*, Bill Kidd*, Brian Adam*, Kenneth Gibson*, Rob Gibson*, Bob Doris*, Jim Tolson*, Stuart McMillan*
