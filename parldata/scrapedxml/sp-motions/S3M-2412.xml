 *S3M-2412Bob Doris:Congratulations to Glasgow UNESCO City of Music—That the Parliament warmly welcomes Glasgow’s becoming only the third UNESCO City of Music in the world, an accolade shared with Bologna and Seville, and notes that, as such, Glasgow joins Edinburgh as part of UNESCO’s worldwide Creative Cities Network; congratulates all those involved in achieving this accolade, including Glasgow City Council, the Scottish Government and, most importantly, the people of Glasgow, whose passion, flare and ability are the most important factors in gaining such recognition; notes that one of the reasons behind the Creative Cities Network is the idea of creative tourism, and, as a result of Glasgow’s new status, looks forward to many more visitors being welcomed to Glasgow in the coming years to experience the many attractions the city has to offer, including its vibrant music scene.
