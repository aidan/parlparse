*S3M-6709 Michael Matheson: End Alcohol Loyalty Points—That the Parliament notes the comment of Dr Brian Keighley, Chairman of the BMA in Scotland, at its recent conference that "There is a need to send the right message on drinking behaviour by not allowing rewards for buying alcohol" and calls on the major supermarkets to end loyalty points on the sale of alcohol as part of a package to help end Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with alcohol.
