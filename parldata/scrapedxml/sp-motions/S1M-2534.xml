*S1M-2534# Dorothy-Grace Elder: Save Post Office Jobs-That the Parliament views with grave concern the cutbacks in postal services in Scotland being proposed by Consignia, including the closure in Glasgow of Scotland's only Parcel Distribution Office and only remaining International Mail Centre and a potential one in ten job losses in other areas, threatening business and domestic services, with transfer of work to newly built centres in Coventry and Berkshire; opposes any plan to sell off Post Office Vehicle Services which could result in further savage job cuts; upholds strongly the Post Office and Royal Mail as respected national institutions; deplores the rundown of a trusted service which commands public respect and affection thanks to the exceptional dedication of its workforce, and urges all who benefit from the dedication of postal workers, especially at this time of year, to realise their present plight and support their campaign to retain decent standards of service and maintain a public service.
