*S3M-3519 Christine Grahame: Arms Embargo of Israel and Gaza—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Amnesty International report examining foreign arms supplies to Israel and Gaza; notes with concern the evidence produced by Amnesty International that UK exports of conventional military equipment to Israel increased in the four year period from 2004 to £10.4 million and that UK exports almost doubled in the last year for which there are figures, further notes the failure of the UK Government to end-use-monitor components licensed for export to Israel from UK companies, and supports Amnesty International’s call for a complete and immediate arms embargo of Israel and Gaza in order to end any future war crimes through the use of weapons sourced from and supplied by the United Kingdom and other EU countries.
