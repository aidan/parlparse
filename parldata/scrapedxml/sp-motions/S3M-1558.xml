 *S3M-1558 Richard Baker: Glencraft—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision by the administration of Aberdeen City Council to withdraw funding from Glencraft which provides employment for the blind and other disabled employees; recognises that the organisation has transformed the lives of its employees and has received funding from successive councils for decades; condemns the lack of consultation with employees and the Board of Management over the withdrawal of funding; notes that Glencraft is already supported by the UK Government through Work Step funding from JobCentre Plus, an aspect which Aberdeen City Council does not seem to have taken into consideration in its decision and which will be lost if its decision stands, and calls on Aberdeen City Council to reverse its decision to withdraw funding from Glencraft.
