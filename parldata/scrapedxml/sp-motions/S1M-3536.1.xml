*S1M-3536.1 Michael Russell: Flexibility and Innovation in Schools—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3536) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end "but regrets that the Executive seems unable to take on board ideas which will make a real difference in the medium and long term such as the need for a substantial lowering in class sizes, particularly in the early years of primary, the simplification of the Scottish exam system, the review of 5-14 with the aim of creating more flexibility and less pressure, the building and development of a collective and collegiate view of school management as envisaged in the McCrone agreement (which should also involve parents and young people), and other major topics, but instead seeks to apply spin and hype to a First Minister’s vision of education that is lacking in vision and depth and does not constructively address the main issue of providing the best education possible for every child in Scotland."
