 *S3M-7269.1 Stewart Stevenson: Renewable Energy—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7269) in the name of Liam McArthur, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes Scotland’s massive renewable energy resources and the opportunities to turn Scotland into Europe’s clean green energy powerhouse; notes the UK Government’s proposals that would result in Scotland’s Fossil Fuel Levy fund helping to form part of a wider UK green investment bank fund that is due to be established in 2013-14; notes the lack of detail underlying that commitment and the risk that this could delay vital funding for the renewables sector in Scotland for several years, and calls urgently on the UK Government to release these funds and place them in the control of the Scottish Government and Scottish Parliament in a way that can be rapidly deployed to support Scotland’s renewable energy sector."
