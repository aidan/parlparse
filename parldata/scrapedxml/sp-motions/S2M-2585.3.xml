 *S2M-2585.3 Tommy Sheridan: Housing—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2585) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from first "welcomes" to end and insert "notes that the Scottish Executive’s target to invest in 21,500 affordable homes falls over 17,000 short of the target of 7,000 additional homes for social rent per year which the Chartered Institute of Housing in Scotland believes is necessary to address the current housing crisis; whilst welcoming help for new home owners, believes that the greatest assistance that could be provided is a substantial increase in the supply of affordable social rented housing to cool housing demand and bring a halt to unaffordable price inflation; believes that the current policy of right to buy, which sees three social houses sold for each one built, is unsustainable and should be replaced with a "right to rent discount" for tenants and that the primary aim of Executive policy should be the provision of good quality affordable social housing for rent; supports recent announcements and ongoing work to develop water and sewerage infrastructure for new housing and boost the availability of land, and welcomes the Housing (Scotland) Bill, published last week, which will seek to raise standards in the private housing sector and strengthen the rights of private sector tenants."
