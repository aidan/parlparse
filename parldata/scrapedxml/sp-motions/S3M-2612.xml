*S3M-2612 Jamie Stone: Supermarkets in the Highlandsâ€”That the Parliament notes that Highland consumers have a limited choice of supermarkets to shop at; regrets the impact that the dominance of a few supermarkets has on consumers, both in terms of choice and value for money, and believes that local authorities and government, when considering applications for new supermarkets, should take into consideration consumer choice as well as the negative impact they may have on the sustainability of small and independent outlets before granting applications.
