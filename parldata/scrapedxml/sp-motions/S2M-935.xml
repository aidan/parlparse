 *S2M-935# Carolyn Leckie: Government Overspend-That the Parliament notes the ongoing concern at the cost of building the new Scottish Parliament going over budget; believes that those costs should be considered in the context of the Ministry of Defence's overspend of £3 billion in the last year alone; notes that this included an overspend of £1.3 billion on the Astute Class submarine; further notes that despite the overspend the Ministry of Defence was incapable of providing its employees with basic equipment necessary for its illegal war on Iraq, and believes that Her Majesty's Government should cancel its top 22 defence projects, saving the UK taxpayer £65 billion.
