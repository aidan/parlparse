*S3M-8025 Margaret Mitchell: Hamilton College and Scottish Opera—That the Parliament congratulates Hamilton College’s J6 and J7 pupils on their recent performance of Scotland, Our Scotland!; notes that this was part of Scottish Opera’s Primary Schools Tours 2011-13 programme; acknowledges that Scottish Opera works with approximately 20,000 children annually by touring with three different shows for pupils in P5 to P7 covering subjects such as identity, citizenship, energy and geography; notes that the moral of Scotland, Our Scotland! is that much more can be achieved by working together instead of against each other; considers that this was an excellent performance providing a high quality experience for the children and that, by working with professional musicians and technicians and their props and equipment, it developed their singing, movement and performance skills, and hopes that many other schools will be able to enjoy the Scottish Opera experience and that the Hamilton College pupils will be inspired to continue acting, singing and performing.
