*S3M-1081 Brian Adam: Dons Eat Danishâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Aberdeen Football Club on its success after its defeat of FC Copenhagen to make it three Scottish clubs still in European competition after Christmas; wishes all the Scottish clubs well in European competitions in the new year; wishes the national side well in the World Cup qualifiers in 2008; notes that this is the first time that three Scottish clubs have been in such a position in decades, and further notes the strong position of Scottish football as a whole, with Scotland in 14th place in the FIFA world rankings.
