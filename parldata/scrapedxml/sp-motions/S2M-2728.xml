 *S2M-2728 Stewart Stevenson: Closure Threat to Longhaven School, Aberdeenshire—That the Parliament believes that, while recognising that in certain circumstances school closures are sometimes necessary and unavoidable, Aberdeenshire Council has failed to put forward a convincing argument for the closure of Longhaven School; understands that the reasons given for closure include a "lack of PE facilities and outdoor facilities"; notes that the school has access to the newly-built £350,000 village hall for PE, which is adjacent to the school and was built with a substantial sum of council money; notes that the school also has its own access to an adjacent council-maintained playing field and football pitch; further notes that administration and opposition councillors of all parties on the Buchan Area Committee have voted 10-nil to recommend that the council’s Education Committee retain Longhaven School, and calls on Aberdeenshire Council to retain and support this very successful rural village school. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
