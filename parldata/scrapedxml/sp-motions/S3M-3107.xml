 *S3M-3107 Kenneth Gibson: Keep Royal Mail in the Public Sector—That the Parliament notes the imminent publication of the Hooper review on the future of the Royal Mail; is concerned that this may be used as an excuse by Lord Mandelson and the UK Labour government to break its manifesto pledge not to privatise Royal Mail; believes that Royal Mail should not be broken up or privatised either wholly or partially, and calls on the UK Government to confirm that privatisation will not be countenanced.
