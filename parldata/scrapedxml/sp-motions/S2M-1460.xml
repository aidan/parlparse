*S2M-1460 Christine Grahame: Roxburgh Citizens Advice Bureau: 30 Years of Serving the Community-That the Parliament recognises the invaluable work of Citizens Advice Bureau offices Scotland-wide and notes that, in the past year of its work, Roxburgh Citizens Advice Bureau, like bureaux Scotland-wide, has offered free, confidential and independent information, advice and advocacy on any subject to anyone who requests it and also helps the community by campaigning on social issues; notes that this year alone it helped the public to claim £805,658 to which they were entitled, and congratulates all volunteers, past and present, as it celebrates 30 years of service in the community.
