*S2M-3641 Frances Curran: Congratulations to Arran Schools on Improvements to School Meals—That the Parliament congratulates Arran schools on plans to improve their school dinners by sourcing up to 70% of the ingredients used in the preparation of school meals from local suppliers, making schoolchildren healthier and reducing the use of processed foods; agrees that this is a great initiative which will also benefit local producers but that it will still only reach the 46% of school pupils who take school meals, and believes that free healthy school meals for all schoolchildren would ensure that all children would get a daily healthy meal.
