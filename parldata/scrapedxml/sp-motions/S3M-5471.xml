*S3M-5471 Hugh O’Donnell: Successful Scots in Dictionary—That the Parliament notes with pleasure the inclusion of four notable Scots in the 2010 edition of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography; recognises the valuable contribution made to Scottish sporting, cultural, environmental and gastronomic life by Jimmy "Jinky" Johnstone of Celtic and Scotland, the author, Muriel Spark, writer and broadcaster Tom Weir and haggis manufacturer John Macsween respectively, and believes that their inclusion in the dictionary is recognition of their international contribution in their respective fields of success.
