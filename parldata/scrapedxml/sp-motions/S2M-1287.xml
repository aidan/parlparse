*S2M-1287 Susan Deacon: National Condom Week 10 to 16 May 2004-That the Parliament recognises that National Condom Week, 10 to 16 May 2004, makes a significant contribution in raising awareness of the importance of using barrier protection in the prevention of both sexually transmitted infection and unplanned pregnancy; further recognises that the Durex Report 2004 shows that 34% of Scottish people had unprotected sex with a new partner in the last 12 months; expresses concern about the 20% increase in HIV cases in the United Kingdom between 2002 and 2003, and believes that the Scottish Executive's forthcoming sexual health and relationships strategy should address this issue and promote the importance of education in improving sexual health in Scotland.
