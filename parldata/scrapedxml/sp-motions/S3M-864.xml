 *S3M-864 Claire Baker: Congratulations to NHS Fife for Eye Diagnosis Pilot—That the Parliament congratulates NHS Fife for winning second prize at the Scottish Clinical Information in Practice awards for its successful pilot, begun in 2005, using email and digital images to refer eye patients rather than using the postal service; notes that researchers concluded that this change in practice for optometrist services was "safe, speedy, efficient, clinically accurate and avoids unnecessary consultations"; recognises that the changes to practice resulted in a much more efficient use of hospital appointments which could save the NHS millions of pounds each year; further congratulates NHS Fife for developing the service by creating a central ophthalmic electronic referral unit, and calls on the Scottish Government to consider rolling out this innovative service across Scotland.
