*S3M-7081 Joe FitzPatrick: University of Dundee World Rankings—That the Parliament congratulates the University of Dundee on being included in the top 200 world universities ranked by the Times Educational Supplement; understands that this year’s rankings were undertaken under a new and more thorough methodology, which places more emphasis on hard measures of excellence in all three core elements of a university’s mission - research, teaching and knowledge transfer; further notes that the university has been described by The Sunday Times as "an institution regarded as one of the success stories of British higher education", which has already been ranked top in the world for research impact in pharmacology by Thomson Reuters and elected Europe’s "best place to work in academia" in the annual worldwide survey compiled by The Scientist magazine, and wishes the staff and students all the very best in continuing to move the bar of human knowledge and further both Dundee and Scotland’s reputations worldwide.
