*S3M-7012 Stewart Maxwell: Increasing Participation in Scottish Youth Football—That the Parliament supports the Scottish Youth Football Association (SYFA) in its move to allow teams participating in all of the age groups that it administers to use more than three substitutions per match; shares the concerns expressed by the SYFA and, it believes, most senior youth football clubs that the current rule means that there are fewer opportunities for young players to get involved on match days; agrees with the SYFA’s concerns that the current position makes young people less likely to stay involved in the sport and that this makes it more difficult for local teams to maintain the large squad of players that they require, including at times, such as exam periods, when a large number of players are likely to be absent; considers that youth football should be primarily about maximising participation, not only to aid the development of players, but also to encourage young people to stay active through sport, and calls on the Scottish Football Association to back the SYFA’s move to allow up to five rolling substitutions per match for youth teams up to the age of 21.
