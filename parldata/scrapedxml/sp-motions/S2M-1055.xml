 *S2M-1055# Frances Curran: Columbian Hunger Strike-That the Parliament notes with grave concern the hunger strike that commenced on Monday 15 March 2004 by Coca-Cola workers in front of the Coca-Cola bottling plants in eight Colombian towns in protest at the company's plans to dismiss 91 workers from the plants; expresses its great concern at the continuing oppression of workers in Coca-Cola bottling plants in Colombia, particularly trade union leaders and members, and the company's efforts to eliminate the trade unions by pressurising workers to resign from contracts; further notes with concern allegations that paramilitary groups have attacked and murdered trade unionists working in Coca-Cola plants in Colombia, and believes that all Coca-Cola products and advertising should be removed from the parliamentary estate and all publicly-owned buildings, especially schools, at once as an act of solidarity with the workers and trade unions in Colombia.
