*S3M-4864 Sandra White: Report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict—That the Parliament notes the report of the United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict, which has found evidence that Israel has committed serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law, actions amounting to war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity that were carefully planned in all their phases as a deliberately disproportionate attack designed to punish, humiliate and terrorise a civilian population and mounted a blockade that amounted to collective punishment in the lead-up to the conflict, while also finding that Palestinian groups had committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity in their repeated rocket and mortar attacks on Israel; welcomes the recommendation of the mission that the United Nations Human Rights Council submits the report to the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court, and believes that all parties involved in the conflict must fully investigate the allegations contained in the report if they are to deliver on the desire of their people to reach a meaningful and lasting peace.
