 *S2M-75 Campbell Martin: North Ayrshire Leisure Limited—That the Parliament condemns the action of North Ayrshire Leisure Limited, a company formed, and primarily funded, by North Ayrshire Council, in banning the Auchenharvie Ice Dance and Figure Skating Club from operating a small tuck shop selling "20p mixtures" of sweets and non-fizzy drinks, proceeds of which were used to help fund the development of skating and ice dance talent among young people in the north Ayrshire area; notes that this action will mean that the club may now struggle to meet financial obligations to its young members in terms of dance and skating development and recognition of achievement, and deplores the fact that North Ayrshire Leisure Limited appears to be putting profit before sporting development by advising club members that they should instead use vending machines selling over-priced and unhealthy chocolate bars and fizzy drinks.
