 *S2M-4224 Murdo Fraser: Launch of "Come off it" on 4 April 2006â€”That the Parliament welcomes the launch of "Come off it" on 4 April 2006, and the message promoted on its website, www.comeoffit.org.uk, that everybody can make a difference in reducing the amount of energy that is wasted every day by taking simple actions, such as switching off all appliances that are on standby and replacing regular light bulbs with energy-efficient bulbs; encourages everyone to take such simple actions today and the Scottish Parliament to set a lead example in energy efficiency, with all MSPs and their staff ensuring that their computers and office lights are switched off at the end of the day, and welcomes the ethos behind "Come off it" which realises that we must reduce pollution in order to stop climate chaos which will damage and change our planet. Supported by: Mr Ted Brocklebank*, Margaret Mitchell*, Mike Pringle*, Mr Jamie McGrigor*, Mr Mark Ruskell*, Eleanor Scott*, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton*, Mr David Davidson*, Mr Kenneth Macintosh*, John Scott*
