*S2M-3433 Mark Ballard: Location of Slow Food UK Office—That the Parliament notes that the UK Slow Food Association was founded at a congress held on Skye in August 2005; notes that the Slow Food Movement is an international organisation with a growing profile (the movement’s founder, Carlo Petrini, was on Time Magazine’s list of European heroes last year); notes that Fiona Richmond from Edinburgh has been appointed as Slow Food UK’s first director and believes that Edinburgh should bid to host the UK office of the Slow Food Movement as the enhancement of Edinburgh’s reputation as a destination serious about real food would be considerable; commends moves to provide office space and sponsorship for the Slow Food UK office, and believes that changing Scotland’s food culture is important in improving the lives of Scottish people and the Scottish environment.
