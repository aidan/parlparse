*S1M-1764# Dr Elaine Murray: Flood Prevention—That the Parliament notes the responsibility which local authorities have for flood prevention measures and also the need for them to give consideration to possible flood risks when considering planning applications; further notes that local authorities have access to estimated 100 year flood maps provided by the Scottish Environment Protection Agency for this purpose but is concerned that the scale of these maps, produced by the Institute of Hydrology, is 1:50,000 and that they only provide information in 50 square metre blocks; urges the Scottish Executive to give consideration to the effectiveness of these maps; believes that the Executive should work with all local authorities to identify areas of flood risk which are susceptible to flooding and to develop a national scheme to restrict or prohibit development on "at risk" areas, and further urges the Executive to produce a long term strategy for areas of development currently prone to flooding.
