 *S1M-2361 Mike Watson: Cosmic Rough Riders—That the Parliament congratulates everyone at C Sharp Community recording studios in Castlemilk for their part in the success of local band, the Cosmic Rough Riders, whose debut album Enjoy the Melodic Sunshine has reached sales of 60,000 in the UK and, as such, qualifies for a British Phonographic Industry Silver Disc award; notes that this year the songs on recordings made at C Sharp have been heard by the band’s audiences during their tours of the UK, the USA, Europe and Japan, and commends the work of community-based studios like this which is evidence that the grass-roots music industry is thriving across Scotland. Supported by: Mr Kenneth Macintosh*
