*S3M-6384 Alasdair Allan: The Lewis Chessmenâ€”That the Parliament welcomes that the world-famous Lewis Chessmen have just gone on major display at the National Museum of Scotland as part of a tour that will see them exhibited in the Western Isles from April to September 2011; notes that the chessmen, which for many years have been a symbol for the islands, were found in Uig in Lewis in 1831; considers that these pieces are of huge cultural and local importance to the Western Isles and congratulates those involved in ensuring that the chessmen will be in the islands during the Year of Island Cultures 2011, and, furthermore, believes that the chessmen should return to Scotland permanently, with an exhibition of at least some of the pieces based in Lewis.
