 *S3M-5831 Angela Constance: Campaign for Improved Neonatal Care Comes to Parliamentâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Bliss, the special care baby charity, on its 30th birthday in Scotland, to be celebrated in the Parliament on 3 March 2010; considers that there is a need for better support for families whose babies are admitted to a neonatal unit far away from the family home, including financial support and accommodation; further considers that too often babies and mothers needing care are transferred long distances from home due to staff shortages at more local units rather than for medical need, and, finally, praises the nurses and doctors working in neonatal units who work tirelessly to ensure that special care babies receive the best possible standards of care.
