*S1M-2270 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Tourism Industry in Crisis-That the Parliament notes that the current crisis facing the tourism industry has been compounded by the recent tragic terrorist attacks in the United States of America which could have the effect of depressing visitor numbers even further, especially those from the key North American Sector; believes that urgent financial action must be taken to maintain the survival of core tourism-related businesses through the winter period and ensure that there is a sound tourism base upon which to rebuild markets, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to establish a tourism hardship fund, from which grants can be paid to tourism-related businesses, in order to aid the survival of sustainable concerns throughout the crisis. Supported by: Mr Duncan Hamilton*
