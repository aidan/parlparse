*S1M-3624 Mary Scanlon: Anticoagulation Medication Strips on Prescription-That the Parliament notes that Scotland has a significant and growing number of patients who require oral anticoagulation medication to avoid potentially fatal bleeding or clotting; recognises that diagnostic technology enables these patients to self-monitor their blood-clotting times in order to determine the correct dose of anticoagulation medication, at considerable saving to the NHS and convenience to the patient; notes that anticoagulation monitoring strips are available on prescription in England, Wales and Northern Ireland but not yet in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make such strips available on prescription in Scotland without further delay.
