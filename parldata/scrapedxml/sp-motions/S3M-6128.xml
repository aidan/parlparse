 *S3M-6128# Cathy Peattie: Full Steam Ahead from Bo’ness to Manuel—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Railway Preservation Society (SRPS) on the extension of the Bo’ness and Kinneil Railway to include a further 1.5 miles from Birkhill to Manuel, where the line is linked to the main rail network; notes that the extension, which included relaying a section of the line and extending Birkhill station platform, was made possible by the tremendous contribution of volunteer workers, and wishes the SRPS continuing success in its plans for the future, including the building of a new station at Manuel.
