 *S1M-2358 Tommy Sheridan: Deportation of Ulla Roder-That the Parliament notes with grave concern that Ulla Roder, a Danish peace campaigner, is currently threatened with deportation, finds it particularly inappropriate that the threat of deportation is raised against a peaceful activist within the borders of the European Union, especially when the European Convention on Human Rights, which normally underpins that Union so strongly, defends the right to protest, and asks the Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government to reject any requests to deport this peace activist who has consistently campaigned for a nuclear-free Scotland.
