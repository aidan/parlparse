 *S3M-2965 Linda Fabiani: St Andrew’s Day—That the Parliament believes in the importance of St Andrew’s Day, Scotland’s national day; recognises the opportunity that it presents for everyone in Scotland, and friends of Scotland around the world, to celebrate our history, culture and traditions as well as the vibrant, creative and dynamic nation that Scotland is today; notes the Scottish Government’s support for a programme of events throughout Scotland as part of the Winter Festival, and supports the opportunity that St Andrew’s Day provides to prepare the way for the 2009 Year of Homecoming, which will give a much-needed boost to the Scottish tourism sector and to the economy generally.
