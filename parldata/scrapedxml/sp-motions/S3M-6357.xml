*S3M-6357 Joe FitzPatrick: Computer Games Tax Relief—That the Parliament notes that although the UK Government is planning to present an emergency budget in the coming weeks, it has not yet stated a position on granting the tax relief for the UK’s computer games’ development industry that it considers necessary to enable the industry to be on a level playing field with competitors around the world; considers that this industry is vitally important to the UK economy and particularly the city of Dundee, where it employs approximately 3,000 people; understands that the current UK tax regime puts British companies in this industry at a competitive disadvantage compared to those in countries such as France, Canada, Japan and South Korea where it believes governments are more welcoming; considers that the cost of granting such tax relief would be extremely small in comparison to the return on the investment and would play a key role in economic recovery; encourages discussions with major stakeholders such as TIGA (The Independent Game Developers Association) regarding the resolution of this issue, and invites the newly appointed Minister for Culture, Olympics, Media and Sport, Jeremy Hunt, to visit Dundee to note first hand the impact that the industry has on the city and the UK.
