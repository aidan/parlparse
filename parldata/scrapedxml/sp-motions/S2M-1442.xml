*S2M-1442 Cathy Peattie: Big Fit Walk-That the Parliament congratulates Grangemouth Health Promotion Group and Integrated Learning Community on its organisation of the Big Fit Walk on 11 June 2004; notes that the object is to raise awareness of the health benefits of physical activity by encouraging as many people as possible to take a 30-minute walk and that at least 3,000 people in Grangemouth are expected to do so on 11 June; further notes that this event builds upon other innovative local initiatives such as the GP Exercise Referral Scheme, and hopes that in future years there will be Scotland-wide Big Fit Walks.
