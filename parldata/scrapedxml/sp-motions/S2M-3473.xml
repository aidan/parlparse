*S2M-3473# Maureen Macmillan: Outsourcing of Rail Call Centre Jobs from Vertex Call Centre, Dingwall—That the Parliament notes with concern the issuing of the 90-day notices to the 200-plus workforce at the Vertex Call Centre in Dingwall; notes that the loss of these jobs will have a major impact on this small Highland town; further notes that these jobs have been put in jeopardy by the decision of TheTrainline, a company which has Virgin Trains as its major shareholder, to move the contract outwith the European Union, in spite of Virgin Trains being in receipt of substantial amounts of UK taxpayers’ money; supports the campaign of the Transport Salaried Staff’s Association on behalf of the call centre workers who are a highly skilled and loyal workforce, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider what influence it can exert to reverse TheTrainline’s decision or assist Vertex in finding a new contract.
