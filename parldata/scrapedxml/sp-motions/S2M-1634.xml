 * S2M-1634# Alex Neil:Rowallan Medical Centre—That the Parliament expresses its concern at the failure of NHS Lanarkshire to involve patients adequately in the selection of a general practitioner for the Rowallan Medical Centre in Blantyre; further expresses its disappointment at the board’s failure to keep its promise of patient involvement at each stage of this process, and considers that the Scottish Executive should urgently review NHS Scotland’s policy and practice in respect of patient involvement in the selection of GPs and wider issues affecting primary health care in local communities.
