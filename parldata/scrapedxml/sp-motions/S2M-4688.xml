 *S2M-4688# Bill Butler: Glasgow Crossrail Scheme—That the Parliament welcomes the progress that has been made to modernise Scotland’s rail infrastructure, the most recent example of which was the agreement to the general principles of the Bill to establish the Glasgow Airport Rail Link (GARL) on 21 June 2006; notes the points contained in the Glasgow Airport Rail Link Bill Committee’s preliminary stage report which highlight the national and local economic and transport benefits of the proposed Glasgow Crossrail scheme if introduced in conjunction with the GARL project; recognises the added value which the proposed crossrail scheme would bring not only to Glasgow but to Scotland’s rail transport infrastructure; acknowledges that the establishment of the scheme would bridge the missing link in Scotland’s rail network; realises that the scheme would further strengthen Glasgow’s bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and believes that the compelling economic and transport case for Glasgow Crossrail is such that the Scottish Executive should commit to the implementation of the project.
