*S2M-3791 Ms Sandra White: Congratulations to the Refugees into Teaching Project—That the Parliament notes the success of and congratulates the Refugees Into Teaching project based at the University of Strathclyde, which has just been awarded 5-star beacon status by the Home Office, the highest status that can be achieved, for its work with refugee and asylum seeker teachers; notes the comments of the award’s assessor that the partnership project, which is jointly funded by the University of Strathclyde, the University of Paisley, the University of Glasgow, Anniesland College, Glasgow City Council, the General Teaching Council for Scotland, the Bridges Project, the West of Scotland Wider Access Forum and the Scottish Refugee Council, “shows early indications that it will result in positive personal and professional outcomes for refugees”, and notes that this successful model of integration for refugees and asylum seekers is one which can be recommended to other professional groups.
