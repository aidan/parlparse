*S3M-7703 Hugh O’Donnell: Violence against Christian Communities in Egypt and Iraq—That the Parliament condemns violence against any religious or faith community as an affront to human liberty and rights and urges the UK Government to express its abhorrence at recent attacks on Christian communities at worship in Egypt and Iraq and to press the authorities in these countries on the need to make the strongest efforts to bring the perpetrators to justice.
