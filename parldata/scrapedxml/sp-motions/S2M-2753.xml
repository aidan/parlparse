 *S2M-2753 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Support for Publicly-Appointed Ferry Service Users’ Representation—That the Parliament supports the Caledonian MacBrayne Users’ Committee, whose members are appointed by public selection and are committed to the Nolan principles; notes with dismay that, when this body is abolished as a result of the Railways Act 2005, the Scottish Executive wishes to replace this publicly-accountable committee with the existing shipping services advisory committees, which have been set up by Caledonian MacBrayne and meet in private, and with a Scottish ferry committee which will be made up of representatives of local authorities, members of the shipping services advisory committees, national bodies, Scottish ministers and representatives of other users, and urges the Executive to ensure that passengers, and in particular foot passengers, are properly represented by publicly-appointed members of a body that will protect their interests in the provision of these lifeline services.
