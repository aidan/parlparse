*S3M-1134# Sandra White: Crime On Your Street Investigation—That the Parliament commends the Glasgow Evening Times’ second Crime On Your Street investigation which reports on the year-on-year changes in crimes affecting Glasgow’s communities, including highly detailed maps providing a comprehensive breakdown of the crimes committed in each of the 232 beats, and gives readers the chance to quiz Strathclyde Police’s new Chief Constable, Steve House, on these findings; believes that such detailed reporting of each community gives a unique insight into the hugely differing crime priorities in each area, providing the police with invaluably precise information in the fight against crime in each community, and hopes that this welcome investigation will serve as a great example to be taken up by other interested parties across Scotland.
