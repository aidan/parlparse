 * S2M-2803 Mr Mark Ruskell:Co-Housing—That the Parliament welcomes the conference to be held at Glasgow Caledonian University, “ A Roadmap to Sustainable Co-Housing for Older People – planning the route” for bringing the notable work of co-housing projects to Scotland’s attention; acknowledges the increasing interest in co-housing amongst many Scottish communities, although there are currently no built projects in Scotland; applauds the work of the innovative pilot project, Vivarium, in Fife for its intention to create an affordable, self-managed co-housing project for older people; believes that co-housing projects have the potential to provide positive, co-operative and sustainable community-led housing environments that combine the autonomy of private dwellings with the advantages of community living; further notes that co-housing projects have been well-established, successful and popular in countries such as Denmark, Holland, Aotearoa/New Zealand and the United States of America for many years, and calls on the Scottish Executive to investigate the benefits of co-housing and how support for it can be integrated into wider housing policy. Supported by: Chris Ballance*, Patrick Harvie*, Eleanor Scott*, Mark Ballard*, Shiona Baird*, Rob Gibson*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Nora Radcliffe*, Dr Jean Turner* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
