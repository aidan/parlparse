*S2M-859 Fergus Ewing: Scottish Infantry Regiments-That the Parliament disapproves of the suggestion that there should be a reduction from six to four in the infantry regiments of the Scottish Division by disbandment; notes that two of the regiments likely to be disbanded are The Highlanders and The Royal Scots which have a long and honourable history central to Scotland's military identity; recognises the important local loyalties for each of the regiments across Scotland; recalls the magnificent campaign to save The Queen's Own Highlanders, which was ignored by Westminster in 1994, and calls on all Scotland, including the Scottish Executive, to campaign for the retention of all Scotland's infantry regiments and to protect Scotland's military identity.
