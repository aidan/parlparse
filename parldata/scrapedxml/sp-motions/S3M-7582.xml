*S3M-7582 John Park: Frosty Relations in the Workplaceâ€”That the Parliament notes that the recent weather conditions have had a huge impact on the ability of people in Scotland to travel safely in their day-to-day lives; is concerned at reports of some employers refusing to pay people, who, despite their best efforts and through no fault of their own, have been unable to make it to work because of the weather and unsafe road conditions; considers that productivity is improved by positive relationships between employers and their workforce; expects employers to look reasonably at the issue of time off for employees who have been affected by the snow and ice, especially during the festive season, and hopes that through such positive actions Scotland continues to be seen as a first-class place to live and work.
