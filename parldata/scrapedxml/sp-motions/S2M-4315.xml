 *S2M-4315 Cathy Peattie: World Asthma Day and Asthma Control—That the Parliament welcomes the aim of World Asthma Day on Tuesday 2 May 2006 which highlights the importance of people with asthma being in control of their condition; notes with concern that four out of five people with asthma in the United Kingdom are currently not in control of their condition, resulting in over three million adults experiencing symptoms, such as inability to exercise and lack of sleep, which impact unnecessarily on their daily lives; supports the launch of Asthma UK Scotland’s asthma control test, a quick five-part questionnaire designed to help people understand how to control their asthma, and believes that, by raising awareness of this issue, more people will be in control of their asthma, rather than controlled by their asthma. Supported by: Margaret Jamieson*, Mr David Davidson*, Christine Grahame*, Murdo Fraser*, Christine May*, Jackie Baillie*, Linda Fabiani*, Mike Pringle*, Colin Fox*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Mr Brian Monteith*, Murray Tosh*, Rob Gibson*, Karen Whitefield*, Bruce Crawford*, Eleanor Scott*, Brian Adam*, Marlyn Glen*, Sarah Boyack*, Des McNulty*, Dr Elaine Murray*, Bristow Muldoon*, Trish Godman*, Mr Kenneth Macintosh*, Mrs Mary Mulligan*, Maureen Macmillan* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
