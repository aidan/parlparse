 *S1M-2955 Tommy Sheridan: Deportation of Eduardo Sanchez—That the Parliament notes with grave concern that Julio Eduardo Hoyos Sanchez, a 36-year-old Peruvian freelance artist, is being held in Dungavel detention centre after having been detained on the morning of Monday 25 March 2002 and that an order for his deportation was granted on 19 March; notes that Eduardo Sanchez has lived in Scotland for 11 years and has a 9-year-old son, Yan Shearer, who lives with his mother, Carol Shearer (Eduardo’s former partner) in Orkney; further notes that Yan is seeking action on behalf of his own human rights to stop his father being deported, that the entire Shearer family is opposed to the deportation of Eduardo and that he himself has lodged an appeal against this deportation order, and urges the Deputy First Minister and Minister for Justice to make immediate representations to the Home Office on behalf of Eduardo with a view to it revoking the deportation order and allowing him to remain in Scotland with his son.
