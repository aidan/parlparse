*S2M-5259 Carolyn Leckie: End of Term Report on Multiple Sclerosis—That the Parliament welcomes the End of Term Report on Multiple Sclerosis, published by the Multiple Sclerosis Society; notes with concern that, with around 10,400 people diagnosed, Scotland has the highest prevalence of MS in the world; appreciates that, while some improvements have been made to the care and treatment of MS with drugs such as beta interferon and glatiramer now being generally available on the NHS, much more still needs to be done; is concerned at the slow progress of the development and implementation of standards of care for people affected by neurological conditions, a proposal for which was approved on 2 February 2006; is further concerned that, although there are now 23 MS nurses in Scotland, they have required to be jointly funded by charitable donations rather than through central funding and that there is still considerable inequality of access to such nurses with Lanarkshire, for example, having only one nurse for 1,100 patients; is deeply concerned that the social care framework for people with MS is severely limited due to local authority budget constraints, with services such as respite care not being adequately and appropriately delivered in some areas and the Multiple Sclerosis Society being required to pick up the shortfall to the tune of £700,000 annually, and home adaptations not being available free of charge to patients in all local authority areas, and calls on the Scottish Executive to provide adequate resources to the NHS and local authorities to ensure equal access to care and services to all MS patients, regardless of where they live.
