 * S2M-3093 Mr Mark Ruskell: Climate Change and the House of Lordsâ€”That the Parliament notes the publication by the House of Lords Economics Affairs Committee of its latest report, The Economics of Climate Change; condemns the conclusions and recommendations of the report as a massive step backwards in the debate on climate change; believes that any economic costs of mitigating climate change will be far outweighed by the costs of inaction and that economies worldwide will be devastated by the effects of climate change unless it is tackled immediately; acknowledges that the key to successful action on climate change must be based around drastic emissions reductions; reaffirms that much-improved energy efficiency and increased use of renewable energy sources will be vital in securing a sustainable energy future, and urges all governments to heed the recent statement of the national science academies of the G8 nations and Brazil, China and India and show leadership in taking prompt action to reduce the causes of climate change.
