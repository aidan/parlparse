* S3M-6163 Margaret Mitchell: Brew for the Few—That the Parliament congratulates the RAF Association on the initiative to raise funds by asking people to host a Brew for the Few event in the form of a tea/coffee morning; understands that 2,000 RAF personnel are currently deployed in war zones and notes that the widely held perception that the RAF Association helps only airmen and airwomen who fought in World War II is simply not the case; recognises that the RAF Association supports the whole RAF family, including people who are serving and have served in recent conflicts; further notes that the association receives no government funding and, therefore, is totally dependent on the generosity of the public and the association’s own members to raise the funds to enable it to continue its work in providing assistance and support to the RAF family, and welcomes The Brew for the Few initiative over the next few months as a great way to help raise money for such a worthy cause.
