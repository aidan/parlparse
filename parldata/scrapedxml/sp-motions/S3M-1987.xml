*S3M-1987 Robert Brown: Recycling Provisions—That the Parliament notes with concern the recent survey by Glasgow’s Evening Times which showed great variation among local councils as to their recycling provision; notes that in Glasgow only 31% of households have a recycling bin of any colour while some neighbouring authorities have collection arrangements for cardboard, food waste and plastic as well as tins, glass and paper; welcomes the work done by the previous administration to dramatically increase recycling, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with local authorities to further improve and increase recycling services and to create a minimum national standard for service provision.
