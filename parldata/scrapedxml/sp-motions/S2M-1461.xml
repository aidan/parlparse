*S2M-1461 Mike Rumbles: Men's Health Week, Scotland: 14 to 20 June 2004-That the Parliament pledges support for Men's Health Week, Scotland, from 14 to 20 June 2004; acknowledges efforts by all sectors to publicise Men's Health Week, Scotland and recognises and welcomes the work undertaken by the Men's Health Forum Scotland generally; recognises that men have a lower life expectancy, higher suicide rate and a higher death rate from diseases such as cancer and heart disease than women; further recognises that men are less likely to have chronic diseases identified and treated early and that men attend their GPs less than half as often as women; notes that as the population of Scotland ages the burden of treating and caring for increasing numbers of men living longer with chronic disease will be resource-intensive; believes that prevention of such diseases should be a focus for Scottish health policy, and calls upon MSPs to assist ongoing collaborations by promoting positive messages about healthy ageing, men's health and Men's Health Week, encouraging more men to take responsibility for their own health and well-being.
