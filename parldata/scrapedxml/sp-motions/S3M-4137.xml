*S3M-4137 Rhoda Grant: VisitScotland Promoting the Scottish Chef of the Year—That the Parliament notes with disappointment the refusal of VisitScotland to promote the country’s new chef of the year, Charles Lockley, on its website and in its brochures; congratulates Mr Lockley, a Michelin-star chef, who was awarded the Scottish Chef of the Year Award on 10 May 2009 and who also has four AA rosettes awarded to his restaurant at the Boath House Hotel in Auldearn; considers that as a public agency VisitScotland should use its public funding to promote properly the Highlands and Scotland, including Mr Lockley and his award-winning organisation, and urges the Scottish Government during this Year of Homecoming to ensure that VisitScotland does all that it can to promote award-winning establishments, such as the Boath House Hotel in Auldearn.
