 *S3M-3105 Sarah Boyack: Further Delay in Publishing Energy Efficiency and Microgeneration Action Plan—That the Parliament condemns the further delay of up to a year in the publication of the Scottish Government’s energy efficiency and microgeneration action plan; notes that, as recently as 5 November 2008, the action plan was promised by the Scottish Government in 2008; notes the findings of the Stern review that energy efficiency could deliver up to 53% of the total greenhouse gas emission reductions required in the United Kingdom by 2050 and the conclusion of Audit Scotland’s report of 11 December 2008 on energy efficiency in the public sector that there is a need for the Scottish Government to give stronger leadership to deliver improvements in energy efficiency, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward an ambitious action plan on energy efficiency and microgeneration without delay.
