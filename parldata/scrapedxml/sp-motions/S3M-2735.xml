*S3M-2735 Cathy Jamieson: World Osteoporosis Day—That the Parliament marks World Osteoporosis Day on 20 October 2008; welcomes the recent publication by the National Osteoporosis Society of Your bones and osteoporosis: What every man, woman and child should know, a major report that shows that almost half of 18 to 24-year-olds do not know that there are steps they can take to keep their bones healthy, with more than half unaware that exercise can help to reduce the risk of osteoporosis and one in three unaware about the positive role that diet can play; notes these statistics and the importance of taking action to prevent osteoporosis in later life, and supports the recommendations to improve the public’s knowledge of bone health across all ages in Scotland.
