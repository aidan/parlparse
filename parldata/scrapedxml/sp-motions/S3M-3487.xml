*S3M-3487 Liam McArthur: NFU Scotland—That the Parliament recognises the key role played by NFU Scotland in supporting Scotland’s farmers who make up one of Scotland’s most important industries, an industry that sustains local economies and communities across rural Scotland and produces top quality food for our tables; congratulates Jim McLaren on his re-election as President of NFU Scotland and Allan Bowie and Nigel Miller on being elected as vice-presidents, and recognises the excellent service given to NFU Scotland and to Scottish agriculture by Stewart Wood, who stands down after two years as vice-president of the organisation.
