 *S3M-2985# Mary Mulligan: Young Roots Films of Woodland in Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the Woodland Trust Scotland and pupils of Bathgate Academy, Deans Community High, Inveralmond Community High, Linlithgow Academy and Whitburn Academy for producing the Young Roots videos, representing various views of local woodlands; recognises that this has helped the young people to understand the contribution of woodland to their environment and to gain skills on film-making, and hopes that the videos can be made available to school and community groups across Scotland to raise awareness of the many woodlands throughout Scotland.
