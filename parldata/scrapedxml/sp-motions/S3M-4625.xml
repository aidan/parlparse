*S3M-4625 Sarah Boyack: Engine Shed Awarded Social Enterprise Mark—That the Parliament congratulates the Engine Shed on being awarded the Social Enterprise Mark, an award that signposts the project to members of the public as a social enterprise creating social and environmental benefits; notes the innovative work carried out by the Engine Shed in providing training for people with learning disabilities to help them improve their confidence, learn transferable skills in a real work environment and move into paid employment in mainstream workplaces; further notes that the four main work areas operating at the Engine Shed, including a vegetarian café, organic bakery, organic tofu production and conference and hospitality facilities, as well as providing a training environment, are busy, thriving production units supplying a wide range of healthy, organic meals and products throughout Edinburgh and further afield while successfully contributing to ensure the sustainability of the enterprise, and commends the efforts of Senscot to promote and establish the Social Enterprise Mark in Scotland in partnership with RISE, a social enterprise organisation that has developed the awards, originally in south-west England and now across other English regions.
