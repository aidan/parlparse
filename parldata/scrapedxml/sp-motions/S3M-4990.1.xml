*S3M-4990.1 Jamie Hepburn: Gordon Brown Is Congratulated by Bono in New York—As an amendment to motion (S3M-4990) in the name of Helen Eadie, leave out from "is immensely proud" to end and insert "notes that Gordon Brown was presented with an award by former US Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, while in New York; recalls the record of Henry Kissinger while part of the US administration and accusations of his involvement in supporting Operation Condor, a programme of political repression involving assassination across Latin America, as well as in the undermining of the democratically elected Chilean administration of Salvador Allende, which was overthrown on 11 September 1973, heralding the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet, a period that resulted in the deaths and disappearances of at least 3,000 people; considers that Henry Kissinger’s attitude to democracy is characterised by his reported remarks, "I don’t see why we need to stand by and watch a country go communist due to the irresponsibility of its own people. The issues are much too important for the Chilean voters to be left to decide for themselves"; recalls that Henry Kissinger was also involved in perpetuating the Vietnam War while part of the US Government, including the secret bombing of Cambodia as part of Operation Menu, resulting in hundreds of thousands of civilian deaths; also considers that Henry Kissinger advocated that the US Government turn a blind eye to the Indonesian invasion of East Timor, an event of which he allegedly had prior knowledge, and believes that, given this track record, being presented an award by Henry Kissinger is a highly dubious honour indeed. Supported by: Bill Wilson*, Bill Kidd*, Michael Matheson* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
