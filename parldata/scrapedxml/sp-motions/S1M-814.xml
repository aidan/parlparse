*S1M-814 Mr John McAllion: Dispersal of Scottish Executive and Public Body Jobs throughout Scotland—That the Parliament notes the recent statements by Ministers that the Scottish Executive does not specifically aim to balance the number of Scottish Executive jobs located in different areas of Scotland; considers that it is desirable to locate civil service and public body jobs across the regions of Scotland as a matter of policy, and calls for a debate on how this might be achieved through a transparent and open mechanism that is accountable to the Parliament itself.
