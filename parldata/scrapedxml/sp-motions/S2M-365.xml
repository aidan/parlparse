 *S2M-365# Bristow Muldoon: Edinburgh's Proposals for Congestion Charging-That the Parliament notes that the draft congestion charging scheme approved by the City of Edinburgh Council proposes to exempt Edinburgh residents who live outwith the proposed outer cordon from paying a congestion charge, whilst still proposing to levy a charge on residents of other local authorities; believes that such a proposal is discriminatory and unfair, thus failing to meet the requirement of "fair treatment" emphasised by the Scottish Executive in giving approval in principle to a charging scheme, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should reject any subsequent proposal from the City of Edinburgh Council which is based on this form of charging regime.
