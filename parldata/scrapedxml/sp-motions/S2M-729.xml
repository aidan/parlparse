*S2M-729 Alasdair Morgan: Reform of Personal Bankruptcy Proceedings-That the Parliament notes the Opinion in the case of Advocate General v Maureen Taylor, wherein the obtaining of a warrant to inhibit on the dependence without judicial consideration contravenes Article 1, Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights; recognises that the imposition of such measures to freeze an individual's assets is often unnecessary and can cause hardship and suffering, and calls on the Scottish Executive to include reform of this practice in its proposed legislation on the reform of personal bankruptcy proceedings.
