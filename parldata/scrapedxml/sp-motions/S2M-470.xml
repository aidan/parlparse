*S2M-470# Pauline McNeill: Closure of Queen Mother's Hospital, Glasgow—That the Parliament opposes the recommendation to the Greater Glasgow NHS Board from the Maternity Working Group, chaired by Professor Margaret Reid, to close the Queen Mother's Hospital and transfer services to the Southern General and Princess Royal hospitals; believes that it makes no sense to close down a well-functioning unit with a proven and world-renowned record of care of mothers and babies; notes that the Queen Mother's Hospital has won many awards for clinical excellence and delivers services to communities that most need the service; further notes that the expert views of Scottish paediatricians and other medical staff appear to have been ignored by the working group, particularly those that expressed the view that transporting ill babies would pose a degree of risk that is currently not necessary; believes that the prospect of closing the Queen Mother's Hospital is not just a loss to women in the west of Glasgow and west of Scotland, but crucially denies a critical service to mothers and ill babies throughout Scotland who have relied upon the close link between the Queen Mother's Hospital and the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill, a model of care which has catered for women expecting babies that require immediate medical attention; is concerned over the negative knock-on effect to children's services as a result of clinicians remotely serving the two retained maternity units and the uncertainty now created over the future of the Yorkhill NHS Trust following the recommendation of the Maternity Working Group to close the children's hospital in the longer term and transfer all services to the Southern General Hospital, and considers that the Greater Glasgow NHS Board should reject the recommendations of the Maternity Working Group.
