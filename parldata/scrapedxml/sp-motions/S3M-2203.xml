 *S3M-2203 Bill Kidd: Banknote Equality—That the Parliament supports efforts to end the anomalous practice whereby Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes are refused in other constituent parts of the United Kingdom or refused exchange abroad; notes the current petition, http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/banknotequality/ to the Prime Minister, which states that: "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to make it against the Law to discriminate against Scottish and Northern Irish Banknotes. As a tax paying citizen of Scotland, the United Kingdom and Europe I should not be discriminated against or offered a lower rate of exchange or charged commission or refused sale for using Scottish money in England, Europe or any foreign country or have to convert it into English notes first. I no longer find it acceptable that my elected members cannot find parliamentary time to sort out the mess of the UK currency, or deal with the discrimination that people using Scottish and Northern Irish banknotes often face. Either sort it or give us all the same currency as I fear the resentment and embarrassment felt when Scots and Northern Irish face refusal or are discriminated against with lower rates of exchange will not help with European or British unity", and urges all those opposed to this discrimination to register their support by signing up to the petition.
