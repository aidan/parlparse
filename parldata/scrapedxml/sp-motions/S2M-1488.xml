*S2M-1488 Rosie Kane: Liverpool’s Princess—That the Parliament calls on Her Majesty’s Government to intervene immediately to stop the removal and deportation of Jugder and Shinee Narantsogt and their two children, Evsaana, aged 17, and Misheel, aged eight; also fears for the safety of Jugder, who was a provincial leader of the Mongolian Democratic Party and was arrested and then forced into hiding by the ruling party in Mongolia; furthermore calls on members of the Westminster Parliament to intervene on the family’s behalf in order to enable Aamer Anwar, the family’s lawyer in Scotland, to have access to their casework to ensure that they have been properly and fully represented; regrets that little Misheel, who was selected from hundreds of children in Liverpool to be crowned Liverpool’s Parade Princess on 10 July 2004, will now be unable to attend the parade due to detention and removal arrangements, and finally condemns the current system which treats people with such cold and heartless brutality and demands the immediate closure of Dungavel House, which stands on Scottish soil but lies outside the powers of the Parliament, making it Scotland’s very own Guantanamo Bay.
