 *S3M-755 Patrick Harvie: National Youth Work Week - All Different All Equal—That the Parliament notes that national Youth Work Week takes place from 1 to 8 November 2007 and that this year’s theme, "All Different All Equal", is based on the pan-European youth campaign, involving 42 countries, to reinforce the fight against racism, anti-Semitism, xenophobia and intolerance; further notes that the Scottish All Different All Equal steering group, made up of 12 organisations and chaired by YouthLink Scotland, is launching Youth Work Week at a conference and exhibition on 1 November at Hampden Park and that this provides both voluntary and statutory youth work organisations the opportunity to showcase their best practice across three themes of the campaign: participation, diversity and human rights, and congratulates the organisers of the conference for creating opportunities which enable youth workers and young people to participate in activities on issues around race, gender, disability and sexuality and to overcome barriers, therefore enabling youth workers and young peer leaders to be better equipped to engage with the diversity of Scotland’s young people. Supported by: Joe FitzPatrick*, Bill Kidd*, Ross Finnie*, Robert Brown*, Marlyn Glen*, Mike Pringle*
