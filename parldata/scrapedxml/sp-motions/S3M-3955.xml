 *S3M-3955 Marilyn Livingstone: Viewforth High School, Kirkcaldy—That the Parliament congratulates the contribution of Viewforth High School to educational services in the community; notes with concern reports of its fall to the bottom of a priority list in the School Estate Development Programme; recognises the urgent need for a replacement building following an audit by Fife Council five years ago confirming that the building was substandard for the role that it plays in providing education; considers that the delay in the planned timescale from 2011 to a building schedule of 2017-18 is unacceptable; acknowledges the concern among local politicians, community representatives, parents and pupils; calls on Fife Council to honour the SNP’s pledge to match the previous administration’s school building programme "brick for brick", and urges the Scottish Government to sort out urgently its public sector funding mechanisms to ensure that vital school buildings are delivered without delay.
