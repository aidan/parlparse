 *S3M-8132 Gil Paterson: 70th Anniversary of the Clydebank Blitz—That the Parliament recognises the 70th anniversary of the Clydebank Blitz and joins with the community of Clydebank in remembering all those who perished or who were adversely affected by the events of 13 and 14 March 1941; further recognises what it considers to have been the heroic efforts of the public services and volunteer organisations that responded from across Scotland and beyond to offer assistance, and puts on record its sincere thanks to the officers and crew of the Polish destroyer, ORP Piorun, who put themselves in harm’s way during the bombardment by drawing the fire of the enemy aircraft to them instead of the town and its people, an action that will never be forgotten by the community of Clydebank.
