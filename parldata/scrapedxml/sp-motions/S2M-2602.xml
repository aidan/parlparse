*S2M-2602# John Swinburne: Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease—That the Parliament notes with concern the preliminary recommendations of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) which, while recognising the effectiveness of three dementia drugs, donepezil, rivastigmine and galantamine, to many sufferers, recommends withdrawing these drugs on the grounds of cost to the NHS in England and Wales; endorses the call by Alzheimer Scotland that all patients with Alzheimer’s disease who are considered suitable by their doctors for these treatments should receive them until it can be shown that either they are not or are no longer benefiting, and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure that the NICE recommendations are not adopted by NHS Scotland to avoid a disastrous decision for the 62,000 sufferers of dementia in Scotland and their families.
