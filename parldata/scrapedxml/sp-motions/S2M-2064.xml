 *S2M-2064 Dr Jean Turner: Doctors’ Responsibility to the Public Sector—That the Parliament acknowledges that NHS Scotland has many problems, including the retention, recruitment and training of staff; notes that these may well be made worse if the private sector is called in to reduce waiting lists; further notes that the private sector does not train doctors and nurses and that the public is often outraged that sometimes patients can see the same doctor much sooner privately than they can in the public sector; considers that this situation is unacceptable in 21st century Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take immediate steps to address it. Supported by: Patrick Harvie*, Eleanor Scott*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, John Swinburne*, Mike Pringle*, Tommy Sheridan*
