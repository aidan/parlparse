*S1M-2787 Mr Gil Paterson: Stop Indecent Displays in Corner Shopsâ€”That the Parliament recognises that the public sale and display of pornographic material in our local stores, newsagents and garages is completely unacceptable; further recognises that pornography eroticises violence against women and children and desensitises the public to the meaning of violence towards women in real life, and calls on the Executive to ensure that the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982 is fully and effectively enforced and to review this legislation to ensure that it is adequate.
