*S3M-6310 Anne McLaughlin: On Your Bike, Mr Tebbitâ€”That the Parliament notes the recent comment by former British cabinet minister Norman Tebbit referring to "the welfare colonies in Glasgow"; condemns these remarks as both highly ignorant and prejudiced; regrets the damage believed done by the Thatcher administration, of which he was a member, to the economy of the West of Scotland; further considers that Norman Tebbit was Secretary of State for Employment and later Secretary of State for Trade and Industry during a period when Scottish heavy industry was systematically dismantled by the UK Government, and calls for Mr Tebbit to apologise to the people of Glasgow for what it considers to be insensitive and inaccurate comments.
