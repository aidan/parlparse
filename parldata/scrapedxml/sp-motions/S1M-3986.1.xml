 *S1M-3986.1 Roseanna Cunningham: Record of the Scottish Executiveâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-3986) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from "notes" to end and insert "regrets that four years of government by Labour and the Liberal Democrats in Scotland have failed to improve on the disastrous record of 18 years of Conservative rule; notes that since the Labour/Liberal Executive came to power, hospital waiting lists have grown longer, violent crime has risen, one in three children live in poverty and the economy has recorded the lowest level of growth anywhere in the European Union; recognises that a change of government is essential to reverse the decline in public services, and believes that only with the normal powers of an independent Parliament will Scotland be able to release its full potential."
