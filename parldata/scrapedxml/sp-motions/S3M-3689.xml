 *S3M-3689 Jamie Hepburn: ICO Seizes Covert Database of Construction Industry Workers—That the Parliament welcomes the investigation by the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) that uncovered a database containing information on 3,213 construction workers, which was used illicitly by over 40 construction companies to vet potential employees for records of industrial activism; notes that many of these companies are, or were, involved with PFI/PPP contracts; further notes that the practice of covertly processing personal information in this way is illegal under data protection law; considers that the Employment Relations Act 1999 enabled the UK Government to ban blacklisting but that this was not actively pursed on the grounds that there was no hard evidence that blacklisting was occurring, and therefore calls on the UK Government to carry out a full investigation into this incident. Supported by: Bill Wilson*, Sandra White*, John Wilson*, Patrick Harvie*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Bill Kidd*, Robin Harper* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
