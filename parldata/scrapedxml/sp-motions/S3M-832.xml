*S3M-832 Mike Rumbles: Free Central Heating Scheme—That the Parliament notes with concern the uncertain winter faced by many older people across Scotland who are currently waiting to have central heating installed under the Scottish Government’s free central heating scheme; considers the lengthy delays facing many old people, leading to the prospect of a winter without central heating or hot water, to be unacceptable; believes that the £3,500 cap on the scheme, which has led to older people in rural areas only being given the option of an electric system which is expensive to run, should be lifted, and further believes that the Scottish Government should take urgent action to ensure that older people in Scotland receive their new central heating systems as quickly as possible. Supported by: Hugh O’Donnell*, Jim Hume*, Ken Macintosh*, Ross Finnie*, Jim Tolson*
