*S3M-569 Sandra White: Sikh Rights in Ireland—That the Parliament expresses disappointment at the recent Irish Government backing for the An Guarda Siochana, the Irish police force, ruling stating that a trainee Sikh police officer would not be given permission to wear his turban on duty; acknowledges the fact that the turban is a mandatory article of the Sikh faith and that this ruling effectively excludes the whole Sikh community from joining the An Guarda Siochana; believes that this position is directly opposed to comments by the Minister for Integration in his inaugural speech in July 2007 that "I’m open to all of your ideas and all of your contributions, because when I look down through this room today I see the citizens for the future. I see the tax payers of the future. I see the people who are going to bring Ireland into a new and very much brighter century, a century that will be more affluent, more open, more tolerant than the one that I was born into here in Ireland" and Ireland’s own social blueprint for the future, Towards 2016, Ten-Year Framework Social Partnership Agreement 2006-2015, which states as one of its main aims for the future that "Every person, irrespective of background or gender, would enjoy equality of opportunity and freedom from discrimination", and expresses the hope that through due process this decision will be overturned.
