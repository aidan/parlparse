 *S2M-1938# Carolyn Leckie: Solidarity with the PCS—That the Parliament shares the concern and anger of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union about Her Majesty’s Government’s plans to cut civil service jobs by over 100,000 and the Scottish Executive’s compliance with them, decimating services to the most vulnerable people in society at the same time; recognises that this is the biggest concerted attack on workers and trade unions since Margaret Thatcher waged war on the miners; notes that the Government and opposition in Westminster participated in an obscene bidding war by boasting about the number of job cuts they would achieve; recognises that job centres and benefits agencies and other services are to be centralised and made less accessible to those who most need them such as pensioners, the sick, disabled people, families and the poor; congratulates the members of the PCS union for taking a stand against such callousness and sends support and solidarity to the strikers on 5 November 2004, and encourages MSPs and the wider public to show their support by visiting picket lines and attending the rally at the Pavilion Theatre in Glasgow at 12 noon on Friday.
