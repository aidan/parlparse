 *S1M-2492.1 Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh: Social Justice—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2492) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the information to date which shows that the Scottish Executive still has a long way to go to meet its own objectives against the targets and milestones it set itself on social justice; affirms its commitment to building a civic society based on opportunity and responsibility for all, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to address the problems of crime in Scotland’s communities and devolve power to individuals, families and communities as an essential step on the road to achieving social justice."
