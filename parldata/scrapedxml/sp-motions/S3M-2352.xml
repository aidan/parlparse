 *S3M-2352 Richard Baker: In Memory of Graham Tranâ€”That the Parliament mourns the passing of trade union official, Graham Tran, at the age of 47; celebrates his determined approach to representing trade union members, initially as a lay union official in the Ministry of Defence and latterly as a full-time official of Unite the Union; recognises the significant progress that he made on health and safety issues on behalf of offshore workers and in particular his efforts to secure paid holidays in the oil and gas sector; acknowledges the hard work, dedication and energy he applied when representing workers, and hopes that a fitting tribute can be established in memory of Graham in the near future.
