 * S2M-2327 Carolyn Leckie:Avoid Compromising the Smoking Bill—That the Parliament supports a ban on smoking in public places; believes that this would be a positive pro-health measure, albeit limited, in the context of poverty-related ill-health; is concerned, however, that the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Bill, as introduced by the Scottish Executive, undermines the chance of a ban being introduced by including other controversial measures within the Bill such as further marketisation of health care and intellectual property and the plans for expansion of the authority to deem adults incapable of making informed decisions about their health needs or care; considers that these measures should not be introduced under the cover of such a high profile debate as the smoking ban and that they should have individual scrutiny as measures in themselves, and believes that, unless the Executive removes these sections from the Bill, the very laudable public health measure that is the smoking ban would be seriously compromised and risk defeat.
