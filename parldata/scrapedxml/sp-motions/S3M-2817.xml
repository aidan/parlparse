*S3M-2817♦ Marlyn Glen: World AIDS Day 2008—That the Parliament recognises the importance of World AIDS Day on 1 December 2008 and its aim of highlighting the challenges and consequences of the HIV epidemic around the world; acknowledges that there are 33 million people living with HIV/AIDS worldwide and that countries face a myriad challenges in halting the spread of the virus and improving the lives and experiences of people affected; recognises that HIV diagnoses in Scotland have been increasing in recent years with 2007 seeing the highest annual number on record; acknowledges that it is estimated that there are 5,500 people now living with HIV in Scotland; regrets that a recent poll found that people in Scotland had comparatively poorer rates of HIV knowledge than in other areas of the United Kingdom; considers that this lack of public understanding about the virus and how it is transmitted compounds and exacerbates the stigma and prejudice experienced by many people living with HIV in Scotland, and therefore supports this year’s theme of Respect and Protect, which highlights the responsibility of everyone to transform attitudes to HIV and encourage actions that stop its spread.
