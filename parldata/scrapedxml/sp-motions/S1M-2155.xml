 *S1M-2155 Andrew Wilson: Efficiency of Transport Divisions of the Scottish Executive Development Department-That the Parliament is deeply concerned by the series of errors, fiascos and poor policy making and administration within the transport divisions of the Scottish Executive Development Department and is concerned that the current Erskine Bridge tolls fiasco, with the resultant disruption to the Parliament's business programme, has followed on from the major problems in the award of the trunk road maintenance contract, chaos in their policy on road tolling and a general perception that the transport divisions are in a mess; is further concerned that the same divisions which have handled transport policy and implementation so badly cannot be trusted in their current form to handle the forthcoming tendering process for Scotland's Cal-Mac ferry routes in an effective and efficient manner, and therefore calls on the Minister for Transport to take control of her divisions and bring forward a comprehensive and independent review of their structure and function with a view to proposing the necessary reforms required to improve their work.
