 *S3M-5179 Alison McInnes: The Isle of Islay—That the Parliament, while welcoming the decision by Caledonian Maritime Assets Ltd (CMAL) to hold a ballot on the name of the new ferry that is currently being built to serve Islay, notes the wishes of many islanders that, in line with the longstanding Caledonian MacBrayne tradition of naming a ferry after the island that it was built to serve, the ferry should be named the Isle of Islay in English and Eilean Ile in Gaelic and calls on CMAL to add this option to its ballot.
