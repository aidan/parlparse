*S1M-1751 Jackie Baillie: Credit Unionsâ€”That the Parliament recognises that credit unions are a valuable provider of low cost financial services and an important way of tackling financial exclusion; welcomes the Action Plan for the credit union movement in Scotland, and supports its implementation and the objective of building a vibrant self-sustaining credit union movement in Scotland, accessible to all, with credit unions as broad based, community-owned financial institutions operating in a sound commercial manner but based on the principles of mutuality and economic justice. Supported by: Ms Margaret Curran*
