*S3M-4883 Tricia Marwick: 200th Anniversary of Tullis Russell—That the Parliament congratulates Tullis Russell Papermakers on its 200th anniversary; considers that, as a major employer in the Glenrothes area, the company plays a key role in shaping the local economy; recognises Tullis Russell’s ongoing commitment to the environment through its proposals to construct a new biomass plant that will reduce its carbon emissions by around 250,000 tonnes each year; congratulates the company on securing £497,000 as part of the Scottish Government’s Climate Challenge Fund to help construct its new Eco-Interpretation Centre, and believes that this is fitting tribute to Tullis Russell as it celebrates its 200th anniversary. Supported by: Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Rob Gibson*, Alasdair Allan*, Sandra White*, Jackie Baillie*, Aileen Campbell*
