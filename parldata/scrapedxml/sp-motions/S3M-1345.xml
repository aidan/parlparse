 *S3M-1345 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Smart Meters Pilot Project—That the Parliament welcomes the installation of Scotland’s first smart meters by Scottish Hydro Electric as part of its long-term energy reduction trial; notes that smart meters provide customers with real-time information about the energy that they are using, how much it is costing, and the impact that it has on the environment; further notes that the installation of smart meters across the country could significantly reduce household consumption, cut carbon emissions and help to alleviate for thousands of households the financial impact of rising fuel prices, and calls on the UK Government to amend the Energy Bill to ensure the roll-out of smart meters to every household in Scotland over the next ten years.
