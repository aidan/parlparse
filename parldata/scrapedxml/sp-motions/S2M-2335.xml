 * S2M-2335# Dr Elaine Murray:Rise of Drugs Misuse in South West Scotland—That the Parliament notes with concern the significant rise in drugs misuse in parts of south-west Scotland at a time when national figures are declining; notes that drugs misuse in Dumfries and Galloway rose by 52% between 2000 and 2003 according to the recent study by the Centre for Drugs Misuse Research and the Scottish Centre for Infection and Environmental Health; notes that one person in 40 misuses drugs in Dumfries and Galloway and that this is the fourth highest rate in Scotland, and believes that drugs services in Dumfries and Galloway, along with other areas which have shown a significant increase in drugs misuse over the period of the study, should be subject to an independent external audit, as announced by the Scottish Executive in its Review of Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation Services, in order to assess whether drugs services in Dumfries and Galloway are appropriate, accessible and adequately funded.
