*S2M-3625 Carolyn Leckie: Stop Violence Against Women - Support Amnesty International—That the Parliament congratulates Amnesty International on its Stop Violence Against Women campaign and its latest initiative, “16 days of Activism to Stop Violence Against Women”; regrets, however, that such campaigns are still necessary and is particularly concerned that recent attitude surveys reflect that an unacceptably large proportion of the population blame women for rapes perpetrated by men; is further concerned that conviction rates for rape have decreased and that those rapes that end up in court are a tiny proportion of rapes actually committed; believes and affirms that rape is a brutal expression of power over, and violence against, women, that it is always the responsibility of the perpetrator and never the victim, that the media contribute to a climate where sexist and misogynist attitudes to women are given credence, and further believes that fundamental attitudinal change must be achieved throughout the criminal justice system for women to have the confidence to report and pursue rape allegations and that the Parliament has the responsibility to lead that attitudinal change in the criminal justice system and wider society.
