*S1M-3285 Brian Adam: "Ditch the Dirt" Campaign—That the Parliament congratulates the Aberdeen Evening Express for launching its "Ditch the Dirt" campaign, which aims to change the attitudes of irresponsible dog owners who do not clean up their dog’s mess, and calls for a change in legislation to allow for on-the-spot fines for those people that refuse to clean up after their dogs.
