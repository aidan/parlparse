*S1M-2553 Dorothy-Grace Elder: First Aid in Schoolsâ€”That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to make basic first aid a compulsory part of the school curriculum, as it is in several other European countries; believes that secondary school pupils could be a major new force in life saving and recognises that even two hours training in a lifetime has led to lives being saved; agrees with the ambulance service that lives are being wasted because of a lack of rudimentary first aid in the first few minutes after cardiac arrest; cites the splendid example of a 17 year-old first aider, Scott Gavin of Holyrood RC Secondary School in Glasgow, who rushed to the aid of a maths teacher, Brian Innes, when he collapsed during a lesson and kept him alive until an ambulance arrived, and applauds all voluntary training offered by the Red Cross and youth organisations while believing that a national programme instilling skill and confidence in every secondary pupil in the country is needed and that this could be accomplished with minimal time and expense.
