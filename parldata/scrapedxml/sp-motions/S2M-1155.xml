*S2M-1155 David Mundell: Launch of the Gretna-Lockerbie-Annan Economic Regeneration Prospectus-That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the prospectus published by the Corridor Regeneration Strategy Steering Group outlining key objectives and a number of themes to stimulate economic growth in Gretna, Lockerbie and Annan to address the impact on the area of the cessation of power production at Chapelcross in March 2005; notes that the regeneration strategy, with its four principle themes of wealth, diversity, inspiration and inclusion, recognises not only the challenges that the Gretna-Lockerbie-Annan corridor now faces, but also the opportunities to be seized; congratulates the steering group on its genuine joined-up and cross-party working to date, and looks to the Scottish Executive to provide all the support it can to the steering group's work and to the regeneration of the Gretna-Lockerbie-Annan corridor.
