*S3M-2298 Jim Tolson: HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales Contracts Signed—That the Parliament welcomes the news that the main manufacturing contracts for the two super aircraft carriers have been signed; notes that the final commissioning of these massive 65,000 tonne ships will be conducted at Rosyth Dockyard in Fife; believes that this is recognition of the excellent skills of the workforce at Babcock; calls on the Scottish and UK governments to maximise the opportunity that this presents for local businesses and local people through skills development, sub-contracting and other means, and further calls on the two governments to ensure the effects of this construction project are felt long after the two carriers sail under the Forth Bridge.
