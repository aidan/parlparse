*S2M-5153 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Investigation of Sri Lankan Murders—That the Parliament condemns the murder on 10 November 2006 in Colombo, Sri Lanka, of the prominent Tamil MP, Nadarajah Raviraj and of one of his bodyguards; notes that the day before his assassination Mr Raviraj had been on a protest against an attack on a refugee camp on 8 November in which 45 Tamil civilians were killed and 60 were badly injured by the Sri Lankan forces; recognises that Nadarajah was a leading member of the United Socialist Party (CWI, Sri Lanka) whose Secretary, Siritunga Jayasuriya, has himself received frequent death threats; understands that, since the recent Geneva peace talks broke up without agreement and the three-year-old ceasefire broke down, the civil war in Sri Lanka continues, having so far cost more than 60,000 lives, and is draining the country’s economy and that a block on the supply route from the south means that the Tamil population in the north is starving; notes this ongoing humanitarian disaster and the failure of the Sri Lankan government to take action to prevent further suffering among its people and its own involvement in killings, abductions and disappearances, and calls for a totally independent international investigation into these actions to be undertaken immediately.
