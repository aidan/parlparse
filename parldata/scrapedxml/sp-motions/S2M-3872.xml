 S2M-3872 Janis Hughes: Local Government Pension Schemeâ€”That the Parliament is concerned with the recent decision to abolish the Rule of 85 for members of the Local Government Pension Scheme (LGPS) in Scotland; recognises that this will have a detrimental impact on the many public sector workers to whom membership of the LGPS is open, including local government staff, police support staff, higher and further education staff and staff within the community and voluntary sector; notes that such a decision means that LGPS members are denied the same rights and protections as members of other public sector pension schemes which have agreed to allow retirement at the age of 60 on a full pension; recognises that members of the LGPS contribute to the scheme and want to ensure that there is a viable and sustainable future for it; notes that the correct manner for dealing with changes to the LGPS, or any disagreement on legal opinion in respect of it, is through open and fair discussion with staff and their trade unions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to initiate urgent discussions with COSLA and the relevant trade unions to achieve a solution agreeable to all. Supported by: Mr Charlie Gordon, Marilyn Livingstone, Margaret Jamieson, Mr Frank McAveety, Kate Maclean, Jackie Baillie, Karen Gillon, Dr Elaine Murray
