 *S2M-606# Carolyn Leckie: Scotland's Football Victory-That the Parliament congratulates the national Scotland football team for a stunning victory against the Netherlands in the first leg of the UEFA Euro 2004 play off and sends warmest wishes and encouragement for the second leg; regrets that the game was not available on terrestrial TV; is concerned at the monopoly of TV coverage by satellite television; believes that all Scots should be able to access national games where they choose; is concerned that women, who bear the greatest responsibility for childcare, will be less able to go to a public house and therefore less likely to be able to see these games, and believes that the Scottish Executive should intervene to try to secure universal coverage of all future Scotland games so that all of Scotland can be united in cheering the team on.
