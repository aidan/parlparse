*S3M-101 Jeremy Purvis: Planning for Further Extensions to the Route of the Borders Railway—That the Parliament reaffirms its support for the construction of the Borders railway; recalls the support of the Parliament to restore the rail line as a dual and single track rail line from Edinburgh Waverley to Tweedbank with stations in Midlothian and the Borders; further recalls the funding commitment of the Scottish Executive in 2005 which has been reaffirmed; welcomes the transfer of the delivery of the project from the Waverley Railway Partnership to Transport Scotland; believes that the scheme is enhanced by the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link; is concerned that the SNP in the south of Scotland has stated that the rail project is under threat if the Edinburgh Airport Rail Link scheme approved by the Parliament proceeds, and believes that the Executive should, without delay, build the Borders railway and start planning the further extensions to the route to Hawick and subsequently beyond.
