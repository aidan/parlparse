*S2M-1200 Pauline McNeill: 10th Anniversary of Democracy in South Africa-That the Parliament congratulates the South African people and government on the 10th anniversary of a democratic South Africa; notes that, despite the threats and predictions of some, South Africa's transition from apartheid to democracy was achieved with a minimum of bloodshed; believes that this owes much to the political maturity and leadership of the liberation movement and the strength, understanding and patience of the people; further believes that the rainbow nation has become a beacon against racism for the world; specifically congratulates the South African people and government on considerable achievements since the overthrow of apartheid, including (a) water - during 2004 the 10 millionth connection to clean water over the past decade will be made, (b) sanitation - in 1994 some 22 million people had no access to clean water, today it is down to 18 million, (c) housing - 1.6 million new houses built since 1994, (d) electricity - in 1994 some 60% of South Africa's population had no access to electricity, now more than 70% have access and (e) education - in 1994 a divisive education system provided secondary education for 70%, now an integrated system covers 85%; acknowledges the terrible legacy of colonialism and apartheid which remains a huge challenge; shares the grave concern over the HIV/AIDs pandemic and the huge cost in suffering to the people of South Africa; pledges continuing solidarity in the struggle to overcome the legacy of colonialism and apartheid, especially given Britain's responsibilities; congratulates ACTSA Scotland (Action for Southern Africa, the successor to the Anti-Apartheid Movement) for the part it played in the South African people's liberation from apartheid and its continuing role to develop links and facilitate solidarity with the people of South Africa; welcomes the joint activity by Scottish and South African organisations, including local authorities, trade unions, students and churches, to build mutually beneficial contacts and activities in various spheres, including those of economic, cultural, educational and sporting activity, and considers that MSPs, the Scottish Parliament and Scottish Ministers should assist in the facilitation of these links with the people and government of South Africa.
