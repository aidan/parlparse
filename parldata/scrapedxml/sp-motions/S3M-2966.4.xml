*S3M-2966.4 Robin Harper: Sea Fisheries—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2966) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end "; acknowledges that, while progress has been made in moving to more sustainable practices, these are still at a very early stage and much more work is required; understands that the scale of damage to our marine ecosystems leaves no room for any level of complacency whatsoever; recognises the huge challenges that face European fisheries ministers as they negotiate this year’s round of fisheries talks, especially given that most of the world’s fish stocks, including those in European waters, are low-to-endangered; believes, therefore, that it is important to undertake a suite of measures to prevent discards, such as encouraging greater use of selective fishing gear, banning of the most destructive fishing technologies, greater coverage of onboard observers, and the temporary closure of fishing grounds to prevent the capture of juvenile or spawning fish, especially to support cod recovery, no-take zones and days in port, and believes that it is important to negotiate a deal that is fair, profitable and sustainable for all of Europe’s fisheries in order to restore all European marine ecosystems and secure sustainable fisheries for the foreseeable future."
