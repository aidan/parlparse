 S3M-5331♦ Sarah Boyack: National Eligibility Criteria for Adult Social Care—That the Parliament notes with concern the contents of the draft guidelines, National Eligibility for Adult Social Care and Waiting Times for Personal and Nursing Care, which it considers will have an adverse impact on preventative services for disabled adults; notes the problems that have been experienced by disabled adults in accessing support services in Edinburgh; is concerned that the guidelines are based on the current working practices of many local authorities across Scotland, which were themselves based on the UK Government’s Fair Access to Care Services; notes that Fair Access to Care Services was originally devised to decide the eligibility for support of older people with progressive age-related incapacity and loss of independence and not for disabled adults for whom it considers access to care is about the right to independence, and believes that the needs of adults requiring social care would be better served if there was guidance on free personal and nursing care and new guidance dealing with the community care services provided under different legislation.
