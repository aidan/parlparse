*S1M-2915 Brian Adam: Removal of Chewing Gum from our Streets—That the Parliament notes that Aberdeen City Council estimates that clearing discarded chewing gum from Union Street and its environs will cost £100,000; further notes that the problem could cost as much as £150 million per annum in the United Kingdom, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government to consider introducing a levy on chewing gum manufacturers, the proceeds of which should then be redistributed in full to local authorities in order to help them deal with the massive and costly problem of removing gum from our streets and pavements.
