 *S3M-5677 Cathy Peattie: Civil Service Compensation Scheme—That the Parliament recognises the essential work done by civil servants across all Scottish and UK government departments; considers that without the dedication and professionalism of civil servants Government would be unable to function effectively; therefore expresses deep concern at proposed changes to the Civil Service Compensation Scheme, published by the Cabinet Office, that would leave many civil servants worse off in the event of voluntary or compulsory redundancy; is concerned that such a change could lead to civil servants losing over 50% of their redundancy entitlement; believes that the UK and Scottish governments should be looking, during these difficult times, to protect those who have given loyal service over a large number of years, and urges the UK Government to re-examine these proposals urgently before they are implemented.
