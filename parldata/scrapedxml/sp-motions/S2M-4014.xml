*S2M-4014 Frances Curran: Scottish Gas Laughing All the Way to the Bank—That the Parliament acknowledges that Scottish Gas shareholders and directors will be laughing all the way to the bank after announcing an operating profit of £1.5 billion, up 11% on the previous year, yet they have increased gas prices by 22%, plunging another 120,000 people in Scotland into fuel poverty and believes that this type of exploitation of a natural resource and of ordinary gas users merely reinforces the view that utility companies, such as Scottish Gas, should not be run for the huge individual wealth of a few, but should be publicly owned to the benefit of the many and to ensure public accountability when it comes to how much we pay to turn our fires on.
