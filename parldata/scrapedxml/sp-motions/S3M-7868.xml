*S3M-7868 Mary Scanlon: The Scottish Football Reminiscence Project—That the Parliament welcomes the progress made by the Scottish Football Reminiscence Project; notes that this project aims to provide reminiscence therapy to people with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia; further notes that this arose after Michael White, Falkirk Football Club’s historian, discovered that talking through old football photos and programmes acted as a potent trigger for fans; notes that Aberdeen FC and the Hibernian historical trust assist with this project in north-east Scotland and in Edinburgh; welcomes that these stimuli have opened up discussions about players and games with patients and have greatly reduced levels of anger and frustration in the men and women taking part; further notes that Glasgow Caledonian University provided an academic evaluation of the project’s usefulness and concluded that "This kind of reminiscence work could make a major impact" and that, in each instance, memorabilia are catered very specifically toward the individual with everyone attending these reminiscence meetings having their own memory pack that incorporates old programmes, photos and match reports related to their specific team; considers that any initiative that helps those with degenerative illnesses to be a welcome advance for patients and their friends and families, and recognises the scale of the problem, given that there are 72,000 people with dementia in Scotland and around 7,000 people are diagnosed with the illness every year.
