 *S3M-5876 John Park: Plugged-in to Ultra-low-carbon Vehicles—That the Parliament welcomes the UK Government’s action to boost the UK’s low-carbon supply chain by introducing its £230 million ultra-low-carbon vehicle incentive programme and in particular measures that offer UK consumers a discount of up to £5,000 off the cost of environmentally friendly vehicles, including electric and plug-in hybrid cars; further welcomes the UK Government’s announcement of a £30 million fund for a network of plugged-in places, a network of electric vehicle hubs, that will see battery charging infrastructure appearing in car parks, major supermarkets, leisure centres, retail centres and on streets; recognises the crucial role more environmentally friendly vehicles could play in bringing down the UK’s carbon emissions and the importance of early market creation and adequate infrastructure provision for such vehicles, and applauds the hard work of organisations such as Europe’s largest independent lithium-ion battery systems supplier, Axeon, in pioneering research and development to significantly improve the commercial viability of electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles.
