*S2M-1063 Robin Harper: Measuring Quality of Life-That the Parliament acknowledges and agrees with the position of the New Economics Foundation report, Chasing Progress - beyond measuring economic growth, that the growth and consumption represented by gross domestic product does not give a true picture of quality of life and fails to deliver the Scottish Executive's own sustainable development targets; recognises that economic growth is not a good indicator of human progress and well-being; further recognises that present rates of economic growth are leading to unacceptable environmental risks, failing to guarantee social progress and do not make the population any happier, and calls on the Executive to introduce new social and environmental indicators such as environmental footprinting and the new measure of domestic progress as baselines to measure the overall performance of all its policies. Supported by: Mark Ballard*, Shiona Baird*, Eleanor Scott*, Patrick Harvie*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Tommy Sheridan*, Richard Lochhead*, Mr Mark Ruskell*
