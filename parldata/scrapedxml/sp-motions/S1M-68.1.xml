*S1M-68.1 Mr John Swinney: As an amendment to the motion (S1M-68) in the name of Henry McLeish leave out from "is falling" to end and insert:-- "remains a grave and ongoing economic and social problem which is not addressed by a partial representation of statistics; and calls on the Executive to develop an economic strategy that has long term sustainable growth in the economy and jobs as its focus and addresses the need to: recognise small businesses as the engine of growth in the economy and the labour market and tackles the need to improve entrepreneurship and business start-up, survival and expansion with particular emphasis on reducing business rates; develop cohesive economic development structures through greater synergy between agencies involved in economic development, inward investment, exporting and tourism and to gain maximum benefit from Scotland’s external representation; produce compelling evidence that the New Deal is delivering long-term structural change in the labour market that will be sustained when the New Deal programme has concluded, and generate competitive advantage for companies in Scotland." Supported by : Fergus Ewing, Mr Duncan Hamilton, Alex Neil, Ms Sandra White.
