*S3M-2710♦ Christine Grahame: Homecoming of Mary Queen of Scots—That the Parliament acknowledges the calls by campaigners to return the remains of Mary Queen of Scots to the country of her birth; recognises that Mary was an iconic historical figure in Scotland and that her return would help educate many Scots, from the north most to the south of Scotland, about this period of our nation’s history; notes the support that campaigners have had from the Catholic Church in Scotland; further notes that Falkland Palace, in which many contemporary chroniclers believed the Scots Queen spent her happiest days, was a place of sanctuary for Mary, and nominates this Fife palace as a possible location where her remains could be interned.
