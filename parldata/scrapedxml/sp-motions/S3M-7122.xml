*S3M-7122 Stuart McMillan: Alcohol Awareness Week 2010—That the Parliament supports Alcohol Awareness Week, which is scheduled to run from 4 to 10 October 2010; notes that Alcohol Awareness Week is an initiative that brings together the Scottish Government, the alcohol industry, health professionals and the voluntary sector to promote a joined-up message about drinking alcohol responsibly; further notes that this is Scotland’s fourth Alcohol Awareness Week and that it includes a joint programme of events designed to provide useful information about responsible drinking; acknowledges the efforts of the Scottish Government to tackle alcohol misuse through introducing the Alcohol etc. (Scotland) Bill, and strongly urges all politicians to support the bill when it is debated in the Scottish Parliament at Stage 3 and back the raft of measures that the Scottish Government wishes to introduce, including a 45p minimum unit price on alcohol, to tackle what is considered to be the scourge of alcohol misuse on society. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Christina McKelvie*, Bob Doris*, Stewart Maxwell*
