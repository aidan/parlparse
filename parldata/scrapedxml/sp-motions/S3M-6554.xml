*S3M-6554 Cathy Peattie: Big Fit Walk—That the Parliament congratulates the Big Fit Walk project on the success of its seventh annual walk on 11 June 2010; notes that the first Big Fit Walk was held in June 2004 in Grangemouth and involved over 3,000 people and that the walks have attracted more walkers each year, with over 12,000 people registering this year, and believes that the Big Fit Walk and similar initiatives are a vital part of the strategy to encourage participation and to highlight the health, environmental and economic benefits of active travel.
