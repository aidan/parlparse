*S2M-2398.1 Murdo Fraser: Tory Comments—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2398) in the name of Christine Grahame, leave out from "condemns" to end and insert "welcomes the comments of Dominic Grieve, the Conservative Shadow Attorney General, who stated on "Good Morning Scotland" on Monday 7 February 2005 that "The problem in Scotland has absolutely nothing to do with immigration levels. I am afraid it is do with the fact that Scotland is not a very attractive place for people to come and settle. That is due to the fact that you have a bloated public sector and Scotland generally has suffered economically as a result. That is not going to change and even if we were to allow unlimited immigration, immigrants will still be going to settle in the south-east of England until Scotland gets its economic act together"; further welcomes his comments in The Scotsman on Thursday 10 February 2005 that "The fact that Scotland can offer a high quality of life makes it all the more frustrating that it should suffer population loss"; understands that his comments on "Good Morning Scotland" were specifically referring to the state of the Scottish economy and condemns Labour and SNP politicians for deliberately quoting these comments out of context; notes that estimates of migration to UK regions in 2001 show that a mere 4% of immigrants chose to settle in Scotland, compared with 41.5% in London; further notes that, according to the Registrar General, Scotland experiences a net loss of people aged 16 to 34 to the rest of the United Kingdom, and concludes that, in light of the fact that Scotland was ranked 10 places behind the United Kingdom in the IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook for the "extent to which government policies are conducive to competitiveness", the economic policies pursued by the Scottish Executive are responsible for Scotland’s low levels of immigration."
