*S3M-915 Murdo Fraser: Home Nations Football Championship 2008—That the Parliament recognises the outstanding achievements by the Scottish national football team in its qualifying campaign for Euro 2008; welcomes the massive national support that the country has given to the team throughout the campaign and believes that Scottish fans have proved themselves to be the best in the world; notes that unfortunately no team from the United Kingdom qualified for Euro 2008 in Austria and Switzerland and therefore supports the creation of a home nations tournament to take place in summer 2008, consisting of Scotland, England, Northern Ireland and Wales, and believes that such a tournament would unite the home nations and allow fans to watch their nations compete on an international stage.
