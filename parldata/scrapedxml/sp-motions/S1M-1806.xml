 *S1M-1806 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Humane Slaughter—That the Parliament believes that in the present slaughter of sheep and cattle any lapses in humane methods of killing should be investigated immediately, that veterinarians should be present throughout every killing and that any instances of inhumane slaughter and animals being left to die be cracked down on hard; accepts the distress not only of farming community but of Scottish children, some of whom have told parliamentarians of nightmares over fears that not all animals may be being killed humanely, and realises that we have a duty not only to animal welfare but to truthful reassurance to a generation of children exposed through necessary publicity to an uniquely appalling scale of national catastrophe.
