*S1M-596 Mr Adam Ingram: Change in Benefit Payments- Effects on Post Offices—That the Parliament notes that large sections of Scottish society do not have access to bank accounts, and cannot obtain bank accounts; further notes that, in rural Scotland, many people do not live near a bank; believes therefore that current government proposals to switch payments of benefits directly to bank accounts will be detrimental to the Executive’s aim of minimising social exclusion; believes that the resulting shift of business from post offices will result in the closure of many post offices, especially in areas already suffering from a lack of public services, including rural areas and areas of urban deprivation, and therefore calls for recognition of the fact that for many, collection of benefits at the post office is the most convenient, or indeed the only option and demands that post offices be fully compensated for the loss of this work in order to secure the long term economic viability of the existing post office network.
