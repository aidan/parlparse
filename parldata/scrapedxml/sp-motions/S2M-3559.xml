*S2M-3559u Mr Ted Brocklebank: A Full Discussion on CFP Withdrawal—That the Parliament notes the increasingly precarious state of the Scottish fishing industry, an industry so important to many communities in Fife, as well as the north east and the Highlands and Islands, and the need for full and open discussion on how to deliver a sustainable future for Scottish fisheries; recognises that withdrawal from the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) is an option now supported by virtually all sectors of Scotland’s fishing industry; considers that the Scottish Executive should investigate the costs and consequences of the United Kingdom initiating such a withdrawal, and believes that the Executive should include withdrawal from the CFP as an option in all further fisheries management discussions and investigations, ensuring the fullest opportunity for debating and scrutinising this alternative.
