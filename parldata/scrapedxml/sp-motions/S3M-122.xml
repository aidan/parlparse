*S3M-122 Jackie Baillie: Cutty Sark—That the Parliament recognises the historical importance of the Cutty Sark and its maritime heritage with Scotland; notes that the ship was designed by Hercules Linton of the Dumbarton firm, Scott and Linton, and was completed by William Denny; further notes that it was launched on 22 November 1869 on the River Leven in Dumbarton; considers the Cutty Sark to be the most famous ship in the world as the sole surviving extreme clipper and the only tea clipper still in existence; acknowledges that the Cutty Sark is a memorial to the men of the merchant navy and, in particular, those who gave their lives during the world wars for their country; deeply regrets the fire which destroyed much of the ship, and supports the efforts of the Cutty Sark Trust so that the ship is restored to its former glory.
