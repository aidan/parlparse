*S3M-7671 Cathy Peattie: Kinneil and the 275th Anniversary of the Birth of James Watt—That the Parliament notes that 19 January 2011 is the 275th anniversary of the birth of James Watt; considers James Watt a brilliant Scottish engineer who stands among the greatest figures of industrial history and that his life has numerous parallels for science, education and industry in the 21st century; recognises his pioneering work in developing the steam engine with Dr John Roebuck at Kinneil House in Bo’ness; welcomes the Bank of England’s intention to issue a new £50 banknote featuring James Watt; believes that there should be an initiative to bring together all those organisations in Scotland with an interest in Watt’s legacy to find additional ways to commemorate his contribution to the modern world, including the restoration of his workshop at Kinneil, and encourages Falkirk Council, Historic Scotland and other interested parties to continue exploring the potential for producing at the earliest opportunity a strategic plan for the recreation as a visitor attraction of Kinneil House, estate and foreshore, which it considers to be of enormous undeveloped potential, given what it sees as their extraordinary and unique combination of Scottish and world heritage assets, including Roman, architectural, landscape, wildlife, industrial, historical, artistic and recreational elements.
