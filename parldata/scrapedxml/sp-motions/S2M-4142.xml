*S2M-4142 Colin Fox: Labour’s "Loans for Lordships" Scandal—That the Parliament condemns attempts to bypass rules laid down by the Electoral Commission on the funding of political parties; notes that the Labour Party received £14 million in loans from wealthy industrialists, many of whom subsequently received peerages, and failed to declare them to the Electoral Commission; notes that the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, kept from the Lords Appointment Scrutiny Committee that three of his 2006 nominees for peerages had recently lent Labour millions of pounds; believes that Labour acted to circumvent the Electoral Commission rules which demand the full disclosure of monies received in this way; notes that the Labour Party Treasurer has accused Downing Street of treating both elected party officials and the Electoral Commission with contempt; notes that the Lords Appointment Commission has now written to Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democratic Party leaders demanding that they disclose the identity of all nominees for a peerage who have loaned money; believes that the Electoral Commission must immediately ensure that the rules governing the monies raised by Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat parties are reviewed and tightened to ensure far greater clarity and accountability, and believes that such financial "sleaze" which did untold damage to the Tories in the past shows New Labour to be no different now.
