*S2M-895# Fiona Hyslop: Missing Link Completion and Upgrade of the A801 Avon Gorge Road-That the Parliament acknowledges the tireless campaigning efforts over many decades by local communities and individuals of Westfield and Avonbridge to bring about the much-needed upgrading of the A801 Avon Gorge road; notes with concern the significant number of deaths and accidents on the road over the years; recognises that the road is a key link between the M8 and M9 in the very centre of Scotland and that completion of the missing link part of the road would allow safe and more environmentally responsible north-south transportation in Scotland, avoiding one of the most severe gradients, of approximately 1 in 6, of any road in Scotland and so eliminating the 40 miles currently taken by many heavy goods lorries from Whitburn to Grangemouth via Newbridge, and believes that the Scottish Executive should recognise the important national strategic importance of improving this road in considering its decision in relation to planning and should acknowledge its responsibility to help complete and upgrade the road in terms of support for funding to West Lothian and Falkirk councils.
