 *S1M-3686 Brian Adam: Aberdeen Council Housing Debt—That the Parliament recognises the relatively low level of local authority housing debt in Aberdeen and demands that the Scottish Executive, rather than punishing Aberdeen tenants for deciding to stay under local authority control, take all necessary steps to write off this debt, just as it did with Glasgow’s local authority housing debt after the vote for the Executive’s preferred stock transfer scheme.
