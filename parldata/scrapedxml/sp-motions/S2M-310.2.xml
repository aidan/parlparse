*S2M-310.2 Richard Lochhead: Strategic Framework for Aquaculture-As an amendment to motion (S2M-310) in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from first "welcomes" to end and insert "expresses support for sustainable aquaculture and recognises the sector's vital economic contribution to Scotland; urges the industry to strive continually to achieve the highest environmental standards and welcomes progress already made; believes that the regulatory framework must be guided by well-resourced science; further believes that lessons must be learnt from other countries on the streamlining and simplification of the regulatory framework and is disappointed that this is one of many issues that the strategy fails to address adequately; calls for the powers currently exercised by the Crown Estate to be transferred to the Parliament, and further calls for the early introduction of legislation transferring planning control to local authorities in order to enhance openness and accountability to ensure that local communities have a say over the siting of fish farms.
