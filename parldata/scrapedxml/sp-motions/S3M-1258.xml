*S3M-1258 Rhona Brankin: Education—That the Parliament recognises the importance of high-quality school buildings to young people’s learning; notes the SNP’s commitment to match the previous administration’s school building programme "brick for brick"; further notes that the previous administration built 200 schools between 2003 and 2007; condemns the Scottish Executive for its total failure to publish details of its school building programme, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to make a statement to the Parliament detailing the Executive’s plans for building the new schools that Scotland’s children deserve and that the SNP promised in its 2007 manifesto.
