 *S3M-1120 Margaret Smith: Fund to Clean Homes after Murders—That the Parliament notes that around 20 to 30 families each year have to pay for the cost of cleaning up their own homes after a murder has taken place there; recognises that the costs of a clean-up can vary from £200 to £3,000; further recognises the stress and strain that this can cause to the families of murder victims who are still coming to terms with their loss, on top of attending to funeral arrangements, and calls on the Scottish Government to establish a fund to cover the costs of cleaning up homes after a murder to help bereaved families at a very difficult time.
