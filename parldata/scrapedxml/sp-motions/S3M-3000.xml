*S3M-3000 Hugh Henry: Huntington’s Disease—That the Parliament recognises that Huntington’s disease is a devastating, high-risk, inherited, neurological condition that causes a profound form of dementia and mental ill health; notes that the Scottish Huntington’s Association (SHA) was established in 1989 by families living with the disease because they could not get help with health and social care services; congratulates SHA in approaching its 20th anniversary in 2009 and on providing Huntington’s disease services staffed by skilled nurses that make a significant difference to the lives of those affected by the disease; expresses its concern that only nine out of the 15 NHS boards provide this service, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make sure that all people living with the condition have access to support that will maximise their quality of life.
