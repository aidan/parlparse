*S3M-3402 Bill Wilson: Israeli Disruption of International Aid Effort—That the Parliament notes a recent Al Jazeera report that the Israeli navy intercepted and boarded the ship, Al-Ikhwa, en route from Cyprus to Gaza with medical equipment, food supplies, books and toys and milk for children; is of the opinion that, if true, the alleged beating and detention of the passengers, among whom were Scottish human rights observer Theresa McDermott and nine human rights observers from Lebanon, the vandalism of the ship’s equipment, the destruction of plasma and the diversion of the ship to Ashdod allegedly for it to be searched, despite searches already having been carried out by Lebanese and Cypriot authorities, amounts to further criminal action by a government that has demonstrated time and again that it has little regard for human rights or life; also considers that such actions are likely to embitter and entrench opposition rather than further the cause of peace, and calls on Israel to release the ship, appropriately compensate all concerned and recognise that oppression damages the oppressor as well as the victim.
