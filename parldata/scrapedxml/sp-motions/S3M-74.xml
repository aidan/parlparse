*S3M-74 Tavish Scott: The Crown Estate and Scotland’s Seabed—That the Parliament notes the importance to Scotland of the seas around its shores, which support fishing, aquaculture, tourism and marine transport industries, and increasingly will support Scotland’s growing marine renewable energy industry; further notes that the control of the seabed remains with the Crown Estate which controls most marine developments and levies charges for the use of the seabed; believes that, if Scotland’s coastal and island communities are to be sustained and Scotland’s marine renewable energy potential is to be developed for the maximum benefit of Scotland, control of the seabed should pass to democratically accountable Scottish authorities, and therefore further believes that the opportunity presented by the proposed UK Marine Bill to devolve control of Scotland’s seabed to Scotland should be taken and that, in the meantime, the Scottish Executive should examine the conclusions of the Crown Estate Review Working Group in order to use every opportunity to use devolved powers to maximise Scotland’s influence over the operation of the Crown Estate in Scotland.
