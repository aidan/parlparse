*S2M-4136 Linda Fabiani: Anniversary of Halabja Massacreâ€”That the Parliament, along with Kurdish communities and other organisations around the world, remembers 16 March 2006 as the 18th anniversary of the attack on Halabja; respects the memories of the thousands who died and recognises the pain of those who survived but suffer long-term health effects; condemns any use of chemical weapons and attacks against civilian populations; reaffirms its opposition to genocide, and supports the call to bring to justice those responsible for the attack, to seek compensation for the victims of the attack, to work to address the environmental problems caused by this attack and others and to help the refugees of these attacks to return to their homelands.
