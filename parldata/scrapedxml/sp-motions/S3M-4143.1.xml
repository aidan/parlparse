*S3M-4143.1 Liam McArthur: 48 Hour Working Time Directive—As an amendment to motion (S3M-4143) in the name of John Wilson, leave out from "with concern" to end and insert "that the UK Government failed to reach an agreement with the European Union with regard to the decision to opt out of the 48 hour working time directive; believes that the defeat of the plans is good news for Scotland’s retained fire service and the communities that rely on it; is surprised that SNP members should express such inconsistent views on these proposals, which posed such a grave threat to the service provided by retained firefighters across Scotland; recognises the need for sufficient flexibility in the working time directive to allow retained firefighters to provide vital fire and rescue services in Scotland’s most remote areas, and therefore calls on ministers to be vigilant and ensure that they keep up the pressure as the European Commission consults on the way forward."
