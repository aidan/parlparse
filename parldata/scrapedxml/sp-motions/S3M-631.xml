*S3M-631 Jamie Hepburn: Holodomor, the Ukrainian Famine of 1932-33â€”That the Parliament notes that it has been over 70 years since the events of the Ukrainian famine of 1932-33, known as the Holodomor; also notes that there are various estimates of how many died as a result of this famine but that even conservative estimates place this number in the millions; further notes that there is a strong body of opinion that considers the events of the Holodomor were in fact a deliberate policy of the Stalin regime of the time and that these constitute an act of genocide; acknowledges that a number of countries now recognise the events as genocide; commends the work of those campaigners working to raise awareness of the events of the Holodomor, including the Holodomor Memorial website and holodomor.org.uk, and passes its condolences to the relatives of victims of the Holodomor, which is marked by an official day of remembrance on 26 November in Ukraine.
