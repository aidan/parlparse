*S3M-729 Stuart McMillan: 2012 Olympic Football Team—That the Parliament welcomes the continued opposition by the Scottish Football Association (SFA) to a single UK football team for the Olympic Games and the comments by Irish Football Association (IFA) president, Raymond Kennedy, opposing the creation of such a team; notes that this means that the IFA joins the SFA and Football Association of Wales in opposition to a single UK team; further notes that the supporters’ organisations for all four UK home teams are similarly opposed to a single team; expresses concern that the British Olympic Association’s push for such a team threatens the independence and identity of the home nations’ football associations, and calls on the British Olympic Association to listen to the majority of home nations’ football associations and all supporters’ organisations and abandon its campaign for such a single team. Supported by: Brian Adam*, Alasdair Allan*, Sandra White*, Nigel Don*, Bob Doris*, Alex Neil*, Christina McKelvie*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Bill Wilson*, Bill Kidd*
