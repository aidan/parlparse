*S2M-181 Dr Sylvia Jackson: Animal Welfare Centres—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive’s decision to hand all responsibility for animal welfare to its Environment and Rural Affairs Department; recognises that the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals has been calling for such a move since 1999, and believes that this will end confusion and allow animal welfare issues to be dealt with more effectively.
