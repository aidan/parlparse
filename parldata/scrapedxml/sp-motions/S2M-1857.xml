*S2M-1857 Sarah Boyack: Proof-of-Age Cards—That the Parliament notes the wide range of age-restricted products that are available to consumers, including alcohol, cigarettes, spray paints, solvents, DVDs and computer games; notes that retailers need to check the age of individuals trying to buy these products when it is suspected that they are too young to legally do so; believes that a national proof-of-age scheme would help both retailers and young people, and, in the absence of such a scheme, calls on the Scottish Executive to carry out a national co-ordinated campaign to highlight the benefits of Scotland’s young people carrying out a PASS-accredited proof-of-age card when intending to buy age-restricted products.
