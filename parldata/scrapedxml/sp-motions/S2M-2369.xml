*S2M-2369 Margaret Mitchell: Recovery, Reuse and Recycling of Mobile Phones and Printer Cartridges—That the Parliament commends the work of Eurosource, a Falkirk-based company, which has become an international leader in the recovery, reuse and recycling of mobile phones and printer cartridges; welcomes its innovative approach and individual customer-tailored collection programmes which have resulted in a significant reduction in environmental damage; applauds the company’s contributions of almost £1.5 million to charities, schools and scout groups since its inception five years ago; recognises the benefits of the company’s corporate social responsibility ethos and its work with schools which helps youngsters to learn about the environment, enterprise and citizenship, and considers that, within the Scottish Executive and Scottish local authorities, everything possible should be done to encourage the recovery, reuse and recycling of mobile phones and printer cartridges. Supported by: Robert Brown*, Richard Lochhead*, Rob Gibson*, Michael Matheson*, Alex Johnstone*, Nora Radcliffe*, Rosie Kane*, Mr David Davidson*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Alex Neil*, Linda Fabiani*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Mrs Nanette Milne*, Eleanor Scott*, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton*, Shiona Baird*, Ms Sandra White*
