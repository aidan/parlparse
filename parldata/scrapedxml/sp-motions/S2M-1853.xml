 *S2M-1853 Mark Ballard: Algerian Immigrantsâ€”That the Parliament expresses its support for the asylum applications by Saleh Moullef, Fouad Lasnami and Ghalem Belhadj and the several other Algerian men arrested in Scotland under the Terrorism Act 2000 in December 2002; notes with concern that the arrests of these men were not as fully supported by evidence as should be expected, that their arrests sparked intense media coverage and that it was almost a year before the charges were dropped; believes that it is clear that these circumstances would place the men in grave danger were they to be returned to Algeria; further notes that, despite charges being dropped, they appeared on a list of terror suspects shared between the British and Algerian security forces, further placing their lives at risk if returned to Algeria, and firmly believes that Scotland now has both a moral duty and a duty under international law to afford these men a safe refuge.
