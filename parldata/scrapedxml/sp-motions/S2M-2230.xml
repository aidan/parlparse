*S2M-2230 Robin Harper: Family Mediation—That the Parliament commends Family Mediation Scotland for the excellent work it has done over the last 20 years assisting separating couples and providing support for children and parents in reaching agreements to enable all parties to move forward and for its work in creating contact centres for children and parents and setting up children’s groups; notes that the most recent annual review of Scottish legal aid concludes that a significant proportion of its savings in legal aid in the last financial year came from increased take-up of mediation services, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make proportionate long-term funding available to family mediation services on this basis.
