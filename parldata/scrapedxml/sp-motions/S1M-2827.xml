*S1M-2827 Trish Godman: Braille Information on ID Cards—That the Parliament commends the decision taken by the Council for Registered Gas Installers (CORGI) to introduce Braille information on the ID cards carried by all CORGI registered installers; notes that this initiative has the approval and support of the Royal National Institute for the Blind; believes that it provides assurance to visually impaired consumers of such services, and urges other organisations whose representatives and technicians call upon domestic consumers to follow this excellent example of service to consumers.
