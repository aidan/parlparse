*S1M-549 Mr Mike Rumbles: Agrimoney Compensation—That the Parliament notes the strength of sterling in comparison to the Euro is disadvantaging Scotland’s farmers and that agrimoney compensation is available from the European Union to address the effects of such currency fluctuations; believes that this aid is urgently needed to address the serious financial difficulties being experienced across all sectors of Scottish agriculture; notes that action is needed at a UK level to secure a total of £92 million in additional payments to Scottish farmers; acknowledges that the Scottish Executive has made representations to Westminster outlining the need for this aid, and therefore calls upon Her Majesty’s Treasury to put in place the necessary financial arrangements and match funding to secure the additional European money at the earliest opportunity.
