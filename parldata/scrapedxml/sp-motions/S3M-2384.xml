 *S3M-2384 Jackie Baillie: One Jumper or Two?—That the Parliament expresses concern at Centrica’s recent announcement that the price of gas for consumers will rise by 35% and electricity by 9% while the company’s profits for the first half of 2008 amounted to £992 million; notes that for every 1% rise in energy prices 8,000 more households are pushed into fuel poverty and condemns the comments by Centrica that, in effect, it is time for people to wear two jumpers instead of one as being completely out of touch with the day-to-day struggle of increasing numbers of households to heat their homes and pay their energy bills, and calls on all suppliers to offer meaningful support to low-income households, including offering a social tariff that is lower than the lowest tariff on offer.
