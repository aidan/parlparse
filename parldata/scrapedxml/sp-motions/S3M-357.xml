 *S3M-357 Robert Brown: Insight Radio—That the Parliament welcomes the work of Insight Radio (formerly VIP on Air), Europe’s first radio service for blind and partially sighted people; congratulates the consortium of funding organisations led by RNIB Scotland and including Glasgow City Council, the British Wireless for the Blind Fund, East Renfrewshire Council and South Lanarkshire Council on their support; notes that a high percentage of staff at the radio station are themselves visually impaired; welcomes the recent addition of a service on 101FM as well as digital, and looks forward to the station continuing to provide a high-class service for its listeners and acting as an exemplar of the potential contribution that can be made by blind and visually impaired employees.
