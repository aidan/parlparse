 *S3M-5885 Christopher Harvie: Kinship Care Allowance Cuts—That the Parliament considers that kinship carers offer very valuable care to vulnerable members of their extended families; believes that children looked after within their extended family have a better long-term outcome in relation to educational attainment and becoming integrated members of their community; notes with regret that Clackmannanshire Council, having implemented kinship care allowance on a par with foster care, is now reducing this allowance by over 60%; sees this as a short-sighted attempt to reduce budget overspends, and urges that this decision be reversed immediately.
