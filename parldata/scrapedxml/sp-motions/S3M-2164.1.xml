*S3M-2164.1 George Foulkes: Irish Reject the Lisbon Treaty—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2164) in the name of John Lamont, leave out from "it is" to end and insert ", unlike the United Kingdom, the Irish constitution requires that the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty is put to a referendum and that every party represented in the Dáil Éireann except Sinn Féin officially campaigned in favour of a "Yes" vote; further notes the comments of the Taoiseach, other political leaders and commentators in the Republic of Ireland, that the "No" vote was heavily influenced by domestic matters rather than just the Lisbon Treaty itself, and believes that the comments of Conservative MPs and MSPs, in criticising the UK for being among the 26 out of 27 EU member states not holding a referendum on the ratification of the Lisbon Treaty, highlight hypocrisy and opportunism by David Cameron and his party, given that while in power the Conservative Party never once held a referendum on the ratification of any of the treaties of the European Union or its predecessors including the Treaty of Rome itself, the Single European Act and the Maastricht Treaty, all of which were much more significant in terms of increasing the powers and scope of European institutions."
