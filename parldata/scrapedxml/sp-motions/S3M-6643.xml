*S3M-6643 Willie Coffey: Privatisation of Air Traffic Controlâ€”That the Parliament condemns the intention of the UK Government to fully privatise the National Air Traffic Control Service (NATS); notes that this is the continuation of a policy pursued by thelast administration led by Labour, which transferred 51% of NATS to the private sector in 2001; believes that the provision of the core activity of NATS, civilian air traffic control, should be excluded from full privatisation, and offers its appreciation of the commitment and dedication of the workforce of 900 at the enlarged Prestwick Air Traffic Control Centre, which deals with 900,000 flights per annum over Scotland, Northern Ireland, the north of England and the North Atlantic.
