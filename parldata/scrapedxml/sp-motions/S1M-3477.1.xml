*S1M-3477.1 Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh: Closing the Opportunity Gap—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3477) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the document Closing the Opportunity Gap: Scottish Budget for 2003-06; believes that the Scottish Executive’s centralised, target-based approach will prevent the most vulnerable from realising their full potential, and further notes that the best way to close the opportunity gap is to offer vulnerable people real choice and diversity through reform of public services and to promote a low-tax market economy which creates jobs and allows our vulnerable people to lift themselves out of the poverty trap, thereby delivering a better life for all."
