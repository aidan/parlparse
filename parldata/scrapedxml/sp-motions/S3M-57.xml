 *S3M-57 Des McNulty: Dalmuir Waste Water Treatment Works—That the Parliament notes the continuing odour problems that have bedevilled Dalmuir waste water treatment works; recognises that poor operational practices have contributed to the seriousness of the problems but that the underlying cause is poor design of the storage tanks and the inadequacy of the plant to deal with the volume of waste water, especially after heavy rain; calls on ministers to take the steps necessary to rectify these odour problems which are particularly pungent during the summer months; welcomes the commitment of the previous Deputy Minister for Environment and Rural Development to provide resources to rectify the serious odour problems at the Seafield waste water treatment works in Edinburgh; considers that the new Scottish Executive should make the same commitment to eliminating the odour problems at Dalmuir; notes the new powers given to local authorities from 1 April 2007 to require high odour standards of Scottish Water, and calls on ministers, Scottish Water and West Dunbartonshire Council to make immediate use of these powers, together with resources announced by the previous deputy minister, in order to deal urgently with the totally unacceptable smell emanating from Dalmuir waste water treatment works.
