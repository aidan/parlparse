*S2M-2616 Ms Sandra White: Bridging the Gap—That the Parliament notes the research report by the Scottish Consumer Council, Bridging the gap: Improving access to primary healthcare services for disabled people, which examined how primary healthcare providers have responded to the needs of disabled people; notes with some concern the disappointment of the Scottish Consumer Council that it did not find more evidence of good practice in this area; calls on all of Scotland’s primary healthcare providers to implement the checklist aimed at primary care practitioners as a step to improving good practice, and urges the Scottish Executive to do far more to promote change among primary healthcare providers as a way of ensuring the needs of disabled people are heard and adhered to.
