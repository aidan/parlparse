*S3M-387 Alasdair Allan: Proposed Closure of Schools in the Western Isles—That the Parliament notes with serious concern the planned consultation on the proposed closure of four primary and seven junior secondary schools in the Western Isles Council area; believes that their closure would lead to the ending of secondary education in rural communities and involve some children as young as 11 making 60-mile return trips to school every day; recognises the local council’s need to ensure that its education provision is on a sound financial footing but notes the very strong feeling in communities across the islands that schools should be closed only if there are educational grounds, and asks the council and the Scottish Government to work together to ensure that the curriculum for excellence can be delivered within the existing format of the islands’ education system.
