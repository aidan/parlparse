 *S3M-3479 Robin Harper: Removal of Funding from the Retired and Senior Volunteer Programmeâ€”That the Parliament expresses its concern over the intended removal of funding from the successful Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme (RSVP), which is run by national charity Community Service Volunteers (CSV); believes that the withdrawal of this funding constitutes a tiny fraction of the Scottish Budget and will lead to staff members who develop and coordinate the programme losing their jobs and some 16,000 older volunteers being left without support and other benefits provided by those coordinators; recognises that RSVP volunteers currently provide more than 6,400 hours of valuable service to their communities each week, in schools, hospitals, GP practices, care homes and environmental projects, and calls on the Scottish Government to reconsider its intended withdrawal of central funding to this valuable programme.
