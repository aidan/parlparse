*S3M-2558 Trish Godman: Help for Heroes Rugby Match—That the Parliament warmly congratulates Gordon Bulloch, Dave Hilton and Kenny Logan who have accepted invitations to play in the Help For Heroes Challenge Match at Twickenham on Saturday 20 September 2008; notes that this rugby match will place a Help For Heroes XV against an International Select XV; further notes that the charity Help For Heroes, which gives help to servicemen and women injured in Iraq and Afghanistan, is seeking to improve facilities and services at the Defence Medical and Rehabilitation Centre at Headly Court and the NHS Selly Oak Hospital, both of which provide medical treatment and care for wounded service personnel, including numerous Scots; believes that Help For Heroes is a notable addition to that estimable group of military charities, such as the Erskine Home in West Renfrewshire, the Royal British Legion, the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, and Families Association (SSAFA) and the Army Benevolent Fund, all of which perform an important role in caring for our military veterans and have, of course, done for so many decades; acknowledges the admirable work of the members of these charities, but is of the firm view that the state itself, assisted where appropriate by the Scottish Government, other devolved legislatures, local authorities and relevant agencies, must always shoulder the financial and administrative responsibilities involved in the medical treatment, care and comprehensive rehabilitation of our wounded veterans. Supported by: Nanette Milne*, David Whitton*, Ken Macintosh*, Sarah Boyack*
