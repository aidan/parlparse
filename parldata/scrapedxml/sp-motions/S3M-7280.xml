 *S3M-7280 Bob Doris: Alasdair Gray Rejects Lib Dem Cuts—That the Parliament acknowledges what it considers to be the utter disillusionment felt by many people who voted Liberal Democrat for the first time at the May 2010 UK General Election; understands that one such voter is the acclaimed Scots novelist and artist Alasdair Gray and that, following what it believes are the savage cuts brought to Scotland by the UK Conservative and Liberal Democrat government, Mr Gray has now withdrawn his support for the Liberal Democrats and will once again support the Scottish National Party. Supported by: Stuart McMillan*, Bill Kidd*, Anne McLaughlin*, Joe FitzPatrick*
