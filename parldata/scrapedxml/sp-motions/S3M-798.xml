*S3M-798# Karen Whitefield: Improving the Central Heating Programme—That the Parliament notes with concern that local pensioners in Airdrie and Shotts have been told by Scottish Gas that, although that are eligible now for new heating systems under the central heating programme, they cannot get the new systems fitted until April 2008, up to 6 months after their date of eligibility; believes that it is unacceptable that pensioners in Airdrie and Shotts are being forced to wait until after winter for a new central heating system; further believes that there needs to be greater flexibility within the programme to protect vulnerable people who have medical conditions or to allow boiler-only installations where this will facilitate a quicker and less intrusive installation, and considers that these problems should be addressed as a matter of urgency.
