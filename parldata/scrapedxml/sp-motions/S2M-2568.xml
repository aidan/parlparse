 *S2M-2568 Nicola Sturgeon: Software Patents—That the Parliament notes with concern the common position reached on 7 March 2005 by the EU Competitiveness Council relating to software patents; considers that the EU proposals mark a serious threat to many software developers and the open source community, including many innovative people based in Scotland; further notes that there was apparently no Scottish minister present at the Council to represent Scottish interests, the UK instead being represented by an unelected member of the House of Lords; believes that, given the importance of issues of this nature to the Scottish economy, intellectual property matters should fall within the control of the Scottish Parliament, and calls on the European institutions to reject the plans allowing for the patenting of software. Supported by: Stewart Stevenson*
