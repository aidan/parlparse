 *S3M-3434 Shirley-Anne Somerville: RBS Job Losses—That the Parliament notes with concern the latest announcement from the Royal Bank of Scotland that it is cutting its workforce by 2%, which will result in 2,300 job losses across the United Kingdom; notes that the announcement affects 40 sites in Scotland and that more than half of the bank’s 16,500 jobs in Scotland are based in Edinburgh; considers it deeply regrettable that skilled hardworking staff will pay the price for the financial mismanagement of the senior bankers; believes that it is utterly unacceptable for bonuses to be awarded to senior staff at this time, particularly in a company that is now 70% in public ownership, and hopes that as many jobs as possible can be safeguarded.
