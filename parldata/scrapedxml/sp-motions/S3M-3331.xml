*S3M-3331 Irene Oldfather: Protecting the Independence of the Mental Welfare Commission—That the Parliament notes with particular concern the proposal by the Scottish Government to merge the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland with NHS Quality Improvement Scotland and some of the functions of the Care Commission; recognises that the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland is an organisation that is focused on the rights of individuals within the context of mental health legislation while NHS Quality Improvement Scotland is a broader body seeking to raise standards within the NHS in Scotland; agrees that the strength of the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland is in its ability to monitor, visit and assist people with mental health problems independent of government and the NHS and that, as such, the findings contained within its reports are highly valued by experts in the field; acknowledges that the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland is not solely concerned with matters pertaining to health and can become involved in issues relating to care in prison, welfare benefits and how the criminal justice system deals with victims with mental disorders, and therefore believes that it is crucial for the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland to be wholly independent and continue to operate with a full remit.
