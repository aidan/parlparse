*S2M-2138 Margaret Smith: Royal Highland and Agricultural Society—That the Parliament expresses its concern about the plans contained in the UK Government’s White Paper, The Future of Air Transport, which would require the relocation of the Royal Highland and Agricultural Society’s headquarters and showground at Ingliston as a result of the proposed expansion of Edinburgh Airport; values the immense contribution that the Royal Highland Centre makes to the Lothian economy, attracting 1.2 million visitors and over £80 million every year; recognises that the centre has not just provided 50 years of the Royal Highland Show, but also accommodates a variety of special events throughout the year, including fairs, concerts, conventions and sporting events; is further concerned by the estimated costs of relocating the centre, which vary between £95 million and over £400 million with further costs to the Edinburgh economy, and encourages the Scottish Executive, the UK Government, British Airports Authority and others to work together to produce a set of proposals which will allow the society to remain at its Ingliston site.
