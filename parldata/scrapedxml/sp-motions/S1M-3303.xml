*S1M-3303 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Flood Victims in Glasgow—That the Parliament urges the Scottish Executive to promise financial aid to flood victims in the east end of Glasgow whose possessions have been wiped out in floods that devastated their homes; believes that council tenants and some pensioner private owners should not be blamed for not being insured in an area that is officially the most deprived in Britain; notes that human error did not prevent the Holyrood building from being bailed out when costs soared from £40 million to almost £300 million; further notes that the divisive contrast between flood victims in poverty being left without funds or furniture in Glasgow and the creation of a parliament building in Edinburgh with comforts for politicians is against the Parliament's caring ethos, and appeals for common sense and humanity to prevail.
