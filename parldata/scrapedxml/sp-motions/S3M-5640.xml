*S3M-5640 Karen Whitefield: We Want Our Missing Millions—That the Parliament welcomes the We want our missing millions campaign by the organisation, for Scotland’s Disabled Children; notes that the campaign seeks to secure £11.3 million from the Scottish Government for Scotland’s disabled children, representing the final third of £34 million intended to support disabled children and young people, and believes that the Scottish Government should take steps to ensure that local authorities spend their share of the £11.3 million on support for disabled children and young people in their areas.
