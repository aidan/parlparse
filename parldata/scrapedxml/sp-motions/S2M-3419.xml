 *S2M-3419# Christine Grahame: Ways 2 Workâ€”That the Parliament notes the contribution of Ways 2 Work, based in Galashiels, and other similar projects assisting and supporting people into the workforce; expresses its concern at the vulnerability of its funding when currently Ways 2 Work supports some 50 clients in the community and a further 40 in social enterprises, including a print shop in Duns, a gardening team in Hawick and a catering team in Peebles; further notes that there are 90 clients currently registered with 20 on a waiting list but that it is estimated that in the Borders alone there will be some 4,000 people with disabilities who would benefit from this and similar programmes; further notes the concerns over its continued European funding and the prospect of the loss of Objective 3 status in the south of Scotland, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should undertake an audit of such programmes with a view to establishing a secure funding basis for them.
