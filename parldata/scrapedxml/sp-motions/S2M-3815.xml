*S2M-3815 Tommy Sheridan: Impeach the Prime Minister—That the Parliament notes the recent comments on BBC Radio 4 of General Sir Michael Rose, former Commander of Forces in Bosnia, in relation to Prime Minister Tony Blair’s responsibility for committing British troops to what many believe to have been the illegal invasion of Iraq that “certainly from a soldier’s perspective there can’t be any more serious decision taken by a Prime Minister than declaring war…and then to go to war on what turns out to be false grounds is something that no-one should be allowed to walk away from”; further notes General Rose’s specific statement in The Scotsman on 9 January 2006 that “the politicians should be held to account, and my own view is that Blair should be impeached. That would prevent politicians treating quite so carelessly the subject of taking a country into war”, and believes that General Sir Michael Rose is, on this occasion, absolutely right and that Tony Blair should be impeached for, as many believe, misleading Britain into an illegal war under cover of lies, distortions and deceit.
