*S3M-1030 Roseanna Cunningham: The Big Lottery Giveaway - Victory for Connect2—That the Parliament welcomes the outcome of the vote for the People’s £50 million Lottery Giveaway from the Big Lottery Fund which has been won by the Connect2 project proposed by Sustrans to revitalise walking and cycling in 79 communities across the United Kingdom by creating new routes for everyday journeys, with crossings and bridges to be created over busy roads, railway lines and rivers, linking into new networks of local paths to get people where they want to go; notes that the project will benefit 79 different communities across the UK, including a pedestrian and cycle bridge over the Tay linking Muirton in Perth with Quarrymill Woodland Park in Scone, the Bridge to Nowhere in Glasgow, cycle links between Hamilton, Larkhall and Stonehouse and connecting two railway paths in Dumfries via the Nith Viaduct; believes that, as a result of Connect2’s victory, millions will be able to travel in a healthy and environmentally friendly way to shops, school, work and leisure, bringing people closer together, making journeys quicker, more convenient and better for the environment, and congratulates everyone involved in developing these great projects and securing the funding needed to bring them into being.
