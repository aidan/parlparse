*S3M-234 Bob Doris: Social Aspect of Bingo Clubs and VAT—That the Parliament acknowledges the important social aspect that bingo clubs provide in local communities; notes that they provide a safe environment and are sometimes the sole outlet for communication for some people, many of whom are elderly women; notes that the Bingo Association was supportive of the smoking ban in Scotland but observes that this has contributed to a serious decline in attendance and profits; further notes that the industry is subject to the imposition of 17.5% VAT, while its immediate competitors in bookmaking and casinos are not, and suggests that the VAT taken by HM Treasury should be removed or significantly reduced in order to level the playing field, facilitate the survival of the industry and prevent further closures of bingo clubs in local communities across Scotland.
