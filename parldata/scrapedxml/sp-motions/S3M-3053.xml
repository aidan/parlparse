*S3M-3053 Bill Kidd: UK Government Plans to Treat Lone Parents as Repeat Offendersâ€”That the Parliament expresses concern at proposals in the UK Government commissioned report, Realising potential: A vision for personalised conditionality and support, by Professor Paul Gregg from Bristol University, to further extend sanctions-based conditionality for groups of persons on incapacity benefit and lone parents; notes that, under the proposals for lone parents, only those with a child under the age of one would be excluded from conditions to take actions to prepare for work; considers that any sanctions imposed on them, where they are described by the Department of Work and Pensions as "repeat offenders", will further impoverish children, and further considers that lone parents deserve positive measures to support them in seeking suitable work rather than punitive ones.
