*S2M-5378 Mr Tom McCabe: Finance—That the Parliament recognises that there have been continuing record levels of public investment in Scotland, as indicated in the most recent publication of Government Expenditure and Revenue in Scotland 2004-05; further recognises the record levels of finance provided to local government which mean that by 2007-08 core funding will have increased by almost £3.2 billion, or 57.9% compared with 1999-2000, and believes that this position is a result of being part of the United Kingdom.
