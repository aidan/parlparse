*S1M-3276# George Lyon: Gourock to Dunoon Ferry Service-That the Parliament notes with concern the Executive proposal to restrict Gourock to Dunoon ferry services to passenger-only in the draft Invitation to Tender for Clyde and Hebrides ferry services currently operated by Caledonian MacBrayne; further notes that this proposal undermines action to upgrade Dunoon pier and transport links at Gourock pier; further notes the total opposition of the local community to this proposal, and considers that the Executive should find an alternative proposal that includes a vehicle-carrying ferry and satisfies European competition rules.
