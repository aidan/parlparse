*S3M-1951.3 Fiona Hyslop: Skills Strategy—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1951) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from "the Scottish Government’s skills strategy" to end and insert "under the previous administration, Scotland’s growth rate and productivity levels lagged behind the United Kingdom and believes that this indicates that a new approach to skills and the economy is necessary; notes the widespread business and industry support for the Scottish Government’s skills strategy and believes that government’s role is to respond to demand from employers, to improve skills utilisation and support individuals’ skills development."
