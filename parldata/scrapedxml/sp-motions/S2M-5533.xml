 *S2M-5533 Mr Mark Ruskell: IPCC - Fourth Assessment Report—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the first part of the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC); congratulates the IPCC on its most careful and painstaking examination of the scientific evidence available on climate change; notes the findings of AR4 that by the end of this century average global temperatures are likely to be 1.8°C to 4°C higher than today, with possible rises of up to almost 6°C, leading to rising sea levels and more, and more severe, extreme weather events, including heatwaves, floods, storms and droughts; is reminded that the consensual working practices of the IPCC mean that its reports are extremely conservative and that a more realistic prognosis for the earth’s climate is likely to be worse than that set out in the IPCC reports; believes that the publication of the report categorically removes any remaining doubt that climate change is the greatest and most pressing threat facing our planet; echoes the sentiments of Rajendra Pachauri, Chairman of the IPCC, in hoping that "this report will shock people, governments into taking more serious action, as you really can’t get a more authentic and a more credible piece of scientific work", and calls, therefore, for the Scottish Executive to ensure that each and every one of its policies is "climate proofed", to introduce binding annual greenhouse gas emission reduction targets of at least 3% per annum and to abandon without delay schemes such as the M74 Northern Extension, the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route and the Air Route Development Fund which can only contribute to man-made climate change.
