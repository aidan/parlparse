*S3M-2811 Rob Gibson: Cyclone Nargis Aid Efforts—That the Parliament congratulates, in the aftermath of the devastating Cyclone Nargis, the impressive progress toward recovery made by citizens and aid workers in Burma over the past six months; commends the efforts made by the United Nation’s World Food Programme, which is still supplying some 770,000 Burmese with food aid; highlights the success of UK-based charity Save The Children in setting up 350 temporary schools and reinhabiting a further 200 schools, and recognising that, according to the International Crisis Group, there is still much work to be done, thus supports and encourages the future efforts of these and other international aid organisations.
