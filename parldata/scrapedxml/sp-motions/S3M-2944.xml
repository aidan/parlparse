*S3M-2944 Irene Oldfather: The Robert Burns Humanitarian Award 2009â€”That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of the Robert Burns Humanitarian Award on the eighth anniversary of the event; recognises the work of the award in giving an international platform to organisations and individuals who may not have been previously recognised for their humanitarian work; notes that 2009 represents the 250th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns, and therefore welcomes the award, both as a representation of the universal ideals espoused by Robert Burns in his works of universal brotherhood and self-sacrifice and the hard work carried out by people across the world.
