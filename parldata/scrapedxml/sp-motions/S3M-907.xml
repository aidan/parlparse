 *S3M-907 Cathie Craigie: BBC Scotland’s Commitment to Deaf Users of Sign Language—That the Parliament notes that BBC Scotland has published its Annual Review 2006-07 which contains priorities for delivering BBC public purposes for Scotland in 2007-08; notes that the BBC will scrutinise the level and quality of cultural representation of the UK’s nations and regions across the BBC networks and ensure that the objective for 2006-07, "Make significant progress towards the development and delivery, through innovative means, of local/regional news, politics and general programming", is achieved by BBC Scotland in 2007-08; congratulates the BBC on the fact that speakers of Gaelic, an indigenous language in Scotland, will have direct access to 35 hours of television in their first language and 3175 hours of radio; expresses its condemnation that Scotland’s 6,500 deaf users of sign language (BSL) are given no consideration by BBC Scotland for programmes in their first language, a language that is recognised as indigenous to the United Kingdom; further expresses its condemnation that BBC Scotland does not at least match the television hours given to the Gaelic language with programmes made in BSL, and believes that it should, in fact, give BSL users more television hours as BSL users do not have access to information and programmes on radio.
