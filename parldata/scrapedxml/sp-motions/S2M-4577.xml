 *S2M-4577 Pauline McNeill: Passengers Before Profits - Greater Accountability in Public Transport—That the Parliament reiterates its strong view that decent local bus services are vital to all Scotland’s communities and its belief that such services are integral to cutting road congestion and safeguarding the environment; welcomes the significant investment in bus infrastructure, including better terminuses, priority bus lanes and fast track traffic management systems which have received Scottish Executive support throughout Scotland; expresses significant concern that withdrawal of services is continuing resulting in, for example, a much poorer after-hours service in Glasgow, undermining investment and attempts to deliver more integrated and accessible health care and other public services, as well as leaving many areas of both urban and rural Scotland without adequate services, and calls on the Executive and Transport Scotland, in return for the increased investment, to ensure greater accountability of the bus industry for services across Scotland, to undertake speedily a review of how quality bus partnerships are operating and to consider seriously all possible options which could prevent the loss or absence of vital services, including new and greater forms of regulation such as franchise agreements or allowing the new Regional Transport Partnerships the power to determine routes and timetables, so as to guarantee all Scottish communities the bus links which they need and deserve.
