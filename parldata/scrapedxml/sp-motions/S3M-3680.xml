*S3M-3680 Elaine Murray: White-coated Roe Deer—That the Parliament is concerned by reports in The Sunday Times on 9 March 2009 that a rare white-coated roebuck discovered on an estate in Dumfriesshire is being auctioned by the person owning the stalking rights for the estate; understands that deer numbers need to be controlled and that stalking is a legitimate way of undertaking such control; but believes that targeting an individual animal because of its rarity is unacceptable, and further believes that this animal will make a far greater contribution to nature tourism and the local economy if it is allowed to survive rather than if it is shot by the highest bidder.
