*S3M-5765 Christine Grahame: Disability Sports Development Officer Cut Condemned—That the Parliament condemns the decision by Scottish Borders Council (SBC) to end funding in May 2010 for the award-winning post of Disability Sports Development Officer held by local Borders man Jed Renilson who previously won ITV Borders Local Hero Award and the Glasgow Trophy for his services and success in promoting sport for disabled youngsters and adults; considers that this decision by the Liberal, Conservative and independent councillors on SBC further undermines sports development in the Scottish Borders, especially among disabled athletes and sports people, and urges the council to reconsider its decision in light of the exemplary work and benefit that local disabled sports people have derived from Mr Renilson’s dedicated effort.
