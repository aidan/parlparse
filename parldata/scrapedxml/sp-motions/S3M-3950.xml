*S3M-3950 John Wilson: Exorbitant Legalised Money Lending—That the Parliament condemns the high APR of 399.7% offered on personal loans by Greenwood Personal Credit and the 189.2% APR attached to the new Provident Personal Credit pre-paid debit card; considers that, during this time of economic turbulence, financial services companies should refrain from charging excessive interest rates while the Bank of England interest rates remain at 0.5%, and is concerned that these rates are targeted at those people currently suffering the most financial hardship and serve only to increase poverty levels and reinforce poverty among people already struggling to make ends meet.
