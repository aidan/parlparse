*S1M-2818# Colin Campbell: Regeneration-That the Parliament recognises that a lack of appropriate jobs is a major problem in Scotland; notes that a main cause is the decline of heavy industry in the past three decades; considers that all local authorities, MSPs and key agencies should work together to implement a regeneration programme, and believes that the Scottish Executive should provide resources for its speedy completion.
