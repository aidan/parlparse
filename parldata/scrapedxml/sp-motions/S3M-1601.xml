 *S3M-1601 Rhona Brankin: Schools of Ambition—That the Parliament recognises the important contribution that the Schools of Ambition programme has made in giving schools greater freedom to develop creative and innovative approaches to school improvement; notes HM Inspectorate of Education’s positive comments on the programme’s effect on pupil motivation; deplores the Scottish Government’s decision to axe the Schools of Ambition programme in the face of such success, and calls on the Scottish Government to continue the funding of existing schools of ambition and to identify further individual schools that would benefit from becoming schools of ambition.
