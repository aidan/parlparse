 *S1M-4006 Linda Fabiani: South Lanarkshire Secondary Schools PPP Proposal-That the Parliament shares the concerns of parents and pupils in East Kilbride with regard to South Lanarkshire Council's public private partnership proposal for secondary schools which, if implemented, will lead to 75% of resultant school closures being in East Kilbride, where 50% of secondary schools will be lost resulting in school rolls amongst the highest in Scotland and to considerably longer school journey times for pupils owing to the locations of the proposed schools; notes that the council's financial proposal is underpinned by the closure of St Bride's High School, academically the highest-performing school in South Lanarkshire, in order that its site can be sold for development; recognises the further concern of parents in East Kilbride that the consultation process by South Lanarkshire Council is inadequate, and calls on the council and the Minister for Finance and Public Services, in consideration of the local community's deep-felt anxiety on this issue, to reconsider this deeply flawed proposal.
