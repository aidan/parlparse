*S3M-276 Sandra White: Welcome Freedom, Lasting Peace—That the Parliament expresses great relief and delight at the release of the BBC’s correspondent, Alan Johnston, who had been kidnapped and held captive for over three months in Gaza City, Palestine; notes the comments of Mr Johnston, who said that Hamas’s seizure of power in Gaza and its subsequent pledge to improve security in the territory had facilitated his release; welcomes the important role that the Hamas government played in securing his release, and believes that this act and the subsequent acknowledgment of Hamas’s crucial role by the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, should serve as a springboard to facilitate discussion with the Hamas government over the crucial issues which need to be addressed in order to achieve lasting peace in the region.
