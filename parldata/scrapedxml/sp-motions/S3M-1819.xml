*S3M-1819 Mary Mulligan: Blackridge Railway Station—That the Parliament notes that West Lothian Council has granted a planning consent, subject to approval from Scottish Ministers, for housing development in Blackridge which includes financial and support infrastructure contributions from the developer toward the building of a new railway station at Blackridge; considers that any further delay by the Scottish Government in confirming that it will provide the remaining funding required will lead to the Blackridge railway station project being excluded from the Network Rail timetable for work on that phase of the Bathgate to Airdrie rail project and would result in the loss of opportunity to provide a new rail station and other beneficial infrastructure projects for Blackridge village; congratulates the local people of Blackridge on their successful community campaign which has demonstrated beyond doubt the economic and social benefits which will accrue from a new railway station, and calls on the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change to confirm that, subject to Scottish Ministers confirming approval for the outstanding planning consent, the Scottish Government will provide the balance of funding required to deliver a new railway station for Blackridge village as part of the overall Bathgate to Airdrie project, and clarification of how much that will be.
