*S3M-5235 Jackie Baillie: 9 to 5 Is Not an Option for Vale Babies—That the Parliament regrets the decision by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to reduce the community maternity unit (CMU) of the Vale of Leven Hospital from a 24/7 service to a 9 to 5 service; notes information that shows that the majority of babies born at the CMU are actually born at night; further notes that, of the 97 babies born at the CMU in 2008, 74 were born at night and only 23 were born during the daytime; believes that switching to an on-call service with minimal evening cover will affect the majority of expectant mothers in the area who have chosen the CMU to deliver their babies, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to intervene and strongly encourage NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to reverse this decision.
