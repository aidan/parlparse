*S1M-2449 Mr Murray Tosh: Convenerships and vice-convenerships of committeesâ€”That the Parliament notes that the convenerships and vice-convenerships of the Parliament's committees were allocated initially on a proportional basis; agrees that these posts should always be allocated proportionally; recognises that the Labour Party, with 42.6% of the seats in the Parliament, now holds 53% of the committee convenerships and 47% of the vice-convenerships, and calls upon the Parliamentary Bureau to take the initiative in restoring proportionality following any personnel changes arising from a reshuffle of Scottish Executive ministers.
