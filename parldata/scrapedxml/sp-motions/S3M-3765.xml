*S3M-3765 Brian Adam: North Sea Oil and Gas Tax Regimeâ€”That the Parliament recognises the strategic economic importance of the oil and gas industry, which contributes over a third of UK corporation tax to HM Treasury and notes that up to 25 billion barrels of oil and gas still remain to be extracted; realises that to attract the investment required to develop these reserves the North Sea must remain competitive; further notes with concern that since 2004 costs have doubled and that the rate of tax charged on new developments has risen to 50% and that the oil and gas industry projects that 50,000 jobs are at risk if investment ceases; calls on the Westminster government urgently to review the tax regime, and also calls on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ensure that banks make credit lines available to the oil and gas industry.
