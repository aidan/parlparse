 *S2M-4687 Campbell Martin: Prestwick Airport - Supply of Weapons to Israel—That the Parliament condemns the compliance of Her Majesty’s Government in delivering to Israel munitions supplied by the United States of America; is very concerned that the weapons of mass destruction that have been allowed to pass through Prestwick Airport were subsequently used by Israel to bomb and kill innocent civilians in southern Lebanon; considers that UK Government compliance may well represent a breach of international law, in that it assisted Israel to carry out disproportionate attacks on Lebanon, and is further concerned that by allowing the use of Prestwick Airport to facilitate the supply of weaponry to Israel the UK Government may have increased the possibility that Scotland in general, and Ayrshire in particular, could become a target for reprisal attacks.
