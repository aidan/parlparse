*S3M-1162 George Foulkes: Council Cuts to Home Help Services—That the Parliament rejects moves to reduce and remove home help services from elderly people across Edinburgh; recognises the vital support that the home helps offer to elderly and vulnerable people across the city; notes that on 12 November 2007 the city council began a review of the 4,000 people in the city who receive home helps; further notes that 140 were reviewed and 40% of these have had their services reduced, with 21% having had their support completely stopped, and believes that we should continue supporting our most vulnerable people in society and prevent moves to abandon this responsibility, recognising that targeting those who cannot take to the streets and protest is both underhand and unacceptable.
