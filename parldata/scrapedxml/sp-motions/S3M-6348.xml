 *S3M-6348 Dr Richard Simpson: Celebrating Foster Care Fortnight—That the Parliament welcomes the Fostering Network’s annual campaign, Foster Care Fortnight, taking place from 17 to 30 May 2010, which raises the profile of fostering in Scotland; is concerned that 1,700 more foster carers are needed in Scotland in order to give children a greater chance of being able to live with a foster family that is right for them, and calls on the Scottish Government to join with colleagues across the United Kingdom in supporting the Fostering Network’s Together for Change campaign, working towards ensuring that every foster carer in Scotland is paid and supported for the work that they do and recognised as part of the childcare workforce so that the pool of foster carers can be increased to make foster care work for every fostered child.
