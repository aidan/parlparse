*S2M-1586 Shiona Baird: Supermarket Developments-That the Parliament notes with concern the growing number of planning applications for supermarket developments which, if approved, will lead to the loss of green spaces, increased car use and the further erosion of local shopping areas, all to the detriment of local communities; recognises the threat posed by large supermarket developments to smaller retailers and the disproportionate impact on elderly and less mobile consumers who rely on local services and supplies, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take action to protect local communities from this threat to their sustainability.
