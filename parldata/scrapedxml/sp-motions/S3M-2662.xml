*S3M-2662 Bob Doris: Big Man - A Celebration of Maryhill, its Canal and its Peopleâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of Big Man, an event taking place on Saturday 4 October 2008 to celebrate Maryhill, its canal and its people; believes that such events are crucial in bringing longstanding traditional communities together to be active participants in the extensive regeneration plans for both the canal and the surrounding area; further believes that when such areas undergo dramatic change it is also crucial that the agencies involved ensure local community buy-in to any change; therefore welcomes the Big Man event and notes the extensive programme of activities and performers, and sends good wishes to the organisers for high attendance, a successful event and good weather.
