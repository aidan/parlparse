*S3M-494 Bill Wilson: Property Management Accreditation Scheme—That the Parliament notes the recent report from the Scottish Consumer Council (SCC) entitled Consumer Experiences of Property Management Services: A Case Study; acknowledges that, while the SCC survey detailed in the report was not comprehensive, it nevertheless suggested that there are serious shortcomings in the way that some properties are managed and in the knowledge of consumers about the duties of property managers, and accordingly agrees with the SCC that the development of a national accreditation scheme for property managers should be expedited by the Scottish Government.
