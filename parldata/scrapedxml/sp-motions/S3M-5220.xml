*S3M-5220 Sandra White: Banks To Force Customers Further Into Debt—That the Parliament expresses concern that, as a result of HBOS proposed changes to overdraft fees, many people could be forced into further debt and poverty; considers the actions of Lloyds Banking Group to be motivated by recent court rulings on overdraft charges and boosting profit rather than simplification of operations at HBOS; believes that, as majority shareholders, the UK Government should, as a matter of urgency, initiate an investigation into the effects of these proposed changes and take appropriate action to ensure that ordinary people are not forced into further debt to boost the profits of these banks.
