*S1M-453 Fergus Ewing: Campaign Against Higher Business Rates in Scotland—That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Executive is proposing a provisional non domestic rate poundage for the year 2000-01 of 45.8 pence, whereas the figures for England and Wales are respectively 41.6 pence and 41.2 pence; notes that the Scottish Executive have accordingly abandoned the uniform business rate policy; fears that this will make Scotland a less attractive location in the UK for large businesses and that this is a retrograde step that will harm the Scottish corporate sector and undermine the benefits received from the harmonisation of cross border business rates in the 1995 re-valuation; calls upon the Executive to re-visit the calculation of the poundage rate and ensure the continuation of the UBR across the UK; to bring forward proposals to provide for smaller businesses a method of relief which remedies the unfair burden which they face in their business rates bills and to estimate what impact its policy of higher business rates for Scotland will have on the level of unemployment and the Scottish economy over the next five years.
