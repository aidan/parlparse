*S3M-7544 Cathy Peattie: Save Violence Against Women Services—That the Parliament notes what it considers the vital and much-needed support that the Scottish Executive has provided over the last decade to help sustain and develop support services such as rape crisis centres and women’s aid groups; further notes that much of this support has been in the form of dedicated funding for services takling violence against women, including the Rape Crisis Specific Fund, the Children’s Services Fund and the Violence Against Women Fund; believes that, if these funds do not continue, the impact on women and children across Scotland will be severe; welcomes the campaign by Rape Crisis Scotland and Scottish Women’s Aid to gather pledges to support and protect funding for these services, and encourages all MSPs to pledge their support.
