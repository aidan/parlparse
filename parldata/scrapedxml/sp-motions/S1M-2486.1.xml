 *S1M-2486.1 Ms Wendy Alexander: Scottish Transport Group Pension Scheme—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2486) in the name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from "both" to end and insert "Scottish Ministers have secured from HM Treasury a substantial pay out for Scottish Transport Group Pension Scheme former members despite the absence of any legal entitlement; further notes that any change to the amount to be distributed to former members is a matter for HM Treasury, and finally notes that the key remaining step is the winding up of the pension schemes, which is a matter for the schemes’ trustees."
