*S2M-5357 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Recognition and Support for Carers—That the Parliament recognises and applauds the work undertaken in our society by Scotland’s 480,000 unpaid carers; notes that the work of those carers contributes around £5.3 billion worth of care, more than half of the entire budget of NHS Scotland; further notes that lack of support means that an increasing number of carers are forced to give up caring every year due to the detrimental effect caring has on their own health; acknowledges that one in five carers suffer from poor health and that carers are a third more likely to become permanently sick or disabled than people with no caring responsibilities; recognises that half of carers who provide substantial care have suffered a physical injury due to their caring role or have received treatment for anxiety, depression or mental ill-health; further notes that at least 17,000 carers are young people whose schooling and social life can be affected, and calls on the Scottish Executive to implement fully the NHS Carer Information Strategies across Scotland to prevent today’s carers from becoming tomorrow’s patients. Supported by: Tommy Sheridan*, Campbell Martin*, Ms Sandra White*, Ms Maureen Watt*, Mr Kenneth Macintosh*, Robin Harper*, Shiona Baird*, Mrs Nanette Milne*
