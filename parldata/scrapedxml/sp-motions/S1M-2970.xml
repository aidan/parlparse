 *S1M-2970# Dr Sylvia Jackson: MS Awareness Week, 14-21 April 2002â€”That the Parliament welcomes MS Awareness Week, 14-21 April 2002, which aims to raise the profile of the disease of multiple sclerosis; recognises the role that the health service in Scotland and the MS Society Scotland play in improving the lives of people affected by MS; notes the recent progress which will ensure that beta interferon is made available to all those people with MS who can benefit from it, and considers that the Scottish Executive should work closely with the MS Society in developing a national standard of care for people with MS.
