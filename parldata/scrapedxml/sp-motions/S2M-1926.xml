*S2M-1926 Christine Grahame: The Last Post—That the Parliament expresses its concern at the threat by the Post Office to close up to half of its main post offices; notes that, in the wake of the closure of large numbers of sub-post offices, this can only compound the damage to communities and to the many individuals, often vulnerable, who rely on the post office service, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to make urgent representations to Her Majesty’s Government before these key services are lost.
