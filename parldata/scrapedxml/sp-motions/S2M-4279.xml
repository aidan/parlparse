*S2M-4279# Richard Baker: Aberdeen Crossrail—That the Parliament notes the economic, social and environmental benefits that Aberdeen Crossrail would bring to the city and other areas of the north east; welcomes the announcement by Network Rail in April 2006 that an additional £40 million is to be invested in the Scottish rail infrastructure network; considers that this additional investment should be used to help develop projects like Aberdeen Crossrail; welcomes the Scottish Executive’s "Transport for Tomorrow" consultation as a valuable chance to debate the future of the Executive’s transport strategy, and believes that the Executive should, through that strategy, move beyond a feasibility study of the crossrail project and progress towards a commitment to construction with a clear timetable for completion.
