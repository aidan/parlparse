 *S1M-1264 Mr Kenneth Gibson: Scotland's Participation in Future Olympic Games-That the Parliament congratulates all British participants in the recent Sydney Olympic Games; is pleased that the number of gold medals won by the Great Britain team was the highest for 80 years; is aware that Cuba won the same number of gold medals as Britain, as did Romania, while the Netherlands won 12, despite these countries having less than a fifth, a third and a quarter of Great Britain's population; realises that Great Britain came only thirtieth in terms of per capita success; believes that this is due to continued underfunding of sport relative to other countries, resulting for example in Britain having only eight Olympic sized swimming pools compared with 1,500 in Australia, which has a population only a third of the size of Britain's; notes that the 199 countries participating excluded one of Europe's oldest nations, Scotland; notes that while most national Olympic Committees are from nations, the International Olympic Committee also recognises independent territories, commonwealths, protectorates and geographical areas and that therefore, despite the Minister for Children and Education's statement on 28 September 2000 (Official Report, col. 792-3), there is not necessarily only a single recognised Olympic committee for each independent nation state; is pleased that American Samoa, Aruba, Bermuda, the British Virgin Islands, Cayman Islands, Cook Islands, Guam, Hong Kong, Netherlands Antilles, Palestine, Puerto Rico and US Virgin Islands all entered teams in the Olympics despite their non-independent status; recognises that Scotland competes in the cricket, football and rugby union world cups and Commonwealth Games in its own right; believes that Scotland should compete in the Athens and subsequent Olympic Games in its own right, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to work to that end.
