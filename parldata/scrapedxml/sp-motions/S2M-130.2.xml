*S2M-130.2 Rosie Kane: Investing in Public Transport—As an amendment to motion (S2M-130) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "recognises that the Scottish Executive’s transport policy has failed the people of Scotland and that, therefore, it must radically alter this policy; believes that what Scotland needs is a publicly owned and accountable transport system covering rail, bus, ferry and air services, including adopting the principle of road equivalent tariffs and public service obligations for our Highlands and Islands communities, and that these should be administered by a national transport network; further believes that a socially just transport system that puts communities before cars should be the prime concern in any public transport investment, and, to that end, calls on the Executive to reprioritise its transport policy, putting people first and delivering a safe, affordable, efficient, integrated and environmentally friendly transport system for all based on the provision of services and not on the generation of profit, as in the example of the M74, and to instigate a full public inquiry into the M74 proposal."
