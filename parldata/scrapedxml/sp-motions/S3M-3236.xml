*S3M-3236 Bob Doris: GHA Tenant’s Back Queens Cross Housing Association—That the Parliament congratulates Queens Cross Housing Association on the results of a tenant survey conducted by IBP Strategy and Research showing that almost 70% of tenants surveyed in the Dundasvale, South Maryhill and Hamiltonhill areas are in support of transferring ownership of their homes from Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) to Queens Cross Housing Association (QCHA); welcomes the series of local meetings organised by QCHA to consult further with tenants and hopes all tenants will engage in this process; notes that this important part of the process of second-stage transfer (SST) comes in the wake of the five successful SST ballots in Parkhead, Cassiltoun, Ardglen, Glasgow West and Shettleston, and welcomes this as further evidence that tenants continue to see GHA as a temporary organisation for the delivery of community ownership through second-stage stock transfer to community-based housing associations.
