 *S3M-2326 Robin Harper: Federation of Master Builders and Climate Changeâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the Federation of Master Builders (FMB) on its recent successful policy conference in London on 9 July 2008; recognises that, in 2050, 80% of our present housing stock will still be in use and that improvements to the insulation, draft proofing and energy efficiency of our present housing stock are the greatest urgency in the context of the challenge of climate change, and calls on the Scottish Government to work as closely as possible with the FMB and small and medium sized construction firms to start a process of innovation, skills development and capacity building in the construction industry, moving towards a future standard for housing refurbishment that is consistent with an 80% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2050.
