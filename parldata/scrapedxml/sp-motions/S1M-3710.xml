 *S1M-3710# Ms Sandra White: Digital Hearing Aids-That the Parliament notes the recent announcement by the Northern Ireland Executive that it will have in place by March 2004 a service to supply digital hearing aids to those who would benefit from them; further notes with concern that Scotland, which once led the UK in audiology services, will now be the only part of the UK without any commitment to fully modernised audiology services, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should take, as a matter of urgency, measures and make resources available for the provision of digital hearing aids to all those who require them.
