*S1M-488# Cathy Jamieson: Standing Commission on Health and Safety at Work in Scotland—That the Parliament is concerned that a recent report by Glasgow University claims that, relative to Britain as a whole, there is a greater risk of workplace fatalities and injuries in Scotland, fewer prosecutions in Scotland arising from fatalities at work, a lower rate of successful prosecutions where such cases are raised and a lower average level of fines in successful prosecution arising from fatalities and injuries at work, and believes that a Standing Commission should be convened by the Parliament, as provided for in the Report of the Consultative Steering Group, to investigate standards of health and safety at work in Scotland, to consider how these can be improved and to review the effectiveness of the regulatory and judicial authorities in relation to occupational health and safety.
