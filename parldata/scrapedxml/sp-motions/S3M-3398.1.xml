*S3M-3398.1 Sarah Boyack: Edinburgh Council Safeguarding School Budgets—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3398) in the name of Margaret Smith, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes that the City of Edinburgh Council failed to safeguard schools by rejecting Labour proposals to reverse last year’s 1.5% cut and invest an extra £2.7 million in frontline school services; considers that schools across the city will remain under acute pressure due to the under funding of schools from last year, and further considers that the Scottish Government has failed to support the development of new and refurbished schools to enable buildings past their sell by date to be replaced or substantially refurbished in an acceptable timescale."
