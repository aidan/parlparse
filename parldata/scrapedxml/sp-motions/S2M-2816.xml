 *S2M-2816 Christine Grahame: Borders Railway Commitment—That the Parliament, which voted unanimously for the reinstatement of the Waverley Line from Edinburgh to Carlisle, expresses its concern at yet further damaging leaks from the Scottish Executive regarding the Borders railway project and associated costs; believes that the highly conditional commitment made by ministers earlier this year set the bar too high for the people of the Borders and placed all of the risk onto the promoters; notes that this situation has been compounded by the poor presentation of the business case by Scottish Borders Council which has, through its own actions, given ammunition to those opposed to reinstating the line; emphasises the extremely damaging impact to the future economic prospects of the Scottish Borders should the project collapse, and therefore calls on the Executive to make a clear commitment to funding the line, as far as Tweedbank, now.
