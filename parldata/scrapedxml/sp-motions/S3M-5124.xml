*S3M-5124♦ Elaine Murray: Friends of the Earth Report, Wasting Away—That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Government’s zero waste consultation closes on 13 November 2009; expresses disappointment that the plans are not yet consistent with a truly zero waste Scotland; welcomes the Friends of the Earth Scotland report, Wasting Away, which suggests that meeting the best European recycling rates could recover £47 million worth of paper, plastic, metals and other valuable materials every year; considers that recycling this waste would cut greenhouse gas emissions by over four million tonnes; further considers that not producing the waste at all could save almost eight million tonnes; hopes that the Scottish Government will take note of these financial and carbon savings, and would welcome ministers reporting to the Parliament on their conclusions as soon as possible.
