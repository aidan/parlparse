 *S2M-975 Christine Grahame: Gift Aid-That the Parliament notes with concern that the future of at least six of Scotland's leading visitor attractions has been thrown into jeopardy by plans by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to change the rules on gift aid donations to wildlife and heritage charities such as Edinburgh Zoo, Scotland's second most popular visitor attraction, along with five of Scotland's five star visitor attractions, the Royal Yacht Britannia, Discovery Point and Verdant Works, Dundee, the Scottish Seabird Centre, North Berwick, and the Scottish Mining Museum, Newtongrange, which would all, as a consequence, face serious financial difficulties; notes that some of these attractions may even face the possibility of closure should the public's ability to donate their admission charge to these charities be withdrawn, as proposed, in April 2005; notes that these attractions contribute millions of pounds to their local economies and between them employ over 400 people; notes that in 2003 the benefit of gift aid tax rebates to these four attractions accounted for approximately 10 to 20% of their admission income and, given their very marginal commercial viability, they may now have to face some serious choices with regard to their long-term future, and accordingly calls upon the Scottish Executive to make urgent representations to the Chancellor to retain the current gift aid scheme insofar as it affects these vital visitor attractions.
