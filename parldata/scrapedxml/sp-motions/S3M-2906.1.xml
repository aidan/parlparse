*S3M-2906.1 Patrick Harvie: ID Cards—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2906) in the name of Fergus Ewing, insert at end "; welcomes the Scottish Government’s decision to establish an expert group on privacy, which should help to safeguard individual liberty in an increasingly database-driven society; notes, however, that the remit of this group does not currently extend to the Citizen’s Account and national entitlement card schemes, which bear similarities to aspects of the ID card scheme; believes that, for these schemes to be acceptable, it is important that they are assessed for their impact on privacy, and calls on the Scottish Government to extend the remit of the expert group on privacy to include a review of the operation of the Citizen’s Account and national entitlement card schemes."
