 * S2M-2912 Nora Radcliffe: British Heart Foundation Scotland’s Help a Heart Week: 4 to 12 June 2005—That the Parliament recognises that more than 100 Scottish women die from coronary heart disease (CHD) every week; is concerned that too many women believe that CHD is primarily a problem for men, despite the fact that it claims four times more women’s lives than breast cancer; recognises that simple changes to lifestyle, such as taking regular exercise, eating a healthy diet and stopping smoking, can significantly reduce the chances of contracting the disease, and urges the public to support the events taking place across Scotland during the British Heart Foundation’s Help a Heart Week in order to raise awareness of heart disease and its prevention and to help the British Heart Foundation raise the funds it needs to continue to invest in life-saving heart research. Supported by: Eleanor Scott*, Carolyn Leckie*, Karen Whitefield*, Mary Scanlon*, Linda Fabiani*
