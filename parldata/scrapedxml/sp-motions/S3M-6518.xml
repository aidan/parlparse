*S3M-6518 Elaine Smith: Additional Support for Breastfeeding—That the Parliament notes that National Breastfeeding Awareness Week takes place on a new date this year and is scheduled to run from 21 to 27 June 2010, with a number of events being held across Scotland and by NHS Lanarkshire; acknowledges the beneficial impact of breastfeeding on the health and wellbeing of mother and child; recognises that mothers who receive additional support are more likely to breastfeed for longer, bringing greater and more prolonged health benefits; believes that new mothers should be afforded the opportunity of a longer hospital stay to ensure that breastfeeding is established with nursing support; considers that the Breastfeeding etc. (Scotland) Act 2005 is an excellent tool for protecting the child’s right to be breastfed in public places free from harassment and has led to an empowerment of mothers to be confident in public feeding; notes with concern, however, that the latest statistics from NHS Scotland show that younger mothers who live in the most deprived areas are the least likely to breastfeed their babies; acknowledges, therefore, that this is a clear area of social exclusion, and believes that the Scottish Government should promote materials aimed specifically at supporting young mothers in areas of particular socio-economic disadvantage.
