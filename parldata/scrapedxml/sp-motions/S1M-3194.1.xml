 *S1M-3194.1 Roseanna Cunningham: Youth Justiceâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-3194) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from first "notes" to end and insert "recognises continuing public concern about the levels of youth crime; regrets the failure of the Scottish Executive to take effective action to tackle such crime; believes that tackling youth crime effectively and appropriately is a key element in reducing overall levels of crime and fear of crime, and calls upon the Executive to introduce practical measures to prevent youth crime and to ensure that there are sufficient places so that those young offenders who, for their own sake, need to be looked after in secure accommodation are held in conditions appropriate to their age."
