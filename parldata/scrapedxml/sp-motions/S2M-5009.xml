*S2M-5009 Ms Maureen Watt: Dyslexia Awareness Week 2006—That the Parliament notes that Dyslexia Awareness Week will take place between 6 and 12 November 2006 and recognises the importance of such an event in raising the profile of the persistent condition which affects the learning process in one or more of reading, spelling and writing; further notes that one person in 10, which equates to around 505,000 people in Scotland, is thought to be dyslexic to some degree and, of these, one in four could be severely dyslexic; notes that dyslexia is not something to be ashamed of and can occur at any level of intellectual ability but that with early recognition and diagnosis coupled with appropriate timely intervention people with dyslexia can have a successful education and career, and hopes that the awareness week will help better inform people about dyslexia and notify people of the help and assistance available to those who may need it.
