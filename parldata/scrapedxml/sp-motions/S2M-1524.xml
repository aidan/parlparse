 *S2M-1524 Christine Grahame: Big Business for Borders Rail-That the Parliament welcomes the support given to the restoration of the Waverley Line by major business leaders of BT Scotland, Standard Life, Scottish Widows and the public sector employer, NHS Lothian, the Borders being the only region in Western Europe currently without a railway station and with poor road links; endorses the comments made by Brendan Dick of BT Scotland that the rail link would help to address the needs of the capital in terms of workforce, congestion and "the benefits to the long-term viability of the Borders economy are also clear to see"; further endorses the comments made by Dermot Gorman of NHS Lothian who, as a large employer, welcomes an initiative allowing a pool of people to be available to ease recruitment problems; believes that the railway would open up a new commuter market for vacancies, helping to raise the average earnings in the Borders, currently 21% lower than the Scottish rate, and calls on the Scottish Executive to stop procrastinating over the business case and to give its unconditional support to the Waverley Line by ensuring that the £130 million funding is provided now.
