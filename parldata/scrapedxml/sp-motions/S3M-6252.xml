*S3M-6252 Ian McKee: Edinburgh Best Tourist Destination in Britain—That the Parliament notes with interest the recent TripAdvisor poll of millions of travellers worldwide that puts Edinburgh at the top of the 25 most popular tourist destinations in the United Kingdom, 21st in the world and seventh-best European nightlife destination; believes that this is yet more evidence of a successful tourism industry that has continued to attract tourists from across the globe despite the economic recession; considers that Edinburgh’s hospitality and tourism sectors are rising to the challenge in making Scotland’s capital one of the most visited cities in the world, and hopes that the survey will encourage other Scottish cities to compete and sell themselves as international destinations of choice.
