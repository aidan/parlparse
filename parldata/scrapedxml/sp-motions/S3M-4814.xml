 *S3M-4814# Angela Constance: Bausch and Lomb Job losses in Livingston—That the Parliament regrets the decision by Bausch and Lomb to pursue closure of its manufacturing plant in Livingston; is deeply concerned that this will result in the loss of 500 jobs; notes that unemployment in West Lothian is at its highest in a decade; applauds the productive, skilled and committed workforce, which has been crucial to the success and efficiency of the Livingston site; also regrets the Bausch and Lomb plans to remove production from Livingston to the Republic of Ireland and is concerned that some of the reasons for this decision include the higher costs involved in closing the Irish site, lower corporation tax in the Republic of Ireland and the lack of access to additional funding streams, given that West Lothian lost its Regional Selective Assistance status in 2006; considers that the 90-day statutory consultation period and plans for phased closure will afford an opportunity for all alternatives to be extensively explored with a view to saving jobs in Livingston; also notes that both Bausch and Lomb and the Scottish Government have confirmed their commitment to continue their dialogue; hopes that both the Scottish Government and Bausch and Lomb will respectfully and meaningfully listen to the views of staff and their representatives, and welcomes the cross-party and community-wide support for the workforce and the determination to succeed that exists in West Lothian despite the current economic challenges.
