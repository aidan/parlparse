 *S1M-3449 Fiona Hyslop: Disabled Persons Housing Service (Lothian)—That the Parliament notes with serious concern that the Disabled Persons Housing Service (Lothian) (DPHS) has announced that it will need to close on 31 December 2002 owing to a lack of financial support from City of Edinburgh Council; notes that this service is internationally renowned; recalls that cross-party support was expressed for DPHS, including the support of ministers, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to consider securing properly the future funding of DPHS and extending the service to other areas of the country in order to ensure that strategies to improve equality can help deliver services to those that need them.Supported by: Linda Fabiani*
