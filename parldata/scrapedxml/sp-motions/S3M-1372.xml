*S3M-1372 Jamie Hepburn: Pension Rights for Injured Firefighters—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the Scottish Government to issue new guidance on protecting the pension rights of firefighters disabled in the line of duty; believes that the previous system whereby seriously injured firefighters assessed as fit to carry out desk duties could lose their pension rights even if no alternative post could be found for them was inherently unfair, and congratulates the Fire Brigades Union for its success in campaigning for this new guidance.
