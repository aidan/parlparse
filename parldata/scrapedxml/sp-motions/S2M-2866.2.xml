 * S2M-2866.2 Mr Jim Wallace: Student and Graduate Debt—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2866) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from “notes with concern” to end and insert “agrees that the support arrangements for students ordinarily resident in Scotland should continue to be based on fairness and affordability; agrees that such a system should include free tuition, regardless of family income, and bursary support for those from less well-off backgrounds; welcomes the increased level of the Young Students’ Bursary and its extended eligibility; notes that liable graduates pay the graduate endowment in respect of the higher education benefits that they have received with the payments adding to the fund to pay support bursaries for students from poorer backgrounds, and recognises that the publication of the survey of Scottish students’ income and expenditure, later this year, will allow for a better understanding of the situation facing students and the continued development of policy to meet their needs.” Supported by: Allan Wilson*
