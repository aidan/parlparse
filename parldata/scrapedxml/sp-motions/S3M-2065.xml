*S3M-2065 Hugh O’Donnell: Counter-Terrorism Bill—That the Parliament expresses its concern over measures contained in the UK Government’s new Counter-Terrorism Bill; agrees with the Law Society of Scotland that proposals that will allow terrorism offences committed in Scotland to be tried in any court in the United Kingdom will undermine the primacy of Scottish courts and the office of the Lord Advocate; opposes plans to extend the pre-charge detention limit beyond 28 days, and agrees with human rights groups such as Liberty, Amnesty International, JUSTICE and the Scottish-Islamic Foundation that such measures are unnecessary and erode the very civil liberties that we wish to safeguard.
