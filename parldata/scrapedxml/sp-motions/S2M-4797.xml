 *S2M-4797 Pauline McNeill: One Planet Living—That the Parliament acknowledges that, based on the average ecological footprint of current lifestyles in Scotland, if everyone in the world lived this way we would need three planets to survive; recognises that this cannot be sustainable and that moving towards "one planet living" is the only solution; warmly welcomes the constructive WWF Scotland package which promotes simple ways for each individual and government to reduce their footprint and move towards "one planet living"; recognises that in areas like food, transport and energy we can all make significant reductions to our footprint just by making different choices like buying local, fresh, seasonal, organic, fair trade food when we can, and notes that these choices are not only better for us, but better for the planet and the Scottish economy. Supported by: Margaret Jamieson*, Mrs Nanette Milne*, Christine May*, Dr Elaine Murray*, Murray Tosh*, Murdo Fraser*, Richard Lochhead*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Mr Mark Ruskell*, Bruce Crawford*, Dr Jean Turner*, Maureen Macmillan*, Sarah Boyack*, Eleanor Scott*, Kate Maclean*, Robin Harper*, Cathy Peattie*, Chris Ballance*, Cathie Craigie*, Bristow Muldoon*, Margaret Smith*, Alex Fergusson*, Rob Gibson*, Ms Sandra White*, Nora Radcliffe*, Mr Kenneth Macintosh*, Trish Godman*
