 *S3M-5155 Stewart Maxwell: Congratulations to Medics Against Violence—That the Parliament congratulates Medics Against Violence (MAV) for its recent recognition at the Scottish Policing Awards for an outstanding contribution to tackling violent knife crime; notes that the educational programme created by MAV was established to teach young people about the dangers of violence and weapon carrying and has been running in schools across the west of Scotland for the last year; recognises that the experience of MAV’s founding members, Dr Christine Goodall, an academic oral surgeon, and Mark Devlin and David Koppel, both maxillofacial surgeons, is invaluable in showing young people the consequences of violent knife crime; notes the contribution of the Violence Reduction Unit, the World Health Organization and, in particular, Campus Police Officer PC Geoff Smith in making the programme a success; applauds the commitment shown by the programme’s many dedicated volunteers, and supports any future initiatives that aim to raise awareness of the impact of violence-related injuries, particularly those caused by knife crime. Supported by: Stuart McMillan*, Rob Gibson*, Gil Paterson*, Jackie Baillie*, Patrick Harvie*, Aileen Campbell*, Anne McLaughlin*, Mike Pringle*, Bob Doris*, Robin Harper*, Bill Wilson*, Joe FitzPatrick*
