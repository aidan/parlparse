 *S3M-7693.1 Gavin Brown: Electricity Market Reform—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7693) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from "at a minimum" to end and insert "not be changed in any way that has a negative impact on Scotland; believes that the Parliament should continue to use these powers in support of the development of Scotland’s low-carbon energy potential; supports the continuation of nuclear power as a vital part of Scotland’s diverse energy mix, and calls on the UK Government and Scottish Government to work together to help fulfil Scotland’s low-carbon potential."
