*S1M-3490 Ms Margo MacDonald: Alain Baxter and the IOC—That the Parliament condemns the International Olympic Committee (IOC) for its failure to institute a standard of testing methamphetamine in Alain Baxter’s test sample that would have shown conclusively that he did not enhance his performance in winning the bronze medal at the 2002 Winter Olympics through illegal use of the stimulant d-methamphetamine; notes that the nasal spray that caused amphetamine to be registered in his test contained l-methamphetamine, acknowledged by Professor Arnold Beckett, formerly a member of the IOC medical commission, to be a non-stimulant, would have had no effect whatsoever on Alain Baxter’s performance, and therefore urges the IOC to reinstate Alain Baxter’s Olympic medal, after complying with the recommendation of the Court of Arbitration for Sport in respect of Alain Baxter's appeal, that it should revisit its testing process for methamphetamine
