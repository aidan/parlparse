*S3M-4476 Patrick Harvie: Child Safety Week, 22 to 28 June 2009—That the Parliament notes the beginning of Child Safety Week from 22 to 28 June 2009; recognises that unintentional injury is the most common cause of emergency hospital admissions and second only to cancers as a cause of death for Scottish children; recognises that the recently published 2009 Child Safety Report Card gave Scotland only a fair grading for progress toward reducing child injuries and injury-related death; accepts that too many Scottish children are unnecessarily hurt or killed each year through unintentional injuries that are largely preventable, and calls on the Scottish Government to provide stronger leadership, improved effort and increased resources for child injury prevention and child safety initiatives.
