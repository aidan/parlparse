*S2M-3490.3 Robert Brown: Children with Special Needs—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3490) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from "; acknowledges" to end and insert "and that, prior to the enactment of the Standards in Scotland’s Schools etc. Act 2000, many children were denied access to such benefits; acknowledges that meeting the needs of the individual child is of paramount importance and that a range of mainstream, specialist and mixed provision will always be necessary; notes that there has been a net increase of 28 special schools and units since 1997, which demonstrates the continuing commitment of local authorities and the Scottish Executive to specialist provision where appropriate, and believes that, following the Parliament’s recent approval, the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 will, when it comes into force on 14 November 2005, strengthen the rights of children and their parents to ensure that their additional support needs are met fully, whatever the school setting."
