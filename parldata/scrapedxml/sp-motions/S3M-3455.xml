*S3M-3455 Peter Peacock: Titian’s Diana and Actaeon—That the Parliament welcomes the continuing availability of Titian’s Diana and Actaeon for viewing in Scotland into the future; regrets the manner in which this issue arose and the threat to a Scottish future for this painting brought about by the approach of the Duke of Sutherland; calls on the Duke of Sutherland to remove any similar threat now or into the future to any other painting currently housed in Scotland by donating those paintings to the national galleries of London and Scotland; further urges the Duke of Sutherland to donate the £50 million received for Titian’s Diana and Actaeon to the people of Sutherland, the Highlands and Scotland more widely as one small step toward redeeming a tarnished reputation.
