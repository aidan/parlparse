*S3M-5624 Marilyn Livingstone: Proposed Removal of the Concessionary Rail Scheme in Fifeâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern proposals by Fife Council to remove or downgrade the concessionary rail travel scheme in Fife in which elderly and disabled passengers are entitled to discounted off-peak rail travel throughout Fife and to Edinburgh, Dundee and Perth; considers that proposals, from removal of the scheme to limited travel concessions within Fife, will put at risk the social, leisure and community benefits enjoyed by thousands of Fifers; notes that in 2009 there were over 420,000 journeys made by concessionary travel cardholders; believes that the scheme contributes to the quality of life and confidence of its users; acknowledges that 40% of Fife Elderly Forum members and user panels that responded to a recent questionnaire said that they wanted the scheme to continue, with 15% confirming that they would be willing to pay more than the current 50p rate if it would allow the scheme to continue, and urges Fife Council to reconsider its position on devaluing the rail concessionary scheme.
