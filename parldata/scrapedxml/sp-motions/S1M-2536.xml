*S1M-2536 Nora Radcliffe: European Notes and Coins—That the Parliament notes that the introduction of the new notes and coins for the single European currency on 1 January 2002 will begin the phasing out of the existing currencies of the eurozone; further notes that a recent survey found that the average British household presently has £35 worth of EU coins squirreled away, which suggests that up to £80 million’s worth of left-over holiday money, which will become worthless after the changeover, may be presently lying about in Scotland, and urges all Scots to take advantage of the schemes run by banks to facilitate the donation of these monies to charities in the run-up to Christmas. Supported by: John Farquhar Munro*, Dennis Canavan*
