*S1M-2973 Tommy Sheridan: James Sabzali—That the Parliament condemns the conviction of Canadian-born businessman James Sabzali in the United States of America for the violation of Washington’s economic blockade against Cuba by selling water purification chemicals to the Cuban government; notes that the water purification chemicals sold to Cuba are used to purify the water which goes to Cuban schools and homes; further notes that James Sabzali could face a sentence of up to 205 years in prison and that he is the only foreign national ever to be prosecuted for alleged violation of the 1917 Trading with the Enemy Act; believes that this conviction is yet another reason why the United States of America’s illegal economic blockade of Cuba must be lifted immediately, and recognises that the USA is in breach of international law and opinion by refusing to accept UN resolutions passed over the last decade demanding an end to its destructive and damaging economic blockade of Cuba.
