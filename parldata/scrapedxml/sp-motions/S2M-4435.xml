 *S2M-4435 Donald Gorrie: Competition Commission Decision on Merger of Waterstone’s and Ottakar’s—That the Parliament is concerned about the Competition Commission’s statement accepting the merger between Waterstone’s and Ottakar’s bookshops, ignoring the strong arguments opposing the merger put forward by many interested bodies in Scotland, the different position in Scotland in relation to competition between booksellers and the treatment of Scottish titles by some major retailers; regards this as yet another example of the UK system favouring the growth of large retail businesses and causing the demise of more and more small, independent shops in Scotland, and commits itself to pressing the UK Government, the Westminster Parliament and the Scottish Executive to promote cultural and social diversity, and calls on the UK Government to direct the Competition Commision to take account of these issues. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
