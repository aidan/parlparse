 *S3M-2016 Elaine Smith: Postcode Lottery for Sufferers of DMD—That the Parliament expresses concern that people who suffer from Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a severe and progressive genetic muscle-wasting disease predominantly affecting boys and for which there is currently no cure, are dying in Scotland years earlier then their counterparts in England; believes that an improvement in the life expectancy and experiences of these young people must be a priority for the Scottish Government; considers that currently the care and management of the disease in Scotland is very much a postcode lottery as are the grants available for housing adaptations; notes that in the rest of the United Kingdom families with disabled children get £30,000 grants to adapt their homes, which are not means tested; calls for similar measures to be introduced in Scotland alongside enhanced medical research and better support services and equipment; recognises that the implementation of such measures can make a massive difference to the quality of life of people with DMD and can contribute to extending their life expectancy; welcomes the calls from Action Duchenne for a centre of excellence to be set up in Glasgow that will bring standards of care and treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy up to those seen in centres of excellence in Newcastle and London, and calls for funding and support from the Scottish Government to deliver this centre of neuromuscular excellence to provide services across Scotland, thus ensuring best practice and dispersing standards of care into local clinics throughout Scotland.
