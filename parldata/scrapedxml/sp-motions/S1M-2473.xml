*S1M-2473# Robin Harper: Moratorium on Sea Cage Fish Farming—That the Parliament notes the responsibility of government to comply with Directive 2000/60/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2000 establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (the Water Framework Directive) in maintaining the quality of rivers, lochs and coastal waters; further notes concerns regarding aquaculture-related environmental impacts voiced in the Transport and the Environment Committee’s inquiry into caged fish farming, and considers that the Scottish Executive should instigate a moratorium on the further expansion of intensive, large scale sea-cage fish farming until such time as the environmental carrying capacity of Scotland’s aquatic environment for aquaculture activity has been comprehensively determined, such a moratorium to exclude the undertaking of sea cage fish farming at new sites for the purposes of good husbandry and mitigating environmental impact.
