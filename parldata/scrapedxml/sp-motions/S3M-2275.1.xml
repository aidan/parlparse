*S3M-2275.1 Robert Brown: Working Creatively for Scotland: Glasgow Science Centre—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2275) in the name of Sandra White, insert at end "regrets however that the Scottish Government saw fit to slash funding for the Glasgow Science Centre by 40%; believes that such a funding level, if not remedied following the Cabinet Secretary’s discussions, will damage the ability of the Glasgow Science Centre to maintain and develop its services and to inspire young people in Glasgow and across Scotland with interest in science, and regrets the low priority the SNP government appears to give to supporting and encouraging interest in science in Scotland." Supported by: Jackie Baillie*, Jim Tolson*, Alison McInnes*, Ross Finnie*, Mike Pringle*, Hugh Henry*, Dr Richard Simpson*, Karen Gillon*, Ken Macintosh*, Hugh O’Donnell* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
