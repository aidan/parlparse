 *S1M-3672 Michael Russell: Act of Settlement-That the Parliament recalls motion S1M-117 which it passed unanimously on 16 December 1999, condemning the Act of Settlement 1701 as an unacceptable piece of legislation that institutionalises religious discrimination and prejudice; deeply regrets that, despite an on-going campaign in Scotland and England which has involved MPs of all parties over the last three years, the Prime Minister has yet again refused to introduce legislation at Westminster to repeal the act; condemns the Prime Minister and his government for such intransigence and for their failure to take this action, which would give an example and encouragement to those that highlight the need to reject all manifestations of sectarianism and bigotry, and renews its call for the Act of Settlement 1701 to be repealed as a matter of urgency.
