*S2M-4661 Ms Sandra White: Congratulations to Tenant Managed Homes in Drumchapel on "see something, say something"â€”That the Parliament commends the management and staff of Tenant Managed Homes (TMH) in Drumchapel, Glasgow, for their successful and inclusive approach to the reduction of anti-social behaviour in the Drumchapel housing scheme; notes the consensual agreements through which TMH draws the families of young people with a history of offending into caring for the surroundings which they share with their neighbours; congratulates them on the highly successful roadshow programme for use in local schools which highlights, to those most likely to offend, the fears of neighbours and the social and financial costs of anti-social behaviour and points out the dangers of such behaviour for all concerned, and congratulates TMH on its "see something, say something" campaign which involves the whole community and all local agencies, including the Community Safety Forum and the police, in successfully tackling anti-social behaviour.
