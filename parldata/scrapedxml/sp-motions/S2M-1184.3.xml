*S2M-1184.3 Carolyn Leckie: Mental Health-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1184) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "through" to end and insert "; notes that mental health problems disproportionately affect those living in deprived areas and that despite the Executive's commitment to tackling mental health problems as a priority, mental health services remain underfunded and overstretched in many parts of Scotland; believes that abolishing prescription charges would help to address the poverty trap faced by mental health service users who return to work, and further believes that more resources should be directed towards treatment and rehabilitation in community settings, that there should be a greater emphasis on children's mental health, that in-patient treatment facilities should be housed in modern buildings, accessible to the communities that they serve, that more practical and financial support should be given to the families and other carers of those experiencing mental health problems and that, as a priority, a well-resourced, independent national advocacy service for users of mental health services should be established in Scotland."
