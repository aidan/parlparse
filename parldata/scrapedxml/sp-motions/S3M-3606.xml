*S3M-3606 Christine Grahame: Cruelty of Snaring Exposed—That the Parliament considers that authenticated footage, filmed on Tuesday 24 February 2009 and published by Advocates for Animals, showing a young badger caught in a legal snare has demonstrated that these traps are cruel, distressing and indiscriminate; notes that disturbance of the surrounding area and the fact that the badger had almost chewed through the steel cable of the snare, injuring its mouth in the process, indicated that it had been struggling desperately for many hours before its discovery; believes that had this badger, a protected species, not been found, it might have died a lingering and agonising death; believes that this incident is not isolated but is proof that regulating snares will not work, and therefore urges the Scottish Government to legislate to ban snares without delay.
