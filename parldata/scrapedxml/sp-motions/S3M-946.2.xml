*S3M-946.2 Ted Brocklebank: St Andrew’s Day—As an amendment to motion (S3M-946) in the name of Linda Fabiani, leave out from "to both celebrate" to end and insert "both to celebrate what it means to be Scottish in the 21st century and to promote a fair and inclusive society; notes the Scottish Government’s proactive support of a programme of events throughout the country and all of Scotland’s cities, including the cathedral city of St Andrews itself and urges it to build on St Andrew’s Day as a launch-pad for a winter tourist season; commends the work of schools and community groups across Scotland in teaching our young people about St Andrew’s Day and its importance in a national as well as an international context and promoting diversity through their celebrations, and furthermore thanks the St Andrew’s societies, Caledonian societies, Scottish Development International, Globalscots, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and all the other overseas organisations who have planned over 100 wide-ranging celebrations in countries around the world."
