 *S2M-164 Trish Godman: Ferguson's Shipyard, Port Glasgow-That the Parliament is of the view that Ferguson's Shipyard, Port Glasgow, is one of the very best shipyards in Europe and believes that it is of the utmost importance, for both the economy of the lower Clyde and the Scottish shipbuilding industry, that the Scottish Executive does all in its power to ensure that the management and workforce at the yard are given every encouragement to bid for orders that, going by the yard's excellent record, would be built on time, to cost and to the highest levels of quality of design and construction.
