 *S3M-3475 Pauline McNeill: Student Movement Supports Gaza—That the Parliament welcomes the day of fundraising at the University of Glasgow for all those affected by the recent conflict in Gaza; notes that the day of fundraising, which will be held on Friday 20 February 2009 and is being organised by the Students’ Representative Council, will offer staff and students the opportunity to contribute to the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) Gaza Crisis appeal as well as to funds being collected for Save a Child’s Heart, an Israeli-based charity that supports children from developing nations who suffer from heart disease, with half of the beneficiaries of that charity being Palestinian children; further notes that the day of fundraising follows on from students at Edinburgh, Glasgow, Strathclyde and St Andrews universities taking a stance on the situation in the occupied territories and the Gaza Strip, and congratulates the student community for engaging with this issue and pressing the international community to work together to bring about justice for Palestinians and a peaceful two-state solution.
