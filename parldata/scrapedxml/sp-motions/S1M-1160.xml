*S1M-1160# Elaine Smith: Permitted Telecommunications Developments-That the Parliament expresses its concern over the proliferation of "permitted development" notices which local authorities have received on behalf of telecommunications companies since the report of the Transport and the Environment Committee on telecommunications developments; views the inability of local authorities to control the siting of these "permitted developments" as a temporary loophole in the planning process and asks that the telecommunications companies involved, specifically those who have served notices to erect three masts near Stepps Primary School in the Coatbridge &amp; Chryston constituency, conduct meaningful consultation with the local communities affected on the siting of these masts and, where agreement cannot be reached, impose a voluntary moratorium on their siting until such times as new planning legislation is brought forward.
