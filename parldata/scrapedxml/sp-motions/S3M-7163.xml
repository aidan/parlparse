 *S3M-7163 Nigel Don: Learn to Sign Week 2010—That the Parliament supports Learn to Sign Week 2010, which runs from 4 to 10 October 2010; notes that there are approximately 3,500 deaf children in Scotland, 90% of whom are born to hearing parents with little or no prior knowledge of deafness; acknowledges with concern that the parents of deaf children who use British Sign Language (BSL) have to pay to learn sign language to communicate with their children and understands that many parents cannot learn at all due to lack of local access to courses in some areas of the country; welcomes the work of the National Deaf Children’s Society (NDCS) Scotland to achieve a world without barriers for every deaf child; congratulates the charity on the development of its innovative Family Sign Language website, which offers families of deaf children the opportunity to learn some BSL by introducing a curriculum that is practical for communicating specifically with children and is available to all families of deaf children throughout the country who have access to the internet, and encourages all MSPs to log on to the NDCS Family Sign Language website and to learn some BSL skills during Learn to Sign week 2010.
