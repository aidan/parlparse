*S3M-6083 Irene Oldfather: Northern Ireland Committee Votes to Ban Snares—That the Parliament congratulates the Northern Ireland Assembly’s Environment Committee for taking decisive action to end the suffering to animals caused by snares; welcomes that the committee has voted to ban snares under the new Wildlife and Natural Environment Bill and considers that, in doing so, has taken a policy decision based on the clear evidence that snares cause suffering and the overwhelming public support for an end to the use of these cruel, indiscriminate traps, and therefore congratulates the League Against Cruel Sports for its efforts in raising awareness of the issue and presenting evidence of the cruelty of snaring to support this decision.
