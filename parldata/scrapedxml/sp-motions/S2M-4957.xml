*S2M-4957 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Local Foods for Local Kidsâ€”That the Parliament notes the success of the local food procurement scheme in East Ayrshire, whereby local primary schools were able to serve healthy, nutritious meals prepared using locally produced foods; recognises that food miles now account for nearly 30% of goods transported on our roads and that this travel adds substantially to the carbon dioxide emissions that are contributing to climate change; notes that a recent report by the Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs states that food miles rose by 15% between 1992 and 2002; further notes that the use of locally produced foods adds a further market for local farmers, while educating children about farming and environmental issues; notes that under EU tendering regulations procurement officers are not permitted to state that they want only local produce, and accordingly calls on the Scottish Executive to seek a derogation from these regulations to ensure that local authorities can purchase locally produced foods.
