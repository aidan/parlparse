*S3M-7892 Kenneth Gibson: Alcohol Minimum Pricing—That the Parliament welcomes news that the UK Government plans to introduce a minimum price for alcohol in England and Wales later in 2011; recognises that there are plans for a trial in Manchester with alcohol at 50p per unit; understands that, even with this relatively modest increase in the basic price, research indicates that this would result in 3,000 fewer deaths every year and 41,000 fewer cases of chronic illness each year if implemented across England and Wales; further welcomes the news that Labour has backed these proposals, which it believes will have a huge positive impact on the health and wellbeing of English and Welsh citizens; believes that the unionist parties in Scotland should now back proposals of the Scottish Government to introduce a minimum price for alcohol in order to tackle Scotland’s unhealthy relationship with alcohol, and believes that a new Bill specifically with that intention should be introduced early in the next session.
