*S3M-7923.2 Des McNulty: Early Intervention in Health and Education—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7923) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from first "supports" to end and insert "believes that NHS boards and local authorities working with third sector organisations and volunteers must give children’s community services more integrated resources; recognises the valuable role being played by Sure Start and Family Centres and expresses concern regarding the impact of funding reductions on low-income families; further believes that health visitors linked with a GP practice and social workers have a key role to play in assessing, advising and supporting the parents of babies and very young children, especially young mums; welcomes the nurse family partnership pilots but proposes that Health for All Children 4 guidance should now be reviewed; considers that families should be partners in determining how services, including parenting support, should be provided; believes that early education and care is vital in providing a positive start for every child as well as in identifying and overcoming barriers to learning such as poor language and communication skills; believes that, where a child is at risk of neglect or abuse, a strict timeline for intervention is required, and welcomes the pilot being undertaken by Glasgow City Council, ensuring that giving every child the best chance in life as well as the protection of the child are the overriding considerations."
