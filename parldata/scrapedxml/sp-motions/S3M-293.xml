*S3M-293 Sandra White: Star Asset—That the Parliament congratulates Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum on receiving a five-star award from VisitScotland, the national tourism agency’s highest award for visitor attractions, and on VisitScotland’s decision, through the International Star Registry, to have a star in the Pegasus constellation named Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum and believes that, as Kelvingrove prepares to celebrate its first anniversary after reopening, it has gone from strength to strength in becoming the most visited gallery outside London and an invaluable asset to Scotland.
