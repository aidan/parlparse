 *S3M-642.1 Kenneth Gibson: Nobel Peace Prize—As an amendment to motion (S3M-642) in the name of Patrick Harvie, insert at end "believes, however, that the public is becoming increasingly scunnered at being lectured on the need to make personal sacrifices for the sake of the planet by actors, singers and former US presidential hopefuls who are seen to minimise their own tax contributions towards global warming by the expedient of having offshore accounts and highly skilled tax advisors, fly across the world on private jets, own a number of large properties in different parts of the globe, are driven around in gas-guzzling limousines and who have a correspondingly large carbon footprint; believes that cynicism on the need to make lifestyle choices would be tempered if the public saw celebrities and high-profile former politicians actually lead from the front on this issue rather than preach to everyone else; recognises that green politics can be seen as a way of extorting higher taxation from the public, rather than for improving the environment, and urges greater transparency in ensuring that revenues raised are actually invested in projects that directly counter global warming."
