 *S3M-4726 Stuart McMillan: On Your Bike—That the Parliament recognises the initiative to get people cycling in the Scottish Government’s Smarter Choices, Smarter Places scheme; acknowledges the £5 million being spent in Scotland over the next three years to encourage people to cycle more; commends the seven areas of Dundee, Glasgow’s east end, Falkirk, Dumfries, East Renfrewshire, East Dunbartonshire and Orkney for taking forward the project; congratulates the Scottish Government on its aim to get 10% of the population out of their cars and on their bikes; welcomes the inclusion in the initiative of projects such as self-service cycle hire schemes, Get Cycling road shows in schools, upgrading cycling and walking routes and improving public cycle storage facilities and bike racks, and encourages people to take up the challenge of using their cars less in order to create a greener and healthier Scotland.
