*S1M-3248.1 Nicola Sturgeon: Action on Waiting and Delayed Dischargeâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-3248) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "delivering" to end and insert "the face of increasing in-patient and out-patient waiting times; is extremely concerned at the disturbing findings of the recent Audit Scotland report, Review of the management of waiting lists in Scotland; calls for deferred waiting lists to be abolished and for all patients to be given a maximum waiting time guarantee; supports the work of the National Waiting Times Unit but calls on the Scottish Executive to give a commitment that HCI will be used exclusively for NHS patients in Scotland, and supports more vigorous action on a range of fronts to reduce waiting times and the delays experienced by patients awaiting discharge from hospital."
