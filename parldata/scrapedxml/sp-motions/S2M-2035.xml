 *S2M-2035 Des McNulty: No More Bhopals—That the Parliament notes that 3 December 2004 marks the 20th anniversary of the world’s worst peacetime chemical disaster in Bhopal, India, in which 27 tonnes of lethal gases leaked from Union Carbide’s pesticide factory, immediately killing 8,000 people and poisoning thousands of others from toxic exposure in the years since; notes that at least 150,000 people, including children born to parents who survived the disaster, are still suffering from exposure-related health effects; supports the demands of survivors and relatives for justice by calling for the Dow Chemical Company, which now wholly owns Union Carbide, to ensure the clean-up of contamination in Bhopal, to release medical information about the toxicity of methyl isocyanate and poison gases, to arrange for the long-term medical treatment and rehabilitation of survivors, to arrange for the long-term economic rehabilitation of survivors whose livelihoods have suffered as a consequence of the disaster and to produce Union Carbide to face trial in the ongoing criminal proceedings in India, and calls for the international community to take every step necessary to ensure that no community, in Scotland or elsewhere in the world, faces the threat or risk of a similar disaster.
