*S3M-3533 Pauline McNeill: Scottish Government Should Set Fairtrade Example—That the Parliament welcomes Fairtrade Fortnight; notes that the Scottish Government spends almost £100 million on food for schools, hospitals and workplaces every year and calls on it to set a positive example by ensuring that at least 10% of this expenditure is spent on fairtrade products, thereby making Edinburgh the fairtrade capital of Europe, and recognises that this target would set a great example to supermarkets, businesses and consumers and that the fairtrade movement has made a real difference to the lives of some of the world’s poorest people by ensuring that farmers and workers get a fair price from the trade of their products and making a vital contribution to combating poverty.
