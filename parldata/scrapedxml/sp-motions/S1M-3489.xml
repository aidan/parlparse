*S1M-3489# John Scott: Increased Workload of GPs Under the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000â€”That the Parliament notes the increased workload being generated for general practitioners through the additional duties and responsibilities being placed on them by provisions under Part 5 of the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000 which deals with medical treatment and research; recognises the problems this is creating for GPs in treating and caring effectively for patients and, in particular, the elderly, and invites the Scottish Executive to consult as a matter of urgency with the primary care sector to gauge and monitor the impact of these provisions on the workload of GPs, with a view to bringing forward the necessary amendments to the Act which will allow GPs to treat their patients in a more considered and proper manner.
