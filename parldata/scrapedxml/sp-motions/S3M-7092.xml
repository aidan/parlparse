*S3M-7092 Kenneth Gibson: Naming of the RV Actiniaâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the University Marine Biological Station Millport (UMBSM) on the naming of its new research vessel, named RV Actinia after the beadlet anemone common on the shores of Cumbrae, by Dame Jenny Abramsky, Chair of the Board of Trustees at the University of London, on 24 September 2010; is aware that the RV Actinia operates primarily from Millport in and around the Clyde Sea Area but is also able to work in any coastal waters; acknowledges that her main roles involve taking students out to sea, hydrographic and benthic sampling, trawling, creeling, surveying and providing a platform for scientific divers and remotely operated underwater vehicles; considers that UMBSM, the national facility for marine biology fieldwork, is ideally situated for marine biological teaching and research, being sheltered and within easy reach of a diversity of marine habitats, such as rocky, sandy and muddy shores, salt marshes, a large estuary and deep water with soft mud, gravel and rocky bottoms; understands that UMBSM is formally an institution of the University of London, with a special relationship with the University of Glasgow, and provides marine biological teaching support for both universities while enjoying a substantial role in providing facilities and logistical support for field teaching by universities and schools throughout the United Kingdom; further understands that current research programmes include work on marine fisheries, biodiversity, marine fouling and marine microbiology; considers that this new vessel represents a significant investment by the University of London, the University of Glasgow, the Higher Education Funding Council for England and the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council in the teaching of marine science in the UK, and agrees that the 1,500 students who attend field studies courses at UMBSM each year and the Cumbrae economy will surely benefit.
