 *S2M-1784.3 Malcolm Chisholm: Centralisation of Health Services—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1784) in the name of Mr David Davidson, leave out from "is opposed" to end and insert "acknowledges public concern about the extent of proposed centralisation of health services across Scotland; believes that improvement is essential to ensure that all patients have access to both high-quality specialist services and appropriate medical care delivered locally; recognises that NHS boards must pursue clinical strategies which demonstrate regional planning; notes that boundaries are irrelevant to patients; welcomes the determination of the Scottish Executive to develop the planning of healthcare services across NHS board boundaries, within the context of a national strategy; notes the work of the Parliament’s Health Committee on this issue; welcomes the decision of the Minister for Health and Community Care to make no decision on new proposals for service change that come before him until such times as the Expert Advisory Group chaired by Professor David Kerr has reported; notes that this provides an opportunity to debate what services are best provided locally, regionally and nationally and that the presumption in the interim is that services will be maintained unless there are genuine issues of clinical safety, agreed by the Minister; affirms the Executive policy outlined in Partnership for Care that the patient must be at the centre of the process, and supports a patient-centred policy that acknowledges safety and quality and that also ensures that as many services as possible are provided locally."
