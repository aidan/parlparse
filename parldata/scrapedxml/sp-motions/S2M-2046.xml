*S2M-2046 Rosie Kane: Ay Family Finally Granted Asylum in Germany—That the Parliament notes with relief and approval the final German court ruling, valid as of 16 November 2004, that granted the children Newroz and Medya Ay, and by extension the other two children and Mrs Ay, asylum and the unlimited right to stay in Germany; notes that the court believed that the mental health of the two children would deteriorate very quickly, to the point of potential suicide, if they were deported to Turkey and was convinced by the medical and psychological reports provided by Professor H Zeitlin (United Kingdom) and Dr Jack Boyle (Scotland) that judged the children to be suffering from serious mental disorders and post-traumatic stress syndrome; notes that the children’s incarceration in Dungavel is explicitly mentioned in the ruling along with the extensive media coverage in Britain and Turkey; congratulates both the German lawyer, Herr Ross, and Scottish lawyer, Aamer Anwar, whose expertise, compassion and sheer determination helped to achieve this result, along with the Herald, Green Party staff in the German Bundestag and all the asylum seekers’ organisations in England, Scotland and Germany, and regrets that the Scottish Executive and the UK Home Office were not able to show the same compassion and courage as the German court in finally granting this persecuted family a safe haven in a European country which will now allow them to settle down, continue their schooling, recover their mental health and rebuild their lives together.
