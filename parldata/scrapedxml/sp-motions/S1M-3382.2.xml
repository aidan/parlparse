*S1M-3382.2 Mr David Davidson: Spending Review 2002—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3382) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "commends" to end and insert "notes the Scottish Executive’s spending plans for 2003-04 to 2005-06, which are funded as a result of the swingeing increases in taxation which were a feature of the 2002 UK Budget; expresses concern about the sustainability of such levels of expenditure; believes that without major reform of public services the proposed spending increases will not produce the value for money improvements expected by the Scottish people, and calls on the Scottish Executive to provide a boost to the economy by reducing the burden of business rates".
