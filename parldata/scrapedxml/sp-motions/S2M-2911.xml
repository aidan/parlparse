* S2M-2911# John Home Robertson: Affordable Rented Housing—That the Parliament is concerned about the shortage of affordable rented housing in many communities and the fact that some applicants in overcrowded or unsuitable accommodation can be stuck on waiting lists for years, while others may be compelled to buy or rent housing that they cannot afford; suggests that there is a need for a clearer definition of affordability for the purposes of housing policy; welcomes initiatives by the Scottish Executive to help councils and registered social landlords to increase the supply of affordable housing, including prudential borrowing to fund new building; recognises that the high cost of development land is hindering that policy, and believes that there is a case for further measures to help local authorities to acquire and secure land for affordable housing in the Executive’s proposed Planning Bill. Supported by: Murray Tosh*, Linda Fabiani*, Nora Radcliffe*, Dr Sylvia Jackson*, Alex Fergusson*, Maureen Macmillan*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Dr Elaine Murray*, Rob Gibson*, John Scott*
