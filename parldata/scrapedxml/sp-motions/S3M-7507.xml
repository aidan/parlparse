*S3M-7507 Robert Brown: Silently Stressed, NUS Scotland’s Research on Student Stress—That the Parliament is concerned by the recent report from NUS Scotland on student stress, Silently Stressed: a survey into student mental wellbeing, which reported that student stress is on the rise, with over 90% of students feeling very stressed by examinations, 70% feeling very stressed by financial hardship and 50% feeling stressed while working in a paid job; is particularly alarmed that 40% of student counselling services surveyed were unable to meet demand from the student community and calls on Universities Scotland to ensure that student welfare and support services are adequately resourced to meet the reported increase in student stress; notes that over 80% of students surveyed felt that stigma around mental illness prevented them from seeking help, and calls for more work to be carried out on how the barrier of stigma can be overcome in encouraging students to come forward early to seek support for stress.
