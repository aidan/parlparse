 *S2M-1140 John Swinburne: Swimming for Senior Citizens-That the Parliament deplores the actions of North Lanarkshire Council which has increased the cost of swimming in its baths and leisure centres for pensioners by 200%; believes that the actions of the council are contrary to the policies of the Scottish Executive in promoting the health and well-being of our nation, particularly older people; recognises that swimming is an accessible method of keeping fit for those older people experiencing some form of ill health or as a formal part of their medical care; notes that the price change will adversely affect pensioners who will not be able to afford this increase and who will consequently cease their participation, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to deliver a national policy of free swimming for older people throughout Scotland.
