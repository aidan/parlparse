 *S3M-7150 Mary Scanlon: The Burden of Pneumococcal Disease—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the report, PneumoAware Scotland; recognises what it considers to be the devastating impact of pneumococcal disease on the health and wellbeing of individuals and families in Scotland, as well as what it believes to be a significant financial and economic burden on the NHS; is proud that Scotland currently has the highest level of uptake of the pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) in the United Kingdom; welcomes the recommendations made in the report to ensure that pneumococcal disease and vaccination remain a key focus at local and national levels; believes that there is a need for continued investment in the development of new and improved vaccines, and calls on the Scottish Executive and NHSScotland to ensure that the prevention of infection and disease through effective vaccination programmes remains a cornerstone of Scotland’s public health vision and health policy.
