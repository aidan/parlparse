*S2M-3606 Alex Johnstone: Arbroath Abbey World Heritage Site Status—That the Parliament supports a campaign to encourage the UK Government to obtain World Heritage Site status from UNESCO for Arbroath Abbey, not only on the basis of its connection with the Declaration of Arbroath of 1320 but also for its outstanding architecture; recognises that the Declaration of Arbroath more than satisfies UNESCO’s requirement for the site to be directly associated with literary works of outstanding universal significance, and considers that the Scottish Executive should support Arbroath Abbey as an excellent Scottish candidate for the UK Tentative List.
