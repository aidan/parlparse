*S3M-4451♦ Johann Lamont: ECHR Ruling on Domestic Abuse—That the Parliament notes the continuing scourge of domestic abuse in Glasgow and across Scotland; welcomes the ruling by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) against Turkey for failing to prevent the murder of a woman in the city of Ankara whose daughter had informed police that she believed her mother to be at risk; recognises the significance of this first ruling by the ECHR against a state for failing to protect a woman from domestic violence, and considers that it sends an important signal to all agencies in Glasgow and across Scotland involved in delivering services to those at risk of domestic violence in relation to the need to respond by taking prompt and effective action when they receive reports from victims or potential victims who believe themselves to be at risk of domestic violence.
