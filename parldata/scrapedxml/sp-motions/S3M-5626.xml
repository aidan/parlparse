*S3M-5626 Mary Scanlon: Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender History Month 2010—That the Parliament notes that February is LGBT History Month and that a number of events will take place to celebrate the contribution of LGBT people to Scotland’s past and, just as importantly, its future; deeply regrets the persecution of the past and expresses gratitude to those who stood against it; affirms that LGBT history is an important part of Scottish history and, as such, the whole country should mark this event with pride; considers that, while huge strides have been taken towards acceptance of gay and transgender people, so long as intolerance and homophobia exists everybody must work hard to combat it wherever it presents itself; resolves to create a tolerant society where young people can grow up without fear of prejudice, and affirms the pride that Scotland can take in its LGBT community and its importance to the nation.
