*S2M-3274 Christine Grahame: It’s Simply Not Cricket—That the Parliament notes the recent cricket win by England over Australia and, while congratulating England’s players, laments the overwhelming UK-wide coverage of a sport that is of only marginal interest in Scotland and further laments that England’s win is apparently of more importance than the continuing starvation of millions in Niger, the complete failure of the UK Government to deliver on the G8 promises and the continuing chaos in Iraq and Afghanistan, and notes that it provides a timely diversion from these desperate failures of the UK Government but that many of us are keeping our eye on another ball.
