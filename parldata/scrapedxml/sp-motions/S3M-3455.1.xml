 *S3M-3455.1 Rob Gibson: Titian’s Diana and Actaeon—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3455) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from "calls on" to end and insert "recollects that the Bridgewater Collection, of which Diana and Actaeon is one item, predates the creation of the dukedom of Sutherland in 1830, stemming as it does from the fortune accrued from canal building in England by the uncle of the 1st Duke of Sutherland; notes from the answer to S3W-16020 that "there are hundreds of loans in operation at any one time" of works of art to the National Galleries of Scotland (NGS); recalls that John Leighton, the director general of the NGS, was quoted last autumn, when the 7th Duke of Sutherland made his demands public, as saying that "we have known for decades that a moment like this would arrive"; recognises the urgent need for a comprehensive publicly available review of works on loan, and conditions attached thereto, to the NGS, National Museums Scotland and the National Library of Scotland, and encourages the Scottish Government to make suitable proposals to deal with such loans, the consequences of which were tolerated or ignored by previous UK governments and the Labour/Lib Dem devolved administrations of 1999 and 2003.
