*S3M-1003♦ Johann Lamont: Meeting the Needs of Disabled Children and their Families - £34 Million Could Go a Long Way—That the Parliament acknowledges the courage, persistence and commitment of parents with disabled children within the Pollok constituency, across Glasgow and throughout Scotland, in fighting for the rights of their families; notes the findings of the report, Aiming High for Disabled Children: Better Support for Families, drawn from the experience and priorities of families with disabled children across the United Kingdom and which seeks to address the needs of the disabled child and the impact of disability on the rest of the family; welcomes the £34 million funding secured by the dedicated campaigning of families with disabled children and provided to the Scottish Executive to deliver the package of improvements in short breaks, accessible childcare, support for young disabled people in transition to adulthood and help for parents to be involved in shaping local services, and considers that families of disabled children should benefit fully from the £34 million fruits of their campaigning endeavour.
