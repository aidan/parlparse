 *S2M-4718 Bill Butler: 150th Anniversary of the Birth of James Keir Hardie—That the Parliament celebrates the 150th anniversary of the birth of James Keir Hardie on 15 August 1856 at Legbrannock, Lanarkshire; acknowledges his importance in the development of the Labour movement, including the strikes of the new unionism in the 1880s and the founding of the Scottish Labour Party in 1888, the Independent Labour Party (ILP) in 1893 and the Labour Representation Committee in 1900; commends his role as a socialist in the Westminster Parliament, first as the ILP member for West Ham South and then for Merthyr Tydfil, and as the first leader of the Parliamentary Labour Party; recognises that the causes he made his own, such as class equality, environmental protection, trade union rights, women’s equality, production for need not profit, full employment and above all peace and disarmament, remain relevant today, and welcomes this opportunity to pay tribute to a citizen of Scotland who, in his lifetime, displayed a profound understanding of the merits of egalitarianism and internationalism.
