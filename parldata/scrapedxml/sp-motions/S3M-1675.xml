 *S3M-1675 Jamie Hepburn: Level Heads and the National Conversation—That the Parliament notes with concern the assertion by the Minister of State at the Scotland Office in a Westminster debate that the Scottish Government’s National Conversation website is "a forum for every swivel-eyed, bigoted, anti-English lunatic in Scotland and beyond to spew forth hate-mongering and obscenities and to cast aspersions on the United Kingdom and its flag"; believes that such comments are themselves provocative and offensive, especially to the wide range of representatives from civic society in Scotland who have chosen to engage thoughtfully and calmly with the debate on Scotland’s constitutional future, and believes that level heads on all sides of the debate should prevail so that the next stage of constitutional reform in Scotland delivers a parliament with all the powers it needs to bring about a better Scotland.
