*S3M-1079 Irene Oldfather: Pressure for Changeâ€”That the Parliament notes the findings of the Care Commission report, Pressure for change, which found serious failings in standards of care in all the care homes that were visited as part of the review; further notes the widespread incidence of pressure ulcers found on older people living in care homes, the effects of which can range from mild skin reddening to severe deep open wounds which can be life-threatening if infected; agrees that it is a disgrace for elderly people in this day and age to suffer unnecessarily from pressure ulcers which are preventable and can be treated; accepts the view of the Care Commission that the report is indicative of widespread failings in the Scottish care home system, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to accept the findings of the Care Commission report and fully implement its recommendations.
