*S2M-1396 Rosie Kane: Mordechai Vanunu and Israel's Secret Nuclear Weapons Programme-That the Parliament condemns the Israeli Government's treatment of Mordechai Vanunu who was released from prison on 21 April 2004 after being held in prison for 18 years, 11 of which were in solitary confinement, for revealing the existence of the Israeli secret nuclear weapons programme; furthermore strongly opposes restrictions placed upon Mr Vanunu by the Israeli Government whereby Mr Vanunu is not allowed to leave the country, visit any embassy or speak to foreigners or media; believes that it is ironic that Mr Vanunu was jailed for exposing secret weapons of mass destruction whilst Iraq was attacked and occupied for supposedly not revealing weapons of mass destruction; considers that the First Minister should write to Ariel Sharon inviting Mr Vanunu to Scotland, a safe haven where he can live in freedom and safety having suffered long enough as a result of his brave stance in relation to weapons of mass destruction and the Israeli Government's secret programme; notes that should Mr Vanunu reach these shores it would not be appropriate to hold him in Dungavel House Immigration and Removal Centre, and supports the Scottish Socialist Party in taking this initiative if the First Minister feels that for any reason he cannot.
