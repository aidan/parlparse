*S3M-7155 Mary Mulligan: Coalition’s Welfare Cuts—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Local Government Forum Against Poverty and Rights Advice Scotland for what it considers their excellent, detailed report, People Councils the Economy; understands that the coalition government is set to remove more than £514 million a year from the pockets of Scotland’s lowest income households and in turn from the Scottish economy; considers this an attack on disabled people and on the poorest and most vulnerable people in Scotland; calls on the Scottish Government to prioritise tackling poverty and disadvantage in its forthcoming budget, and calls on Scottish local authorities to support the work of the forum and its welfare rights teams.
