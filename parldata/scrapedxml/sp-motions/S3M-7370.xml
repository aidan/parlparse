*S3M-7370 Cathy Peattie: Hepatitis C Action Plan for Scotland—That the Parliament wholeheartedly supports the Hepatitis C Action Plan for Scotland, which it considers has made impressive progress in diagnosing, treating and supporting hepatitis C patients; understands that the Hepatitis C Action Plan for Scotland has been cited across the world as an example of national best practice in addressing hepatitis C; further understands that the effectiveness of the Hepatitis C Action Plan for Scotland was a key motivator behind the decision to develop a national liver disease strategy for England, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that the progress made in addressing hepatitis C is sustained and furthered by continued investment and support for what it considers this important public health area.
