 *S1M-2812 Mr Duncan McNeil: Euro 2008-That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that the Scottish Football Association and the Football Association of Ireland are to launch a joint bid to host the Euro 2008 football championships; notes that every major party in the Parliament has, at least in the past if not at present, supported such a joint bid; further notes the potential of the bid to bring all the benefits for tourism and the economy that would have resulted from a solo bid by Scotland without burdening the country with four expensive and unneeded 30,000-seater stadiums; looks forward to the opportunity of working and renewing ties with our Irish neighbours, and urges the whole country to back the bid. Supported by: Mr John McAllion*, Bristow Muldoon*, Johann Lamont*, Trish Godman*, Rhoda Grant*, Dr Sylvia Jackson*, Margaret Jamieson*
