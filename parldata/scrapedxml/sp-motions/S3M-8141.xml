*S3M-8141 Sandra White: 32nd Scottish Press Awards—That the Parliament congratulates journalists at The Herald, Sunday Herald and Evening Times on their nominations at the 32nd Scottish Press Awards; notes that 18 journalists across the titles have been nominated for awards, including Paul Hutcheon for scoop of the year for his story exposing ex-Glasgow City Council leader Steven Purcell’s cocaine use and subsequent resignation, David Pratt, who is filing dispatches from Libya, as reporter of the year and Ian Bell as columnist of the year; believes that these nominations highlight both the value of high quality investigative journalism and the wide range of rich journalistic talent in the Scottish newspaper industry, which it believes has been damaged by management attempts at cost cutting, and calls on the management groups of Scotland’s newspapers to recognise this talent by committing proper investment in the future of Scotland’s newspaper industry.
