*S2M-4113 Richard Lochhead: Closure of Centre for Ecology and Hydrology—That the Parliament condemns the decision by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) to close the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology at Banchory, along with three other centres in England; recognises the groundbreaking research into climate change for which the centre had a deservedly high reputation; considers the closures to be tantamount to environmental vandalism, and urges the Scottish Executive to fight tooth and nail to resist these closures and to lobby the UK Government and the NERC to rethink this decision. Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Christine Grahame*, Robin Harper*, Mark Ballard*, Brian Adam*, Rob Gibson*
