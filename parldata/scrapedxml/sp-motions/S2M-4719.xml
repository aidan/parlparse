*S2M-4719 Margaret Smith: The Lion of Scotland Sculptureâ€”That the Parliament recognises the excellent work of Edinburgh-based sculptor, Ronald Rae of Cramond, highlighted in the ongoing exhibition of his work in Holyrood Park supported by the Scottish Executive New Arts Sponsorship Awards and Historic Scotland; further notes that the sculpture "The Lion of Scotland" has proved particularly popular with the public, and, bearing in mind that the lion is our historic national symbol, calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to investigate the possibility of the sculpture being re-sited permanently outside the Parliament building. Supported by: Mr Jim Wallace*
