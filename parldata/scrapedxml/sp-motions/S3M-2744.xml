*S3M-2744 Sandra White: Pensioners Take Their Place at Holyrood—That the Parliament welcomes the ringing endorsement for the establishment of a pensioners’ parliament, unanimously agreed at the recent SNP conference in Perth; notes that a clear objective of one of the longest-standing cross-party groups (CPG) in the Parliament, the CPG on Older People, Age and Ageing, has been for the establishment of this forum, and looks forward to working with all relevant parties in making this commitment a reality.
