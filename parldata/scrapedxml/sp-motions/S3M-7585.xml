*S3M-7585 Bill Kidd: Carers’ Missing Millions—That the Parliament notes with concern new figures released by Carers Scotland that show that across Scotland 25,852 carers are missing out on a total of £72 million worth of carers allowance each year; considers that failure to claim carers allowance can have a significant impact on carers’ lives; further notes that Carers Scotland has found that the effects of financial hardship and ill-health can lead to isolation and social exclusion for carers; considers that carers make a huge contribution to Scottish society, and calls on the UK Government to take steps to ensure that carers are made aware of and receive the support to which they are entitled.
