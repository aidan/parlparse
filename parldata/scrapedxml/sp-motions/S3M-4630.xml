 *S3M-4630 Anne McLaughlin: Voice for Glasgow North Eastâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern and disappointment that residents of the Glasgow North East Westminster constituency will be without representation in the UK Parliament for up to four months; recognises that, in stark contrast, voters in Norwich North elected a new MP after only 48 days, and believes that the people of Glasgow North East deserve the same representation in the UK Parliament as any other constituency and require a strong voice at all times, especially when the community is facing major job losses at the Port Dundas Diageo distillery.
