*S2M-1910 Colin Fox: John Peel—That the Parliament mourns the passing of John Peel; regards his outstanding and lasting contribution to popular culture in the UK as unique; notes that he was responsible for bringing a diverse range of music to generations of young and old alike through his radio shows, championing everything from punk rock to reggae and hip hop; notes particularly that he gave help and assistance to many Scottish bands who would have otherwise been unable to make progress in an industry that is over-dominated by the multinational record labels, and believes that his legacy will last forever in the music that he so dearly loved.
