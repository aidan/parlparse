*S3M-5513 Hugh Henry: Local Newspapers—That the Parliament notes the contribution made by local papers in Renfrewshire and throughout Scotland; believes that local daily papers such as the Paisley Daily Express, weekly papers such as the Gazette and free papers such as the Extra all add to healthy local discussion; is concerned that the removal of local authority and Scottish Government advertising will weaken the financial viability of local newspapers; notes that many people, particularly older people and those on a low income, do not have access to the internet; believes that public agency advertising in local newspapers is important for a healthy democracy, and calls on the Scottish Government and Renfrewshire Council to review the decision to end advertising public notices in local newspapers.
