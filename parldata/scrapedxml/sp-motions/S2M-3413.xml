*S2M-3413 Ms Sandra White: European Maritime Safety Agency - Glasgow Bid—That the Parliament notes the success of the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 which has ensured the release of information about Glasgow’s bid to be the new base of operations for the European Maritime Safety Agency (EMSA); notes that the bid for the new EMSA headquarters has since been awarded to Lisbon; notes that, at a meeting of heads of government, Tony Blair did not table the Glasgow bid; notes that assurances were repeatedly given to Scottish MPs and MSPs that the Glasgow bid was going ahead; notes that Glasgow was even referred to as a part of the “strong competition” by Nicol Stephen in January 2004, despite the fact that a civil servant said “It is our understanding that securing the EMSA for the UK is not the main objective. The preferred scenario seems to be to attract the police training college to a location in England. Any bid for the EMSA would not therefore proceed in the hope that it could be won, but rather so that it could be tactically withdrawn later to boost the chances of getting the police college”; further notes that the Glasgow bid was never mentioned on the EMSA website, which did mention Genoa, Nantes, Athens and Gothenburg as competitors to Lisbon, and believes that it is clear from this information that the best interests of Glasgow and Scotland are not being served by the UK Government or the Scottish Executive.
