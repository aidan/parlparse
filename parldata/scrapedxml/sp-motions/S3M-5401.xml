*S3M-5401# Angela Constance: Bausch &amp; Lombâ€”That the Parliament regrets that Bausch &amp; Lomb is continuing to pursue closure of its manufacturing plant in Livingston; remains deeply concerned that the phased closure and transfer of production to Ireland will result in the loss of 500 jobs in Livingston; notes that the 90-day statutory consultation period ends on 14 December 2009; regrets that Bausch &amp; Lomb has not reconsidered its decision to close the highly successful and award-winning site in Livingston; applauds the productive, skilled and committed workforce, which has been crucial to the success and efficiency of the Livingston site; notes with sadness that the first round of redundancies will result in 45 people ceasing employment on Christmas Eve; would welcome a continuing dialogue between Bausch &amp; Lomb and the Scottish Government with a view to both protecting jobs and supporting those who now face redundancy; notes that the phased closure of the plant will continue to afford time and opportunity to mitigate against the colossal impact on the West Lothian economy; notes that unemployment in West Lothian is at its highest in a decade, and welcomes the cross-party and community-wide support for the workforce and the determination to succeed that exists in West Lothian despite the current economic challenges.
