*S3M-5227 Patrick Harvie: Glasgow Royal Concert Hall and Buchanan Bus Station—That the Parliament notes that over a year has passed since Glasgow City Council granted outline planning permission for construction of a multistorey car park on top of Buchanan Bus Station, to expand the retail space at Buchanan Galleries by up to two thirds and to demolish the popular Royal Concert Hall steps and replace them with a shopping centre entrance; further notes the objections made to the planning application relating to the bus station by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport and Transport Scotland and the concerns expressed by the city’s major bus operators; shares their concerns that building on top of the bus station would diminish the attractiveness of the space and limit future flexibility and the development of bus services; acknowledges that improvements in accessibility to the Royal Concert Hall and better maintenance of the steps are desirable but rejects the idea that this requires the removal of the open, communal space of the steps and their replacement with another commercial facade; agrees that it is vital that public awareness of these plans is greatly increased, and calls on Glasgow City Council to assume responsibility for encouraging widespread public debate and engagement with the ongoing planning process for these major and contentious projects for Glasgow city centre.
