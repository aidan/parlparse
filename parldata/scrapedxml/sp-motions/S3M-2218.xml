*S3M-2218 Sarah Boyack: "Shrink Paper" in the Parliament—That the Parliament welcomes the news that it has recorded a 28% reduction in paper use in the building in the last financial year, significantly exceeding the Parliament’s Environmental Steering Group’s target of 7.5%; congratulates all those involved in all parts of the building on achieving this success, particularly the Environmental Performance Manager; notes, however, with concern, and notwithstanding the development of recycling, that world consumption of paper has quadrupled since the 1960s and the use of printing paper has increased six-fold despite the development of electronic alternatives; is further concerned that just 10% of the world’s population in western Europe and north America consumes more than 50% of the world’s paper, six times above the world average, and therefore welcomes the "shrink paper" initiative by the European Environmental Paper Network, supported by its website www.shrinkpaper.org/index.shtml, as a means to encourage other organisations and individuals to follow the example set by staff in the Scottish Parliament and significantly reduce paper consumption where possible.
