 *S1M-3560.1 Robin Harper: The Draft Genetically Modified Organisms (Deliberate Release) (Scotland) Regulations 2002â€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-3560) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end "but, in doing so, regrets that the regulations do not require the consideration of "ethical principles" before genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are released or placed on the market, as highlighted in the preamble to Directive 2001/18/EC, and that the regulations (a) narrow the existing definition of "harm" from GMOs under the Environmental Protection Act 1990 instead of retaining the existing definition which includes harm to property, (b) weaken the existing definition in the Act of proper "control" of GMOs that currently requires any GMOs that enter the environment to be "harmless", to only having to "minimise the risk of harm", (c) allow the requirement for information to be contained in an application for consent to release/market GMOs, as required in the Directive, to be varied "to the extent that such information is appropriate to the nature and scale of the release or application" but do not require full information to be provided according to Annex III of the Directive for any release of GMOs, (d) reduce the current powers of Scottish ministers to "revoke a consent at any time" to instead only allowing a consent to be revoked if "new information" comes to light and (e) provide for joint powers with the Health and Safety Executive to refuse a consent on health grounds rather than such powers being retained solely with Scottish Ministers."
