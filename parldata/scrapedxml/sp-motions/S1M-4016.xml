*S1M-4016# Bill Butler: Announcement of Glasgow Airport Rail Link Project—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement made on 12 March 2003 by the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning committing the Scottish Executive to invest in the construction of the vital Glasgow Airport rail link to Central Station; applauds the timetable for implementation of the project which could begin as early as 2005 with a completion date of 2008 and recognises that this will result in Glasgow being the first city in Scotland to have a completed direct airport rail link; notes that the new airport rail link will provide Glasgow with a direct connection to three international airports and believes that this will contribute in a positive fashion to the economic development of Glasgow and west central Scotland; accepts that this announcement does not preclude the Glasgow crossrail project from being developed in due course, and praises the commitment of Glasgow’s MSPs, Glasgow City Council, Strathclyde Passenger Transport, Glasgow Chamber of Commerce and The Evening Times in campaigning, and arguing, for this much-needed transport project.
