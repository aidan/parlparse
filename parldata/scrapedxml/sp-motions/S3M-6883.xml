 *S3M-6883 Christine Grahame: Lockerbie, Unfinished Business—That the Parliament commends the one-man play, Lockerbie: Unfinished Business, written and performed by David Benson and based on Dr Jim Swire’s own manuscripts and extracts from the trial, winner of a Fringe First Award; notes that it narrates one man’s grief at the loss of a much loved daughter from the night of the bombing through to an exposition as to why Dr Jim Swire, among others, believes that there has been a miscarriage of justice in the conviction of Al Megrahi, and considers this to be a further compelling component in a campaign for a full enquiry into the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988.
