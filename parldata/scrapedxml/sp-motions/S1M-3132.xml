*S1M-3132 Margaret Smith: Energywatch "Stop Now!" Campaign-That the Parliament welcomes the energywatch "Stop Now!" campaign which is designed to put a stop to cowboy tactics used by some gas and electricity companies, regrets the increase in unscrupulous sales tactics by such companies which, customers report, can include lying, bullying, misleading requests and intimidation; supports the demands made by energywatch to ensure that the gas and electricity companies' house is put in order by (a) the Office of Gas and Electricity Markets (Ofgem) keeping and strengthening the operating licensing conditions with which the energy companies must comply, (b) Ofgem using its power to fine unscrupulous energy companies, (c) the energy companies establishing a "rogues' register" of sales agencies and individuals who fail to meet acceptable standards, (d) the energy companies paying proper compensation to consumers for any distress and inconvenience caused by their sales malpractices and (e) the establishment of a standard format for energy supply contracts so that consumers are able to understand contracts and compare them with other suppliers; welcomes the commitment of energywatch to work with the police to combat bogus caller crime; urges the Scottish Executive to work in partnership with Scottish energy companies to improve consumer relations, and commends energywatch for raising the profile of such important consumer issues.
