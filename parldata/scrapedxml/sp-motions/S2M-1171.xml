 *S2M-1171# Mark Ballard: Fair Trade Footballs-That the Parliament notes the adverse publicity over the production, often by children, of footballs in sweatshop conditions and therefore welcomes the launch of "fairdealfootballs", fair trade footballs of "FIFA monitored international matchball" quality, and considers that the Scottish Football Association should take action to make fair trade footballs standard amongst all league and junior football clubs in Scotland.
