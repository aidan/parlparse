*S2M-4011# Marilyn Livingstone: Fairtrade Fortnight—That the Parliament recognises that Fairtrade Fortnight will take place between 6 and 19 March 2006; supports this important series of events which raises awareness of the need to provide support to workers and producers in Third World countries to get a fairer return for their produce; congratulates the growing number of towns and organisations which have succeeded in achieving the Fairtrade mark; acknowledges Burntisland’s new signage which greets visitors to "Fife’s First FairTrade Town"; notes that more fair trade products are being stocked in all major supermarkets; celebrates the increased purchasing of fair trade products by individuals and businesses, and considers that all MSPs and consumers should participate in these events which will help protect the livelihood of small farmers and producers who for too long have faced exploitation instead of reward for their labours.
