S3M-5544 Cathy Jamieson: Recognition of Council Workers’ Efforts during the Big Freeze—That the Parliament recognises the efforts of council workers in East Ayrshire and South Ayrshire who made tremendous efforts to keep services going and respond to the public during the recent severe weather; notes that, while priority was given to gritting and clearing snow from major routes, many roads and pavements in housing schemes and outlying areas were not treated, causing difficulty for local residents; urges the councils, in light of the recent experience, to consult local communities while reviewing the effectiveness of their winter plans, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that East Ayrshire and South Ayrshire councils have adequate resources to deal with the aftermath of the freeze and subsequent thaw.
