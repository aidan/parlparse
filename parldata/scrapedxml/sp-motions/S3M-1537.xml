*S3M-1537 Bill Wilson: European Alcohol and Health Forum’s Social Norms Forum 2009—That the Parliament welcomes the recent establishment of the European Alcohol and Health Forum and its announcement of a European social norms forum to be held in 2009; notes that this will be the first conference on social norms to be held in Europe; congratulates researchers John McMahon and John McAlaney on their invitations to speak at this event following their promising work in this field at the University of Paisley and elsewhere in the United Kingdom; further notes that the social norms approach is an evidence-based, data-driven and cost-effective method of achieving large-scale positive results in reducing high-risk drinking as well as other risky behaviours, and, accordingly, calls on the Scottish and UK governments to increase their engagement with and support for the social norms approach to public health and wellbeing issues.
