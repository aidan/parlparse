 *S3M-6635 Iain Smith: Tourismâ€”That the Parliament notes that tourism is among the largest contributors to the Scottish economy and is defined as a key sector; believes that the industry needs clear direction and support in order to achieve sustainable, long-term growth; deeply regrets the current crisis at the head of VisitScotland over the role of the chief executive and the lack of clarity over ministerial involvement; further notes that the hospitality and tourism sectors have been particularly affected by higher rates bills following revaluation and that Scottish businesses are almost alone in the United Kingdom in having to face these massive increases; notes the British Hospitality Association Scotland, CBI and Chambers of Commerce criticisms of the lack of a transitional rates relief scheme, and calls on the Scottish Government to work constructively with these and other business organisations across Scotland to agree and deliver such a scheme.
