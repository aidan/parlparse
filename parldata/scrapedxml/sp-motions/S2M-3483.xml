*S2M-3483&lt;&gt; Karen Whitefield: Vasa Praevia—That the Parliament recognises the severe condition, Vasa Praevia, which occurs when foetal blood vessels from the placenta or umbilical cord cross the entrance to the birth canal and can result in rapid foetal haemorrhage during birth; recognises the huge potential benefits of prenatal screening in increasing survival rates; considers that NHS Lanarkshire should establish a training programme so that there is an increased awareness of the dangers of Vasa Praevia among health professionals, leading to increased prenatal diagnosis, and congratulates Ms Caroline Prentice and the former members of the Lanarkshire Health Council for the campaigning work which they have undertaken on this matter in Lanarkshire.
