S3M-4690 Duncan McNeil: 30 Years of Headway—That the Parliament congratulates Headway on reaching its 30th anniversary; notes that for three decades its dedicated and hard-working team has been providing vital and much-needed support and advice to brain injury survivors and their families; acknowledges that it has grown from humble beginnings to set up more than 100 groups and branches across the United Kingdom, including 13 in Scotland; welcomes its efforts to challenge the discrimination suffered by people with brain injuries, and offers the brain injury charity its support and best wishes for the future.
