*S3M-36 Nicol Stephen: Making Every Vote Count—That the Parliament notes the achievement of securing proportional representation through a system of single transferable votes (STV) for the 2007 local government elections and the resulting transformation of local governance in Scotland; notes with concern the number of spoiled ballot papers for the Scottish Parliament elections and that these significantly exceeded those for the local government elections; believes that there should be the same voting system for the Scottish Parliament as there is for local government and that STV represents the fairest system of election; notes the further benefit of having one system of election for all levels of government in improving public confidence in the electoral system, and therefore calls on the UK Parliament to amend the Scotland Act 1998 to replace the use of the additional member system with a new system of proportional representation using single transferable votes in multi-member constituencies in all future Scottish Parliament elections. Supported by: Tavish Scott*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Jim Hume*, Jim Tolson*, Alison McInnes*, Liam McArthur*, Jeremy Purvis*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Iain Smith*, Margaret Smith*, Mike Rumbles*, Mike Pringle*, John Farquhar Munro*, Robert Brown*, Ross Finnie*
