 *S2M-1506 John Swinburne: Senior Citizens' Views of Pension Credit-That the Parliament welcomes the first study by Age Concern that is aimed at examining the experiences of senior citizens applying for, and receiving, pension credit; acknowledges that the research shows that nine out of 10 pensioners receiving pension credit believe that Her Majesty's Government should provide a higher basic state pension; believes that a decent and fair income for senior citizens is their right and should replace the complicated, excluding and stigmatising benefits system, as 73% of pensioners in the study believe means-testing puts them off applying for pension credit; further agrees that means-testing is inefficient as the cost of administering pension credit is greater than what is actually being received by senior citizens, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to exert more influence on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to provide a fair, basic state pension and to deliver on his 1993 pledge to remove means-testing if elected to government.
