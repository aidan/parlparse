 *S3M-5018 Liam McArthur: 70th Anniversary of the Sinking of the Royal Oak—That the Parliament notes that 14 October 2009 is the 70th anniversary of the sinking of the battleship, HMS Royal Oak in Scapa Flow; further notes that 883 of the ship’s crew, including many boys, lost their lives as a result of the explosions, fire and rapid sinking of the ship after it was torpedoed by a German U-boat that had penetrated Scapa Flow’s defences; recognises that the sinking and the sacrifices of those who lost their lives are still remembered by Orcadians and by the Royal Navy, which every year sends down divers to replace the White Ensign that flies on the wreck, which is otherwise left undisturbed as a war grave, and considers that out of this terrible event came some good, with the law changing to prevent boys under the age of 18 being engaged in active service in the navy and with the construction of the Churchill Barriers, which today link the islands of Lamb Holm, Glimps Holm, Burray and South Ronaldsay to Mainland, Orkney, providing a vital road link as well as a constant reminder of the loss of the Royal Oak and of so many of her crew.
