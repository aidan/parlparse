*S3M-5563 Hugh Henry: UK Government Consultation on Post Bank—That the Parliament welcomes the consultation on the proposal for a Post Bank; considers that the Post Office already provides a vital service in local communities across Scotland; further considers that the Post Office has established public confidence and trust; believes that the creation of a Post Bank would provide essential banking services in a way that some major high street banks do not; considers that a Post Bank service would bring banking services back to the heart of local communities and would improve the sustainability of the Post Office network; welcomes the continued support for a Post Bank from the Communication Workers Union (CWU), Unite the Union and other trade unions; believes that the scope of the consultation should be widened to look at all structural options, including the Post Bank having its own financial licence as well as a wider range of funding options, and believes that the creation of a Post Bank should have the full support of the Scottish Parliament.
