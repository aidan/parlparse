 *S3M-275 Aileen Campbell: Human Rights Education is Itself a Human Right—That the Parliament supports the development of A Curriculum for Excellence and the emphasis placed on responsible citizenship as one of the four purposes; further notes that human rights represents an internationally accepted framework for structuring discussion on values and respect for others and that the Convention on the Rights of the Child provides an ideal structure for teachers seeking to foster these crucial social skills; notes that many other countries make specific reference to learning about human rights, and therefore hopes that the final curriculum proposals will include specific reference to human rights.
