*S2M-4961 Scott Barrie: Munros for All—That the Parliament notes the 150th anniversary of the birth of Sir Hugh Thomas Munro who was the first person to chart Scotland’s hills and mountains over 3,000 feet; further notes that the Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 makes it easier than ever to enjoy Scotland’s natural heritage; congratulates the roughly 3,500 people who have "bagged" every Munro, and encourages Scots and non-Scots alike to enjoy the Munro experience.
