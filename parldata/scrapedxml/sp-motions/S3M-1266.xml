*S3M-1266 Joe FitzPatrick: Responsible Procurement Strategy—That the Parliament commends the launch of its responsible procurement strategy; notes that, rather than just being a collection of worthy policies, this is a systematic approach to responsible procurement which aims to transform culture across the Parliament; further commends the publication of the strategy to meet the Parliament’s needs without jeopardising the ability of others to meet their needs in the future; acknowledges that this is a contribution to the high standard of environmental management already adopted in the Parliament, which was the first public body to adopt ecological footprint as a corporate key performance indicator, and notes that, by seeking the highest standards in its operations, we can demonstrate that we should all aspire to be responsible global citizens.
