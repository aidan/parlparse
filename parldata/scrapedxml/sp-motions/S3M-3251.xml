*S3M-3251 Christopher Harvie: Racism and the UK Borders Agency—That the Parliament notes with concern reports that members of the British National Party have been found working as immigration staff for the UK Border Agency and its private security contractors; hopes that the official inquiry will prevent such occurrences in the future; also notes the Home Office Complaints Audit Committee Annual Report 2007-08, which depicts serious problems in the handling of allegations of racism against Border Agency officials and in particular against detention centre contractors’ staff, evidence that raises concerns about the Dungavel Detention Centre, and stresses the desirability of immigration being devolved to the Scottish Parliament to enable policies that respect the dignity of refused asylum seekers to be implemented, a stance long given up by the UK Government, and to enable the Scottish Government to attract the skills needed by the Scottish economy, as acknowledged in the first report of the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution.
