 *S2M-2222 Ms Wendy Alexander: Christmas Card Recycling Scheme—That the Parliament notes that more than 100 million Christmas cards were sent in 2004 in Scotland but that last year only around 5% of cards sent in 2003 were recycled; welcomes the scheme promoted by the Woodland Trust and backed by Waste Aware Scotland; urges people to double the amount recycled by taking their cards to special recycling bins placed in WH Smith and Tesco stores throughout January, and notes that the funds raised from the scheme will contribute towards the Woodland Trust’s major new tree planting campaign "Tree For All" which will see two million native trees planted throughout Scotland with the help of thousands of children.
