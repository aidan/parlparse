 *S3M-2432 Jim Tolson: Reduce VAT on Building Repairs—That the Parliament supports calls from the Federation of Master Builders for a reduction in the rate of value added tax (VAT) from 17.5% to 5% on building repair and improvement work to existing buildings; believes that cowboy builders flourish by evading VAT, that reducing the rate of VAT on domestic building work will significantly reduce their commercial advantage and that the financial incentive to choose a rogue builder will diminish; believes that reducing VAT on repairs and maintenance will help bring thousands of empty homes back into use all across Scotland and help meet the 2012 obligation to abolish all unintentional homelessness; notes the increasing number of households across Scotland living in fuel poverty and believes that cutting VAT would also enable thousands of families to upgrade their homes to make them more energy efficient, and consequently calls on the UK Government to reduce VAT for building repairs and improvements.
