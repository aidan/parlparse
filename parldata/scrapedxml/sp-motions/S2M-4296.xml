*S2M-4296 Mike Pringle: A Cow for the Scottish Parliament—That the Parliament believes that CowParade Edinburgh 2006 will be one of the most significant arts and cultural events in Edinburgh this year and notes that over 80 life-size fibre-glass cows, each a unique work of art, will be grazing Edinburgh for 10 weeks from 15 May until 23 July 2006; supports the 21 community projects and the full range of age groups involved in creating their own cows for this event; further supports the auction of the majority of cows in September to raise funds for OneCity Trust and VETAID; believes that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) should support such an event as a way of promoting the local arts and allow a cow to be sited within the Parliament estate, and asks the SPCB to explain why it is not participating in CowParade Edinburgh 2006 by offering to host a cow on the estate as part of this event.
