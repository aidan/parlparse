 *S2M-4761 Tommy Sheridan: Pay the Workers More—That the Parliament notes the Office for National Statistics’ (ONS) report which reveals that rewards in the form of bonus payments in the exclusive world of Britain’s boardrooms and City dealing rooms have reached record levels and show a 16% increase, to the unprecedented amount of £19 billion, this year; further notes that the ONS report shows such boardroom and City bonuses increased by £2.5 billion this year, following a rise of £1.5 billion last year, and believes that such obscene and unjustified bonus payments should be borne in mind when public and private sector unions submit their annual pay rise demands, in recognition of the fact that the real creators of wealth are far from properly rewarded for the fruits of their labours.
