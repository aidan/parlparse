*S3M-29# Des McNulty: Alimta for Mesothelioma Sufferers—That the Parliament recognises that mesothelioma is a particularly aggressive cancer of the lungs, almost exclusively caused by exposure to asbestos; also recognises that West Dunbartonshire has the highest incidence of this work-related disease in Scotland and the second highest in the United Kingdom; further recognises that Alimta is the only drug licensed to treat mesothelioma, where it has been found to deliver significant improvements in the quality of life of sufferers, and considers that Scottish Executive ministers should ensure that Alimta continues to be made available to all existing and new mesothelioma sufferers who, in the professional opinion of consultant oncologists, would benefit from it. Supported by: Michael McMahon*, Charlie Gordon*, John Park*, Sandra White*, Jackie Baillie*, Ken Macintosh*, James Kelly*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Duncan McNeil*, Trish Godman*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Kenneth Gibson*, Bill Butler*, Mary Mulligan*, Pauline McNeill*, Iain Gray* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
