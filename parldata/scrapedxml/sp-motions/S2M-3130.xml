*S2M-3130 Mr Brian Monteith: Well Done to Central Scotland Police—That the Parliament praises the excellent work of Central Scotland Police officers in playing such an important part in providing security for the G8 summit; supports the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland President, Peter Wilson’s, comments that all the police involved had "delivered a safe and secure environment for the G8 leaders to meet", "allowed peaceful protest" and had "quickly responded to violent disorder", and utterly condemns those violent protestors and mindless thugs who caused so much disruption and damage in Bannockburn and areas of Stirling and only caused to deflect attention away from the serious issues that the thousands of peaceful protestors from across Scotland, the United Kingdom and Europe were trying to address. Supported by: Alex Johnstone*, Mr Ted Brocklebank*, Mr David Davidson*
