*S3M-2421Elaine Smith:Pay Up for PCS Members—That the Parliament expresses its solidarity with the members of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) in the Scottish Government and Registers of Scotland who felt they had no option but to take strike action for a second day over a 2% pay cap; commends Scotland’s civil servants for the sterling work they do in providing vital services to the public; notes that while the Scottish Government calls on COSLA to return to the negotiating table to resolve the local government pay dispute, they are ignoring the plight of their own low-paid workers who are suffering an effective pay cut in the current economic climate; regrets that the Scottish Government’s failure to act in this matter means that the workers will be continuing an overtime ban and work-to-rule as the strike threatens to escalate with other groups of PCS members, particularly in the Scottish Court Service and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, now balloting to take part in future strikes this autumn, and believes that the Scottish Government should meet the union without delay to negotiate a just pay deal for these valued public servants.
