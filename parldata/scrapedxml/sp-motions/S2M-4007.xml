 *S2M-4007 Jeremy Purvis: Tartan for the Royal Regiment of Scotland: Robert Noble and Company—That the Parliament acknowledges the quality of product of the woollen cloth produced by Robert Noble and Company in Peebles who have supplied the British army for 150 years; believes that the Royal Regiment of Scotland should use the highest quality woollen cloth for its tartan; is concerned that the Ministry of Defence is refusing to stipulate that the tartan cloth should be of the highest standard; is alarmed that the tartan for the Regiment’s kilts and trews will be open to tender, resulting in the cheapest product being chosen, and calls on the Ministry of Defence to reconsider its position immediately. Supported by: Mike Pringle*, Mr Jim Wallace*, Brian Adam*, Margaret Smith*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Cathy Peattie*, Mr Jamie Stone*
