*S2M-994# Johann Lamont: Report on Responses to Prostitution-That the Parliament notes and welcomes the report A Critical Examination of Responses to Prostitution in Four Countries, commissioned by Glasgow Routes Out Social Inclusion Partnership; welcomes the contribution it makes to the debate on strategies to tackle prostitution; recognises that the report provides evidence that legalisation or regulation of prostitution does not create any safer an environment for women involved in prostitution and that the Swedish approach, where there are legal penalties for those men who create the demand for prostitutes, offers a realistic alternative; welcomes the report's evidence that highlights the importance both of protecting women and of challenging those men who use prostitutes; confirms that prostitution is a form of abuse and that all strategies must understand the importance of recognising and tackling this abuse, and believes that the Scottish Executive Working Group on Prostitution should take proper account of this report's findings in its deliberations.
