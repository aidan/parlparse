*S3M-582 Rob Gibson: The John Lennon Northern Lights Festival—That the Parliament welcomes the successful inauguration of the first John Lennon Northern Lights Festival held in Durness, the most north-westerly community on the Scottish mainland, over the last weekend in September 2007; recalls the inspiration of the festival being the late John Lennon whose youthful holidays in Durness infused his life, music and work with the Beatles and as a solo artist thereafter; notes the support of John’s close family at the event; congratulates the festival organisers for transforming the theme with international artistic exhibits and performances in venues around this scattered crofting community, and commends the festival as a highly appropriate annual tribute to the inspiration of John Lennon’s art and music to take place in one of his favourite places on the planet, putting Durness on the map for the best possible reasons.
