*S3M-3777 Claire Baker: Protecting Tenancy Deposits in Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the research, Review of the Private Rented Sector; notes that the size of the private rented sector includes approximately 233,000 households with 74% of these households paying a tenancy deposit of, on average, £433; further notes that tenancy deposits therefore amount to over £70 million and that the research found that 13% of these deposits are withheld; highlights that the research estimates that up to 19,000 tenants in Scotland believe that they have had a deposit withheld unfairly, with these withheld deposits totalling up to £6 million; believes that tenancy deposits in Scotland are currently inadequately regulated; considers that there is a successful tenancy deposit protection scheme operating in England and Wales; recognises that there are powers provided by statute as part of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2006 to introduce a tenancy deposit protection scheme; considers that there is support among the National Union of Students, Shelter and many other organisations for such a tenancy deposit protection scheme, and calls on the Scottish Government to introduce at the earliest opportunity a tenancy deposit protection scheme to protect tenants and good landlords alike from rogue private landlords.
