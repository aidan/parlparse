*S2M-3548u Mrs Margaret Ewing: Excess Winter Deaths—That the Parliament notes with growing concern that fuel bills will rise by 15% this year and further notes that an 18% rise occurred last year; believes that the vulnerable will suffer most from these charges and that excess winter deaths will regrettably and unnecessarily continue to rise, as was the case in Grampian where last year 320 excess winter death cases were recorded; believes that new solutions must be sought to prevent the rise of excess winter deaths, and further believes that, as an energy-rich nation, the people of Scotland should expect warm, dry and affordable ways to heat their homes and that the Scottish Executive should conduct a review of the effectiveness of existing schemes. Supported by: Richard Lochhead*, Eleanor Scott*, Patrick Harvie*, Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Tricia Marwick*, Fergus Ewing*, Mr Adam Ingram*, Linda Fabiani*, Brian Adam*, Mr John Swinney*, Ms Sandra White*, Robin Harper*, Bruce Crawford*, Mr Andrew Welsh*, Mr Bruce McFee*, Alex Neil*, Christine Grahame*, Jim Mather*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Shiona Baird*, Rob Gibson*
