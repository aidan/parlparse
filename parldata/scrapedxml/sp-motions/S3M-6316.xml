*S3M-6316 Joe FitzPatrick: Fiscal Stimulus—That the Parliament agrees that protecting the economic recovery is a key priority for Scotland; believes that the importance of maintaining a fiscal stimulus cannot be underestimated; further believes that such a stimulus would be a key tool in helping to cement the recovery and create jobs, and calls on the UK Government to respond positively to the Scottish Government’s call for a sustained fiscal stimulus for Scotland and the UK.
