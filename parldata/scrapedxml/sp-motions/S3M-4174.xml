 *S3M-4174 Kenneth Gibson: Congratulations to Dalry Thistle—That the Parliament congratulates Dalry Thistle Football Club, the players, fans and everyone connected with the club on winning the Stagecoach Ayrshire District League and gaining promotion to the First Division of the Super League for the first time; notes that Dalry Thistle won the league on the last day of the season and that this is their first title win in seven years, since winning the Ayrshire Third Division in 2001-02; believes that Dalry Thistle’s achievement is all the more remarkable given that only one game has been played at home since 23 August 2008; acknowledges that much of the credit for Dalry Thistle’s success must go to its manager, John Garroch, in his first season in junior football; considers that Dalry Thistle winning the league title will provide an incentive for North Ayrshire Council to have Merksworth Park ready for the new season, and wishes Dalry Thistle all the very best in its First Division campaign. Supported by: John Lamont*, Bill Kidd*, Sandra White*, Gil Paterson*
