 *S2M-5549.1 Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Early Years Education, Development and Careâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-5549) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from "that there needs" to end and insert "can assist parents with the difficult but rewarding task of raising children; further believes that provision must be advanced, highly-skilled and flexible in order to meet the range of needs that parents and children in Scotland have; therefore expresses its concern that access to qualified teachers in nurseries may be insufficient in some areas of Scotland; recognises the potential that early intervention has for helping children from disadvantaged backgrounds, or who have additional support needs or are otherwise at risk, and calls for serious consideration to be given to expanding the number of family centres, particularly in areas of deprivation."
