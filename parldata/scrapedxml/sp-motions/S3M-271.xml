*S3M-271 John Park: SPL Call for Lifting of Alcohol Ban for Football Fansâ€”That the Parliament notes the recent decision to lift a ban on alcohol sales at Murrayfield Stadium for rugby fans in time for the Rugby World Cup; expresses concern that proposals have not been brought forward for a similar trial scheme for football; believes that football fans in Scotland should be treated with the same level of respect as rugby fans; notes the many successful football events that have been held in recent years at Hampden, such as the Champions League and UEFA Cup finals, and supports the calls from the Scottish Premier League for a pilot scheme lifting the ban on alcohol sales in Scottish football grounds to be introduced as soon as possible.
