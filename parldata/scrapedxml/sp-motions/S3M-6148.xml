*S3M-6148 Liam McArthur: Orkney Pupils for Euroquiz Final—That the Parliament notes that the P6 pupils at Stenness Primary School narrowly beat their contemporaries at Stronsay Junior High to win the competition to represent Orkney in the Euroquiz Final in the Parliament; further notes that the close competition was evidence of the hard work that both teams and their teachers had put into researching how Europe works; believes that competitions such as this, which help to increase the understanding of Europe and of Scotland’s place in it, will do much to overcome the misunderstandings and myths that surround the European Union, and offers both teams congratulations for their efforts and the Stenness team best wishes for success in the final to be held on 10 May 2010.
