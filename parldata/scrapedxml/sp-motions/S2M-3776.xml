*S2M-3776 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Lowering the Drink-Driving Limitâ€”That the Parliament recognises that an average of one in six deaths on Scottish roads is caused by drink-driving; regrets the increase in the number of under-21s convicted of drink-driving, up 38% between 1996 and 2002; is concerned by the fact that the current drink-driving limit of 80mg per 100ml of blood is amongst the highest in western Europe and that the average drink-driving limit in Europe is 40 to 50mg; supports any measures that will lead to a reduction in the number of people who choose to drink and drive, including increased enforcement and greater education and awareness campaigns; acknowledges that the Parliament does not have the power to deal with this issue, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to take this matter up with the UK Government in an attempt to get the issue legislated on at Westminster as soon as possible.
