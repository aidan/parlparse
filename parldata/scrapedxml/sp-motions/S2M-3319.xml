*S2M-3319 Mr Andrew Arbuckle: Renewable Energy Opportunities—That the Parliament supports the view that Scotland should initiate more fuel projects based on oil-producing crops, thus helping to increase the energy supplied from sustainable sources as required by international obligations, particularly Kyoto; further welcomes the recent announcement by the Scottish Executive that farmers who wish to grow energy crops can now apply for grants of up to £1,000 per hectare; notes that Scotland’s only bio-fuel project, Argent, is a welcome start as it only recycles existing waste vegetable oils; notes that a new market for relevant crops would be a valuable new opportunity for Scottish farmers, and recognises that there are literally thousands of acres of uncropped land lying in set-aside which, if turned into production, could help to meet Scotland’s sustainable energy targets.
