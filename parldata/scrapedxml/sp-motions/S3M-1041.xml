*S3M-1041 Ian McKee: Possible Breach of the Councillors’ Code of Conduct—That the Parliament welcomes the investigation by the Standards Commission for Scotland into the conduct of two Midlothian Councillors who voted to reinstate a senior official of their party after he had previously been dismissed from his council position; understands that the councillors failed to register their interest in the situation, and notes with concern that this incident is the latest in a series of alleged breaches of the code of conduct by members of this party.
