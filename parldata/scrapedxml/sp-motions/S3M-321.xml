 *S3M-321 Jackie Baillie: Indian Duty on Whisky Scotched—That the Parliament welcomes the move by the Indian Government to abolish the additional duty currently levied on Scotch whisky imports; recognises that this will allow Scottish distillers to compete fairly with their Indian counterparts for the first time; commends the Scotch Whisky Association for its campaign to reform the system, and welcomes the opportunity to provide consumers in India with a greater choice of internationally renowned Scotch whisky brands.
