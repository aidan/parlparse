*S3M-1228 Kenneth Gibson: VAT on Sports and Leisure Trusts’ Membership Packages—That the Parliament disapproves of HM Revenue and Customs’ (HMRC) recent decision to charge VAT on sports and leisure trusts’ membership packages and to collect unpaid VAT retrospectively over the last three years; notes that PricewaterhouseCoopers and Tax Counsel advised the Sports and Recreation Trusts Association (SpoRTA) that the way in which HMRC is seeking to charge VAT is wrong in law; recognises the potentially serious financial and social consequences for leisure trusts and their customers including higher membership fees at leisure centres necessary to cover the VAT liability which would lead to lower participation, especially in more deprived communities; is concerned that HMRC’s decision to charge VAT retrospectively to some trusts may result in their liquidation, and further notes that HMRC’s decision contradicts the policies of both the Scottish and Westminster governments’ efforts to promote healthier lifestyles and the wider health benefits of sport and leisure as well as undermining the drive to tackle public health issues such as obesity.
