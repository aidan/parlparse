*S3M-6952 Robin Harper: Edinburgh Sports Facilities Cuts—That the Parliament is appalled by the proposals to close sports facilities in Edinburgh; acknowledges that local authorities have tight budgets but is of the firm belief that further reductions in the provision of such facilities could have drastic effects on obesity rates and the general health and fitness of all people; highlights what it considers to be the strong correlation between sport and health; is of the view that, if these centres were to be closed, they would be gone for good; is of the view that, if such a decision is made in order to generate a short-term saving, it could result in long-term consequences for a generation of children in Edinburgh, and believes that this would put an additional strain on NHS resources, which it believes are already stretched through coping with obesity-related health issues.
