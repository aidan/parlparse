*S3M-1478 Jamie Hepburn: Venezuelan Oil Assets—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision on 7 February 2008 by a court in England to grant an injunction to US multinational oil company ExxonMobil, freezing the US $12 billion assets held by the Venezuelan oil company PDVSA in England and Wales; further notes that the action was in response to the policy of the Venezuelan Government to take back majority control of its own oil resources, that the Venezuelan Government was given no notice of the case and was not afforded any opportunity to be represented at the hearing; believes that the action by ExxonMobil contravenes the right of the democratically elected government of Venezuela to exercise sovereignty over its natural resources, a right that properly belongs to all countries of the world; supports Venezuela’s national sovereignty, including the right to determine its own policy in relation to its oil and natural resources, and calls on government at all levels in the United Kingdom to support efforts to have the dispute resolved by the World Bank’s International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes. Supported by: Bill Wilson*, Brian Adam*, Alex Neil*, Bashir Ahmad*, Christopher Harvie*, Bill Kidd*
