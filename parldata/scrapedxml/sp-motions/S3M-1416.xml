*S3M-1416 John Park: Billy Liddell for the SFA’s Hall of Fame—That the Parliament celebrates the achievements of Dunfermline-born footballer Billy Liddell; recognises that his achievements have been inspirational to generations of young Scottish footballers; further recognises that, after playing for Kingseat Juniors and Lochgelly Violet, he went on to spend over 20 years with Liverpool Football Club, where he was instrumental in its success for much of this time, earning the club the nickname "Liddellpool", and was honoured by the club with a commemorative plaque at Anfield in 2004; is surprised that despite this success and his 28 caps for Scotland, Billy Liddell’s contribution to football has not yet earned him a place in the Scottish Football Association’s Hall of Fame, and calls for fans from across the country to support a campaign to ensure that Billy Liddell enters the Hall of Fame this year to join his 51 fellow countrymen who are already honoured in this way and for a fitting memorial to these achievements to be established in Townhill, Dunfermline.
