*S3M-6690 Robin Harper: Wood Panel Industry and Biomass Plants—That the Parliament strongly supports the wood panel industry’s campaign, Make Wood Work, and applauds this effort to promote the optimal use of a valuable and limited resource; acknowledges the important role that wood products play in storing carbon; expresses concern at the inefficiency of burning wood to generate electricity alone; understands that the Scottish wood industry could not support even one large-scale biomass plant on its own; supports the industry’s call for the Scottish Government to introduce a moratorium on consents for electricity-only biomass power plants; considers that the wood panel industry is Scotland’s largest industrial generator of renewable heat, and encourages the UK Government to adjust its policies toward better use of Scotland’s timber resources and to include the wood panel industry in the proposed renewable heat incentive.
