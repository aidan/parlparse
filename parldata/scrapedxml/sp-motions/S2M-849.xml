*S2M-849 David McLetchie: Police Accountabilityâ€”That the Parliament notes that there is widespread public misunderstanding of who is responsible for what in terms of policing in Scotland; recognises that there needs to be greater local involvement in policing along with a police service that is more responsive to public demands, and calls on the Scottish Executive to strengthen public accountability and involvement by considering ideas such as the direct election of conveners of police boards and the regular publication of localised crime statistics.
