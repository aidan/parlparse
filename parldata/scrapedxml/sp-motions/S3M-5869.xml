* S3M-5869 Pauline McNeill: BBC Asian Network and BBC 6 Music—That the Parliament notes that the BBC’s first public purpose is to "represent the different nations, regions and communities to the rest of the UK"; believes that the BBC Asian Network plays an important role in fostering cross-community cohesion; further believes that BBC 6 Music plays an important role in the development of Scotland’s contemporary cultural output and provides a platform for new and innovative artists, and calls on the BBC Trust to review its proposals to close down the BBC Asian Network and BBC 6 Music.
