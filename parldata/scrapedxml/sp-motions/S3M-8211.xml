 *S3M-8211 Patrick Harvie: Potential Closure of the Scottish Resource Centre for Women in Science, Engineering and Technology—That the Parliament expresses deep concern regarding the potential closure of the Scottish Resource Centre for Women in Science, Engineering and Technology (SRC); notes that this has arisen as result of the UK Government’s decision to abolish SRC’s core funder, the UKRC; acknowledges the expertise and value of service provided by SRC in encouraging women across Scotland to enter and progress in careers in the science, engineering and technology (SET) sector; considers that women are currently underrepresented in this sector; believes that SRC has an essential role in challenging those employment practices and workplace cultures that deter women from entering SET and reinforce gender inequality in Scottish society; considers that the underrepresentation of women in SET has a detrimental impact on the dynamism and potential of the Scottish economy, and calls on the Scottish Government to provide the funding for SRC to continue in what it sees as its important work in order to secure a more accessible and successful SET future for Scotland.
