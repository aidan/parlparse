*S3M-6068 Jackie Baillie: Obama Health Reforms Welcome—That the Parliament congratulates US President Barack Obama and the US House of Representatives for the successful passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, which will bring substantial reform to health care in America; welcomes the ending of pre-existing condition exclusions for health insurance coverage; further welcomes the extension of insurance to all low-income groups; warmly acknowledges the improved access and inclusion of more individuals and families in the US health care system, and, in doing so, celebrates the NHS in Scotland and across the United Kingdom, where health care remains free at the point of need.
