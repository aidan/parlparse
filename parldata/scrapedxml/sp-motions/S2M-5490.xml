*S2M-5490 Alex Neil: Celtic Partnership of Autism Organisations—That the Parliament reaffirms its commitment to improving the lives of people with autistic spectrum disorder; is concerned that, while good progress has been made in Scotland, some individuals with autistic spectrum disorder still experience difficulties in accessing the appropriate services and support necessary for them to fulfil their potential; welcomes the development of the Celtic Partnership between Autism Cymru, Autism Northern Ireland and the Scottish Society for Autism which will be launched on 30 January 2007 in the Welsh Assembly; believes that this partnership will serve as an information channel to support elected Members of each of the devolved decision-making structures in their endeavours to create a society where autism is fully understood and where people with autistic spectrum disorder are fully respected and supported and receive timely, quality services which are appropriate to their individual needs, and offers its congratulations to those involved in this endeavour on their efforts to develop partnership between the respective devolved decision-making structures to share policy and learning.
