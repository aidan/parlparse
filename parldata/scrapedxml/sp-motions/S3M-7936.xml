 *S3M-7936 Kenneth Gibson: Motion Encap Arran Triathlon—That the Parliament welcomes this year’s Encap Arran Triathlon, which is scheduled to take place on the weekend of 10-11 September 2011; understands that 2,000 people will compete in this event; notes that it will be approximately eight times larger than any triathlon previously held in Scotland; further notes that it will consist of a 1,500 metre open water swim in Lamlash Bay, a 23 mile cycle, with views of some of Scotland’s most spectacular scenery, and a six mile run to finish off; considers the establishment of such an event to be a huge boost for local tourism, which will project a positive image of Scotland to the world; further considers that this is an excellent opportunity for people to get involved with and participate in what has been reported as the fastest growing sport in Europe, and wishes the organisers and competitors the best of luck in what it sees as this fantastic event come September.
