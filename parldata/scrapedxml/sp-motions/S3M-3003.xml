*S3M-3003 Cathy Peattie: ScotRail Franchise Extension—That the Parliament notes the resignation of Guy Houston, the finance director of Transport Scotland, following the publication of an Audit Scotland report that criticised his participation in key meetings to discuss the extension of the ScotRail franchise without declaring his financial interests in First ScotRail’s parent company, FirstGroup; notes also that the report is critical of Transport Scotland for not consulting external bodies on the franchise review; further notes that the report highlights that the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change, Stewart Stevenson MSP, was not presented with a fully-documented business case, and believes that the Scottish Government should now call a halt to the franchise extension and instigate a full inquiry by the Scottish Parliament and that there should be an emergency statement from the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change.
