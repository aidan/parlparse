 *S3M-2045 Tavish Scott: Shetland Relay for Life—That the Parliament congratulates the massive community involvement in the Relay for Life at Lerwick’s Clickimin Centre on Saturday 31 May 2008 where over 2,000 people took part in a fundraiser towards cancer relief; notes that this has already raised a staggering £72,000, with further donations to be received; considers that this enormous contribution from an island community with a population of under 22,000 is a reflection of the impact that cancer has had on so many Shetland families; believes that particular congratulations are due to the organisers, especially the irrepressible Belle Spence and Elizabeth Johnson from Unst, and recognises that monies raised by communities such as Shetland are desperately needed for the work to find ways to overcome cancer.
