*S1M-3688 Tommy Sheridan: General Agreement on Trade in Services-That the Parliament calls for an immediate cessation of negotiations on the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS); notes the publication of the World Development Movement's report into the implications of the General Agreement on Trade in Services which reveals that ultimate control of key public services, including health and education, has already been signed over to World Trade Organisation lawyers and that broadcasting and postal services are next in line to be locked into irreversible free trade agreements which could see virtually the entire infrastructure of Britain owned and controlled by profit-hungry multi-national companies; also notes the comments of Luton North Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins who slammed the World Trade Organisation's plans as "an attack on democracy itself" and further stated, "How we choose to deliver basic services to citizens and how we decide to regulate the activities of companies are at the core of the duties of a modern democracy. GATS attack the ability of governments to make these decisions and are therefore an attack on democracy itself. Negotiations on this agreement should halt immediately"; agrees wholeheartedly with these sentiments, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make immediate representation to Her Majesty's Government declaring the Scottish Parliament's support for an immediate cessation of negotiations on the General Agreement on Trade in Services in order to protect democracy and the public services.
