*S3M-3882 Patrick Harvie: Scotland’s Colleges and the Welfare Reform Bill—That the Parliament notes that the UK Government’s Welfare Reform Bill is currently being considered at Westminster; recognises the work done by Scotland’s Colleges to consider the potential for Scottish further education to play a central role in reducing the number of long-term unemployed people and to achieve equality for disabled people; further notes the three specific recommendations by Scotland’s colleges, firstly, the formation of a Scottish Advisory Committee on Welfare Reform to ensure that Scotland’s best interests are safeguarded as the law develops, secondly, the development of closer links between Scotland’s colleges and Job Centre Plus to address the needs of benefits claimants and to seek long-term solutions to long-term problems and thirdly, that Scottish colleges, as publicly-funded providers of comprehensive training and universally recognised qualifications, should be considered the first-choice provider of education and training opportunities that result from the Welfare Reform Bill, and calls on the Scottish Government to raise these proposals with the UK Government as soon as practicable. Supported by: Bill Kidd*
