 *S3M-264 Hugh Henry: School Wardens—That the Parliament notes the problems of litter and antisocial behaviour which sometimes can be evident in the vicinity of schools; believes that these can be intimidating to the local community and can affect the confidence of pupils not involved; also notes the success of neighbourhood/community wardens across Scotland, and believes that the introduction of school wardens, working in partnership with police and neighbourhood/community wardens, would be of real benefit to schools and local communities.
