*S3M-2172 Robert Brown: Funding Cuts by Scottish Government to Glasgow Science Centre—That the Parliament is appalled at the decision of the Scottish Government to cut the funding of the Glasgow Science Centre (GSC) from £1.7 million in 2007-08 to £1.4 million in 2008-09 and to £1.08 million in 2009-10; notes the international standing of GSC which is one of only three science centres in the United Kingdom to be a full member of the Association of Science-Technology Centres (ASTC) and that GSC has been awarded five star status by VisitScotland; notes further that GSC serves schools and communities through inreach and outreach in every local authority area in Scotland; is concerned that the Scottish Government’s new funding method takes no account of the breadth or quality of the experience offered at GSC; contrasts the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning’s bold statement that the Scottish Government will tackle poor levels of science achievement in Scotland with the reality of SNP Government cuts in the funding of Scotland’s only international standard science centre; is concerned at the lengthy lack of engagement with GSC over the proposals, and calls on Scottish Ministers to reinstate the previous levels of funding to GSC to enable it to continue to bring a rich experience and interest in science to young people across Scotland.
