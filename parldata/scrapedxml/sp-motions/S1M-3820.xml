*S1M-3820# Dr Richard Simpson: New Forth Road Bridge Crossing Near Kincardine-That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Scottish Executive to proceed with the new Forth road bridge crossing upstream from the Kincardine Bridge; notes the decision by the Forth Valley NHS Board to recommend to the Scottish Executive that there should be a new single site acute hospital and that the favoured site should be at the Royal Scottish National Hospital, Larbert; recognises the very real difficulties in access to the proposed site for patients from Clackmannanshire, West Fife and Stirling, and considers that the Scottish Executive should do all in its power to ensure that the bridge is completed as soon as possible and that, in considering any site for the new hospital, the road networks will provide equity of access to all residents in Forth Valley.
