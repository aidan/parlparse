*S3M-2981 Stuart McMillan: British Government Invoke Anti-Terrorist Legislation on Iceland—That the Parliament notes with concern the news that the British Government has invoked anti-terrorist legislation, which many people believe is perceived to be aimed at Iceland through freezing the funds owned, held or controlled by the Icelandic bank, Landsbanki, and acknowledges that people in Iceland, through the petition website www.indefence.is, which has over 80,000 signatures, believe that the British Government is acting indiscriminately and affecting the interests of Iceland, its actions serving only to exacerbate the problems for Iceland during the current difficult economic climate.
