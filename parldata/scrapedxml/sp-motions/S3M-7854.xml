*S3M-7854 Murdo Fraser: Mobile Alcohol Intervention Team—That the Parliament recognises the positive work that the Fife-based Mobile Alcohol Intervention Team (MAIT) achieved in its work with young people during its pilot in Kirkcaldy in 2009; congratulates the team and notes that there was a 30% reduction in police call-outs for youth disorder and antisocial behaviour during that year; looks forward to seeing similar success arising from MAIT’s recent expansion in October 2010 into south-west Fife, notably Rosyth; further notes that its multiagency partnership, including Fife Constabulary, NHS Fife, Equal Well, Community Wardens and Clued Up has, it considers, brought a wealth of experience and wisdom to the project, which seeks to provide information and an early intervention into the health of Fife’s young people, and wishes it every success in the future.
