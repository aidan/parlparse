*S3M-7715 Alasdair Allan: Mànran—That the Parliament notes that the new Scottish Gaelic band, Mànran, made up of Norrie MacIver, Ross Saunders, Scott Mackay, Gary Innes, Calum Stewart and Ewen Henderson, has today released its first single, Latha Math, through a large number of online retailers in an attempt to become the first Gaelic band of the 21st century to make it into the UK top 40; considers that Mànran is helping to create the new sound of a modern Gaelic Scotland, and wishes the band every success for the future.
