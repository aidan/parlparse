*S1M-1691 Robin Harper: Discharges of Technetium-99 (Tc-99) from Sellafield—That the Parliament with regard to the UK Environment Agency’s public consultation on proposals for the future regulation of Technetium-99 discharges from Sellafield, objects to the Environment Agency’s proposal to allow Sellafield’s high discharges of Tc-99 to continue until at least 2006; notes that Tc-99 remains dangerous for hundreds of thousands of years and builds up in the food chain, particularly in lobsters; notes with concern that lobsters are still being found in south-west Scotland with levels of Tc-99 close to the European Community Intervention Level (1,250 Bq/kg) after a nuclear accident, that levels in seaweed range from 2,800 Bq/kg in south-west Scotland to 910 Bq/kg in Cape Wrath and therefore that the whole of the west coast of Scotland and beyond is contaminated with Tc-99; is concerned that British Nuclear Fuels Limited (BNFL) is planning to increase discharges of Tc-99 and many radioactive substances as a result of its plan to increase the throughput of its MAGNOX reprocessing plant, contrary to the UK Government’s stated intent to substantially reduce or eliminate these discharges; believes that radioactive waste should be concentrated and contained in monitorable and retrievable form rather than being diluted and dispersed in the seas around Scotland, and therefore requests that Government and the nuclear industry’s regulators should stop BNFL producing any more liquid Tc-99 and other radioactive wastes by ending MAGNOX reprocessing at Sellafield and closing BNFL’s MAGNOX reactors and furthermore should stop BNFL discharging its existing liquid Tc-99 wastes into the sea by converting them into a solid form that can be contained and shielded on the Sellafield site.
