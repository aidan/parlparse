*S1M-3317 Tommy Sheridan: Stoning of Amina Lawal-That the Parliament notes with horror the threatened stoning to death of a Nigerian woman Amina Lawal; calls on the Scottish Executive to make urgent representations to Her Majesty's Government to ask it to intervene with the Nigerian Government to prevent this atrocity and believes that Nigeria cannot remain part of the Commonwealth and international community if it enforces the sentence.
