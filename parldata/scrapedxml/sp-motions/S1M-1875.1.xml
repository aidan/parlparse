 *S1M-1875.1 Robin Harper: Report on Genetically Modified Organismsâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-1875) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, insert at end "; notes that the Committee was divided over several key conclusions of the report, specifically (a) whether or not GM crop field trials presently taking place in Scotland are safe, (b) whether or not the Scottish Parliament has powers to prevent GM crop trials as has happened in other EU countries and (c) whether a Scottish rather than an English-based body is needed to advise on GM technology in Scotland, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to suspend the current GM crop field trials as an emergency measure at least until these concerns are clarified by an independent committee of inquiry.
