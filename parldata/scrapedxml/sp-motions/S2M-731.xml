*S2M-731 Tommy Sheridan: Killing of Afghan Children by US Forces-That the Parliament is appalled at the killing of 15 Afghan children in the last 14 days by US forces involved in "clinical strikes" against alleged Taliban members; notes that these children were killed while playing near their homes and that it represents an atrocity as reprehensible as any of those atrocities executed by alleged terrorists across our world, and calls on Her Majesty's Government to issue a firm statement of condemnation for the continued killing of children in Afghanistan by US armed forces.
