*S3M-5898♦ Peter Peacock: The Future of Library Services—That the Parliament applauds the contribution made by libraries and library staff, which it considers to be essential to the social, cultural and economic wellbeing of Scotland’s communities for the past 150 years, including those in the Highlands and Islands; understands that more people in Scotland visit libraries than football matches or cinemas; considers that, despite investment in the library service, more work needs to be done to keep libraries central to their communities; welcomes Unison’s Love Your Libraries campaign, which will assess the major contribution made by those working in the library service and library users and make recommendations on safeguarding the future of the library service, and believes that all options should be considered to ensure the long-term viability of this essential service.
