*S2M-4372 Elaine Smith: National Breastfeeding Awareness Week 2006—That the Parliament notes the crucial role played by National Breastfeeding Awareness Week, which takes place between 14 and 20 May 2006, in channelling focus to the issue of breastfeeding and promoting it as a healthy lifestyle choice for new mothers and their babies; acknowledges the extent of the challenge faced in Scotland in facilitating a cultural shift in favour of breastfeeding and securing improvements in rates of uptake and duration; recognises, however, that Scotland now leads the field in the United Kingdom in terms of innovation and commitment to the cause of breastfeeding promotion and that this is largely due to the enthusiasm and dedication shown by individual health professionals and the voluntary sector throughout the country; acknowledges the aim of the Breastfeeding etc. (Scotland) Act 2005 to challenge the negative cultural influences which work to discourage mothers from breastfeeding; agrees that more work needs to be done at a national level to help publicise the new legal protection afforded to mothers by the Act in order to maximise the impact of the legislation; welcomes the Scottish Executive’s current efforts to consult on the development of an infant feeding strategy; expects that, when in place, this will work to provide an inclusive framework for future breastfeeding promotion and support in Scotland, giving this public health issue the recognition it deserves, and hopes that it will act to support and strengthen the good work already being carried out in Scotland and will serve as a barrier to the marginalisation of breastfeeding promotion within NHS budgets.
