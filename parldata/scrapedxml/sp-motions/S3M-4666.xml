 *S3M-4666 Richard Baker: Tombstoning, Jumping into the Unknown—That the Parliament notes with concern the dangerous practice of tombstoning, a potentially lethal practice that involves jumping into the sea, rivers and lochs from a cliff or other high point; further notes with concern the incidence of tombstoning in areas of north east Scotland, including Arbroath and the ongoing occurrence of tombstoning at both coastal and inland locations across Scotland; also notes with concern that in the United Kingdom tombstoning has killed 10 and seriously injured 26 people since 2005; again notes with concern that tombstoning not only puts the lives of all those directly involved at risk but also takes up a significant amount of time of the emergency services; notes also with concern the emergence of websites and videos promoting this dangerous activity that often give a false impression that tombstoning is risk-free, which can lead to copycat behaviour; welcomes the joint efforts to address this issue between police forces and the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) and in particular congratulates the local collaborative approach taken between Tayside Police and the MCA, which has resulted in a local education campaign in schools, warning of the dangers of tombstoning, a campaign leaflet focussed on holiday-makers and an appropriate enforcement strategy; notes the need for a dual approach of education and enforcement, and finally welcomes the ongoing Don’t Jump into the Unknown campaign, run by the MCA, that aims to raise awareness among young people about the risks involved in tombstoning.
