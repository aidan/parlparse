*S3M-3087 Bill Kidd: UK Government’s White Paper’s Threat to Lone Parents of Very Young Children and Disabled People—That the Parliament expresses concern at proposals contained in the UK Government’s White Paper, Raising expectations and increasing support: reforming welfare for the future, to push lone parents of very young children and disabled people into taking mandatory steps toward work that is not necessarily available in a time of economic turndown, which it believes is the result of the economic incompetence of the UK Government; believes that this represents bullying tactics against vulnerable groups and individuals, and notes that suggestions that schemes be piloted in Glasgow effectively amounts to test-bedding Glasgow in the same way as Scotland was test-bedded for the Poll Tax by the Thatcher government.
