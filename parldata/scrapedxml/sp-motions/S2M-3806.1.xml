*S2M-3806.1 Jim Mather: Skills and Training for a Modern Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3806) in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from “; recognises” to end and insert “but regrets the continuing delay in the publication of the Scottish Executive’s employability strategy and the lack of any new measures to tackle the unacceptably high number of 16 to 19-year-olds who are neither in employment, education or training in Scotland and recognises that the Executive’s worthy objectives self-evidently can only be met comprehensively when Scotland couples relevant, valued and constantly improving training with the full range of economic powers that can credibly and tangibly improve competitiveness and create the levels of employment opportunity and sustainable income improvement for all which, in turn, will retain and attract talented people to Scotland.”
