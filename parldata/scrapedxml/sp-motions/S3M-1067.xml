 *S3M-1067# Sandra White: Bambury Regeneration Centre—That the Parliament recognises the great work done by the Bambury Centre in Glasgow in vastly improving the education, skills and sustainable employment opportunities of local people through providing a training and learning centre, childcare nursery, crèche and out-of-school care, east-end internet broadcast and a conference hall and meeting rooms; congratulates the centre on winning the Scottish Urban Regeneration Forum’s Partnership award for helping to give a divided community a sense of cohesion and providing a grassroots community "owned" project that was generated and developed by local residents and which is having a positive impact on poverty and exclusion for young and old alike, and believes that the great success story that is the Bambury Centre is a perfect model for communities across Scotland.
