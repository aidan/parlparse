 *S3M-3198 Willie Coffey: Scotland Urged to Open for Euro Business during Homecoming—That the Parliament considers that the 250th anniversary of Robert Burns’s birth and the Homecoming celebrations will make Scotland the place to be for many thousands of visitors in 2009; urges Scotland’s retailers, restaurants, pubs and shops, with the support of the banks, to step up arrangements for accepting the euro for over-the-counter transactions during this year’s Homecoming celebrations, and considers that the message that Scotland is open for euro business will be warmly received by visitors from eurozone countries and those from elsewhere for whom Scotland is one stop in a wider European trip.
