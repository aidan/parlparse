 *S2M-4273 Dr Jean Turner: Scottish Monument in Flanders—That the Parliament commends the people of Zonnebeke in Flanders for their efforts in raising funds to build a Scottish monument, a Celtic cross made from Corrennie Pink granite from Scotland, which will be dedicated to all the Scottish soldiers who fought in the Great War, wherever they came from; notes that it is not aimed at glorifying war but that its sole purpose is to remember all Scottish involvement, from the Canadian Scottish to the 1st South African Brigade which was part of the 9th (Scottish) Division; further notes that there is no monument at present in any part of the Ypres Salient dedicated to any Scottish regiments and that this monument will be a tribute to every Scottish soldier, whatever his regiment; recognises the efforts of the local authorities of Passchendaele, Wytschaete and Messines for their planning of year-long events in 2007 to commemorate the 90th anniversary of the Third Battle of Ypres, otherwise known as "Passchendaele" in which there were over 500,000 British and German casualties, and further recognises that the Celtic cross will be an important, permanent reminder in keeping alive the memory of the Scottish soldiers from the Great War and will also serve as a wonderful testament to the people of Flanders in showing their thanks for the sacrifice of the Scottish soldiers and also to those Scots whose final resting place is far away from home in "Flanders Fields".
