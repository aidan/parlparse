 *S3M-2100 Sandra White: London Mayor’s Remarks—That the Parliament expresses disappointment at the comments made by London Mayor, Boris Johnson, that UK residents in London and the South East of England are "resentful" for "forking out for things in Scotland"; believes that such remarks are counter-productive to promoting a constructive working relationship between different parts of the United Kingdom; agrees with the Scottish Labour Party; the Scottish Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party that these claims are untrue, given that London receives higher public funding per head than Scotland, and hopes that these views are not shared by the UK or Scottish wing of the Conservative Party. Supported by: Rob Gibson*
