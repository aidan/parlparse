 *S3M-5490# Christopher Harvie: Bo’ness Scottish Railway Museum—That the Parliament pays tribute to the Scottish Railway Museum at Bo’ness, one of Europe’s major transport collections and a leading Scottish tourist attraction, and to its founder, the late John Burnie, and also commends John Burnie’s ambition to see the Scottish Railway Museum play its part in inspiring and training the new generation of engineers needed for infrastructure and manufacturing in the entire Forth basin.
