*S2M-4672 Shiona Baird: Home Energy Efficiency Targets Requiredâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the Sustainable Development Commission on the publication of its latest report, Stock Take: delivering improvements in existing housing; welcomes the report as a valuable contribution to the debate on how to improve the energy efficiency and sustainability of existing housing stock, reducing fuel poverty and helping to tackle climate change; recognises that around 70% of existing housing will still be in use in 2050, the date by which the UK Government has pledged to reduce carbon emissions by 60%; acknowledges that it is not sufficient merely to improve building standards for new housing and notes that if the 60% carbon reduction target is to be met by 2050 there must be significant improvements to the energy efficiency of existing housing, and calls on the Scottish Executive to include a commitment to set challenging and legally binding energy efficiency targets for all Scottish housing as part of its long-awaited energy efficiency strategy.
