 *S3M-1405 Robin Harper: Cultural Co-ordinators—That the Parliament views with alarm the decision of the Scottish Government to withdraw support from the cultural co-ordinators programme and pass responsibility to the Scottish Arts Council for a programme that is in an early stage of development but which has, with limited resources, already delivered critically important links between the worlds of art, culture and education, transforming cultural initiatives in education and enhancing children’s educational development, and agrees that it would be better to continue to develop and extend the cultural co-ordinators initiative, rather than to discontinue a scheme that will be sorely missed in many parts of Scotland.
