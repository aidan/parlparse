*S3M-1835 Margaret Mitchell: Local Authorities - External Consultants—That the Parliament notes that local authorities spent £67 million on hiring external consultants in 2007, which represents an increase of 30% on 2006; is surprised that the information on these fees is not automatically publicly available and that so much appears to be contracted out instead of being done in-house, given that local government senior managers routinely earn in excess of £100,000, and believes that all councils have an obligation to ensure that they are transparent and fully accountable to the electorate for their spending decisions.
