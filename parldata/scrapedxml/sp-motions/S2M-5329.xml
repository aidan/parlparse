*S2M-5329 Rob Gibson: Label Scotch in Gaelic—That the Parliament notes that EU institutions are currently dealing with a legislative proposal aimed at updating European rules relating to the labelling of spirit drinks; further notes that under the proposal legal recognition is given to the terms "Irish Whiskey" and "Uisce Beatha Eireannach/Irish Whiskey"; considers that it would be appropriate for the Scottish Gaelic term "Uisge-beatha Albannach" to be given similar protection as is already afforded to its Irish equivalent, particularly given the recent legislation giving Gaelic official status in Scots law, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to work alongside the whisky industry, Gaelic language bodies and Her Majesty’s Government to ensure that full EU legal status is given to Scotland’s national drink in our national languages.
