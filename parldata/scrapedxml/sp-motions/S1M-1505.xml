*S1M-1505 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Save Our Small Shops—That the Parliament supports the small shops and family businesses of Scotland and honours their contribution to the individuality of towns and villages; calls upon the Scottish Executive to have a strategy to protect locally owned shops against unrestricted development of out of town shopping centres, which have devastated existing trade in many areas and contributed to the closure of many small shops in Scotland, and to carry out an audit of remaining family-run shops and hold talks with owners and staff over their urgent concerns that Scotland does not have enough shoppers to justify unrestricted growth; recognises that the individuality of shops and the hard work of shopkeepers form a community service as well as contributing to tourism and does not want our high streets to be taken over completely by the same giant chains which operate everywhere.
