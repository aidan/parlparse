 *S1M-3535 Tommy Sheridan: Decline of the Daily Record—That the Parliament regrets the decline of the Daily Record newspaper in relation to quality, honesty, objectivity and standards of reporting; notes the rapidly declining paid sales of the Daily Record; believes that this is directly related to the poor and unprofessional stewardship of its editors, particularly that of the current editor Peter Cox; recognises the sharp decline in standards and, consequently, in sales since the appointment of Peter Cox; further believes that his use of the paper to denigrate and conduct personal vendettas against individuals is both cowardly and unprofessional; further notes the employment record of Peter Cox, who was formerly assistant editor of The Sun newspaper between 1983 and 1994 and who, during that time, wrote numerous articles and editorials supporting Mrs Thatcher and her government; notes that, during this same period, The Sun supported Mrs Thatcher’s vicious war against the miners, denigrated lone parents regularly and referred to European citizens as "krauts", "wops" and "frogs"; further notes that, before working for The Sun, he worked for a white South African paper under the vile apartheid regime and that after his eleven years at The Sun moved on to become deputy editor of the New York Post but only lasted five months there and was criticised by one executive for trying to turn the New York Post into an American version of The Sun; regrets the performance of Mr Cox since coming to Scotland, where his mistakes include denouncing a child witness as a liar the day before a Children’s Panel hearing, for which the Daily Record was found guilty of contempt of court in 1999, and crass coverage of, for example, the heroin addiction of the daughter of Donald Dewar’s chief of staff, the premature birth of Gordon and Sarah Brown’s daughter and the murder of asylum seeker Firsat Dag, which generated widespread condemnation from across Scotland and, in particular, from ethnic minority communities; further notes the 70,000 a day reduction in sales of the Daily Record since Peter Cox became editor and believes that the language used to describe democratically elected politicians is crass, abusive and alien to the high journalistic standards normally associated with Scottish newspapers, and believes that the Trinity Mirror Group in London, owners of the Daily Record, should examine seriously the decline in standards within the Daily Record under the editorship of Peter Cox before the catastrophic drop in sales and journalistic standards becomes terminal.
