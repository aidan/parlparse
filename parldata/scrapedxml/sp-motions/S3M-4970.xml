*S3M-4970♦ Elaine Murray: The Food Train Rides Out—That the Parliament congratulates the Food Train on its success over the past 14 years in providing low-cost grocery deliveries to people unable to shop for themselves; notes that the service, which was originally offered to pensioners in the town of Dumfries, is now on offer across Dumfries and Galloway; further notes that the constitution of the Food Train was changed on 2 October 2009 to enable the service to expand to other parts of Scotland; congratulates the Food Train on delivering 15,000 grocery orders to almost 600 households in the past year, and wishes the charity well in its plans to extend its services across Scotland.
