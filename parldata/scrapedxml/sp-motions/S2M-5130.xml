*S2M-5130 Ms Sandra White: Expressions of Sorrow—That the Parliament condemns, in the strongest possible terms, the attack on Beit Hanoun in Gaza perpetrated by Israel, which resulted in the killing of 18 people, including 8 children, all of them of the Athamnah family; echoes the comments of the European Union which termed the action as "a profoundly shocking event", Egypt’s foreign minister who referred to it as "immoral and inhuman" and the parliament of Kuwait which stated that the incident was one of "organized terrorism", and calls on the Scottish Executive to issue a statement denouncing Israel’s continued aggression in the middle east and expressing its deep-felt sorrow for the innocent families involved.
