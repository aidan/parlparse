*S2M-1723# Margaret Smith: Development of Edinburgh Airport—That the Parliament notes the importance of Edinburgh Airport to the local, regional and national economy; further notes projections in Her Majesty’s Government’s white paper, The Future of Air Transport, that Edinburgh Airport will need a second runway by 2020; is sceptical that these projected passenger number increases will necessarily come to pass; recognises that, while setting aside land for any second runway may be a sensible precaution, it creates planning blight for a number of households and concern for many others and that construction would necessitate relocation of the Royal Highland showground; believes BAA plc must engage with all the local communities around the airport and keep them up to date with development plans at the airport in as open and transparent a fashion as possible; recognises the problem of noise pollution from current flight levels; believes that greater provision of high-speed rail could offer genuine alternatives to short-haul air travel, with the added benefit of freeing up capacity for more long-haul international flights and reducing the need for a second runway; welcomes the development of tram and rail links to Edinburgh Airport and the development of all transport links that will reduce congestion in the area, and considers that Her Majesty’s Government, the Scottish Executive, BAA plc and all concerned should help deliver sustainable, long-term development of Edinburgh Airport.
