 *S3M-6748 Mary Scanlon: Congratulations to Orkney Junior Golf Clubâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Orkney Junior Golf Club after being named clubgolf Junior Club of the year; notes that this competition recognises clubs who have demonstrated excellence in promoting junior golf and that the final award was keenly contested by a further six finalists; welcomes the fact that, when Orkney GC began offering clubgolf coaching in 2007, junior numbers increased from 22 to 74, which led to a need for greater facilities; further notes that these improved facilities, opened in 2009, included an indoor golf centre, outdoor double bay practice net, four forward junior tees and a four-hole short course, with 2009 also seeing the number of qualified volunteer coaches rise to 14, and wishes members and supporters of Orkney Junior Golf Club continued success in the future.
