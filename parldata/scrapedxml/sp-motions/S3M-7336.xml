 *S3M-7336 Sandra White: Storyline Scotland—That the Parliament recognises the international success of the Scottish Storyline method, developed in and after 1967 by Steve Bell, Sallie Harkness and Fred Rendell at Jordanhill College of Education in Glasgow; considers this to be an innovative teaching approach, placing students’ existing knowledge at the centre of the learning experience, and notes that it has been taken up not only in Scotland but internationally, in Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands and the United States; congratulates Steve Bell and his colleagues on their success and contribution to international teaching, and believes that this evidences Scotland’s continuing excellence as a centre of imaginative liberal education in the tradition of Robert Owen, Thomas Davidson, AS Neill and RF MacKenzie.
