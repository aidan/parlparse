*S3M-708 Kenneth Gibson: Chartered Teacher Scheme—That the Parliament considers that the Chartered Teacher scheme is prohibitively expensive and that the achievement of full Chartered Teacher status, allowing teachers to access salary increases of up to £6,500, takes too long, thereby making the achievement of full Chartered Teacher status unrealistic for most teachers; believes that all teachers should be able to access higher salaries in order for the scheme to be a credible part of the salary structure; notes that of Scotland’s 20,000 eligible teachers less than 3,500 have registered to work towards Chartered Teacher status and only just over 300 have achieved full accreditation; agrees that this shows that the scheme is not currently within the reach of most teachers and is therefore inequitable; acknowledges that the scheme in its current form creates a false picture of teacher salaries; considers that achieving Chartered Teacher status should be affordable to all members of the profession who are eligible; understands the need for the accreditation route to be streamlined to reduce the amount of time required to achieve full accreditation; realises that the 12 modules required for full accreditation, costing £650 each, effectively price many teachers with young families out of the scheme, and affirms that, in light of this and in the spirit of the McCrone agreement, the Chartered Teacher scheme should be reviewed so that it can achieve its original goal of rewarding experienced teachers who wish to continue to work in the classroom.
