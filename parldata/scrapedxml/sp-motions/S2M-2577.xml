 * S2M-2577 Tommy Sheridan:Comments of Republican Member of Congress About Syria—That the Parliament condemns the comments of Republican member of Congress, Sam Johnson, on 19 February 2005 when he was quoted as saying, “Syria is the problem. Syria is where those Weapons of Mass Destruction are, in my view. You know, I can fly an F-15, put two nukes on ‘em and I’ll make one pass. We don’t have to worry about Syria any more”; believes that such comments are not only irresponsible but inhumane in relation to the deployment of nuclear weapons which are illegal and barbaric in that they kill indiscriminately; believes that this member of Congress should be roundly condemned across the world for making such comments, and believes that the Republican Party should seek his immediate resignation from Congress and, if he refuses to resign, should expel him forthwith.
