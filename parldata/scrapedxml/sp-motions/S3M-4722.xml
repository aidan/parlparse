 *S3M-4722 Bill Wilson: Excessive Charges for Users of Prepayment Meters—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Federation of Housing Associations’ support for the National Housing Federation’s (NHF) campaign against excessive charges levied by power companies on those who use prepayment meters; congratulates Scottish Power, Npower and E.ON for removing such premiums on gas and electricity; notes, however, that, according to the NHF, British Gas, EDF Energy and Scottish and Southern Energy still penalise their gas prepayment customers by charging them up to £40 a year more for their fuel; further notes that, between 2006 and 2008, many premiums were far higher despite EU directives limiting premiums to only the extra cost of installing and maintaining meters, which Ofgem estimates at around £40 a year for gas and £30 a year for electricity; understands that, despite hundreds of letters sent by consumers, no company has yet offered a rebate; wishes the NHF and Consumer Focus well with their investigation of this matter, which potentially involves a breach of EU legislation, and calls on all power companies to cease practices that discriminate against the poorest members of society, make reparations for such practices in the past and treat all customers fairly.
