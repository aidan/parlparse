 *S3M-5171.1 David Whitton: Apprentices—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5171) in the name of Christina McKelvie, leave out from "plans" to end and insert "ambition of the UK Government to ensure that three quarters of people participate in higher education or complete an advanced apprenticeship or equivalent technician-level course by the age of 30; welcomes the publication of Skills for Growth – A national strategy for economic growth and individual prosperity on 11 November 2009; further welcomes the passing of the Apprenticeships, Skills, Children and Learning Bill and looks forward to the Bill receiving Royal Assent; understands that this Bill provides for a statutory framework for apprenticeships and creates a right to an apprenticeship for suitably qualified 16 to 18-year-olds; further understands that, thanks to this Bill, Scottish workers will benefit from the right to request time off for training; understands that SNP MPs failed to support this Bill in the final stage of its passage through the Houses of Parliament despite this right to request time off for training being supported by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning; considers that, far from implementing savage cuts for apprenticeships and training places, the Skills for Growth strategy will create 35,000 new advanced apprenticeships over the next two years; considers that the 7,800 extra apprenticeship places, the apprenticeship guarantee and the modern apprenticeship summit were agreed by the Scottish Government only following pressure during budget negotiations earlier this year, and welcomes Labour’s continued commitment to skills and training for the people of Scotland."
