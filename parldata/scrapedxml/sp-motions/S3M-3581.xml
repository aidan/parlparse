*S3M-3581 Rob Gibson: President Mugabe’s Birthday Sinks Country Further into Destitution—That the Parliament condemns the appalling behaviour of Robert Mugabe in marking his 85th birthday on 21 February 2009 with a sumptuous banquet in Harare as the start of a week of extravagant celebrations that included a $100-a-ticket gala dinner and advertised musical extravaganza; notes that Mr Mugabe’s latest show of excess comes at the same time that Zimbabwe’s Prime Minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, declared that it would take around £3.5 billion to rehabilitate the country’s collapsed health, social and education systems; deplores the involuntary removal of cattle and money from the starving people of Zimbabwe by their president and notes that each district was expected to donate 50 cattle and to raise $1,500 to go toward the week’s celebrations, and finally calls for Mr Mugabe to honour the power-sharing agreement with Prime Minister Tsvangirai and work efficiently and cooperatively to rebuild their nation and bring their people out of destitution. Supported by: Kenneth Gibson*, Bill Wilson*, Jamie Hepburn*, Bob Doris*, Alasdair Allan*, Patricia Ferguson*, Bill Kidd*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Gil Paterson*, Sandra White*, Robin Harper*, Christine Grahame*, Mike Pringle*
