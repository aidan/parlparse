*S3M-2501 Christina McKelvie: Tragedy, Loss, Hope, Help, Rescue and Survival—That the Parliament acknowledges the excellent work of Scotland’s firefighters, as detailed in research published by the Fire Brigades Union showing that 141 people per month are rescued from fires and vehicle crashes by fire crew, that 4,181 people were rescued from dwelling fires between 2001 and 2005 and that 4,280 people involved in road traffic collisions were rescued in the five years to 2005-06, the most recent year for which figures are available, and thanks our firefighters for their efforts to preserve lives across Scotland and bring hope, help, rescue and survival where there is tragedy and loss.
