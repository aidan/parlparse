*S2M-2079 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Feu Duty Compensation—That the Parliament agrees with the abolition of the feudal system; considers that in 2004 no one should be paying feu duty to a "feudal superior"; invites the Church of Scotland to reconsider its reported charging of feudal tenants when the feudal system is abolished on 28 November 2004, which would affect a disproportionate amount of elderly people, and considers that, if the Church of Scotland is not persuaded to do this, due to the considerable drop in income levels it claims this will bring, the Parliament should investigate ways of recompensing either the Church of Scotland or the householder to save them from being charged sums of between approximately £400 and £800 by their "feudal superiors".
