 *S2M-2342 Mr Brian Monteith: Failure of Norway’s Ban on Smoking in Public Places—That the Parliament recognises that Norway’s ban on smoking in all public places, introduced in 2004, has failed to reduce the incidence of smoking; recognises that, according to Statistics Norway’s annual survey of smoking practices, the number of Norwegians between the age of 16 and 74 who smoke daily, which had dropped from 29% to 26% in 2003 without a smoking ban, has dropped by only 0.3% in 2004 following the ban; recognises that the number of daily smokers among young Norwegians aged 16 to 24 actually increased, rising to 23.7% from 22.8% in 2003; acknowledges that smoking bans do not necessarily reduce the incidence of tobacco consumption, and calls on the Scottish Executive to reflect on the Norwegian example before pressing ahead with its plans for a similar total ban in Scotland.
