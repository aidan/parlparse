*S2M-4651 Roseanna Cunningham: Undergrounding the Beauly to Denny Power Line—That the Parliament notes the suggestion by Perth and Kinross Council, the Highland Council, the Cairngorms National Park Authority, the John Muir Trust and Scottish Natural Heritage that certain sections of the proposed Beauly to Denny electricity transmission line be buried underground; notes the work of the Perthshire-based Braco Pylons Campaign which promotes awareness of the positive aspects of undergrounding power lines, including the benefit of decreasing electric and magnetic fields (EMF) exposure limits, and the work of other campaign groups throughout Scotland who want further consideration of the undergrounding option; notes that the Olympic Delivery Authority is spending up to £200 million burying transmission lines in order to clear the site for London’s new Olympic Park for the 2012 Games, and calls on the Scottish Executive not to make any decision on the plans for the Beauly to Denny power line until the option of burying cables underground has been fully explored.
