*S2M-1487 Robert Brown: Internet Dialler Fraud—That the Parliament acknowledges the public harm caused by consumer fraud involving premium rate, satellite and international number internet "diallers", which close the user’s current internet connection to their regular service provider and connect to an alternate service without their knowledge; notes that calls to the telephone regulator, Ofcom, have nearly quadrupled during the period 1999-2003, whilst calls to premium-rate regulator, the Independent Committee for the Supervision of Standards of Telephone Information Services (ICSTIS) have risen by 500% since the discovery of the internet problem; notes that ICSTIS estimates that the value of premium-rated services in the United Kingdom to be worth over £1 billion per year; urges ICSTIS, telecommunication companies and the Internet Service Providers Association to take effective steps to identify the perpetrators and to warn the public of the problem, and believes that Her Majesty’s Government should introduce legislation to protect consumers against such fraud, which is estimated to cost consumers around £5 to £10 million a year on premium-rate internet calls alone.
