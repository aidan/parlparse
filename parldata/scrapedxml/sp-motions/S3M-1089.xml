 *S3M-1089 Kenneth Gibson: Save the Albatross—That the Parliament supports the campaign by the RSPB, BirdLife International and a host of partner organisations worldwide to save the 100,000 albatrosses killed each year by swallowing baited hooks used by longline fishing boats; notes that 19 of the world’s 22 albatross species are being driven to extinction through being killed in this cruel and unnecessary way, with three species critically endangered and Amsterdam Albatross numbers already having plummeted to 17 breeding pairs worldwide; is aware that the low reproductive rate of these majestic creatures makes albatross population recovery difficult and accentuates their vulnerability; commends the work of the Albatross Task Force in helping longline fishermen introduce albatross-friendly ways of working; recognises the progress made by the campaign to date, and wishes it continued and growing success.
