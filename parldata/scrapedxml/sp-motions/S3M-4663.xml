 *S3M-4663♦ Maureen Watt: Devolving Marine Conservation—That the Parliament acknowledges the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution’s recommendation that marine conservation policy should be devolved to Scottish control; notes that Scottish Environment LINK believes that the marine Bills currently before Westminster and Holyrood provide a unique and quick opportunity to devolve responsibility for marine conservation; considers the devolution of marine conservation to be vital for the north east and other coastal areas, and believes that by working together the Scottish and UK governments can ensure that this opportunity is not wasted.
