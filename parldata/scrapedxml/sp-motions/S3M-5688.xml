*S3M-5688 Jamie Hepburn: Second Annual Grangemouth Music Festival—That the Parliament welcomes the second annual Grangemouth Music Festival, which is to take place on seven consecutive Saturdays between 1 May and 12 June 2010 and is to be run by Grangemouth Independent Retailers; congratulates Jim Waugh and Les Burkey, who are to head up the organisation of the event for a second year running following its successful debut last year as part of the Homecoming Scotland 2009 celebrations; notes that the festival is to benefit greatly from improvements being made to the bandstand in La Porte Precinct, following a £35,000 award from the Scottish Government’s Town Centre Regeneration Fund; further notes that the festival will feature a broad mix of bands with Celtic rock and contemporary ceilidh band Skerryvore launching the event, and wishes all those organising, participating in and attending a very successful, entertaining and enjoyable festival.
