 *S3M-5225 Stuart McMillan: Inverclyde Chosen for Lottery Funding Boost—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that Inverclyde has been chosen as one of five areas to receive a share of £9 million of National Lottery money; notes that Greenock Central and East has been selected for a new Big Lottery Fund programme aimed at helping to revive communities; further notes that the Our Place initiative has been developed in order to make increased investment in areas that have not seen the expected level of grants over the last three years, and looks forward to seeing the development of this community and the others selected to receive this funding boost.
