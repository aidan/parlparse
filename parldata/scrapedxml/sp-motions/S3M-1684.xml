 *S3M-1684 Karen Whitefield: Scotrail Franchise Renewal—That the Parliament expresses its grave concern about the decision taken by the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change to extend the First Scotrail franchise for three years to 2014 without consulting MSPs, transport authorities, passenger groups, trade unions and other stakeholders, especially in light of the fact that nearly two thirds of First Group plc’s income to run Scotland’s rail services is public subsidy; notes that the First Scotrail franchise is the largest contract let by Scottish Ministers, with the level of public subsidy to be paid over the lifetime of the franchise likely to reach £2 billion; calls on the Parliament’s Transport, Climate Change and Infrastructure Committee to conduct an immediate inquiry into the decision, and believes that the minister should have made the announcement to the Parliament.
