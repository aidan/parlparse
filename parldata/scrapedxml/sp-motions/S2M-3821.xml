*S2M-3821 Frances Curran: US Air Force Strike on Village in Pakistan—That the Parliament condemns the bombing on Saturday 14 January 2006 by the CIA of a village in Pakistan on the border with Afghanistan which killed at least 18 innocent people; believes that this attack represents a humanitarian outrage which should be condemned by the United Nations and the world community in the strongest possible terms; notes that incorrect intelligence that Al Qaeda number 2, Ayman al-Zawahri, was in the village led to the strike which devastated so many villagers’ lives; further notes that thousands of people in Karachi and elsewhere in Pakistan have demonstrated their anger at the cynical use by the USA of, and the Pakistani government’s collaboration in, the so-called “war on terror”; further notes that the UK Government has just sent 400 soldiers to relieve US troops in Afghanistan which is essentially a war zone because of the war on terror, and believes that the action of the United States of America demonstrates a cynical and arrogant contempt for human life and will further divide the world in a violent conflict between the Muslim community and Western powers.
