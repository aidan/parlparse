 *S3M-7055 Kenneth Gibson: Fossil Fuel Levy—That the Parliament is concerned that the UK Government’s respect agenda is already faltering after only five months in office; believes that, in order for coalition soundbites to be taken seriously, the UK Government should immediately release the £185 million fossil fuel levy, which can only be spent on renewable energy projects in Scotland and is currently held by Ofgem; considers that, during this difficult financial period, this input of capital would create and safeguard thousands of jobs in Scotland while also advancing Scotland’s renewable energy potential in accordance with the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009; believes that, should the UK Government refuse to release these funds, it will have failed to meet one of the key political reforms that it proposed in its publication, The Coalition: Our Programme for Government, which stated that "We will review the control and use of accumulated and future revenues from the Fossil Fuel Levy in Scotland", and further believes that the release of such funds should not be deducted from the Scottish Parliament’s block grant as was inferred by the previous chancellor.
