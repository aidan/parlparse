 S3M-5963 Bob Doris: Welcoming St Gregory’s Family Centre, Supporting Fight for New School—That the Parliament applauds the victory for Maryhill residents as the first turfs were cut at a ceremony on 16 March 2010 to mark the development of the new family centre at the site of the former St Gregory’s Primary School in Wyndford; believes that the family centre was secured for the area because of the high-profile and inspiring campaign by children, parents and the wider community against the closure of the Wyndford and St Gregory’s schools in 2009; reaffirms its belief that Glasgow City Council’s Labour administration was wrong to close these schools and that the consultation process was woefully inadequate and flawed; condemns the council for rejecting requests to bring schooling back to the Wyndford area under the Scottish Government’s Scottish Futures Trust; considers that, given the extent of UK cuts now coming to Scotland, further investment in the schools estate will become increasingly difficult, and believes that the council should conduct an open and transparent educational provision planning exercise in the area to re-examine the area’s educational needs and to ensure that Wyndford is prioritised for investment according to those needs.
