 *S1M-1837# Shona Robison: Privatisation of Meat Inspection—That the Parliament notes with concern the changes being proposed to the inspection of carcass meats in the UK, which will remove the function of meat inspection from official controls and make the industry itself responsible for the carrying out of meat inspection; notes the concern expressed by UNISON and others about these proposals; believes that the use of independent government inspectors working for the Meat Hygiene Service is the best way of ensuring the safety of meat consumed by the public, and believes that a full and open debate should take place in Scotland on any proposals to privatise meat inspection, rather than the issue being left to the European and Westminster Parliaments. Supported by: Fergus Ewing*, Dennis Canavan*
