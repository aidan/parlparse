 *S1M-942 David Mundell: The Davie and William Show-That the Parliament notes that David Shankland and William Williamson have brought great pleasure for many years to thousands of people in Dumfries and Galloway with their weekly local radio programme; further notes that "The Davie and William Show" has played an important part in promoting, developing and sustaining local culture in Dumfries and Galloway; notes with concern that the programme has been dropped from its weekly Saturday slot on West Sound Radio, and calls upon the Scottish Radio Holdings plc to do all it can to facilitate the immediate return of "The Davie and William Show" in that slot.
