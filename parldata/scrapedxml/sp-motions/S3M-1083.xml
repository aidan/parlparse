 *S3M-1083 Pauline McNeill: Brick by Brick: A Tenancy Deposit Scheme for Scotland—That the Parliament notes the publication of the latest National Union of Students Scotland’s report, Brick by Brick: the state of student housing in Scotland 2007, which draws attention to the one-third of Scottish students who lose their deposits on leaving private accommodation; notes that many students, who may rely on the return of this deposit to pay upfront rent for their next property, believe that their deposits have been withheld unfairly and expresses concern that the withholding of deposits unfairly can lead to hardship and ultimately homelessness; further notes the tenancy deposit protection scheme in operation in England and Wales which ensures protection for both landlords and students, and calls on the Scottish Government to engage with NUS Scotland with a view to implementing a similar scheme for Scotland.
