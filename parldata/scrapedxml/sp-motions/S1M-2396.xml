*S1M-2396 Bruce Crawford: Moratorium on GM Foods-That the Parliament congratulates Europe's environment ministers for rejecting European Commission plans to lift the current moratorium on approving new genetically-modified plant varieties; welcomes the positive effect this decision will have on protecting public health and the environment; expresses disappointment and dismay at the support of Her Majesty's Government for the lifting of the moratorium, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to attempt to persuade Her Majesty's Government to change its position and ensure that the moratorium remains in place.
