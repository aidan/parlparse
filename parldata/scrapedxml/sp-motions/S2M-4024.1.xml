 *S2M-4024.1 Christine Grahame: Regeneration in Scotland - People and Place—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4024) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes that after some seven years of this Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition and the launch of yet another glossy brochure littered with self-evident axioms, one in four Scottish children and one in five pensioners remain in poverty; further notes that tens of thousands of young people remain not in education, training or employment and that 39,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in the first three years of this government and that, according to a report in The Herald on 28 February 2006, a spokesman for the First Minister stated regarding regeneration,"England has jumped ahead of us on this. This is us getting our act together"; therefore welcomes the Finance Committee’s inquiry on deprivation spending, to report at the end of March, and recognises that, had the Scottish people not been deliberately misled about the impact of the energy reserves in the 1970s and the economic and social prospects of independence, poverty in Scotland would have been made history."
