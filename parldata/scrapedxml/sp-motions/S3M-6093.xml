*S3M-6093 Jamie McGrigor: Air Iomlaid Art Exhibition 10 April to 9 May 2010—That the Parliament notes that the Air Iomlaid exhibition of artwork by pupils of Bun-sgoil Shlèite, Skye, and Tollcross Primary School, Edinburgh, takes place at Edinburgh’s Fruitmarket Gallery from 10 April until 9 May 2010; is aware that the exhibition marks the culmination of an intensive process of art tuition, conducted in Gaelic, over 18 months at both primary schools, devised and developed by artist Julie Brook, which has produced an excellent range of sketchbooks, drawings, paintings, poems, animation and collaborative large-scale artworks; commends the pupils involved in this exciting exchange of ideas and techniques and positive exploration of culture and shared ideas through the medium of art and Gaelic, and encourages members of the public to visit the exhibition and see the first-class creative work that has resulted from this inspirational project.
