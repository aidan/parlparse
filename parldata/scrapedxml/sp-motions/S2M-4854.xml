*S2M-4854 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Safeguarding Scottish Comprehensive Education—That the Parliament notes with concern that the First Minister, Jack McConnell, is using his party conference to announce his plan for 100 "skills academies" under which less successful pupils will be persuaded to leave school at 14 to go into separate institutions to learn a trade; further notes that most of these "academies" will be located in further education colleges which, since they were removed from local authorities, have suffered from under-funding and low staff morale; believes that these "academies" will become ghettoes for the most deprived young people, including those growing up in acute poverty; calls on the Scottish Executive to support small businesses to take on apprentices, particularly in areas of high numbers of young people not in education, employment or training; further calls for the introduction of vocational courses as part of a broad and balanced curriculum which should follow on from tackling school disaffection at its source, including smaller classes, especially where children’s lives are troubled by poverty and disadvantage, stopping the practice of placing some children in ability groups at the age of five and stopping building large and anonymous high schools where many children simply drift, and calls for the restoration of the integrated community school project.
