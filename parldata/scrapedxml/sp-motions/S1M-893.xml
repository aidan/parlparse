*S1M-893 Mrs Mary Mulligan: Mike Tyson—That the Education, Culture and Sport Committee calls upon the Scottish Football Association to reconsider its proposal to host the boxing contest involving Mike Tyson, considers that it is inappropriate to allow the use of Scotland’s National Stadium by an individual who has been convicted of the crime of rape and further considers that he represents an image of sport and boxing in particular which is unacceptable in this country and which, if the bout goes ahead, will encourage young people to believe that violence, particularly violence against women, is to be tolerated.
