*S2M-5131 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Integrated Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation Services for Scotland—That the Parliament recognises the misery caused by drug misuse in our communities; acknowledges that current and past policies of the Scottish Executive have failed, and calls on the Executive to implement, as a matter of urgency, a policy of integrated drug treatment and rehabilitation services across Scotland, such services to be based on a range of treatment options including family support, action on employability, substitute prescribing, and residential and community-based rehabilitation, all of these services to be based on a full assessment of individuals’ needs, through an individual care plan implemented and monitored by a key worker allocated to each individual and provided equally across the country.
