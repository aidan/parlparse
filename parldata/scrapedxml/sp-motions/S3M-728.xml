 *S3M-728 Marlyn Glen: World AIDS Day 2007—That the Parliament observes World Aids Day on 1 December 2007; acknowledges that there are an estimated 39.5 million people living with HIV worldwide; supports this year’s campaign theme, "HIV: Let’s Get Talking", aimed at encouraging wider discussion and understanding of HIV; recognises that, despite the decreasing visibility of HIV in Scotland in recent years, numbers of annual diagnoses have increased sharply since the 1990s with 2005 seeing the highest number of reported cases on record; considers that around a third of people living with HIV in Scotland remain undiagnosed; understands that late diagnoses account for at least 5% of HIV-related deaths each year in the United Kingdom, many of which could be avoided through early testing and access to treatment; acknowledges that stigma impacts profoundly on the lives of people living with HIV and acts as a major barrier to testing; supports efforts to promote greater awareness and understanding of the realties of living with HIV, and welcomes the opportunity which World Aids Day presents to get people in Scotland talking about HIV.
