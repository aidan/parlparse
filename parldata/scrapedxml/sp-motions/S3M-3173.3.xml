*S3M-3173.3 Patrick Harvie: Homecoming and its Potential to Support Sustainable Economic Growth—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3173) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from "further recognises" to end and insert "expresses its disappointment that no effort has been made to assess the climate impact of the Homecoming; considers that it is vital to shift the tourism industry away from dependence on aviation; recognises how domestic and local tourism opportunities are crucial to Scotland’s tourism market and economy; further recognises that a significant majority of tourists visiting Scotland come here from elsewhere in the British Isles; believes that the Homecoming is likely to be both more successful and more sustainable if these more local markets are prioritised throughout 2009, and calls on the Scottish Government to publish a sustainability statement for the Homecoming, detailing the expected share of surface-based transport, the impact on greenhouse gas emissions and how the Scottish Government will prioritise local tourism marketing."
