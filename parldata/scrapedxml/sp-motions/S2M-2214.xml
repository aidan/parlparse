*S2M-2214 Mike Pringle: New Year Derbies—That the Parliament notes that the first ever Edinburgh derby was held over 100 years ago in 1895; notes that this season the derby was scheduled to be on New Year’s Day but was changed by the TV company, Setanta; further notes the support of both fans and clubs for the traditional New Year derby, and calls on the Scottish Premier League, in consultation with the clubs and police, to reintroduce the Edinburgh New Year derby as a permanent fixture in the calendar as well as look favourably on the reintroduction of other New Year derbies where they have the support of clubs and fans.
