 *S3M-1304 Bob Doris: God Bless the SNP Government—That the Parliament notes the statement by Glasgow City Council leader, Steven Purcell, confirming the Labour administration’s intention to freeze its council tax levels for a third year; recognises that this is in stark contrast to the 20%, 22% and 12% rises in its first three years as a unitary authority; welcomes the comments of one councillor who stated "The opposition Scottish Government is giving us money to do what we were planning to do anyway. God bless them"; applauds the fact that this will allow Glasgow City Council to apply for its share of the additional £70 million being made available by the Scottish Government to allow all local authorities to freeze council tax, and looks forward to other local authorities following suit. Supported by: Alasdair Allan*, Ian McKee*, Bashir Ahmad*, Christine Grahame*, Aileen Campbell*, Rob Gibson*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Stuart McMillan*
