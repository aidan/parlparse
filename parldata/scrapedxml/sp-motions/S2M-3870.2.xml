*S2M-3870.2 Richard Lochhead: Future Energy Policyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-3870) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from "with interest" to end and insert "that Scotland is an energy rich nation; rejects calls for investment in new nuclear power stations in favour of accelerating the development of our renewables potential and emerging clean technologies; notes that, contrary to the impression given by many commentators, Scotland is a gas exporter and consumes only one-eighth of gas produced, and believes that the Parliament requires the political powers to determine our own energy future and ensure that our energy resources benefit the people of Scotland."
