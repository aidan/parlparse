*S3M-1158 Jamie Hepburn: London Olympic Funding—That the Parliament congratulates Scottish National Party MPs in Westminster for voting against the decision to divert up to £184 million of Scottish lottery funding to the London Olympic Games; notes that not a single Scottish Labour MP voted against this decision; considers that those Scottish Labour MPs who voted for this decision have badly let down vulnerable and disadvantaged groups in their constituencies, many of which rely on lottery funding as lifeline support; believes that lottery money earmarked for Scotland should be spent in Scotland, and recognises the vast difference in planning, budgeting and use of resources between the Glasgow Commonwealth Games and the London Olympics. Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Alex Neil*, Christine Grahame*, Gil Paterson*, Sandra White*, Bill Wilson*, Bashir Ahmad*, Stuart McMillan*, Alasdair Allan*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Nigel Don*, Kenneth Gibson*
