*S3M-1020 Bill Wilson: Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation—That the Parliament welcomes the recent Greenpeace report, Cooking the Climate; condemns the rapid destruction of Indonesia’s tropical forests for the sake of palm oil; understands that the rate of Indonesia’s deforestation, 2% a year, is the highest in the world; notes that using biofuels such as palm oil, whose production is associated with peatland destruction, will be worse for the climate than continuing to rely on fossil fuels; demands reconsideration of the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation (RTFO) which stipulates that a proportion of fuel sales must come from biofuels by April 2008, without requiring any guarantee of sustainability; believes, therefore, that the RTFO does nothing to prevent the kind of environmental devastation taking place in Indonesia; calls on the Scottish Government and the UK Government to postpone the implementation of the RTFO until sustainability standards are in place, and believes that the fact that there is currently no internationally agreed definition of a sustainable biofuel is no justification for ongoing deforestation. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Patrick Harvie*, Stuart McMillan*, Robin Harper*
