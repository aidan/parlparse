*S2M-3550 Michael Matheson: Boost to Gaelic Language—That the Parliament welcomes the recent agreement between Spain and the European Union which allows people who so wish to correspond with certain European Union institutions in Catalan, Galician and Basque; notes that the agreement was signed in Brussels by the Spanish Foreign Minister and the UK Foreign Secretary; considers that this offers an opportunity to place Gaelic on a similar footing, and calls on the Scottish Executive to enter into negotiations with the European Union to ensure that Gaelic is awarded the same status within Europe as Catalan, Galician and Basque.
