*S3M-1890 Bob Doris: The Path is Green—That the Parliament strongly welcomes the launch of The Path is Green, a Careers Scotland initiative to attract young people into jobs in the renewables sector; notes that there are at present 80,000 such jobs and that a further 50,000 are projected within the next 10 years; observes that traditional occupations will require a new set of skills to realise Scotland’s potential for producing 25% of the European Union’s total capacity for wind and tidal power; further notes that Green jobs extend beyond renewable energy and that there are an increasing number of opportunities in other areas, for example, in environmental careers such as town planning and landscape architecture, water waste management and sustainable constructions; applauds the cyber-friendly focus of the initiative, of which more information can be found at www.thepathisgreen.com, and applauds the joined-up thinking that links important career opportunities with both the economic future of Scotland and the wellbeing of our planet.
