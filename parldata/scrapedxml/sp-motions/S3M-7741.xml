 *S3M-7741 John Wilson: Savage Cuts in North Lanarkshire—That the Parliament is concerned that North Lanarkshire Council has decided to introduce a new four-weekly pay period instead of the historical fortnightly pay period for its employees on the lowest pay grade; understands that, as of 12 June 2010, North Lanarkshire Council employed 14,443 full-time equivalent employees who may be affected; considers that this was done with minimum consultation with the appropriate unions, and acknowledges that, while the new system beds in, this will have a severe impact on workers already facing serious financial hardship.
