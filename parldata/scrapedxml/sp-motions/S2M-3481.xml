*S2M-3481 Rosie Kane: They Hang Asylum Seekers in the Scottish Parliament—That the Parliament finds it ironic that photographs which adorn its walls include Nexhi Vucaj and that Nexhi, her husband and three children were subjected to a dawn raid at the hands of the Home Office and were removed to Albania, having lived in Glasgow for five years; welcomes the image of asylum seekers among our works of art; believes that, if we are to exhibit these images in the Parliament to emphasise our diversity here in Scotland, then at the very least we should do everything we can to ensure that people who come to this country for whatever reason are welcomed, supported and encouraged to stay, and further believes that the rich tapestry which makes up Scotland is something we should cherish, but not only on a wall and in a frame. Supported by: Brian Adam*, Ms Sandra White*, Eleanor Scott*
