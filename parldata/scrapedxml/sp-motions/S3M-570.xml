*S3M-570 Jackie Baillie: Ditch the Discrimination—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of ScottishPower to write off the debt, accrued through no fault of their own, of those token prepayment meter customers outside its former monopoly area; expresses concern that 13,000 customers in southern Scotland and Liverpool, including Glasgow and Edinburgh, will continue to be exposed to debt that they have accrued because of ScottishPower’s failure to reset antiquated token meters in a timely fashion following price rises; notes that, along with Npower and Powergen, it is one of the six major suppliers who adopt a policy of backcharging low-income customers, and calls on ScottishPower to go even further than Npower and Powergen by writing off the debts of all of its token meter customers and effectively ending the policy of backcharging.
