*S1M-4015# Trish Godman: Welcome Overhaul of Credit Laws—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Department of Trade and Industry to introduce legislation that will, at long last, give greater protection against those avaricious companies that inflict extortionate interest charges upon vulnerable borrowers; believes that the Scottish Executive, Scottish banks, credit unions and local authorities have an important role to play in the proposed safeguards to be given to decent, ordinary people who are hoodwinked by such disreputable companies, and further believes that ways and means must be found to eliminate the predatory activities of loan sharks who continue to ply their evil trade in communities throughout Scotland.
