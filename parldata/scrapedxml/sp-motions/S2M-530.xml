*S2M-530 Miss Annabel Goldie: New York Crime Success-That the Parliament notes the publication of the Crime in the United States report by the Federal Bureau of Investigation; congratulates New York City on becoming the safest large city in America as crime has dropped 5% this year to its lowest level since the 1960s; recognises that this impressive record is largely due to the "broken windows" approach adopted which has led to "zero tolerance" neighbourhood policing based on the idea that no act of crime, no matter how small, should be ignored, and calls on the Scottish Executive to increase the resources available to our overstretched criminal justice system and to learn from the New York experience by introducing directly elected conveners of police boards who would be accountable to their local communities through regular publication of localised crime statistics, based on "Compstat", and would therefore be able to respond to the public's expressed desire for such "zero tolerance" policing in Scotland, along with a far more visible police presence on our streets.
