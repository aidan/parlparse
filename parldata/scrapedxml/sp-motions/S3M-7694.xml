 *S3M-7694 Mary Scanlon: Save RAF Lossiemouth—That the Parliament recognises what it considers as the huge support for The Northern Scot’s petition to save RAF Lossiemouth, which has been signed by over 30,000 people; recognises that this represents over one third of the total population of Moray; applauds the decision of campaigners to travel from Moray to Downing Street in a battle bus to deliver the petition in person; believes that the undertaking of a 1,200-mile round trip shows the strength of feeling in the local community to save the RAF base, and hopes what it sees as this tremendous campaign will resound with decision makers and secure the future of RAF Lossiemouth. Supported by: Hugh Henry*, Bill Aitken*, David McLetchie*, John Lamont*, Bill Kidd*, Nanette Milne*, Alison McInnes*, Brian Adam*, John Farquhar Munro*, Jackson Carlaw*, Stewart Maxwell*, David Stewart*, Margaret Mitchell*, Dave Thompson*, Jamie McGrigor*, Murdo Fraser*
