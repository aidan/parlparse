*S2M-923 Mr Brian Monteith: Council House Rent Rises in Stirling-That the Parliament notes the decision of Stirling Council to increase council house rents by 8% this year, in sharp contrast with the relatively low level introduced immediately before the last year's local authority elections and further notes with surprise the lack of any public criticism of this large rent rise from Stirling Labour Councillor Colin Findlay, despite the fact that only last month he felt compelled to publicly lecture power companies for a 6% increase in bills which he said would have a "devastating impact on families".
