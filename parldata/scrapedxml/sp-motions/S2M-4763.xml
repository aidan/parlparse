*S2M-4763 Jackie Baillie: Meter Madness—That the Parliament expresses concern that the practice of collecting back charges from customers who have not had their token prepayment meters recalibrated following a rise in energy prices threatens 250,000 households with increasing levels of debt, with some households facing a 138% rise in their weekly energy bill; notes that four companies: Scottish Gas, Scottish Power, npower and Powergen pursue this practice, while Scottish and Southern Energy (Scottish Hydro) and EDF Energy do not charge customers until their meters have been recalibrated, and calls on those companies which continue to collect back charges to follow the lead of Scottish and Southern and EDF and apply price rises only after a meter has been recalibrated.
