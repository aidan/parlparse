*S3M-1301 Jamie McGrigor: Rights of the Indian Hindu Minority in Malaysia—That the Parliament notes with concern the recent arrest and detention without trial in Malaysia of five ethnic Indian human rights activists from the organisation Hindraf (Hindu Rights Action Force) following a peaceful rally about human rights; notes that these men are being held under the Internal Security Act which allows detention without trial for an unspecified period; further notes that these arrests come on top of other actions taken by the Malaysian Government to curtail the human rights of the minority Indian Hindu community in Malaysia including the freedom of religion; calls on Her Majesty’s Government to make representations to the government of Malaysia about these matters and to press for the early release of the Hindraf activists, and, while noting the UK’s good relations with Malaysia and the welcome contributions that Malaysia makes to peacekeeping missions across the globe, calls on Malaysia to ensure that the internationally protected rights to peaceful assembly, expression and freedom of thought, conscience and religion are promoted at home among all the ethnic groups that make up Malaysian society, including the ethnic minority Indian community.
