 *S2M-2897 Frances Curran: Don’t Stop at Edinburgh—That the Parliament welcomes the call by Bob Geldof for a million people to take a day off work or study to come to Edinburgh on Wednesday 6 July 2005, the opening day of the G8 summit in Gleneagles; calls on them, however, not to stop at Edinburgh, but to continue a few miles north to Gleneagles to take part in the mass demonstration called by G8 Alternatives against global poverty, climate change and fair trade; notes that G8 Alternatives is an umbrella for many of the Scottish grassroots organisations protesting at the summit and is already supporting the call for people to take to the streets of Edinburgh on 2 July for the Make Poverty History demonstration, and calls on all those coming to Scotland on 6 July to come to Gleneagles to let their voice be heard and extends that invitation to Bob Geldof and Midge Ure.
