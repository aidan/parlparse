 *S3M-1073 Mike Pringle: Royal Hospital for Sick Children, Edinburgh—That the Parliament notes the excellent range of services currently provided by the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh and is concerned at proposals to centralise children’s services in Glasgow; recognises the compelling case for maintaining the existing provision in Edinburgh, and believes that moving brain tumour treatment, academic training and early clinical trials of new drugs to a centralised location would not be in the interests of patients across Scotland.
