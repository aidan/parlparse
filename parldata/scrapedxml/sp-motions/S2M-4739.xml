*S2M-4739 Dave Petrie: Broadband in Rural Scotland—That the Parliament recognises the completion of the Scottish Executive’s Broadband for Scotland programme and the benefit which it has brought to many rural communities; notes that there are, however, still many isolated communities throughout Scotland, not yet covered by this programme, who have no access to the broadband network; recognises that the most isolated parts of Scotland contain those communities which are disproportionately more reliant on services such as broadband internet connection, and urges the Executive to stick to its commitment to improve access throughout rural Scotland and speed up the ongoing technical assessments into the matter.
