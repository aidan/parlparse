 *S3M-3849.1 Bill Aitken: Antisocial Behaviour Framework—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3849) in the name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from "it builds" to end and insert "the success of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 has not been universal; agrees that antisocial behaviour blights the quality of people’s lives and should not be tolerated but believes that prevention is better than cure when it comes to protecting communities from disorder and encourages communities to report all incidents of crime and disorder so that they can be properly addressed, and appreciates the wealth of good practice followed in some areas of Scotland and the importance of replicating it as widely as possible."
