 *S3M-1342 Alasdair Allan: 80th Anniversary of the National Party of Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament notes that 11 February 2008 is the 80th anniversary of the founding of the National Party of Scotland which was inspired by young political activists from the Glasgow University Scottish Nationalist Association; recognises that this party was one of the key components in the creation of the Scottish National Party in 1934 and one of the first to promote Scottish independence; notes the success that this party has had in going from the University of Glasgow to government, and congratulates the generations of campaigners for founding the Scottish National Party without whom it is doubtful that there would be a Scottish Government at all. Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Christine Grahame*, Brian Adam*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Bashir Ahmad*, Angela Constance*, Bill Wilson*, Bob Doris*, Sandra White*, Aileen Campbell*, Bill Kidd*, Stuart McMillan*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Jamie Hepburn*, Kenneth Gibson*, Andrew Welsh*, Alex Neil*, Dave Thompson*
