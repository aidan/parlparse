*S3M-8146 Elaine Smith: May Day—That the Parliament recognises the importance of the May Day bank holiday, which was introduced by the Labour Secretary of State for Employment, Michael Foot, in 1978 in honour of organised labour and the right to strike; understands that 1 May is celebrated as a holiday in over 100 countries around the world and is synonymous with International Workers’ Day; considers that May Day has become an important international celebration of the social and economic achievements of the labour and trade union movement; is concerned therefore by reports that the UK Government is considering removing the 1 May bank holiday in favour of a new UK Day in October; understands that Scotland currently has only nine public holidays compared with the European Union average of 12 per year, and considers that any new public holiday should be an additional one and not a replacement for a traditional and internationally recognised celebration of working people.
