*S3M-6995 Jackie Baillie: St Mary’s Free Play—That the Parliament congratulates the pupils of St Mary’s Primary School in Alexandria on the transformation of their playground into a free play space; understands that the pupils, working in conjunction with the Environment Trust, have changed their playground as part of Inspiring Scotland’s Go Play initiative; further understands that this project aims to reflect the Environment Trust’s vision to create school playgrounds akin to those in Scandinavia; notes that the new playground at St Mary’s will allow the teaching staff to deliver outdoor learning experiences for the pupils; further notes that the official opening of the project will take place on Thursday 23 September 2010, and hopes that the school pupils, now and in the future, will benefit from their new playground.
