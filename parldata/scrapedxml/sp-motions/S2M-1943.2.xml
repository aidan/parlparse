*S2M-1943.2 Margaret Mitchell: Domestic Abuse Servicesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-1943) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "acknowledges" to end and insert "notes with grave concern the escalating pattern of repeat victimisation highlighting the fact that more and more victims are trapped in abusive situations; acknowledges and welcomes the range of initiatives in this area that have been funded by the Scottish Executive in the last few years, and calls on the Executive to continue to explore different means to raise awareness of the issue generally and to ensure that individuals who are trapped in abusive situations are aware of these support services to help them escape from their abusive circumstances."
