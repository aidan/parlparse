*S3M-386 John Park: Scotland to Norway Ferry Serviceâ€”That the Parliament notes the proposed new Scotland to Norway ferry service; welcomes the addition of Lerwick as a possible mid-point in the crossing; notes the potential for increased freight traffic through the port of Rosyth for the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe and the subsequent consolidation of the existing Rosyth to Zeebrugge service; recognises the economic benefits of the proposal and the increased tourism that the new route would bring to Shetland, Rosyth and south-east Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work with SESTRAN and other bodies to secure the route for Rosyth.
