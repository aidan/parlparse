*S3M-5034 Robert Brown: Lloyds TSB Foundation—That the Parliament notes the decision of the Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland to suspend its grant-making activities for the foreseeable future due to the loss of approximately £6 million of income arising from the lack of pre-tax profits by the Lloyds Banking Group; considers that the Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland, Scotland’s largest independent foundation, has been an enormously important and innovative funding stream for the voluntary sector and that this disappointing decision has serious implications for the charitable economy in Scotland, particularly during the economic downturn; is deeply concerned that charities that depend on Lloyds’ funding, especially smaller organisations, may have to curtail or even cease operations as a result of this move; further notes the foundation’s fears that proposals to amend the terms of its covenant would curtail its independent status, and calls on the Lloyds Banking Group to resolve the position urgently to enable the foundation to continue its work supporting Scottish charities until the Lloyds Banking Group returns to profit. Supported by: Jim Tolson*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Mike Pringle*
