 *S3M-638 Michael Matheson: Thornhill Road Post Office—That the Parliament is concerned by the proposal to close Thornhill Road Post Office in Falkirk; notes that the decision to close the post office network in many of our communities is as a direct result of the policy pursued by the Labour government at Westminster; acknowledges that Thornhill Road Post Office is a vital community asset for the people of Middlefield, and calls on the UK Government to recognise that these continual cuts in the post office network have the greatest impact on the most vulnerable people in our community.
