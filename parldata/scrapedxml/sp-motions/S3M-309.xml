*S3M-309♦ Kenneth Gibson: Impact of the London Olympics on Lottery Funding—That the Parliament notes with concern the potentially devastating effect that the diversion of lottery funds for the 2012 Olympic Games in London will have on the Scottish voluntary sector; further notes that the announcement made by Tessa Jowell MP on 15 March 2007 proposed an increase of £425 million from the Big Lottery Fund and £250 million from other good causes and that the apparent focus of Whitehall is to use lottery funding to pay for budget shortcomings caused by a gross miscalculation of the costs needed to pay for the Olympics, with the current total of diverted funds at £2.2 billion, up from the previous estimate of £1.5 billion; pays particular attention to the fact that almost 20% of lottery funding will be top-sliced, basically a year’s worth of funds diverted over the period from 2009 to 2012; recognises that between 2005 and 2009 the Big Lottery Fund expects to give Scotland £249 million in grants and that after 2009 it will have to reassess the ability to give grants to small charities across Scotland; is aware that deprived communities in the west of Scotland, including Cunninghame North, will be among the most badly affected; observes that the Big Lottery Fund is the largest distributor of lottery funds in the United Kingdom, awarding over £2.6 billion to thousands of good causes and that in 2006 alone 2934 lottery fund grants with a total value of £82,366,500 were awarded; recognises that the voluntary sector has generated an estimated 10,000 jobs since 2004, employs 83,500 full-time employees in Scotland and has 1.2 million volunteers, and believes that any decrease in lottery funding will undoubtedly impact adversely on the voluntary sector and the valuable services that it provides.
