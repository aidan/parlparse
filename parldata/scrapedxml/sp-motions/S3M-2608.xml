*S3M-2608 Bob Doris: Scottish Community Councils and Community Empowerment—That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in organising the recent regional meeting of the Association of Scottish Community Councils in Glasgow City Chambers, which included a question time session with parliamentarians chaired by broadcaster John Mackay; notes that this gave community councillors the opportunity to question politicians on a number of matters of concern, including their views on devolving greater responsibilities, for example financial responsibilities, to community councils; welcomes the fact that 82 of the 129 MSPs elected to the Scottish Parliament were elected on a platform that promised to empower community councils; considers that the Labour Party was the only party not to do so and hopes that it will join the political consensus and support the devolving of further responsibilities to communities, including community councils, and looks forward to cross-party support for any Scottish Government pilot for empowering local communities.
