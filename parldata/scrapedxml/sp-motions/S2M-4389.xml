*S2M-4389 Patrick Harvie: Contraceptive Services for Drug Users—That the Parliament believes that the provision of contraceptive services must be underpinned by the concepts of reproductive rights and, crucially, women’s right to choose whether and how to control their own fertility; notes the challenges in providing such services to individuals suffering from drug addiction but considers that much more needs to be done to develop the options, make them available and encourage uptake where appropriate; welcomes any serious and considered contributions to this debate, but, however, is deeply concerned that ill-considered and simplistic proposals could fuel rumours of "spiked" methadone and thereby lead to patients failing to continue with their prescriptions or other treatment.
