*S1M-3017 Fiona McLeod: Removal of Dr Robert Watson from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-That the Parliament expresses concern at the removal of Dr Robert Watson as Chair of the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change following last year's publication of its Third Assessment Report (TAR) which states that global temperatures are rising nearly twice as fast as previously thought, predicts that temperatures could rise by as much as 5.8 degrees Celsius by the end of this century and claims that industrial pollution is the main cause; notes that the TAR report has the unqualified backing of more than 3,000 scientists; expresses dismay at President Bush's continued refusal to recognise the link between pollution and global warming; urges the President to reinstate America's support for the Kyoto Protocol, and further notes Scotland's determination to play its full part in tackling the threat of global warming.
