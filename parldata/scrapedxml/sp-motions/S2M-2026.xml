 *S2M-2026 Maureen Macmillan: Specialist Mountain Search and Rescue Vehicle—That the Parliament commends the sterling work undertaken by the Scottish mountain rescue teams that provide an essential service in our mountains and hills in all seasons and weathers; welcomes the grant of £160,000 awarded by the Scottish Executive to mountain rescue teams in Scotland which has assisted in purchasing a £250,000 specialised off-road communications vehicle for use in mountain search and rescue operations in the Highlands and Skye; further welcomes the charitable donations given by the Order of St John and others, and notes that the vehicle is equipped with both digital and analogue radios thus allowing liaison between mountain rescue teams, RAF helicopters and the police which will be of major benefit, not just in large-scale mountain rescues, but also in dealing with incidents such as aeroplanes coming down in the hills.
