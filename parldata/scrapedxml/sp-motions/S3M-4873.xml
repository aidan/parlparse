*S3M-4873 Ian McKee: Wester Hailes Education Centre PE Success—That the Parliament congratulates Wester Hailes Education Centre for exceeding the Scottish Government target of delivering two hours of physical education per week; notes that the Scottish Parliament Health and Sport Committee led a fact-finding visit to the school as part of its Pathways into Sport and Physical Activity inquiry and found that all S1 pupils receive two hours of quality PE, rising to three hours in S2 and S3 and five hours in S4; further notes that in S5 and S6, when PE becomes optional, 64% of pupils continue with classes, which is well above the national average, and encourages other schools in Edinburgh and throughout Scotland to follow the example of Wester Hailes Education Centre to include at least two hours of quality PE in the curriculum in order to improve the long-term health and wellbeing of Scotland’s children and young people.
