*S2M-4464 Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Education—That the Parliament believes that creating a greater degree of school autonomy, devolving more powers to head teachers and giving greater say to parents and teachers in shaping the education system will raise standards; is therefore disappointed at the abolition of school boards which will dilute parental representation in schools; notes that Jordanhill School, Scotland’s only remaining independently run but publicly funded school, has consistently been among the top-performing schools in Scotland and won the SQA "School of the Year" award; notes that teaching unions are voicing concerns over the Scottish Executive’s discipline and mainstreaming policies, and calls on the Executive to introduce reforms to create a more diverse education system in Scotland to raise standards, tackle discipline and serve the needs and aspirations of all pupils.
