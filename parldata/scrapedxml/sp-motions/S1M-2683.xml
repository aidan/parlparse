*S1M-2683 Trish Godman: Scottish Veterans of the International Brigade-That the Parliament offers warm greetings to the very small band of Scottish veterans of the British Battalion of the International Brigade; notes that they and their late Scottish comrades formed a full 25% of the British Battalion; acknowledges their courage and radical determination to assist the democratically elected Spanish Government in stemming the ugly tide of fascism so many years ago, at a time when some European governments sought to appease the fascists in Spain, Germany and Italy; recalls that these Scottish veterans, along with other veterans of the International Brigade, were honoured by the Spanish Government on the 60th Anniversary of the Spanish Civil War with honorary Spanish citizenship, and offers its best wishes to these distinguished Scottish veterans of a distant war against fascism.
