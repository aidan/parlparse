*S3M-3263 John Scott: Recreational Fishing - Article 47—That the Parliament notes with concern Article 47 of draft EU regulation SEC(2008) 2760/61, which would bring recreational sea fishermen under the direct control of the Common Fisheries Policy; understands that it would require recreational fishermen to register their boats, that their catches would be counted against the fisheries quota for that country and that each country would be required to allocate the share of its quota for each fish species that would be available for commercial and recreational fisheries use; believes that these proposals would create enormous administrative problems and would be effectively unworkable in a Scottish context; further believes that they will contribute little to the conservation of fishing stocks, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to make representations to the European Commission opposing the provisions of Article 47 of the draft EU regulation.
