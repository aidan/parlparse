*S1M-3433 Tommy Sheridan: Proposed New National Stadium in Wembley-That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed new national stadium at Wembley and its projected cost of £750 million; believes that this will be a waste of public money, and urges the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government to reconsider this project and instead consider favourably the Birmingham alternative, which satisfies all the criteria for the new stadium but at less than half the cost.
