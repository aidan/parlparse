*S1M-3170# Murdo Fraser: Psychiatric Services at Murray Royal Hospital, Perth-That the Parliament recognises the concerns of psychiatrists, user groups and members of the legal profession at the reduction in secure beds in psychiatric hospitals in the Tayside area; considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure that forensic psychiatric services currently provided at Murray Royal Hospital are not lost during the restructuring of services by NHS Tayside but rather that an increased number of beds and appropriate services is made available for male and female patients in the forensic psychiatric unit, and believes that the importance of mental health facilities across Tayside must be recognised and adequately funded.
