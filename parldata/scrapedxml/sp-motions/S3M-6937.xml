*S3M-6937 Willie Coffey: Alcohol Commission Disregards Scotch Whisky and Scottish Jobs—That the Parliament recognises that all of the major political parties are considering the use of price mechanisms to manage the adverse impact of over-consumption of alcohol; considers that the most recent substantive contributions to this debate have come from the Scottish Government, which has proposed a flat-rate minimum price of 45p per unit of alcohol on all types of alcoholic products, and from the Labour Party-appointed Alcohol Commission, which has recommended the use of cost of production, duty and VAT to set a minimum price for each type or strength of alcoholic product; notes further that the Alcohol Commission’s report fails to mention or assess the impact of its proposals on the Scotch whisky industry or on jobs in Scotland’s high quality drinks sector, and considers that, unlike the Scottish Government’s proposal, which uses a flat-rate minimum price per unit of alcohol to deliver maximum health benefits, the Alcohol Commission’s proposals, if adopted across the United Kingdom, would see prices fall and risk an exodus of jobs from Scotland’s alcohol industry as manufacturers seek to lower the cost of production.
