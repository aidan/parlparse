 *S3M-4967 Jamie McGrigor: World Porridge Day—That the Parliament welcomes World Porridge Day on 11 October 2009, which is the celebration of a traditional Scottish dish that has had a place in homes around Scotland for generations; notes that World Porridge Day was established by a partnership between Mary’s Meals and the World Porridge Making Championship, which takes place at Carrbridge; recognises that to many people porridge is a comfort food that warms up a wet or wintry day but to the 320,000 children in Malawi who receive Mary’s Meals, likuni phala, a maize-based porridge, provides the comfort of knowing that there will be a next meal; congratulates the highland charity, Scottish International Relief, based in Dalmally in Argyll, on the tireless and dedicated work that it carries out and particularly congratulates Mary’s Meals, which feeds over 375,000 children in 15 different countries; notes that events are planned across the world from Loch Awe to Chicago, and would welcome widespread participation by hosting a big porridge breakfast or other porridge-related activities to raise money and awareness about hunger.
