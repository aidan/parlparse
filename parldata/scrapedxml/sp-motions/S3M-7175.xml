*S3M-7175♦ Liam McArthur: The Success of the Air Discount Scheme—That the Parliament considers that, since its introduction in May 2006, the Air Discount Scheme has brought great benefits to the residents of eligible areas of the Highlands and Islands by reducing the cost of their air fares on the vital lifeline air routes to the main Scottish airports; is of the view that the European Commission’s approval of the scheme as aid of a social character recognises that residents of Scotland’s islands and the far north of the mainland face disproportionately high costs in gaining access to services of the mainland and that they deserve this support to reduce the cost; believes that the case for the Air Discount Scheme is as strong today as it was in 2006, and looks forward to its continuation for the foreseeable future.
