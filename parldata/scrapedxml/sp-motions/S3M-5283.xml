*S3M-5283 Christine Grahame: Credit Card Theftâ€”That the Parliament urges retailers to review existing security screening and warning notices around checkout areas where chip and pin devices are used and to focus on the need for increased security for customers who are older, have young children or are disabled in order that the festive season does not provide opportunities for criminals actively targeting these groups by means of credit card theft and fraud.
