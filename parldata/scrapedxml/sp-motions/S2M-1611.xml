*S2M-1611 Brian Adam: Grampian Police Funding—That the Parliament expresses concern that £1.5 million of this year’s budget for policing in Grampian is allocated for national policing duties such as £1.2 million for royal protection and £0.25 million for offshore policing; regrets that royal protection is considered five times more valuable than the security of the oil and gas industry; finds it unacceptable that the Scottish Executive has taken no steps to ascertain these costs and reimburse Grampian Police for them, and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring its police funding review to a rapid conclusion taking these matters into account and to seek to recover United Kingdom security costs from Her Majesty’s Government.
