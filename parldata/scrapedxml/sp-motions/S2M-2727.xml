*S2M-2727 Mark Ballard: Canadian Seal Cull: Inhumane and Unnecessary—That the Parliament notes that the Canadian Government has approved a massive expansion in the allowable catch for harp seals in Canada to a maximum of 975,000 animals over a three-year period; notes that the second phase of Canada’s commercial seal hunt began on 14 April 2005 in Newfoundland, under which more than 200,000 seals, 95% under three months old, will be shot or clubbed; notes that, according to the International Fund for Animal Welfare, tests carried out in previous seasons on cubs that had been clubbed and skinned suggested that up to 42% were still conscious when skinned; further notes that the increase in sealing is directly linked to the decrease in fishing employment following the collapse of commercial fisheries in 1992, that the collapse of commercial fisheries was due to overfishing by humans rather than predation by seals and that there is no clear scientific justification for the seal cull on the basis of fisheries protection; notes that a licence to hunt harp and hooded seals off eastern Canada costs $5 (£2), while a permit to watch someone else kill seals costs $25 (£10) and requires a background check by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police and that the estimated landed value of harp seals in 2001 was approximately $5.5 million as opposed to $300 million from tourism; condemns the increased Canadian seal cull as inhumane and ecologically unnecessary, while respecting the right of first nations’ populations to hunt marine mammals on a sustainable subsistence basis, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make known its grave concerns on the continuation of this cull to the Canadian Government.
