*S2M-5544 Tommy Sheridan: Support for the Bolivarian Socialist Republic of Venezuela—That the Parliament notes the decision of the democratically elected National Assembly of Venezuela to approve a wide-ranging enabling law to allow the re-elected President, Hugo Chavez, to nationalise key sectors of the Venezuelan economy to facilitate the growth of socialist production and wealth redistribution across Venezuela; further notes that the power to nationalise will target important sectors like oil, telecommunications, electricity and natural gas and notes the comments of Hugo Chavez that "The nationalisations will always be limited to strategic areas of the economy…I call to national and international business owners to come. Let’s work together for the development of a mixed economic model", and believes that a mixed economic socialist model with ownership and control of the key sectors of the economy in public hands would well serve an independent Scotland in respect of both the quality and standard of the life of all its citizens.
