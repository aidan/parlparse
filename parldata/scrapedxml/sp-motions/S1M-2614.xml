*S1M-2614 Trish Godman: Oxfam Scotland—That the Parliament commends the campaign by Oxfam Scotland to encourage people to give foreign currency notes and coins made worthless by the euro to any of Oxfam Scotland’s 68 shops; believes that Oxfam Scotland will put such currency to very good use, once exchanged in the developing world, and urges all those with soon-to-be useless coins and small denomination notes, of any of the twelve EU member states which have signed up to the euro, left over from holidays and visits to respond to this excellent initiative and by doing so helping poor people to live more tolerable lives. Supported by: Colin Campbell*
