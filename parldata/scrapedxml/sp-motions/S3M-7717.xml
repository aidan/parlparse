*S3M-7717 John Scott: Discards—That the Parliament condemns what it believes to be the reprehensible, yet widespread, practice of discarding fish whereby dead or dying fish are thrown back into the sea; considers that this is utterly indefensible on environmental, economic and ethical grounds; notes that the practice occurs as a direct result of what it views as the ill-thought-out and inflexible decrees of the European Common Fisheries Policy, and believes that the Scottish Government, the UK Government, the European Commission, Scotland’s fishermen and all other interested parties should work together to find solutions to bring about a speedy termination of discarding in Scottish waters.
