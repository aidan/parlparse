*S2M-1521# Mark Ballard: Support for Students with a Child-That the Parliament notes the reduction in the student support rate of £165 for the coming academic year for students with one child due to the withdrawal of the Dependents' Allowance; considers that this reduction may add to unacceptable hardship suffered by students with children, and resolves to support lifelong learning by supporting calls to reinstate or replace this element of student support.
