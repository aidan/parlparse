 *S2M-893# Carolyn Leckie: Nursery Nurses Deserve Settlement Now-That the Parliament is appalled that nursery nurses, essential to the development of our children and the future well-being of Scotland's society, are still not valued by COSLA or the Scottish Executive; condemns those who profess to support investment in education and who profess concern about Scotland's depopulation, but condemn nursery nurses to low pay, undervalued status and continued gender discrimination; salutes the determination and solidarity of the 4000 nursery nurses on strike this week; believes that the spectre of all-out strike action is an indictment of the employers, COSLA and the Executive; considers that COSLA should return to the negotiating table; believes that the Executive must exert all its influence to ensure a fair and agreed national settlement for nursery nurses, and affirms its unequivocal support for nursery nurses.
