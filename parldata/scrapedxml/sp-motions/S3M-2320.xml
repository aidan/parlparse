*S3M-2320 Sandra White: Government Plans May Lead to Ghettoisation of Glasgow—That the Parliament expresses serious concern over the implementation and consequences of the UK Government’s local housing allowance (LHA), which has replaced housing benefit, highlighted by growing evidence in Glasgow that landlords and letting agents are not receiving rent from clients on benefits leading to these clients being refused private rented accommodation; considers that this is a direct consequence of the allowance being paid directly to claimants rather than landlords and gives rise to concerns that this could result in the repossession of property and a huge rise in the number of homeless people; notes the concerns raised that this could lead to increased ghettoisation in Glasgow as people are forced out of more expensive areas and into poorer ones due to the introduction of the flawed broad rental market areas, and believes that the LHA must be reformed as a matter of urgency before these changes irreversibly damage Glasgow’s drive to build mixed communities.
