*S3M-5409 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Drinking Is Not a Crime But Rape Is—That the Parliament welcomes the Rape Awareness Campaign launched by Lothian and Borders Police in conjunction with Rape Crisis Scotland and the Edinburgh Women’s Rape and Sexual Abuse Centre; notes that the campaign involves police officers, police staff and special constables handing out specially designed postcards depicting women enjoying themselves socially with the direct message that "drinking is not a crime.... but rape is"; supports the decision by Lothian and Borders Police to focus a public safety campaign on the clear message that women are not to blame for rape just because they have been drinking; recognises awareness-raising work being done by police and voluntary sector organisations across Scotland, including the washroom campaign launched on 10 December 2009 by Glasgow Community and Safety Services, which involves posters from Rape Crisis Scotland’s This is not an invitation to rape me campaign being placed in bars and clubs across the city for one month, and wishes these campaigns every success in their efforts to challenge unacceptable attitudes towards rape.
