*S2M-526.4 Mr Brian Monteith: Building Better Cities - Delivering Growth and Opportunities-As an amendment to motion (S2M-526) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from "notes" to end and insert "believes that the cities of Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Stirling are vital drivers of economic growth in Scotland and that they, together with Scotland's urban and rural economies, would benefit from a reduction in non-domestic rates, an improvement in transport infrastructure and better public services and further believes these three policies would achieve far more than centrally-directed government-inspired initiatives, strategic plans and visions."
