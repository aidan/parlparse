 *S3M-8078 Elaine Smith: Coatbridge St Patrick’s Day Festival 2011—That the Parliament congratulates the St Patrick’s Day Festival Committee in Coatbridge, headed by chairperson Tom Nolan, on its work in organising and promoting the annual festival, which is now one of the biggest St Patrick’s day celebrations in the world; notes that a number of cultural and social events will take place over the course of the festival culminating in a street festival on Saturday 19 March 2011, which will be the ninth annual event in Coatbridge and is expected to attract in excess of 15,000 people from Scotland, the rest of the United Kingdom and abroad; considers the climax of the festival to be a family-friendly affair with entertainment including live bands, Irish dancers, contemporary dance, traditional music, children’s entertainment, a balloon launch, kids’ rides and face painting, which serves as a good boost to the local economy and to small independent retailers; recognises the Irish heritage of the town and the pivotal role played by working class Irish men and woman who settled in communities such as Coatbridge in the development of Scotland; believes that Scotland should continue to be proud of and celebrate the heritage of all its people, and hopes that the 2011 St Patrick’s Day Festival will be the best one yet.
