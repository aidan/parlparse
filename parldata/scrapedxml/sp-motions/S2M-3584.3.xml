*S2M-3584.3 Carolyn Leckie: Dentistry—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3584) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, leave out from “welcomes” to end and insert “regrets that inequalities in dental health status and access to dental services persist; believes that NHS dental provision is under serious threat; further believes that radical action in recruitment and widening of access to dentistry training is urgently required, and believes that the dentists whom the state educates and trains should be required to give a minimum commitment to NHS service of five years, within an agreed NHS salaried career structure.”
