*S2M-1239# Frances Curran: World Lupus Day-That the Parliament congratulates LUPUS UK, the national charity for lupus sufferers, on its involvement in World Lupus Day which takes place on 10 May 2004; notes that its participation in this event aims to publicise the illness lupus, an auto immune disease which is currently incurable and, although less well-known, appears to be more common worldwide than leukaemia, multiple sclerosis and muscular dystrophy; further notes that lupus can be life-threatening and adversely affects the lives of sufferers, and hopes that World Lupus Day is successful in raising awareness of this illness.
