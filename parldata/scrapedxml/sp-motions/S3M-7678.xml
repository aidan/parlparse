*S3M-7678 Jackie Baillie: West Dunbartonshire Budget Cuts—That the Parliament notes that the SNP-led West Dunbartonshire Council will reduce its budget by £14.7 million; considers that the SNP has slashed over £3 million from social work services in the last year, including cuts to vital frontline services; further considers that, on top of the cuts being made, the SNP has imposed millions of pounds of additional charges for essential services and equipment; understands that West Dunbartonshire Council has had a reduced budget from the Scottish Government, with a cut of 4.53% in cash terms, equating to the loss of £12 million this year; further understands that this budget cut is significantly higher than the average of 2.6% across Scotland, and calls on both the Scottish Government and the SNP-led West Dunbartonshire Council to reverse the damaging cuts that it considers they are making to vital services in West Dunbartonshire.
