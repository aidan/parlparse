*S1M-448 Fergus Ewing: Highland Virtual Airline Company—That the Parliament supports the proposal by the Highland Council, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Inverness Chamber of Commerce to establish a community owned "virtual" airline company in order to seek to secure landing slots at London Heathrow Airport; believes that it is vital for the economy of the Highlands and Islands that there should be a method of protecting slots for Inverness, as for other regional centres at prime hub airports and that there should be recognised a public service obligation on the London Heathrow route to guarantee a slot on the grounds of economic necessity and peripherality; and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make explicit their support for this initiative.
