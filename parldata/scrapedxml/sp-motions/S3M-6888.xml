*S3M-6888 John Farquhar Munro: Attack on Gugu Hunters of Nessâ€”That the Parliament is of the view that the traditional harvest of gugas on Sula Sgeir by the men of Ness is under attack by the SSPCA; notes that the harvest is licensed by Scottish Natural Heritage, undertaken for human consumption and, it is considered, carried out at a level that does not threaten the gannet colony; believes that those calling for it to end are making an unwarranted attack on an old Hebridean tradition and should instead campaign against real threats to animal welfare of which there are, regrettably, a great number, and looks forward to the continued success of this age-old tradition that provides a delicacy that will continue to delight the palate of islanders at home and abroad for generations to come.
