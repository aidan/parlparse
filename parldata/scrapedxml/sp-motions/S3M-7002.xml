*S3M-7002 Ken Macintosh: Lack of Support—That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Government to reconcile the First Minister’s programme for government, in which he talked of continuing to support the armed forces and veterans’ community, with the actions of SNP backbencher Christine Grahame MSP; considers that Ms Grahame displayed insensitivity and unfairness in trying to use the example of a visit by a Royal Navy officer and parent in East Renfrewshire to his local nursery as an example of the armed forces allegedly recruiting three and four-year-olds; further asks ministers to explain how this behaviour displays support for the armed services, and calls on Ms Grahame to apologise to the officer concerned and to the people of Neilston for the offence that it considers that she has caused.
