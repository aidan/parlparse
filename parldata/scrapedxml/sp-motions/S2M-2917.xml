 * S2M-2917 Irene Oldfather: Hungry for Success—That the Parliament acknowledges the Scottish Executive’s Hungry for Success initiative which aims to drive up the nutritional standards of school meals; recognises the benefits that this guidance will have on the diets of most schoolchildren; is aware, however, that, in a modern society, many children wish to pursue a vegetarian or vegan diet, and therefore considers that the Hungry for Success guidelines should be expanded to contain advice for schools on providing options for pupils who may choose to adhere to vegetarian or vegan diets.
