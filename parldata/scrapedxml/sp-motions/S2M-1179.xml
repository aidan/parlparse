*S2M-1179 Carolyn Leckie: Nursery Nurses' Just Pay Claim-That the Parliament demands the immediate settlement of the nursery nurses' dispute in light of the news that the UK's richest people have seen their wealth increase by nearly 30%; recognises that Scotland's nursery nurses have been denied a national settlement to their just demand for a decent living wage at the same time as the 100 richest Scots are now worth over £11 billion, and regards it as a disgrace that our nursery nurses are having to battle for a decent living wage while the excessively rich sit back and watch their bank balances increase daily.
