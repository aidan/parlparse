 *S1M-2883.1 John Scott: Nuclear Power Stations-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2883) in the name of Bruce Crawford, leave out from first "consent" to end and insert "planning consent for nuclear and other electricity power stations over 50 megawatts under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989, is a responsibility devolved to Scottish Executive Ministers, but further notes that responsibility for UK energy policy is a matter for Westminster to decide and calls on Her Majesty's Government and the Scottish Executive to clarify unresolved issues in relation to the division of responsibilities in pursuit of a balanced sustainable energy policy."
