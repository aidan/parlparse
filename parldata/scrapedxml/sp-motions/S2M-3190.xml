*S2M-3190# Jim Mather: Supply of Affordable Housing in Rural Areas—That the Parliament considers that new pension rules to be introduced in April 2006 allowing funds from self-invested personal pension plans to be invested in residential property, such as buy to let or holiday homes with up to 40% tax relief, and allowing residential property already owned to be moved into pensions schemes will reduce the availability of affordable housing, particularly in rural areas where young people are already facing difficulties in finding housing to buy or rent, and considers that the Scottish Executive and UK Government should reconsider the proposals, taking into account the particular issues surrounding rural housing in Scotland, and should exempt housing in Scotland from these new pension provisions.
