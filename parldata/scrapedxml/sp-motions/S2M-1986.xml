*S2M-1986# John Scott: Waiting Lists for Access to Free Personal Care—That the Parliament is concerned to note that South Ayrshire Council has been required to operate a waiting list policy for the delivery of free personal care to older people who have been assessed as being eligible for such care; believes that, given the commitment made by the Scottish Executive to fully fund the provision of free personal care, the existence of waiting lists is incompatible with this commitment, and considers that financial allocations should be increased to those local authorities whose existing allocations are insufficient to meet assessed demand for free personal care.
