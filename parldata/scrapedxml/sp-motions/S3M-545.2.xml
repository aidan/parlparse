*S3M-545.2 Nicola Sturgeon: Waiting Times—As an amendment to motion (S3M-545) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "is concerned" to end and insert "calls on the Scottish Government to build on the progress made by the last administration in reducing waiting times by establishing a new 18-week whole journey waiting time guarantee by 2011 and consulting on a Patients’ Rights Bill that will ensure a more patient-focussed NHS."
