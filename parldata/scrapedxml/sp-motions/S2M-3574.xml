*S2M-3574 Roseanna Cunningham: Scottish Definitive Postage Stamps: Self-Adhesive and Book Format—That the Parliament welcomes Royal Mail’s continuing the production of Scottish definitive stamps; notes, however, market research findings that public awareness of the stamps is low; regrets that the Scottish stamps are not available in tourist centres or many retail outlets; believes that the availability and use of these stamps would be much greater if they were made available in book and self-adhesive format as is done with the UK definitive issue, and supports the campaign by the St Andrew Society and Postwatch Scotland to persuade Royal Mail to promote the Scottish definitive stamps and produce them in book and self-adhesive formats.Supported by: Christine Grahame*
