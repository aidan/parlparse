*S1M-3637 Jackie Baillie: Argyll and Clyde NHS Acute Hospitals Trust—That the Parliament notes the apparent difficulty of Argyll and Clyde NHS Acute Hospitals Trust in managing to provide a full range of services to meet the needs of the local population; further notes the resignation of key health service personnel over the last few months and the failure of management to recruit, which has led to instability and uncertainty over the future of service provision in the area, particularly at the Vale of Leven District General Hospital; recognises and applauds the commitment of front-line staff, doctors, nurses, auxiliaries and others, in maintaining excellent standards of health care for people in the area; notes the welcome intervention of the Minister for Health and Community Care in sending in a support team to consider and act on any management failures, and calls upon the Scottish Executive and Argyll and Clyde NHS Board to act quickly on the recommendations made by the support team to restore professional and public confidence in the service.
