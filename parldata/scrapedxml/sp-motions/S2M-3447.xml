S2M-3447 Patrick Harvie: Pock Mark Award for the M74—That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Executive has earned the Pock Mark Award for Scotland’s worst planning decision, in respect of Nicol Stephen’s decision to approve the M74 extension which he took while serving as Minister for Transport; considers that this decision is a startling example of outdated transport policy worthy of national, and even international, disdain, and urges the Executive to report to the Parliament on its plans for publicising and celebrating this unique achievement. Supported by: Robin Harper, Chris Ballance, Mr Mark Ruskell, Eleanor Scott, Shiona Baird, Ms Rosemary Byrne
