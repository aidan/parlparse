*S3M-7923.1 Ross Finnie: Early Intervention in Health and Education—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7923) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from first "supports" to end and insert "agrees with the conclusions of the Finance Committee’s recent inquiry into preventative spending that the current balance of government spending is skewed too much in favour of reactive, rather than preventative, spending; recognises that early intervention has proven benefits not only in health and education but also in other areas such as crime reduction measures, support for carers and services for older people, and supports a long-term shift to sustained investment in a high-quality, preventative approach to the growing social and economic challenges faced by public services."
