*S1M-3037 Andrew Wilson: Motherwell Football Club-That the Parliament notes with alarm the current crisis at Motherwell Football Club; recognises that it is a symptom of the financial crisis in the professional organisation of Scotland's national game and that the current structure of its organisation is unsustainable; appreciates the importance of Motherwell Football Club to the Scottish game and to the people of Lanarkshire as well as the needs of the employees of the club; acknowledges and further appreciates the many attempts made by the outgoing ownership at Motherwell to invest in the club and the game, but recognises that such investment is unsustainable unless the overall structure of the Scottish professional game is sustainable and viable, and calls for all leaders of Scottish Football to consider a wide-ranging and radical overhaul of the structure of the Scottish game and leagues in order to ensure competitiveness at all levels and the growth of community-based clubs encouraging domestic talent and to ensure that there are opportunities for clubs to grow and progress through the leagues from all levels and, if necessary, to move on to larger, non-domestic leagues if that is to their financial and sporting advantage.
