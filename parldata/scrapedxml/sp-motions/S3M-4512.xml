*S3M-4512 Richard Baker: Congratulations to Cornerstone Forensic Service, Winners of Best Social Service Team in Scotland—That the Parliament congratulates the Cornerstone Forensic Service in Aberdeen on winning the Best Social Service Team in Scotland award at the Scottish Social Services Council Care Accolades award ceremony in Dundee on 7 June 2009; welcomes the team’s structured approach and emphasis on inclusion; notes that the forensic service provides support to adults with learning disabilities and mental health issues who have a history of offending or are at risk of offending without appropriate levels of support; notes that the project aims to protect the community and prevent individuals from reoffending by introducing structured support, employment opportunities and activities that bring stability to their lives, and considers that, since the service started in August 2004, it has been a huge success with none of the individuals supported by the service going on to reoffend but instead going on to integrate successfully back into the local community and with several of the residents now in part-time employment and attending college. Supported by: George Foulkes*, Marlyn Glen*, Hugh Henry*, Lewis Macdonald*, Jamie McGrigor*, Bill Kidd*, Sandra White*, Jackie Baillie*, John Park*, Mary Mulligan*, Robin Harper*, Marilyn Livingstone*, Des McNulty*, Ken Macintosh* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
