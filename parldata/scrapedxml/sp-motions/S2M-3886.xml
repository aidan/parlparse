*S2M-3886 Jackie Baillie: Encouraging Sport for Young People—That the Parliament believes that it is essential for the Scottish Executive to provide opportunities for children to become more active and lead healthier lives; recognises that considerable effort has gone into ensuring a level of physical activity in schools; notes, however, that improvements can still be made, particularly in primary schools, and urges the Executive to develop sporting opportunities in local communities in partnership with sports organisations, such as football clubs, in order to maximise the provision of community facilities and share the wealth of experience available in local areas.
