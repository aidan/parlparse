 * S2M-2844# Richard Lochhead: Ocean Power Delivery’s Commercial Success and Scotland’s Wave Energy Future—That the Parliament congratulates Ocean Power Delivery on securing the world’s first commercial wave energy installation; believes that this breakthrough illustrates the enormous renewables expertise that exists in Scotland; notes that Ocean Power’s device will be installed in Portuguese waters, rather than Scottish waters, due to the level of support for marine renewables offered by the Portuguese Government in contrast to the Scottish and UK Governments; recognises that Scotland possesses enormous marine renewables potential; regrets that the Scottish and UK Governments have failed to create an environment that would have attracted commercial wave developments in Scottish waters, despite the fact that the technology has been developed in Scotland, and believes that, if the Scottish and UK Governments do not get their act together, then renewables technology developed in Scotland will continue to meet the energy and environmental objectives of other countries before they benefit Scotland’s.
