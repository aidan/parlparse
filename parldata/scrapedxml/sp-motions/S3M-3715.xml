 S3M-3715 Christina McKelvie: World Social Work Day—That the Parliament joins with social workers across Scotland in celebrating World Social Work Day on 17 March 2009; notes the enormous contribution that Scotland’s social workers and social care workers make to improving the lives of individuals, families and communities across Scotland; recognises that social work services benefit all sections of the community and are likely to touch every one of us at some point in our lives; acknowledges that, despite the difficult environment that many of them work in, social workers and social care workers successfully work with other services to help people find solutions to their own problems, and finally applauds the value and contribution that this workforce makes to Scotland every day.
