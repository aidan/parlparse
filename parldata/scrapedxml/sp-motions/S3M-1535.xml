*S3M-1535♦ Margaret Mitchell: Medtech—That the Parliament welcomes the contribution of the medical technology (medtech) sector to Scotland which is worth around £8.7 million and accounts for around 7,000 jobs; notes that the medical devices sector has been identified as one of the six key technology areas for the following five years by the Council for Science and Technology and that the market is worth $200 billion globally; welcomes the work of Lanarkshire-based Medical Devices in Scotland (MDIS) in providing advice and support for medtech businesses with issues such as regulation, procurement, trade shows and product development, as well as facilitating research and development projects worth over £8 million; further welcomes the fact that MDIS has generated an approximate nine-fold return on an investment of £949,064 provided by Scottish Enterprise since 2001; is therefore concerned that Scottish Enterprise’s funding for MDIS is due to cease as of 31 March 2008; considers that this may lead to a weakening of the sector’s position in Scotland at a time when other UK regions and the Republic of Ireland are aggressively targeting the sector, and therefore considers that all interested parties should work together to provide a solution guaranteeing the long-term financial support that the sector requires.
