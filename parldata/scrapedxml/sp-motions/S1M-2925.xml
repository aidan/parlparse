*S1M-2925 Irene Oldfather: Ethical Threads—That the Parliament welcomes the introduction of the "Ethical Threads" branding; notes that tee-shirts carrying the brand are sourced from ethically sound companies and co-operatives that employ good labour practices, provide safe and hygienic working conditions and pay workers a living wage; further notes that the vast majority of tee-shirts currently sold in the music merchandising sector are produced by sweatshop labour, and therefore calls on the musical artists and promotion companies of Scotland to adopt the Ethical Threads trademark as a means of insisting that sweatshop exploitation plays no further part in the music merchandising business.
