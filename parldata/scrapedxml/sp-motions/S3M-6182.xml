*S3M-6182 Bill Kidd: Generals Call for Trident to be Included in Strategic Defence Review—That the Parliament notes the expression of deep concern on the part of Field Marshal Lord Bramall, General Lord Ramsbotham, General Sir Hugh Beach and Major-General Patrick Cordingley at the fact that the future of Trident has been excluded from the Strategic Defence Review, which is to follow the UK general election; agrees that dismissing other options out of hand would be a major strategic blunder, and considers that the new impetus given to nuclear disarmament by the Obama administration, to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons, presents an opportunity for the next UK Government to give due consideration to the renewal of Trident, which the Parliament rejected by a vote of 77 to 16 in June 2007. Supported by: Brian Adam*, Rob Gibson*, Stewart Maxwell*, Sandra White*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, John Wilson*, Michael Matheson*, Kenneth Gibson*, Aileen Campbell*, Malcolm Chisholm*
