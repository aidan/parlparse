*S3M-8202 Stuart McMillan: Willie Wright Tributeâ€”That the Parliament recognises the efforts of the late Willie Wright of Greenock for his continued work on behalf of asbestos victims; considers that for almost 20 years Willie was a great source of information and support to those who attended the Greenock asbestos support group, which forms part of Clydeside Action on Asbestos; further considers that despite ill health he continued to campaign vigorously and promote the rights of those who were negligently exposed to asbestos and was an inspirational campaigner, and recognises that Willie was in no doubt that the Scottish Parliament would remedy the House of Lords ruling on pleural plaques and was delighted with the work done at Holyrood to allow compensation for people affected by pleural plaques.
