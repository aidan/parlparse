*S1M-2914 Iain Smith: GM Crop Trials—That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Executive has approved the planting of a GM oilseed rape crop at three trial sites in Scotland this spring, that, while Scottish Ministers have the responsibility to approve the planting, they have little discretion under the EU and UK regulations unless there is verifiable evidence that there is a direct physical threat to the environment or human health caused by the GM crop and that the advice of the independent Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment and the Food Standards Agency to Scottish Ministers is that there is no such direct threat; further notes that the GM oilseed rape grown in the trials is the subject of an application to be granted commercial approval in Europe but that the industry and Her Majesty’s Government have agreed that no decision will be taken on this application at least until the results of these field trials are known, and calls for the Scottish Executive to lobby the European Commission for a moratorium on all future planting of GM crops to allow a full assessment of the environmental and health implications, taking account of the results of the trials and international evidence and of a full and informed public consultation on the desirability or otherwise of GM crops.
