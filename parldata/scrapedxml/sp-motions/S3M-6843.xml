 *S3M-6843Bill Wilson:Banning Hot Branding of Equine Animalsâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the news that a ban on the hot branding of equine animals is to be put into force at the beginning of the next parliamentary session and notes that this ban will bring into line the welfare of equine animals with the welfare of other animals and will mean that what many consider an outdated and unnecessary practice will be abolished.
