*S3M-4997 Bill Kidd: Labour and Conservative Consensus Over Welfare Reform—That the Parliament notes the congruity of the welfare reform proposals of the UK Labour Government, laid out in the green paper, No one written off: reforming welfare to reward responsibility, and the Conservative Party’s Get Britain Working plan; considers that both sets of proposals promote the further privatisation of welfare, with private sector and voluntary organisations being awarded contracts and bonus incentives to find work for those on benefit; believes that this marked concordance is unsurprising, considering that both schemes were devised chiefly by David Freud, as a government adviser under both Tony Blair and Gordon Brown and then as shadow minister for welfare for the Conservative Party; further believes that both sets of proposals fail to grasp properly the scarcity of employment opportunities afforded to job seekers in the current economic climate nor the changing nature of employment, with many benefit claimants going into jobs which lack any security, for example on the basis of a zero-hour contracts, with income and hours varying significantly; recognises that under such circumstances all the risk is borne by the low-skilled worker while the benefits are enjoyed entirely by the employer, and acknowledges that such proposals, if taken forward, would drastically weaken, rather than strengthen, financial support given to jobseekers in Scotland.
