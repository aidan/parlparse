*S1M-358.2 Mr Jamie McGrigor: Sea Fisheries—As an amendment to motion (S1M-358) in the name of Mr John Home Robertson, delete from ‘calls’ to end and insert: "recognises that the current Common Fisheries Policy arrangements are failing our fishermen and calls upon the Scottish Executive to advocate reform of the CFP that devolves power to regional and zonal levels which would give our fishermen better control over the stocks of fish whilst recognising the traditional rights of other countries, and further calls for the fishing section of MAFF to be relocated to the North East of Scotland, the UK’s main fishing centre, and that continuous assessment should replace the current practice of annual negotiation.
