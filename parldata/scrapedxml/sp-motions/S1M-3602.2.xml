*S1M-3602.2 Fergus Ewing: Scottish Executive Response to the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Inquiriesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-3602) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "and welcomes" to end and insert "; welcomes the fact that the Scottish Parliament was able to deal with the foot-and-mouth crisis more efficiently than it was tackled in England; endorses many of the proposals contained within the Scottish Executive response to the inquiries but considers that insufficient progress has been made to tighten import controls; believes that emergency vaccination should be deployed in any future outbreak, that there should be a total transfer to Scotland of all necessary power to handle any such outbreak and that the continued application of the 20-day rule is creating significant difficulties for Scottish farmers and crofters, and considers that the restrictions on access to the countryside were retained for far too long and had a severe impact upon the rural economy of many parts of Scotland."
