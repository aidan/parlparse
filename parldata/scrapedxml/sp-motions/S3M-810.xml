 *S3M-810 Margo MacDonald: Aamer Anwar—That the Parliament, while recognising and strongly supporting the independence of the judiciary, is concerned that a contempt of court charge should be hanging over the head of Mr Aamer Anwar, solicitor, for his remarks made outside the court, following the verdict in the trial of Mohammed Atif Siddique; notes that Mr Anwar’s comments on aspects of the prosecution and trial, on behalf of his client, were controversial; believes that the Scottish judicial system is robust enough to absorb criticism and that solicitors should not be constrained from speaking out against injustice, and recalls cases where the system has been faulty to the point of innocent persons being found guilty.
