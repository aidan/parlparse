A member shall not submit a claim unless the member is satisfied that the expenses represent value for money and were incurred having due regard to efficiency and effectiveness. 	Accountability A member is personally accountable for a claim, even if the member delegates the administration of the claim to others. A member is entitled to reimbursement of expenses only if the claim is supported by receipts or other documentation confirming the expenditure, unless otherwise determined by the SPCB. 	Openness A member shall be open and transparent as respects expenses claimed under the Scheme. 	Integrity A member shall ensure that a claim is in compliance with the Scheme. A member shall not submit a claim which relates to party political activity and a member shall not enter into any arrangement which could give rise to a benefit to a party political organisation.	 Selflessness A member shall ensure that any claim is submitted solely in respect of the performance of parliamentary duties and is not submitted in order to gain financial or other benefit for the member or any other person. 	Honesty A claim shall be made in good faith. Leadership In complying with the rules of the Scheme and the Scheme Principles, a member shall lead by example to strengthen public trust in the Scheme. 1.1.3 The SPCB shall exercise its functions under the Scheme so as best to promote and achieve conformity with the Scheme Principles. 1.2	ADMINISTRATION OF THE SCHEME 1.2.1 The Scheme is to be administered by the SPCB. 1.2.2 In exercising its functions under the Scheme, the SPCB may make such arrangements as it sees fit for administration of the Scheme and for determining any claims and may, in particular:- (a) prescribe the form and manner in which claims are submitted and the manner in which claims are verified; (b) on the submission of a claim by a member, reimburse expenses incurred by that member; (c) issue guidance to members on the operation of the Scheme; (d) prescribe time limits for the submission of claims and determine the consequences of failure to comply with any such time limits; and (e) do anything else which the SPCB considers necessary or expedient in connection with the administration of the Scheme. 1.2.3 In determining any matter under the Scheme the SPCB shall, in particular, consider whether a member has had regard to guidance issued under paragraph 1.2.2(c). 1.2.4 For each financial year the SPCB shall uprate the various limits on expenses or costs which can be reimbursed under the Scheme, having regard to such indices as the SPCB considers appropriate. Such increases shall apply from 1 April in any financial year. 1.2.5 The limits on the reimbursement of accommodation costs under paragraph 2.1.7, staff salary costs under paragraphs 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 and office costs under paragraphs 4.2.3 and 4.2.4 shall be rounded up to the nearest £100 at each uprating under paragraph 1.2.4. 1.2.6 The SPCB may at any time review the limits on the reimbursement of staff salary costs under paragraphs 3.2.1 and 3.2.2 and office costs under paragraphs 4.2.3, 4.2.4 and 4.2.7 and may, following such a review, apply such variation to those limits as it considers appropriate. Any such variation shall apply from 1 April in any financial year. 1.2.7 Where any changes are enacted in respect of constituencies or regions following a review by the Boundary Commission for Scotland, the SPCB may amend such references to constituencies and regions in this Scheme as it considers necessary to give effect to those changes. 1.3	PUBLICATION OF EXPENSES 1.3.1 The SPCB shall publish information on expenses reimbursed to members under the Scheme in such form and at such intervals as the SPCB may determine. 1.4 	SUBMISSION OF CLAIMS AND VERIFICATION OF EXPENDITURE 1.4.1 Where a member is entitled to reimbursement of expenses or costs under the Scheme, the member shall complete and authenticate any form or other documentation provided or required by the SPCB. 1.4.2 Where a member is required to apply to the SPCB for reimbursement of any expenses or costs under the Scheme:- (a) in advance of incurring any such expenses or costs, a member shall submit an application to the SPCB for approval of such expenses or costs in such form as the SPCB may require; (b) the SPCB may grant its approval for reimbursement of such expenses or costs to such extent as it considers appropriate; and (c) following such approval and once any such expenses or costs have been incurred by the member, the member shall complete and authenticate any form or other documentation provided or required by the SPCB and the SPCB shall reimburse such expenses or costs to the extent previously approved by it (or to the extent of expenses or costs actually incurred if that amount is less). 1.4.3 Subject to paragraph 1.4.4, the SPCB shall reimburse expenses or costs under this Scheme only on production of evidence of such expenses or costs in the form of supporting invoices or receipts or such other documentation as the SPCB may determine from time to time. 1.4.4 A member is not required to provide supporting invoices and receipts for the reimbursement of the cost of travel undertaken in the performance of, or in support of, the member’s parliamentary duties:- (a)	in respect of a claim for an amount per mile for a journey, or part of a journey, by motor vehicle (excluding a hired motor vehicle), motor cycle, or bicycle; or (b) in such other exceptional circumstances as the SPCB may determine. 1.4.5 The SPCB may determine that in certain circumstances a member shall provide written justification for the use of a taxi. The SPCB shall reimburse a member for taxi costs only to the extent that it is satisfied with the justification provided. 1.5	REVIEW OF DECISIONS AND IMPROPER CLAIMS 1.5.1 Where a member disputes a decision either not to reimburse expenses or costs or not to approve expenses or costs for reimbursement, the SPCB may review that decision. Any decision of the SPCB on review is final and it shall intimate the result of that review to the member. 1.5.2 The SPCB may investigate any claim. Where, following such an investigation, the SPCB finds that a member has submitted an improper claim, the SPCB may report to the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee and may recommend the removal of all or part of the member’s entitlement to reimbursement of expenses under this Scheme for such period and to such extent as the SPCB may specify. 1.6	VIREMENT 1.6.1	Subject to paragraph 1.6.2, a member’s entitlement to reimbursement of expenses or costs may not be transferred between the different categories of entitlement to reimbursement of expenses or costs in Sections 2, 3, or 4. 1.6.2	Once in any financial year a member may transfer up to one third of the limit on that member’s entitlement to reimbursement of office costs to that member’s entitlement to reimbursement of staff salary costs. A member making such a transfer shall notify the SPCB in advance of incurring any costs in respect of the sum transferred. 1.7	POOLS 1.7.1 Any members who set up a pool with one or more other members shall give written notice to the SPCB of the setting up of the pool. Such notice shall be in the names of all of the members in the pool. 1.8	MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS 1.8.1 A member is not entitled to reimbursement of expenses where those expenses have been, or will be, reimbursed or otherwise met from any other source. 1.8.2 Where a person becomes a member part way through a financial year, or where a member ceases to be a member part way through a financial year, any limit on the annual entitlement to reimbursement of expenses or costs is to be applied on a pro rata basis or on such other basis as the SPCB may determine.

The SPCB shall not reimburse rent incurred until such a report has been provided. If, on the basis of the report, the SPCB determines that the rent payable in terms of the lease is greater than the fair market rent, the member shall be deemed to be liable only for the fair market rent and the member’s entitlement to reimbursement shall be calculated on that basis. 4.2.12 A member who sub-lets local parliamentary office premises or part of those premises to a party political organisation shall, before concluding the sub-lease, supply to the SPCB a report prepared by an independent surveyor providing a professional opinion as to the fair market rent for the premises concerned when sub-let on the same terms. If, on the basis of the report, the SPCB determines that the rent payable in terms of the sub-lease is less than the fair market rent, the member shall be deemed to be in receipt of the fair market rent and any rent reimbursed shall be calculated on that basis. 4.2.13 A member is not entitled to reimbursement of office costs in respect of a local parliamentary office which is shared with a Member of the House of Commons ("MP") or a Member of the European Parliament ("MEP") unless the member has entered into a written agreement with the MP or MEP as to the apportionment of costs and the terms of the agreement have been approved by the SPCB. 4.3	REIMBURSEMENT OF OFFICE COSTS FOR MEMBERS WHO DO NOT ESTABLISH AND RUN LOCAL PARLIAMENTARY OFFICES 4.3.1 Where a member does not establish and run a local parliamentary office within the constituency or region from which that member was returned, or where a member uses an office in the Parliament as a local parliamentary office, that member is entitled only to reimbursement of office costs up to a maximum amount of 25% of the limit on entitlement to reimbursement which would otherwise be applicable to that member. 4.4	MEMBERS WORKING FROM HOME 4.4.1 A member who works from home in connection with the performance of parliamentary duties is not entitled to reimbursement of any office costs arising from the use of the home for that purpose other than the cost of telecommunications. 4.5	TELECOMMUNICATIONS COSTS 4.5.1	A member is entitled to reimbursement of the cost of telecommunications subject to the limit in any financial year specified in the Schedule of Rates. 4.6	SURGERY ADVERTISING 4.6.1	A member is entitled to reimbursement of the cost of advertising that member’s availability to the public at specified dates, times and places in that member’s constituency or region for consultation regarding enquiries and problems, through surgeries or otherwise, subject to the limit in any financial year specified in the Schedule of Rates.

A member’s entitlement to reimbursement under this paragraph is limited to the cost of a maximum of 74 journeys per member in any financial year.

A journey shall be all such travel completed within one day, but shall not include daily commuting journeys by a member of staff, volunteer or intern to a normal place of work. 5.1.5	Unless paragraph 5.1.1(b) applies, a member shall apply to the SPCB for reimbursement of the cost of travel outwith the UK undertaken in the performance of parliamentary duties.
