*S3M-1040 Pauline McNeill: Teenage Kicks - Improving Musical Opportunities for Young Peopleâ€”That the Parliament notes the recent visit of Feargal Sharkey, chair of the UK Live Music Forum and former lead singer of The Undertones, to meet members of the Cross-Party Group on the Scottish Contemporary Music Industry; congratulates the forum for the work done with the UK Government to utilise assets from dormant bank accounts to fund rehearsal spaces and instrument lending for young people in disadvantaged communities and for securing an advance payment from the Department for Children, Schools and Families to take forward plans modelled on a studio in Wrexham and proposals which have been suggested for Ferguslie Park in Paisley, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with the cross-party group to ensure that Scotland receives its share of any funds released and also to examine whether proceeds of crime revenue can be used to widen access to the music industry for young people in Scotland.
