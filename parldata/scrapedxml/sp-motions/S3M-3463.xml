*S3M-3463 Irene Oldfather: Congratulations to David Weir—That the Parliament congratulates David Weir, a ten-year-old from Dreghorn in Cunninghame South, on his recent success in securing three gold medals in gymnastics in the men’s artistic at the Scottish Regional and National Development Championships at Bellahouston; notes that he has now been invited to train with the national squad; acknowledges the importance of fostering young talent in Scotland and the role that this generation will play in the Glasgow Commonwealth Games, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that every child who has the ability to compete at a national level is given the necessary support to train.
