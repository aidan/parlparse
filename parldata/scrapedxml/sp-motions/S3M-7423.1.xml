*S3M-7423.1 Nicola Sturgeon: Prescription Chargesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-7423) in the name of Derek Brownlee, leave out from "notes" to end and insert "recognises that the abolition of prescription charges will benefit all those patients with long-term conditions and the 600,000 people on low incomes who are not entitled to exemption and further recognises that total abolition is in the best tradition of the NHS and that poor people and sick people should not be made to pay the cost of the economic and financial situation that Scotland faces."
