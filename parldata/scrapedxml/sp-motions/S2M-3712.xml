*S2M-3712 Christine Grahame: Rose, Cindy and Susan—That the Parliament notes the visit to the Scottish Parliament of Cindy Sheehan, Rose Gentle and Susan Smith, mothers of sons killed in Iraq; recognises the work these women are doing in exposing, with great personal dignity and courage, the bloody reality of UK and US involvement in Iraq; regrets the decision by the First Minister of Scotland not to meet these women and that this represented a missed opportunity for him to explain his support for Her Majesty’s Government in this war, which is widely considered to be illegal, and why it is necessary for young men from Scotland, England and the United States of America, together with thousands of civilians in Iraq, to die in the pursuit of oil.
