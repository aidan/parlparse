*S3M-5660 Helen Eadie: Familial Arrhythmia Network for Scotland—That the Parliament warmly welcomes the launch of the Familial Arrhythmia Network for Scotland (FANS), a national managed clinical network designed to assist with the management of people with primary electrical diseases at risk of sudden cardiac death and their families; notes that around 50 young people are killed suddenly by familial arrhythmias annually and that this has a devastating impact on families right across Scotland; notes that, for those living with the associated risk of sudden cardiac death, a diagnosis of this nature is extremely worrying for the patient and relatives; believes that services for these patients in the past has been, at best, patchy; considers that the network will provide a mechanism to assist these patients and their families at the time that they need it most by defining and agreeing referral protocols, developing national guidelines for clinical and genetic testing and establishing a national register of people with these conditions, and urges all MSPs to be aware that, with good management, many of these sudden deaths are preventable and to direct constituents who are affected by these conditions to FANS services, which are based in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen and Dundee.
