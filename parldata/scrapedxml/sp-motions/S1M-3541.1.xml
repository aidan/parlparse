 *S1M-3541.1 Alex Fergusson: Forestry in Scotland-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3541) in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from "and believes" to end and insert "but condemns the Scottish Executive's failure to address the practical problems which face the Scottish forestry industry, particularly with regard to transport; further notes that the Executive has failed to set and promote robust planting targets or to plan for the impending doubling of timber output over the next 10 to 15 years, and urges the Executive to give greater priority to the issues which so concern what is now the third biggest industry in Scotland."
