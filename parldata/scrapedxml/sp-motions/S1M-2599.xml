*S1M-2599 Fiona Hyslop: Edinburgh's Bus Warâ€”That the Parliament condemns the recent demand from Conservative leader David McLetchie that Lothian Buses, the last publicly owned bus company in Scotland, be privatised noting that such a policy would remove bus services needed by the most vulnerable in our society, particularly pensioners, and services which are needed by the community but which are not profitable, and notes that this new privatisation policy from the Conservatives follows on from their discredited deregulation of transport which has led to diminution of transport services including bus services provision.
