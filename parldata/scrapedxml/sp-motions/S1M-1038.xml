*S1M-1038 Trish Godman: Threatened Closure of Royal Ordnance Bishopton—That the Parliament warmly commends the shop stewards at the Royal Ordinance Factory Bishopton and their trade unions for their wholly admirable and substantial campaign to maintain the manufacture of military propellants and related products at the plant; firmly believes that, even at this late date, BAE Systems should have the courage to rescind its earlier and unwise decision to close the plant, and further believes that such a change of heart would make good sense because it would allow for the retention of the last propellant manufacturing facility in the United Kingdom.
