*S2M-3140# Mrs Margaret Ewing: Prospective School Closures in Moray—That the Parliament believes that rural schools are a vital part of local communities and that there should be no presumption of closure; recognises that rural schools and their high standards of education often act as magnets to attract and retain young families; believes that the Moray Council’s option to close 21 such local schools is driven by financial rather than educational considerations, that tighter rules and guidelines must be implemented when it comes to the process of any prospective school closures and mergers in the future and that councillors should be free to express their views as democratically elected representatives of their communities prior to officials bringing forward recommendations, and re-iterates the principle that elected members not officials decide the priorities of their communities.
