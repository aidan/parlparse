*S1M-1374 Irene McGugan: Children's Rights—That the Parliament notes the publication by the Scottish Alliance on Children’s Rights of the report All Children, All Ages which highlights that, although Her Majesty's Government signed the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1991, many of the 54 separate international standards are not being complied with, that children’s basic human rights are being consistently disregarded and that many of the problems highlighted in the report are caused by poverty and social deprivation, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to give serious consideration to the findings and recommendations within the report, principally that a Children’s Commissioner for Scotland should be appointed to ensure that children’s rights are a central consideration in any new legislation, that children themselves should have a voice in policy making, that serious consideration be given to a ban on physical punishment and that there be specific and immediate actions to alleviate poverty as well as long- term targets.
