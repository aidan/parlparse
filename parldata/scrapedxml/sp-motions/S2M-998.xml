*S2M-998 Bill Butler: Intemperate Remarks of Donald Gorrie MSP-That the Parliament views with dismay the comments made by Donald Gorrie MSP at the Fraser inquiry on 3 March 2004 in relation to the late First Minister, Donald Dewar MSP and the Holyrood project; considers that the remarks made by Mr Gorrie were intemperate, inaccurate, deeply offensive and uninformed; deplores Mr Gorrie's attempt to pass off as measured criticism a stream of impolitic utterances which bear no relation to the true nature and character of the man who gave years of distinguished and selfless public service in the cause of his Anniesland constituents and the people of Scotland, both at Holyrood and Westminster, and agrees that an apology followed by a period of lengthy silence from Mr Gorrie is much to be desired on this matter. Supported by: Scott Barrie*, Margaret Jamieson*, Mr Alasdair Morrison*, Mr Duncan McNeil*, Karen Gillon*, Michael McMahon*, Paul Martin*, Richard Baker*, Dr Elaine Murray*, Cathie Craigie*, Dr Sylvia Jackson*, Marlyn Glen*, Mike Watson*, Irene Oldfather*, Helen Eadie*, Des McNulty*, Mr John Home Robertson*, Sarah Boyack*, Elaine Smith*, Kate Maclean*, Ms Wendy Alexander*, Cathy Peattie*, Christine May*, Karen Whitefield*, Johann Lamont*, Jackie Baillie*, Trish Godman*, Maureen Macmillan*, Pauline McNeill*, Mr Kenneth Macintosh*, Rhona Brankin*, Bristow Muldoon*, Marilyn Livingstone*, Susan Deacon*, Janis Hughes*
