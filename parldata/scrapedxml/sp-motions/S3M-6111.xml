 *S3M-6111 Aileen Campbell: End Trident to End Poverty—That the Parliament welcomes the Easter publication of the open letter to voters in Scotland signed by Rt Rev Bill Hewitt, Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, Cardinal Keith O’Brien, head of the Catholic Church in Scotland, and the Most Rev David Chillingworth, Primus of the Scottish Episcopal Church, which condemns the UK Government’s plans to spend £100 billion to replace the Trident nuclear weapons system and encourages everyone in Scotland to choose life over death and the alleviation of poverty over the replacement of Trident; notes that, while the United States of America and Russia have signed a new strategic arms reduction treaty to reduce the number of nuclear weapons in the world, Gordon Brown has decided not to attend a nuclear security summit in Washington on 12-13 April 2010, and believes that scrapping the replacement Trident nuclear weapons system will help to promote world peace and security as well as releasing vital funds for investment in public services during the economic downturn.
