*S2M-3519 Richard Lochhead: Call for Withdrawal of Motion to Remove Haddock From Saleâ€”That the Parliament condemns the early day motion tabled on 1 November 2005 at Westminster by Liberal Democrat MP, Norman Baker, and supported by Dan Rogerson regarding the need for the House of Commons authorities to remove haddock from sale in food outlets; believes that such a move would be extremely damaging to an industry that has already suffered significant hardships in recent years; notes that scientific advice states that North Sea haddock stocks are robust with the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea recently advising the European Union that there is a healthy stock of haddock; further notes that Liberal Democrat and Scottish fisheries minister, Ross Finnie, has condemned the proposed 40% reduction in the haddock quota for 2006, and calls on Norman Baker and Dan Rogerson to withdraw their motion and commit to supporting the Scottish fishing industry as it continues the sustainable fishing of the North Sea.
