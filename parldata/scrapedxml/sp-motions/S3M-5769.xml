* S3M-5769 Margaret Mitchell: Diabetes UK Scotland’s Measure Up Road Show—That the Parliament welcomes Diabetes UK Scotland’s Measure Up campaign, which encourages people to measure their waists to see if they are at risk of type 2 diabetes; notes that diabetes is one of the biggest health challenges facing the United Kingdom today, with over 220,000 people suffering from diabetes in Scotland and a further 620,000 people who are thought to have pre-diabetes, an underdiagnosed condition that makes people up to 15 times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes; further notes that early diagnosis is fundamental in reducing the likelihood of people developing serious complications, such as cardiovascular disease, neuropathy, nephropathy and retinopathy, and congratulates the team of the road show bus who provide an important and professional service in raising awareness of diabetes and who, on a recent visit to Hamilton, had 800 visitors, 191 of whom took part in the assessment, resulting in 47% being referred to their GPs as having a high to moderate risk of developing diabetes.
