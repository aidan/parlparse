 *S2M-5090 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Scotland’s Prisons Shame—That the Parliament notes with concern the report by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland that reveals that 24 under 16-year-olds spent time in adult prisons last year and that this is an increase of six from 2004-05; notes that all of the children held in prison were boys and the youngest was only 14 years and three months; further notes that the Chief Inspector has listed nine evils of prison overcrowding including staff having less time to screen violent and potentially suicidal prisoners, drugs being more readily available, the greater likelihood of cell sharing with dangerous inmates, noise and tension being increased, contact between prisoners and staff being reduced, inmates having less access to education and rehabilitation services, facilities being stretched and food quality suffering, more time being spent isolated in cells and family visits and contact being restricted; recognises that all of these evils can exacerbate stress levels for all prisoners and can particularly exacerbate stress for young prisoners; notes further that the emotional needs of young offenders are different to those of the adult prison population and that incarceration of young prisoners in adult establishments is detrimental to the emotional well-being of young offenders and does nothing to help them rehabilitate and address their offending behaviour, and calls on the Scottish Executive to call an immediate halt to the practice of sending young offenders to adult prison and to address the causes of offending among young people.
