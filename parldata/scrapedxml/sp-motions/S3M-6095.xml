 *S3M-6095 Stuart McMillan: Lenzie Academy Represents Scotland at UK Final—That the Parliament congratulates Lenzie Academy for representing Scotland at the UK Final of the Bar National Mock Trial Competition; notes that Team Lenzie was Scotland’s only representative at the finals and that the team of 15 students came top of their league but, unfortunately, lost out to two other teams that scored more points in their respective leagues; further notes that each team competed in three rounds where they acted as either prosecution or defence for cases that they had been preparing; acknowledges the hard work of all those students that took part, and wishes them the very best for the future.
