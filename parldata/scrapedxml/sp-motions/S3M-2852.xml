 *S3M-2852 Mr Frank McAveety: 2014 Communities Lottery Fund—That the Parliament congratulates the Big Lottery Fund in Scotland and warmly welcomes the launch of 2014 Communities, a new and dedicated fund aimed at securing a legacy from the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games; notes that this is the first such fund in Scotland or the United Kingdom to provide dedicated funding to help create and support a legacy for communities across Scotland arising from the 2014 Games; further notes that through 2014 Communities the Big Lottery Fund will offer small grants to fund and support grassroots involvement in sport and physical activity, focusing on increasing the number of people participating in or volunteering for such activity, and believes that, by opening this new fund now, to run right up to the 2014 games, people across Scotland will have an early opportunity to benefit.
