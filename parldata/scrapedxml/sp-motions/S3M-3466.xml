 *S3M-3466 Jackie Baillie: Alexandria Medical Centre—That the Parliament welcomes the commitment of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to build a new medical centre in Alexandria; notes with regret that the plans to build the centre have been delayed by at least two years; believes that, given the economic downturn, it is in the public interest to accelerate the project, helping to safeguard local jobs and boosting the local economy; understands that delaying the project at a time when building material costs are at their lowest for years will have an added cost impact of £1.5 million; acknowledges that the new medical centre will be a valuable asset to the town and that delaying its construction will be detrimental to the local community’s health and wellbeing, and therefore calls on NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to reprofile the capital necessary to build the new medical centre without any further delay.
