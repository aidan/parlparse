 *S3M-1893 Elaine Murray: Scottish Agricultural Wages Board—That the Parliament supports the efforts of Unite - the Union to retain the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board as a separate body and for its remit to be expanded to cover all workers in the agricultural sector, including those in private and ornamental gardens and all types of fish farming; believes that the board’s future is at risk as a result of the First Minister’s statement on more effective government; believes that the Orders set by the board covering 25,000 workers constitute a model of best practice in industrial relations, and supports the role performed by the board since 1949, in light of the unique nature of the work conducted by those in the agricultural sector, the notoriously high fatality and injury rates in agriculture and the prevalence of gangmasters in the sector, controlling thousands of migrant workers from the EU accession states who are at a greater degree of risk of exploitation.
