*S3M-873.2 George Foulkes: Threatened Closure of the King’s Theatre in Edinburgh—As an amendment to motion (S3M-873) in the name of Sarah Boyack, leave out from "following a decision" to end and insert "despite a promise by City of Edinburgh Council Leader, Councillor Jenny Dawe, in May 2007 to give "top priority" to reviving plans for a refurbishment of the King’s Theatre; notes the comments of the Chief Executive of the Festival City Theatres Trust which runs the venue on the council’s behalf that a delay threatens the King’s Theatre with closure on health and safety grounds within two years; recognises the important contribution that the Tollcross venue has made in its 101-year history to the cultural life of Edinburgh, the Lothians and the east of Scotland and which continues today, and calls on the current ruling Lib Dem/SNP council administration to honour the promise made to the people of Edinburgh only a matter of months ago."
