*S1M-1233# Christine Grahame: Day Care Centres-That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive's announcement that as many older people as possible should remain in their homes for as long as practicable; recognises the valuable contribution which day care centres throughout Scotland make to continued well being of older people and the insecurity which lack of funding can bring; notes the answer to question S1W-9571 by Iain Gray to Christine Grahame on 18 September 2000 that the Scottish Executive has no plans to make provision of day care services for older people a statutory duty; however, calls upon the Scottish Executive to legislate so that there is a specific statutory duty on local authorities to provide day care services, and further requires that it put in place appropriate funding mechanisms in order that day care centres can continue to provide and develop the services which individuals and local communities find essential to maintaining older people at home.
