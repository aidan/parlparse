*S3M-4317♦ Christine Grahame: The Child Support Agency, A Case for Urgent Reform or Abolition?—That the Parliament condemns the ongoing incompetence of the UK Government body, the Child Support Agency (CSA), noting that, despite several assurances of reform or abolition by UK Government ministers in July 2006, it was only in 2008 that the Child Maintenance and Enforcement Commission was set up to consider options; regrets that it was not until February 2009 that Sir David Henshaw, whose salary for a three-day week is around £234,000 a year, was appointed to head the commission while the CSA continued to cause misery and undue stress to parents in the Scottish Borders and elsewhere through inaccurate calculations of maintenance, over-complicated bureaucracy and an inadequate appeals process; considers that this combination is leading to unnecessary stress and financial hardship for both resident and non-resident parents and families, with a substantial impact on their health and wellbeing and consequently health service provision across Scotland, and believes that any further delay of reform or abolition can only bring more misery and stress.
