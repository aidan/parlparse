*S1M-1816 Irene McGugan: Decline in Sports Facilities—That the Parliament notes that, according to a report by the Strathclyde University Scottish School of Sports Studies, children at one in seven secondary schools no longer have access to a grass playing field and that, despite government promises to promote sport, there is evidence of a serious long-term decline in the facilities available, almost 40% of schools do not have a football pitch and there is real concern also about community facilities which are closing down because of a lack of resources to maintain them; considers that this situation means that the already high obesity rate among young Scots will continue to rise in the future and that the nation’s performance in the world sporting arena will go into irreversible decline, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to take positive steps to prioritise sport for children and young people and ensure that locally available and appropriate facilities are available.
