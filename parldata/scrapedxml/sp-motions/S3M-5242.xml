*S3M-5242 Alasdair Allan: BP Fuel Cardsâ€”That the Parliament condemns BP for its recent decision to stop accepting BP Plus and BP Plus Bunker Fuel Cards at 13 non-BP-branded sites on the islands of Lewis, Shetland, Arran and Skye as of 18 December 2009; notes that these cards presently allow island-based businesses and organisations 7.5 pence per litre off the cost of fuel; regrets that, by this decision, BP is imposing additional costs on rural businesses on islands, many of which already have some of the highest fuel costs in the world, and calls on BP to reconsider this damaging decision.
