 *S2M-1266 Allan Wilson: Scotland's Beaches - A National Resource-That the Parliament recognises the importance of Scottish beaches in attracting visitors to Scotland; welcomes the results of the recent Keep Scotland Beautiful survey of resort beaches with the granting of Seaside Awards to 40 Scottish beaches including 14 new recipients; acknowledges the impact of beach litter as highlighted in the recent Marine Conservation Society's Beachwatch 2003 Report; commends the partnership approach taken between the Scottish Executive and other bodies to help address the issues raised in Beachwatch 2003; endorses the continuation of that approach, and encourages the public to take more responsibility for its own litter to ensure that Scotland's beaches continue to be a valued and productive national resource.
