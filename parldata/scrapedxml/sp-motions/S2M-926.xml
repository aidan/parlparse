 *S2M-926 Carolyn Leckie: Primary Medical Care in Lanarkshire-That the Parliament notes the consultation being undertaken by NHS Lanarkshire in relation to primary medical services; is concerned that only one third of GPs have indicated a willingness to participate in new out-of-hours services and that only five GPs are proposed to cover home visits overnight for the entire NHS Lanarkshire area; notes that only housebound and terminally ill patients will be guaranteed a home visit, leaving vulnerable children and other adults with no choice but to make long journeys during the night to access any care; believes that total waiting times for that care, including transport, will be unacceptably long; further believes that, in the context of increasing out-of-hours patient contacts with primary medical services, the proposed provision is woefully inadequate and will not meet the needs of Lanarkshire people, and is concerned that the practical impact of the Primary Medical Services (Scotland) Act 2004 and the new GP contract in Lanarkshire is not untypical and that patient care in Scotland will suffer as a result of its introduction unless there is a substantial increase in the number of GP hours available for out-of-hours provision and a commitment to maintain locally based provision.
