*S1M-3334 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Save the Planet Summit—That the Parliament applauds the intent of the Save the Planet summit in South Africa but expresses disgust and revulsion at the lavish expenditure on delegates in view of the key topic of world starvation and urges the UK delegation to scorn the hospitality of the pâté de foie gras and vintage champagne circuit, as exposed by the Sun newspaper, and come to urgent conclusions about ending the horrific conditions suffered by the deprived.
