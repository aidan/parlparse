*S3M-3890 Patrick Harvie: Resources Needed for the Cairo Programme—That the Parliament notes the assessment made by the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) that a total investment of $64.7 billion is needed for the delivery of the global programme of sexual and reproductive health and family planning, as adopted by the 179 countries represented at the 1994 Cairo International Conference on Population and Development; agrees with the UNFPA that the implementation of this programme is crucial for the eradication of extreme poverty; recognises that this is the first time in 15 years that the Cairo Programme of Action’s cost estimates have been reviewed; further notes that only one third of the $64.7 billion has been pledged from the aid budgets of donor countries; considers that there is a dire need to increase the financial resources for the implementation of the Cairo Programme and that, if the governments of the rich world are serious about the Millennium Development Goals, they should not leave the poorest countries on Earth to find the bulk of the investment themselves; recognises the commitment that both the Scottish and UK governments have shown in the field of international development, and urges them to consider what further action can be taken in light of this reassessment of the resources needed.
