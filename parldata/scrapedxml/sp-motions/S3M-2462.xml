*S3M-2462 Jackie Baillie: Emergency Services at the Vale of Leven Hospital—That the Parliament deeply regrets the conclusions of Report of the independent external clinical review of anaesthetic services at the Vale of Leven Hospital, which recommends the removal of the anaesthetics service at the hospital and the cessation of the Medical Assessment Unit in its current form; notes the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing’s welcome for the report which, if implemented, will see the further transfer of patients from the Vale of Leven Hospital to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley; further notes that the report recommends that all attendances resulting from 999 calls and NHS24 referrals will completely bypass the Vale of Leven Hospital and only attendances referred by a GP and the Minor Injuries Unit will continue; recognises that the net effect of these changes is expected to result in as many as 64% of existing emergency patients being transferred away from the Vale of Leven to Paisley; consequently believes that the SNP government will have failed to meet its own policy of keeping services local if existing patients are unable to receive emergency medical care at the Vale of Leven Hospital; is further disappointed that the option to develop a new acute hospital north of the Clyde, centred on the Golden Jubilee Hospital, has not been comprehensively considered, despite the excellence of the clinical quality that would be provided, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government, in the strongest possible terms, to continue existing emergency services at the Vale of Leven Hospital and give robust consideration to realigning acute services for the local population, away from Paisley to north of the river.
