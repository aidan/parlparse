 *S3M-3461 Willie Coffey: Chancellor Must Act on Whisky Duty—That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement by Diageo that it is to implement a £100 million cost reduction programme, which may impact on its Scottish workforce; notes that, with the Johnnie Walker plant at Kilmarnock and distribution hub at Hurlford, Diageo is a major employer in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun constituency, as it is elsewhere in Scotland; recalls that, in November 2008, the Chancellor of the Exchequer increased alcohol duty on whisky by 4% to balance the cut in VAT to 15%; expresses concern that, when the VAT cut is reversed in November 2009, the increase in alcohol duty is to remain in place; recognises that there is considerable evidence, most recently in a report by Gen Consulting, that a reduction in alcohol duty on whisky would be of major benefit to the Scottish economy and would protect Scottish jobs; notes that the current alcohol duty regime discriminates against Scotch whisky, while favouring cheap ciders, beers and wines, which are the most frequent causes of drunkenness among Scotland’s young people, and calls on the chancellor to revise the alcohol duty regime and give a much-needed jobs boost to a vital industry, which provides Scotland with valuable employment and a major contribution to its exports.
