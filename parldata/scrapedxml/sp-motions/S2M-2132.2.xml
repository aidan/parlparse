*S2M-2132.2 John Swinburne: Iraq—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2132) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from first "notes" to end and insert "believes that the Westminster Parliament was misled by the threat of imminent danger to the United Kingdom from attacks of nuclear and biological weapons of mass destruction which could be launched in 45 minutes by Saddam Hussein and, as a consequence, voted to "liberate" the Iraqi people from the tyranny of Saddam’s oppressive regime, action which has now escalated into a war of attrition against the people of Iraq who have suffered unspeakably due to what has widely been considered an illegal invasion of their country by the forces of President Bush and Prime Minister Blair; notes that this action has resulted in the deaths of around 100,000 civilians and the complete destruction of much of the infrastructure of Iraq, and therefore calls upon the UK Government to take action to end this carnage immediately by withdrawing all troops and to hand over primary responsibility for peacekeeping and security to the United Nations along with an undertaking to pay reparations to the Iraqi people for any illegal actions which the coalition undertook."
