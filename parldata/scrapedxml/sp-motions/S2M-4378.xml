 *S2M-4378 Patrick Harvie: Renew for Freedom—That the Parliament congratulates the campaign group No2ID for their "Renew for Freedom" campaign which urges members of the public to renew their passports en masse in May 2006; notes that by doing so Scottish citizens who wish to exercise the liberty to travel will be able to enjoy at least 10 years of freedom before being compelled to provide biometric data for the UK Government’s ID Card scheme and having their details entered on the National Identity Register (NIR); encourages MSPs and all Scottish citizens to apply for a new passport this month to ensure the slowest possible implementation of the ID card and NIR system, and sincerely hopes that before these 10 years of freedom have passed the system will have been scrapped by a more enlightened government. Supported by: Tommy Sheridan*, Eleanor Scott*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Rob Gibson*, Robin Harper*, Murdo Fraser*, Shiona Baird*
