*S2M-1587 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Continuing Concern at Hospital Services Review-That the Parliament notes with continuing alarm the results of the hospital service reviews within Glasgow and the west of Scotland; further notes that these reviews have led to the proposed or actual closure of, or diminution of services at, many hospitals within these areas, including Stobhill, Vale of Leven and the Victoria Infirmary among others and that the views of the public, which are overwhelmingly against the decisions taken so far by NHS Greater Glasgow and NHS Argyll and Clyde, are continually ignored, and therefore urges its members to support a moratorium on any planned diminution of services until the Minister for Health and Community Care takes on board the views of the people who will have to live with the results of these cuts and to fight for the continuation of their local services. Supported by: Jim Mather*, John Swinburne*, Carolyn Leckie*, Frances Curran*, Tommy Sheridan*, Patrick Harvie*, Dr Jean Turner*, Chris Ballance*
