 *S2M-5504 Alex Johnstone: One Step Beyond Campaign—That the Parliament congratulates Kay Gilmour of Angus College for instigating the One Step Beyond Campaign which seeks to collect 80,000 pairs of second hand shoes for distribution in Africa and Asia; notes that the campaign also seeks to raise £160,000 to be split between four charities: Cancer Research UK, No More Landmines Trust, Children in Need and Angus College Charitable Trust; wishes the campaign every success, and hopes that its bid succeeds to set a new world record to have the longest line of pairs of shoes ever laid out.
