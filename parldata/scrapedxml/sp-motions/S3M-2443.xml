 *S3M-2443 David Stewart: Insulin Pump Therapyâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the recent decision by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland to approve the new NICE guidelines on insulin pumps for use in Scotland; notes that more people will now be eligible for continuous insulin infusion pump therapy thereby improving the quality of lives for those with insulin-dependant diabetes, and urges the Scottish Executive and local NHS boards to monitor closely the insulin pump programme availability throughout Scotland to ensure that people with type 1 diabetes who meet the criteria have access to these insulin pumps that deliver therapy.
