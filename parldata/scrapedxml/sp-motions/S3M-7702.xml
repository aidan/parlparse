*S3M-7702 Mr Frank McAveety: Shettleston Scheme a Boost for Bookworms—That the Parliament welcomes the success of Shettleston railway station’s book swap initiative that is being led by the east-end based ticket officer, Michael Cochrane; believes that this initiative promotes reading and encourages engagement with the area’s history; hopes that what it believes will be the increase in passenger numbers associated with the new direct service from the station to Edinburgh will help the project go from strength to strength, and considers that the success of this innovative scheme is further evidence of the unique role played by the east end in Glasgow’s rich and diverse cultural experience.
