*S3M-3148 Christina McKelvie: Congratulations to Scotland’s Universities—That the Parliament congratulates Scotland’s universities on being rated as internationally excellent in the field of research by an independent review carried out as part of the Research Assessment Exercise (RAE); agrees with Universities Scotland that this is a Scottish research triumph and one that offers real economic hope amid the gloom, and believes that our universities can continue to go from strength to strength.
