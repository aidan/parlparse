*S2M-1058 Donald Gorrie: Expansion of the Internment Facilities at Dungavel-That the Parliament regrets the decision of Her Majesty's Government to expand the detention facilities at Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre in Lanarkshire without consultation with the Scottish Parliament; believes that, notwithstanding that immigration is a reserved matter, decisions relating to the internment of would-be asylum seekers in Scotland should be referred to the Scottish Parliament for agreement, and suggests that a meeting should be held between MSPs and Scottish MPs to develop a common policy on Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre.
