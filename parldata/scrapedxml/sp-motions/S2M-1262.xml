 *S2M-1262 Donald Gorrie: Sectarian Marches-That the Parliament is concerned about the disruptive effect on communities caused by the large number of sectarian marches, for example over 300 annually both in Glasgow and in North Lanarkshire, and proposes setting up, in the area of each council significantly affected by marches, a body representative of the council, police, organisations promoting marches and communities repeatedly marched through, which would seek voluntary agreement on fewer marches being held, on conventions governing legitimate reasons for marches and on the choice of routes acceptable to local communities, as guidance to councils and police in their decisions about giving permission for marches.
