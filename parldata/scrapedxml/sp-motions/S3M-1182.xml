*S3M-1182 Kenneth Gibson: Problem Gamblingâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern that approximately 0.7% to 0.8% of the adult Scottish population, or approximately 35,000 to 40,000 individuals, are problem gamblers; acknowledges the negative impacts of problem gambling on society, including anxiety, increased abuse of alcohol, disruption of family relationships, decreased productivity in the workplace due to absenteeism and preoccupation with gambling, increased incidences of incarceration or arrest, depression and suicide; recognises the need to reduce the prevalence of problem gambling and alleviate its corresponding social ills, and believes that casinos and other gambling institutions should be accountable for the harm that they promote by contributing financially to a fund to be used for educating the public about the potential dangers of problem gambling as well as for the treatment of individuals who already struggle with problem gambling.
