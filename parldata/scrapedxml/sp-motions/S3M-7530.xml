 *S3M-7530♦ Ted Brocklebank: Retention of RAF Leuchars—That the Parliament considers that RAF Leuchars plays an essential role in the defence of the United Kingdom; commends the professionalism and dedication of military personnel who have served or serve there; considers that those who have been deployed from Leuchars on active service have given exemplary service since the First World War; believes that the case for RAF Leuchars remaining as one of the United Kingdom’s two main fighter strike bases is overwhelming as it has a pivotal strategic position on the east coast and is adjacent to Scotland’s major population centres; understands, however, that any considerations on how the United Kingdom’s air defences are deployed and where aircraft should be based must be made on strategic grounds, and believes that the Secretary of State for Defence must make his decision on that basis.
