*S2M-1107 Patrick Harvie: Environmental Justice-That the Parliament notes a new report, Environmental Justice, published by the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF), the Environmental Law Foundation and Leigh, Day and Co, which alarmingly shows that the civil justice system effectively prevents people who are concerned about the environment from going to court and that the criminal justice system fails to provide effective deterrents to environmental and wildlife crimes in England and Wales; further notes that the report surveyed over 50 respondents, including 18 solicitors, 20 barristers and 15 non-governmental organisations, and found that 97% of those interviewed did not think that the civil law system delivered environmental justice, and urges the Scottish Executive to undertake a review of the civil and criminal justice systems in Scotland to ensure that the law properly protects the environment.
