 *S3M-3005 Bob Doris: Supporting Kinship Carers - No to UK Clawback—That the Parliament calls on the UK Government’s Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) to update rules regarding kinship carers of looked-after children to ensure that no kinship carer loses out on the new allowances agreed in the historic concordat between Scotland’s local authorities and the Scottish Government; acknowledges that some kinship carers are currently in receipt of state benefits that may be clawed back by the DWP, if the rules are not amended, rendering the kinship care allowance pointless for some families and potentially resulting in Scotland’s local authorities and the Scottish Government effectively subsidising the UK treasury, and believes that any clawback would not only be an unacceptable way to treat our kinship carers but would also hamper the clear policy objectives of the democratically-elected Scottish Government and local authorities in Scotland.
