*S2M-3837.2 Fergus Ewing: Air Route Development Fund—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3837) in the name of Tavish Scott, insert at end “further acknowledges the importance of aviation in the prime aim of growing the Scottish economy; urges the Executive to seek to remove barriers to further success in aviation policy; calls on the Executive to audit and review the ARDF and its efficacy thus far, with a view to refining and widening its terms, and to consider, for example, its extension to air freight traffic and to less frequent and seasonal services, and urges the Executive to work with Scotland’s airports and carriers to deliver a competitive economic environment, which should include the provision of appropriate and sufficient infrastructure for our airports.”
