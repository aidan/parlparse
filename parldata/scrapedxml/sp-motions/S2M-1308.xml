 *S2M-1308 Colin Fox: The City of Edinburgh Council, Housing Stock Transfer-That the Parliament has serious concerns about plans announced by the City of Edinburgh Council to transfer its entire housing stock out of local authority control; notes that since 1993 more than 300,000 council houses have been transferred into private ownership and a further 46,000 demolished, whilst only 48,000 have been built in the socially-rented sector; believes that the restrictions placed on council housebuilding programmes should be lifted immediately; notes that the City of Edinburgh Council's plan includes a commitment by the Scottish Executive to write off £300 million of debt and believes that this debt should not be used as inducement in this way but instead be written off now; believes that the Executive must make a clear commitment to high quality, affordable, public housing for rent in Scotland and is disappointed that only 51 council houses were built in Scotland last year; urges the City of Edinburgh Council to ensure that the views of its tenants are fully consulted and that the referendum planned for 2006 is thoroughly democratic and fair, and calls on the council to ensure that both sides in this debate are provided with equal amounts of council resources to be able to put their case forward.
