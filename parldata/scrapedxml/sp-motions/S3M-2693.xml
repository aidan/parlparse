*S3M-2693# Nanette Milne: Community Service Volunteers (CSV)—That the Parliament commends Community Service Volunteers (CSV) for its strong track record in supporting retired people to engage with their local communities as volunteers; congratulates the Energy Challenge project in Aberdeen, which trains older volunteers to bring fuel efficiency and energy savings advice to people in their own homes to ensure that they stay warm and have energy-efficient homes; notes that, in view of government funding ending in March 2009, CSV’s support to 1,600 older volunteers working in their local areas will come to an end, which will have a huge impact on communities and individuals across Scotland, and believes that consideration should be given to how continued support can be provided for volunteer-involving organisations. Supported by: Robert Brown*, Murdo Fraser*, Hugh Henry*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Ted Brocklebank*, Rob Gibson*, John Lamont*, Elizabeth Smith*, Jackson Carlaw*, Bill Aitken*, Alex Johnstone*, Jim Tolson*, Dr Richard Simpson*, Brian Adam*, Jamie McGrigor*, Trish Godman*, Liam McArthur*, Robin Harper*, Patrick Harvie*, Elaine Murray*
