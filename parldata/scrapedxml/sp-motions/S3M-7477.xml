*S3M-7477 John Swinney: Scottish Variable Rate of Income Tax—That the Parliament notes that the Scottish variable rate (SVR) remains a power in statute; further notes the substantial investment required to make the SVR operate in a way compatible with HM Revenue and Custom’s IT system; believes that such expenditure requires careful consideration at a time of huge public spending pressures; further believes that this expenditure requires to be assessed in the context that the SVR is due to be replaced by a new taxation system; calls on the UK Government to specify the costs of its Calman taxation proposals so that the Scottish Parliament can judge whether these costs should be met and that the Scottish Parliament should be informed of these costs before considering whether to give approval to the proposed UK legislation, and records the fact that such costs, under HM Treasury’s own statement of funding policy, should be borne by the UK Government, all of which demonstrates the need for the Scottish Parliament to have full financial responsibility.
