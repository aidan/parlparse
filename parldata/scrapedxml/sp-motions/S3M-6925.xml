*S3M-6925 Bill Wilson: Paisley Abbey Drain Excavation—That the Parliament congratulates the Renfrewshire Local History Forum on its second excavation of the Paisley Abbey Drain to coincide with Renfrewshire’s Doors Open Day and Scottish Archaeology Month; considers that Paisley Abbey has been a focal point of the town since 1163 and so recognises the cultural significance of the continued work, the first phase of which took place in 2009, and wishes the forum well with its ongoing discovery and exploration of historical sites throughout Renfrewshire.
