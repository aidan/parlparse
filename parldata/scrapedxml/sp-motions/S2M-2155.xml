*S2M-2155 Mr Andy Kerr: Fair to All, Personal to Each - The Next Steps for NHS Scotland—That the Parliament notes that continuing action is needed to turn round the poor health of many people in Scotland; supports the emphasis that the Scottish Executive has placed, across portfolios, on health promotion; agrees that the Executive is right in tackling the three big killers of coronary heart disease, cancer, and stroke and recognises the progress made to date in reducing mortality rates from these diseases; believes in putting patients first so that they are at the heart of NHS service developments and priorities, and supports the Executive’s determination to target additional investment and increase capacity so that the next steps are focused on reducing waiting for out-patient appointments and hospital admissions, on speeding diagnostic tests and on extending patient choice.
