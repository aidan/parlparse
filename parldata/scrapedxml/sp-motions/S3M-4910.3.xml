*S3M-4910.3 Keith Brown: Teacher Numbersâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-4910) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from "the most recent" to end and insert "that Scotland benefits from a record low in average class size in primary schools, that the number of P1 to P3 pupils in classes of 18 or under is increasing and that the Scottish average primary class size is considerably smaller than those for England and Wales; welcomes the record levels of funding provided by the current administration to local government and the commitment set out in the concordat to reduce class sizes but notes that the employment of teachers is a matter for local authorities; welcomes the continuing commitment of the Scottish Government and local government to work together to make further progress on class size reduction; highlights with concern that the previous administration took no legislative action to support its class size reduction policy and notes the recently announced intention of the Scottish Government to introduce regulations for a maximum class size of 25 in P1 from the beginning of the 2010 school year and to review more generally how class sizes are governed, and also recognises the action of the Scottish Government to ensure a better balance between supply and demand of teachers."
