*S1M-2672 Mr Brian Monteith: Mansfield Place Church-That the Parliament congratulates the Mansfield Traquair Trust for its success to date in restoring the fabric of the Catholic Apostolic Church at Mansfield Place, Edinburgh, which is an excellent example of romanesque style by Sir Robert Rowand Anderson and home to the most uplifting, scintillating and luminescent murals from the arts and craft movement by Phoebe Anna Traquair, completed in 1901, but now, sadly, in great need of careful restoration; notes that the Scottish Council for Voluntary Organisations has already agreed a long term lease to use the building as its new headquarters, thereby providing a secure basis for the future, and calls upon Historic Scotland, national lottery organisations and other public agencies to continue to give the Mansfield Traquair Trust every assistance so that the building and its superior decorative illuminations are available for the enjoyment of the Scottish people and art lovers world-wide.
