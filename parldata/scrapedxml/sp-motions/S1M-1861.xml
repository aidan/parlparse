*S1M-1861 Tommy Sheridan: Chief Executive of Visitscotland—That the Parliament condemns the shambles over the appointment of the Chief Executive of visitscotland; believes that this is a story of greed and incompetence which brings discredit on the Scottish Executive; in particular condemns the obscene salary of £145,000 per annum which was offered and which apparently was insufficient to secure the full-time services of Mr Rod Lynch, and contrasts this position with the failure of the Scottish Executive to fund properly local authority and health workers who earn less than £10,000 per annum.
