*S2M-4176 Mark Ballard: Fairtrade NUS—That the Parliament congratulates the National Union of Students Services Limited (NUSSL), the buying consortium for NUS-affiliated students’ unions, on its decision to become 100% Fairtrade for hot beverages, subject to approval at the forthcoming NUSSL Annual General Meeting; supports moves by the NUS to encourage its entire membership to opt in to Fairtrade status; recognises that Edinburgh University Students’ Association, along with others, has submitted a motion to NUS Annual Conference supporting this move; notes that the motion will allow the NUS to encourage all student unions to embrace Fairtrade and ensure that the millions of students across the United Kingdom will drink Fairtrade as default in their unions; further recognises the importance of Fairtrade products for securing a fair deal for farmers in developing countries, and calls on the UK Government to continue to do all it can to support the continued growth of the fair trade market in the United Kingdom.
