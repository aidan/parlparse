*S3M-7692.1 Elizabeth Smith: Education—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7692) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from "condemns" to end and insert "notes the SNP government’s failure to deliver on its education pledges; further notes that many of them were unrealistic, uncosted and the wrong priorities for pupils and parents; regrets that the Scottish Government has failed to bring forward any substantive reforms to school management, but recognises the educational benefits of "free schools" and of giving more decision-making powers and greater financial control to head teachers of all other publicly funded schools."
