 *S2M-1832# Dr Elaine Murray: Supporting People Fund—That the Parliament notes with concern that 19 local authorities will receive standstill or reduced funding from the Scottish Executive’s Supporting People initiative, including Dumfries and Galloway Council which will lose £2.4m from its budget in the next financial year; considers that this will lead to a reduction in support services to some of the most vulnerable people in these local authority areas, and believes that the Executive should consider increasing the funding available to this initiative to maintain at least the current level of support to those local authorities that stand to lose funds from April 2005.
