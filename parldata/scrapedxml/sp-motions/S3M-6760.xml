 *S3M-6760 Kenneth Gibson: Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999â€”That the Parliament believes that, as part of the alleged respect agenda, the UK Government should rescind the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order 1999; considers that, under this regulation, 15,000 square kilometres of Scottish waters, as agreed in the Continental Shelf (Jurisdiction) Order 1968, were transferred unilaterally from Scottish to UK jurisdiction; understands that this was carried out on 13 April 1999, just weeks before the Scottish Parliament came into being, without being debated in the House of Commons; further understands that this annexation of Scottish waters and seabed gives the UK Government control over oil, gas and other minerals in that sector, which includes the Angus, Auk, Clyde, Fife, Fulmar and Janice wells, and regrets the acquiescence of unionist parties north of the border in meekly accepting this state of affairs.
