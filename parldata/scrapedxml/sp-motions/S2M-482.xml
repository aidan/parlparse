 *S2M-482# Maureen Macmillan: Development of Oban Harbour-That the Parliament notes with concern that Oban, the crossroads to the west highlands and islands, is being economically constrained by the lack of strategic development of the harbour resulting in a knock-on effect on the north Argyll islands and believes that the Scottish Executive should work with Argyll and Bute Council, Highland and Islands Enterprise and all other stakeholders to develop the infrastructure in Oban harbour in a strategic way so that it can meet the future need for berthing facilities for the increasing number of ferries, cruise liners, pleasure boats, yachts and fishing boats that use the harbour.
