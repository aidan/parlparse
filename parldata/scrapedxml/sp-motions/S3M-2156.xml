*S3M-2156 Mary Scanlon: World Elder Abuse Awareness Dayâ€”That the Parliament supports World Elder Abuse Awareness Day on 15 June 2008; notes that an estimated 500,000 older people suffer from elder abuse; further notes that, through persistent campaigning and lobbying, the issue of elder abuse is now a more widely recognised issue and that 15 June will for the third year see co-ordinated events around the United Kingdom which aim to give abuse and neglect of older adults a global relevance that will sustain and move prevention efforts throughout the year, and congratulates Action on Elder Abuse on its work to protect and prevent the abuse of vulnerable older adults.
