*S2M-3939 Robin Harper: Save the Palais—That the Parliament notes with alarm that the Fountainbridge Mecca Palais bingo hall, an Edinburgh institution which once attracted young dancers in their droves, is to be demolished to make way for housing, business units and eateries; believes that this building, with its landmark Art Deco frontage, should be preserved at a time when live music and dance venues in Edinburgh are at an all-time low, and recognises that we should encourage the resurgence of dancing generated by recent television programmes as a means of promoting physical exercise in adults.
