 *S2M-3959 Mr Adam Ingram: Teaching of History is Foundation Subject for Modern Democratic Societies—That the Parliament notes with concern that the current level of the teaching of history in Scottish schools is amongst the lowest in Europe; further notes that the teaching of history is one of the foundation stones to modern democratic societies; considers that an understanding of history allows pupils to develop the necessary analytical and critical faculties to enable them to make informed choices about the social standards and values of their own communities and to understand Scotland’s place in the world, and therefore believes that the teaching of this distinct and important subject should be extended from its present one hour a week for S1 and S2 pupils to a minimum of two hours a week and made a requirement for pupils up to S4.
