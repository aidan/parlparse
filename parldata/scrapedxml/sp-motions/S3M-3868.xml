 *S3M-3868 Margaret Curran: Green Garrowhill—That the Parliament recognises the excellent efforts of Garrowhill Primary School’s eco committee, particularly the endeavours of the seven elected members, Lyndsay McMath and Amy Kerweiss from primary five, Claire Wallace, Ross McPhearson and Amy Thompson from primary six and Fiona Kirkpatrick and Kyle Nolan from primary seven; congratulates Garrowhill Primary for being awarded its first Green Flag almost two years ago and for placing environmental issues at the centre of the school’s ethos, which is a tremendous reflection on the pupils, staff and parents of the Garrowhill community; commends the eco committee for encouraging greater consideration for waste management, health and wellbeing, and hopes that the achievements, which include a successful Eco Day and a working organic fruit and vegetable garden, will encourage schools across the area to become more green.
