 *S3M-4018 Elaine Smith: Breastfeeding, Every Day Makes a Difference to Your Baby—That the Parliament notes that National Breastfeeding Awareness Week takes place from 10 to 16 May 2009, with this year’s theme being "Breastfeeding: every day makes a difference to your baby"; recognises the positive impact of breastfeeding on the health of both mother and child; understands that mums who receive help and support, whether it be from a friend or family member, a healthcare professional or volunteer breastfeeding supporter, are likely to breastfeed for longer, giving them and their child important health benefits; believes that the Breastfeeding etc. (Scotland) Act 2005 is an excellent method of protecting the child’s right to be breastfed in public places, free from harassment, and thus acts as a positive incentive for choosing breastfeeding; is concerned, however, that anecdotal evidence suggests that attempts are still being made to stop mothers and babies from breastfeeding in public places despite this being a criminal offence; regrets the apparent lack of knowledge of the law on breastfeeding in society as a whole but specifically within the police forces of Scotland; considers that knowledge within the Scottish Police Service could be improved if the Act were to feature as part of the syllabus taught to probationer constables; expects that, where evidence exists to show that the law has been broken, such cases will be referred to the procurator fiscal, and believes that the Scottish Government should take urgent action to ensure that this law is understood by employers, law enforcers and the general public as part of an awareness raising campaign to assist in meeting its target of 37.5% of babies being exclusively breastfed by 2010-11.
