*S2M-4741 Cathie Craigie: Don’t Lose the Music Week—That the Parliament welcomes the first ever Don’t Lose the Music Week, taking place between 4 and 10 September 2006, backed by RNID Scotland; further welcomes the launch of the campaign designed to educate people who enjoy listening to music on their iPod or MP3 player to recognise the dangers associated with listening to music at high volumes for sustained periods of time; expresses concern over the potential hearing damage inflicted on themselves by the 19.7% of 16 to 24-year-olds who listen to their players for over 21 hours each week, and believes that safe listening messages displayed on and within product packaging would allow users to make informed choices.
