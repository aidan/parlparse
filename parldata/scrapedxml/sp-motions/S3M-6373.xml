*S3M-6373 Bill Wilson: Significant Fraud—That the Parliament notes an Audit Scotland report that fraud and errors in the public sector are costing an estimated £21.1 million in Scotland; notes that this is equivalent to 0.016% of UK tax evasion, avoidance and non-collection as estimated by the Public and Commercial Services Union, and calls on both governments and the media to act appropriately.
