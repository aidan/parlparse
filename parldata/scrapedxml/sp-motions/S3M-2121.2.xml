 *S3M-2121.2 Patrick Harvie: Bus Transportâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-2121) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end "recognises the need, beyond the short term, to consider the most appropriate regulatory environment for bus services to operate within, given the mixed impacts of competition in the industry and the positive results that have been achieved in countries and cities which use stronger forms of bus regulation, and calls on the Scottish Government to consult on the full range of options for the future of bus services."
