 *S2M-505 Richard Lochhead: Statues of Justice and Mercy-That the Parliament notes the existence of the statues Justice and Mercy, sculpted in 1637 by Alexander Mylne of Perth, that stood above the great door of Parliament Hall within the old Scottish Parliament; further notes that the statues are currently under the care of the Faculty of Advocates and Court of Session in Parliament House; regrets the lack of awareness and knowledge of these statues; believes that prominently displaying them in the new Parliament building at Holyrood would be an ideal way of linking the old Parliament with the new, and calls on the Presiding Officer to investigate, along with the Faculty of Advocates and Court of Session, the possibility of installing these historical artefacts in a suitably cherished position within the new parliament building.
