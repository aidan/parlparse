 S3M-4681 Christine Grahame: Town Centre Regeneration Fund Investment for Hawick—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that Hawick will benefit from £353,000 from the Town Centre Regeneration Fund, part of a £40 million package of funding from the Scottish Government that will boost town centres and support jobs; notes that the successful bid was made achievable through the coordinated efforts of local shopkeepers and that the money will be spent on improving the high street, on maintenance and on funding for local festivities that will attract more people to Hawick, and encourages more Border towns to put forward substantive applications for the final tranche of funding.
