 *S3M-3495 Liam McArthur: Future of Scotland’s Retained Firefighters—That the Parliament notes with surprise and regret that not a single SNP MP turned up to debate the future of the Scottish Retained Fire Service in Westminster Hall on 11 February 2009 and that only one Scottish Labour MP was present; is disappointed that the SNP in particular seem to prefer engaging in debate in the press rather than in the parliamentary chamber; views the protection of our local communities and retained fire crews as something that requires careful, responsible joint working, and calls on SNP and Labour parliamentarians in Westminster and Holyrood to participate in the democratic process for which they were elected and to press the UK and Scottish governments to ensure that a means of implementing any changes is found that will allow the continued operation of a fire service relying on retained firefighters.
