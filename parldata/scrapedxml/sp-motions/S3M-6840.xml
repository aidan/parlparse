*S3M-6840Jackie Baillie:Dumbarton Band Is Piping Hot Success—That the Parliament congratulates the Dumbarton and District Pipe Band on what it considers to be the band’s tremendous accomplishment at the World Pipe Band Championships held at Glasgow Green in August 2010; notes that the senior band qualified for the final heat of the competition and finished 12th overall in the grade two category; further notes that Andrew Symon and Iona Burns from the band finished fifth and sixth respectively in the Juvenile Drum Major category; acknowledges that, for many of the members of Dumbarton and District, this was their first time competing in the World Championships since graduating from the junior to the grade two senior band, and hopes that they can keep up this fantastic form when they return to the World Championships next year.
