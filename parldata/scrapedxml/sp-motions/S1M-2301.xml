*S1M-2301# Mr Kenneth Gibson: Save Milngavie Reservoir—That the Parliament is concerned at the plan by West of Scotland Water Authority to build Scotland’s largest ever treatment works at the Milngavie Reservoir, a development which would be the equivalent to building five football pitches to the height of a four storey building on the brow of a hill; notes that Milngavie Reservoir is a place of significant cultural and historic value to both Milngavie and Glasgow, with the entire site having been listed by Historic Scotland; is aware that the reservoir has been recognised as a location of importance to nature conservation; is angered at the totally inadequate level of public consultation by the authority on the project with plans presented to the local community as virtually a fait accompli; is further concerned at the secrecy surrounding the project and the failure of the authority to provide satisfactory justification on either technical or environmental grounds for selecting Milngavie Reservoir over 17 other possible sites; believes that the plans for the reservoir deprive the citizens of Milngavie and Glasgow of a much loved and used public amenity in an area of outstanding natural beauty set in the grandeur of a Victorian architectural setting; supports the "Friends of Milngavie Reservoir" campaign against this proposal by West of Scotland Water Authority, and calls for an immediate halt to the project to enable other possible sites to be fully, properly and publicly evaluated.
