 * S2M-2973 Donald Gorrie: Statues of Justice and Mercy—That the Parliament strongly dissents from the decision to refuse to site in Holyrood the two statues, titled Justice and Mercy, from the former Scottish Parliament building and urges the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, which apparently was not consulted about the decision, to assert its authority and agree to house the statues appropriately in Holyrood.
