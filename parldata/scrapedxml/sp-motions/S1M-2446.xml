*S1M-2446# Shona Robison: National Mouth Cancer Awareness Weekâ€”That the Parliament recognises the importance of National Mouth Cancer Awareness Week in highlighting the need for people to visit the dentist regularly to ensure early detection and treatment of oral cancer; is concerned that the incidence of oral cancer has increased by one third over the last fifteen years; is aware of the research by the British Dental Association which showed that one in two people are more likely to visit a dentist regularly if there is no charge for an NHS dental check up, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider the restoration of free dental check ups as part of its review of charging policy within the health service.
