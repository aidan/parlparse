*S3M-6055 Dave Thompson: Young Consumers of the Year Scotland 2010—That the Parliament congratulates Boroughmuir High School in Edinburgh on its victory in the Scottish final of the Young Consumers of the Year 2010; notes that the school’s team of Douglas Boubert, Imogen Ross, Elspie Horne and Alice MacKenzie beat three other finalists to win the prestigious competition for the third consecutive year; congratulates the other three teams from Dingwall Academy, Ayr Academy and Linlithgow Academy for beating off tough regional competition to reach the Scottish final; further considers that the competition, which is run by the Trading Standards Institute and Scottish local authorities and sponsored by Consumer Focus Scotland, is a great opportunity for young people to learn more about their consumer rights and responsibilities, and wishes the Boroughmuir High School team every success when it goes on to represent Scotland at the UK final at the Trading Standards Institute annual conference in Edinburgh in June 2010.
