*S2M-2117.1 Fergus Ewing: Executive-Supported Lifeline Ferry Services in the Clyde and Hebridesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-2117) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from "commends" to end and insert "believes that lifeline ferry services must be provided and an element of public subsidy will be required for that aim; further believes that the proposed national concessionary travel scheme should be extended to ferry travel; calls on the Scottish Executive to provide documented evidence showing that EU law requires that the tendering process which the Executive proposes must be undertaken; is concerned about the potential impact that this process may have upon the employment conditions of staff working on ferries, and notes that many passengers have voiced serious concerns about both the efficiency and effectiveness of the current ferry services provided by Caledonian MacBrayne which require a thorough and independent investigation."
