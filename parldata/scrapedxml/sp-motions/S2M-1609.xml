*S2M-1609 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Dumping of Human and Industrial Sludge at Ben Bain, Dalmellingtonâ€”That the Parliament accepts that the proposed dumping of human and industrial sewage sludge at Ben Bain, Dalmellington, is unacceptable and should not be permitted; notes with strong disapproval that there is no requirement for planning permission in spite of the fact that the proposed amount of sludge to be dumped is 33,000 tonnes over the next six to twelve months, thus raising the ground level by up to one metre; further notes that any requirement to risk assess the effects of increased traffic on the roads or possible seepage into a tributary of the River Nith has thereby been disregarded, and calls on the Scottish Executive to put an end to the undemocratic practice of not requiring planning permission for such developments.
