 *S3M-7768 John Lamont: Scottish Produce at Le Bocuse d’Or—That the Parliament congratulates the Tuke family and the staff at Hardies Mill Farm in the Borders on being selected by Quality Meat Scotland to supply produce for the 2011 Bocuse d’Or taking place in Lyon from 22 to 26 January 2011; recognises that Le Bocuse d’Or is widely considered to be the culinary version of the Olympic Games, attracting top young chefs from around the world; considers this to be a tremendous vote of confidence in the quality of produce available from farms in Scotland, and welcomes the opportunity for local produce to be on show at such a highly regarded and influential event.
