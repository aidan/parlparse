*S2M-1558 Tommy Sheridan: No Tour Charges in the People's Parliament-That the Parliament condemns any attempt to charge the people of Scotland to go on tours of their own new Parliament building, the people having previously paid for it with over Â£430 million of public money; views any such proposal as being in direct contradiction to the Parliament's founding principles of access and participation and opposes any attempt to impose such a charge; believes that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB), in agreeing to recommend the imposition of such charges, has once again demonstrated its complete inability to take into account the views of the ordinary people of Scotland, and calls on the SPCB to be expanded to include elected representatives from civic Scotland to ensure that such views are at the heart of future decision-making on the governance of the people's parliament.
