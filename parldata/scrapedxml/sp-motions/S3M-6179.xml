*S3M-6179 Stuart McMillan: World Meningitis Day, 24 April 2010—That the Parliament welcomes the second annual World Meningitis Day; applauds the work of the Meningitis Research Foundation in creating awareness about meningitis and septicaemia and funding research in order to prevent these diseases and improve survival rates and outcomes; notes that meningitis and septicaemia affected 139 people in Scotland in the last year, 64 of whom were under the age of five; further notes that these diseases cause up to seven deaths per week in the United Kingdom and Ireland; recognises that, although there are vaccines that provide excellent protection against certain strains of meningitis, there is no vaccine that can prevent all forms of the disease; notes that there are approximately 1.1 million cases of bacterial meningitis worldwide and 265,000 deaths due to the disease, and therefore welcomes the Meningitis Research Foundation’s work to ensure that the symptoms of meningitis are widely recognised in order to prevent further meningitis and septicaemia-related deaths.
