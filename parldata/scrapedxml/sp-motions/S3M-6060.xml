*S3M-6060 Liam McArthur: Amnesty on Sheep EID Penalties—That the Parliament welcomes the call made by the European Parliament’s Agricultural Committee for an amnesty of three years on cross-compliance penalties relating to electronic identification (EID) of sheep and goats; notes that the committee made this call because this is a new and complex technology that will require some time for farmers to become accustomed to it and for the systems to be road tested; believes that such an amnesty would remove the current threat of high fines that Scottish farmers and crofters face as they struggle to cope with the technology, which many believe has been shown to be far from perfect by the current pilot, and calls on the Scottish Government to seek the agreement of the European Commission for the early introduction of such an amnesty in Scotland.
