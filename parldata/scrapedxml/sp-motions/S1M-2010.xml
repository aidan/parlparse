 *S1M-2010 Trish Godman: The Scottish Working People's History Society—That the Parliament commends the members of the Scottish Working People’s History Society for their admirable and determined work in unearthing and cataloguing the documentary and oral archival material relating to the struggles and sacrifices of generations of working women and men to live and participate fully in a tolerable society, but regrets the fact that such fine academic research is being carried out on a shoe-string budget and believes that societies such as this and the Scottish Labour History Society are eminently worthy of more adequate financial support.
