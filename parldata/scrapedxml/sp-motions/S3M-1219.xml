*S3M-1219 Jackie Baillie: Dumbarton Academy—That the Parliament acknowledges that, despite the SNP promising to match Labour’s school regeneration programme "brick for brick" in April 2007, the young people of Dumbarton have been denied a new much-needed school; believes that Dumbarton Academy should become the first priority for rebuilding in West Dunbartonshire, and calls on the Scottish Government to intervene with the local authority to ensure that a new Dumbarton Academy is built by the originally proposed date of Spring 2009 in order that the full curriculum can be delivered.
