*S2M-818 John Swinburne: Retrospective Graduate Tax-That the Parliament condemns, given the current uncertainty over the funding of higher education, the response by some alumni who expect today's higher education students to incur significant debt to pay for a privilege that they received at no direct cost to themselves, upfront or thereafter and who, in addition, received adequate financial assistance at the expense of the general taxpayer, and therefore believes it is incumbent on the Scottish Executive to ensure that any future review of higher education funding guarantees that everyone who has benefited from a university education contributes fairly to it through a retrospective but progressive graduate tax.
