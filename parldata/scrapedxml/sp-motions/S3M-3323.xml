 *S3M-3323 Ken Macintosh: Posthumous Honour for Jane Haining—That the Parliament pays tribute to the moving courage and sacrifice of Scottish missionary Jane Haining who, following the outbreak of the Second World War, ignored orders to return to Scotland from Budapest, refusing to leave the Jewish orphans in her care, and, as a result, was arrested by the Nazis and died in Auschwitz-Birkenau in July 1944; celebrates the example of moral courage that her actions set for young people today; recognises the honour bestowed on her by Yad Vashem, Israel’s Holocaust memorial authority, in naming her as Righteous Among the Nations, non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews from the Nazis, and supports the Holocaust Educational Trust, The Scotsman and others in calling for a posthumous honour for Jane Haining and other heroes of the Holocaust in recognition of their bravery and selflessness. Supported by: Rhona Brankin*, Charlie Gordon*, Bill Butler*, Ms Wendy Alexander*, Hugh Henry*
