*S2M-4141 Sarah Boyack: A Strategy for Older Volunteering—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of The Hidden Resource: A Strategy for Older Volunteering in Scotland by the Retired and Senior Volunteer Programme of Community Service Volunteers; notes that this initiative follows months of research into the benefits of volunteering by people aged 50 and over both to society as a whole and to the volunteers themselves and that it complements the Volunteering Strategy of the Scottish Executive; further notes the valuable contribution already made by older citizens in supporting local community organisations and individuals throughout Scotland, enriching the lives of people of all ages, and believes that Scotland’s ageing population provides great opportunities as well as challenges.
