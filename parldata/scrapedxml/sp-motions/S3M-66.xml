*S3M-66♦ Alex Neil: Youth Unemployment—That the Parliament expresses concern at the level of youth unemployment in Lanarkshire and elsewhere in Scotland; recognises the need to give priority to reducing the number of 16 to 19-year-olds who are not in education, employment or training; recognises that existing programmes and policies are not delivering sufficient opportunities for young people, and considers that an urgent review of the situation should be carried out with a view to further action being taken to address the position.
