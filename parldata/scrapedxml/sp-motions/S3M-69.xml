*S3M-69 Irene Oldfather: Early Years Education—That the Parliament acknowledges the importance of good quality early years education in a child’s social and academic development; is aware that in a modern Scotland the majority of parents are working parents and require assistance with childcare at the beginning and end of the school day; is proud of Scotland’s record post-devolution in providing access to affordable after-school facilities and wraparound care using a range of arts, music, sport and study support, as well as free nursery places for every three and four-year-old; considers this system to be one of the best in Europe; recognises that membership of the European Union allows us the opportunity to exchange ideas and examples of good practice with other member states and regions throughout the EU; is aware that the Committee of the Regions held an extraordinary meeting in Brussels on 8 May 2007, entitled "Putting children first: implementing the Barcelona targets at local, regional, and national levels", whereby representatives of education authorities from across Europe met to share experiences; welcomes the fact that two of Scotland’s representatives attended from North Ayrshire Council; is aware that North Ayrshire Council operates out-of-school services which are currently open to any child in the area and which consist of breakfast clubs for pre-school care and after-school care which involves a varied range of activities for the children, such as art, drama, games, music, sports, IT activities, environmental activities and circus skills, with healthy snacks and drinks also being provided; considers that this is a great working example of the success of the Scottish early years education system to date, and calls on the Scottish Executive to continue supporting Scottish parents by maintaining and extending funding for such services at this crucial stage in a child’s development.
