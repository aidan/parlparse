 *S3M-849 Jamie Hepburn: Non-Compliance with Minimum Wage Legislation—That the Parliament notes with concern figures released in the House of Commons Library Economic Indicators Bulletin showing that an estimated 41,000 workers in Scotland are earning less than the minimum wage; notes that this represents some 1.8% of the Scottish workforce and is the highest rate of non-compliance of any part of the United Kingdom; believes that this shameful statistic demonstrates an unwillingness or inability on the part of HM Treasury to fully enforce minimum wage legislation; calls for those employers not complying with minimum wage legislation to be dealt with to the fullest extent of the law, and further believes that these cases can only be effectively dealt with by the Scottish Parliament assuming full legislative and enforcement powers over employment rights and duties, currently reserved by the Scotland Act 1998.
