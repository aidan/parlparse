 *S1M-3474 Fiona McLeod: European Health and Safety at Work Week, 14-20 October 2002—That the Parliament welcomes the focus of this year’s European Health and Safety at Work Week on the prevention of psychosocial risks and the stress that they cause, given that nearly one in three of Europe’s workers report that they are affected by stress at work and that one in five workers in Scotland, an estimated half a million people, are exposed to work-related stress.Supported by: Robin Harper*
