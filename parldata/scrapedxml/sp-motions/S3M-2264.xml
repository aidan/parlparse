*S3M-2264 Bob Doris: North Glasgow Local Integration Network Cuts—That the Parliament notes with serious concern the decision taken by Glasgow Community Planning Partnership to slash funding for local integration services across North Glasgow for the next three years; believes that these cuts, which see funding fall from £305,796 in 2007-08 to £221,695 this year and reduced further to £95,550 in 2009-10, are swingeing, ill conceived and unnecessary and in a part of the city with the highest asylum-seeking and refugee population in the city; further believes that the partnership, chaired by Labour Councillor Jim Coleman, was wrong not to consult the Local Community Planning Partnership Boards for Maryhill/Kelvin and Canal, and Springburn and North East Glasgow on the impact of the loss of such funding, and shares the concern of local councillors Grant Thoms and Phil Greene that those projects that were funded by the local integration network are now at serious risk, that north Glasgow’s diverse local communities may suffer as a result, and that the Partnership should reconsider this decision as a matter of urgency.
