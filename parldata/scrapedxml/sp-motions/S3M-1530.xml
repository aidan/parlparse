 *S3M-1530 Patrick Harvie: NHS Occupational Health Services—That the Parliament notes with concern NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde’s decision to enter into negotiations with a private company with a view to contracting-out the provision of occupational health services for its own staff; further notes the anger of NHS occupational health therapists who would be forced to transfer their employment to the private sector, and questions whether such a move is the best way to achieving an effective and efficient service, given the risk of taking for granted the skills and dedication of health professionals and creating resentment among them.
