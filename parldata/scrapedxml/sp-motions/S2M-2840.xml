 * S2M-2840# Dr Jean Turner: Nurse Recruitment and Retention—That the Parliament acknowledges that, while some progress has been made in the recruitment of nursing staff in NHSScotland over recent years, the nursing workforce trend in Scotland is of continuing concern with growth at less than half that achieved in England over the period 1997 to 2004; recognises that there is a global nursing shortage and that in the United States of America, which is seeking to recruit an additional one million nurses over the next few years, nurse-patient ratios are increasingly viewed as the best way to both guarantee high standards of patient care and improve staff morale and retention, with the American Nurses’ Association leading a campaign in Congress for adequate and safe nursing numbers to be guaranteed in law; recognises that in a competitive world market Scotland has to ensure that it is offering the best possible incentives to recruit, retain and reward nurses, and believes that the Scottish Executive should examine options for legally guaranteeing safe nursing numbers in NHSScotland in order to help retain staff and ensure that patients know there will always be enough staff available to give them the standard of care that they require.
