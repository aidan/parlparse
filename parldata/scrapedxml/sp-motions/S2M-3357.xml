*S2M-3357 Michael Matheson: Campaign for a Scottish Olympic Team—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Campaign for a Scottish Olympic Team; notes that an overwhelming majority of Scots, 78%, would like to see Scotland send its own Olympic team to London in 2012 which would act as a catalyst to inspire many young Scottish athletes to represent their nation and pursue sporting excellence; recognises the fact that there is no technical reason why Scotland cannot have its own Olympic team, and calls on politicians from across the political spectrum to get behind the Scottish Olympic Team campaign. Supported by: Mr John Swinney*, Jim Mather*, Rob Gibson*, Mr Bruce McFee*, Linda Fabiani*
