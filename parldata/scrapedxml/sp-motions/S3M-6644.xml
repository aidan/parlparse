*S3M-6644 Bill Kidd: The UK Budget and the Future of Disability Living Allowance—That the Parliament expresses concern that the Chancellor of the Exchequer has stated in his budget speech that a new medical assessment for Disability Living Allowance (DLA) will be introduced from 2013 and will be applied to new and existing claimants; notes that this appears to be adopting a model similar to that of Employment and Support Allowance, and further expresses concern that this new test will be introduced with the express intention of reducing the number of people eligible for DLA rather than being based on the principle of fairness.
