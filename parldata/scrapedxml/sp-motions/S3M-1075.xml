*S3M-1075 John Lamont: Erwin Ureelâ€”That the Parliament recognises the efforts of Erwin Ureel, a native Belgian, who organised not only the erection of a new Scottish Memorial monument at Passchendaele to commemorate the sacrifice made by Scottish servicemen during the First World War but also the unveiling ceremony, almost single-handedly, and considers that his efforts should be recognised by all MSPs.
