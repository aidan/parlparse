*S3M-5621 Michael Matheson: Tennent’s Support for Minimum Price of Alcohol—That the Parliament welcomes the growing consensus in favour of the minimum pricing of alcohol, including the recent backing by Scotland’s largest brewer, Tennent’s; welcomes the comments by Mike Lees, Managing Director of Tennent Caledonian, who views minimum pricing as "part of an overall programme to reduce the abuses of alcohol"; realises that minimum pricing seeks to raise the price of inexpensive ciders, lagers and low-grade spirits that contribute to high levels of alcohol misuse, and understands that this targeting will ultimately benefit the people of Scotland.
