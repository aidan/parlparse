*S1M-3585 Ben Wallace: Armed Forces Personnel and Firefighting Duties-That the Parliament supports the brave young men and women of the armed forces in Scotland who are putting their lives at risk in order to cover the reckless and dangerous strike by Scottish firefighters; demands that the Scottish Executive immediately steps up concurrent training for armed forces personnel to allow them to use better firefighting equipment and, in addition, gives them access to basic protective clothing; believes that public safety and the safety of the armed forces personnel must come before trade union demands, and notes that the armed forces carry out these essential services ill-equipped and for considerably lower pay than firefighters and with no right to strike. Supported by: Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh*, Bill Aitken*, Phil Gallie*, John Young*, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton*, Mr Jamie McGrigor*, John Scott*, Mr David Davidson*
