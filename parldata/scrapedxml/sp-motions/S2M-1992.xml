*S2M-1992 Mr Brian Monteith: Hearts Memorial—That the Parliament welcomes the unveiling of a memorial in the French village of Contalmaison to Heart of Midlothian players killed during the Battle of the Somme; recognises the sacrifice that saw seven players, Duncan Currie, John Allan, Thomas Gracie, James Speedie, James Boyd, Ernest Ellis and Harry Wattie, never return and 11 other players wounded or gassed; further recognises that their patriotism and valour inspired many other players and supporters from other clubs to enlist; commends the work of Jack Alexander whose book, McCrae’s Battalion, directly led to the memorial being established, and welcomes the support of the Scottish Executive, the City of Edinburgh Council and other clubs such as Hibernian FC for this fitting tribute.
