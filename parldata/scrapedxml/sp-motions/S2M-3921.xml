 *S2M-3921# Euan Robson: Proposed Closure of Coldstream and Jedburgh Hospitals—That the Parliament notes the contents of NHS Borders’ consultation document, Getting Fit for the Future; believes that the preferred options for the closure of Coldstream and Jedburgh cottage hospitals manifestly do not command the confidence of the respective local communities; further believes that NHS Borders must take advantage of opportunities to redevelop both hospitals in conjunction with other statutory bodies, private providers and voluntary organisations in the spirit of Professor Kerr’s report, Building a Health Service Fit for the Future, and the Scottish Executive’s response to the report; congratulates the local action groups on their constructive approach to these issues, and believes that the Executive should reject closure and require redesign of the proposals to redevelop these locally delivered NHS services. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
