*S3M-5055 Bill Butler: Let’s Show Racists the Red Card—That the Parliament notes that 16 to 31 October 2009 marks Show Racism the Red Card’s annual Fortnight of Action; welcomes the fact that all 42 clubs playing at the professional level in Scotland were involved in a weekend of action on 24 and 25 October through on-pitch activities and that £10,000 in grants has been distributed to help 22 community-based initiatives organise a variety of events to promote tolerance; believes that Scottish football, both at club and international level, has benefited hugely from the participation of players born outside of Scotland; abhors the treatment of players who have been racially abused at grounds across Scotland, and unequivocally affirms that racism has no place in Scottish society. Supported by: Patricia Ferguson*, Robin Harper*, Robert Brown*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Rob Gibson*, Johann Lamont*, Malcolm Chisholm*, Mike Pringle*, Jackson Carlaw*, Claire Baker*, Andy Kerr*, Brian Adam*, Karen Whitefield*, Joe FitzPatrick*, James Kelly*, Jim Tolson*, Jamie McGrigor*, Des McNulty*, Bob Doris*, Cathy Peattie*, Marlyn Glen*, Mary Mulligan*, Bill Kidd*, Cathy Jamieson*, David Whitton*
