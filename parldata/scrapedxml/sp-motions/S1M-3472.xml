 *S1M-3472 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Use of the Holyrood Building as a Full Public Facilityâ€”That the Parliament believes that the new Parliament building should be a full public as well as parliamentary facility, giving priority to events held by diverse community groups, especially those unable to afford conference premises; considers that, as the building will have been custom-built for disabled access, it should be the premier meeting place in Scotland for those with disabilities as well as for community groups, including schools and theatre and performing arts clubs; further believes that it would be unacceptable for the building to be used only as the Parliament, especially in the light of cost rises, and that it should provide public facilities on every non-meeting day, including recesses, weekends and at night, and further considers that the cost of doing so would be minimal, given that security staff are present 365 days a year.
