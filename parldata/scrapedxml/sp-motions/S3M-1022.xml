 *S3M-1022# Jamie Hepburn: Save the Children Report, "Robbing Peter to Pay Paul"—That the Parliament welcomes the publication by Save the Children of Robbing Peter to Pay Paul, an assessment of how limited access to affordable credit hurts families and children living in poverty, many of whom live in Central Scotland; notes the findings of this assessment that amongst those in poverty 42% have been seriously behind with repaying bills or credit commitments in the past year, compared with just 4% of those not in poverty, while 36% of low-income credit card users have been exposed to penalty charges; further notes that nearly 60% of low-income families have no savings and that many of those in poverty are using doorstep lenders who charge a typical 183% interest each year; notes that the assessment finds that the impact on families unable to source affordable credit is severe, with large numbers reporting an inability to make even modest savings or replace worn-out furniture or send children on school trips; further notes that the findings also conclude that the social impact of this poverty is severe, with significant numbers reporting ill effects on physical and mental health and relationships between partners and with children; commends Save the Children for its work in this area; commits itself to the eradication of poverty and improving access to affordable credit for all of Scotland’s citizens, and believes that serious active consideration should be given to the recommendations made by Save the Children for tackling these problems, as set out in Robbing Peter to Pay Paul.
