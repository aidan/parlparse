*S2M-910 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Smoking and Fertility-That the Parliament congratulates the British Medical Association (BMA) on its most recent report, Smoking and reproductive life - the impact of smoking on sexual, reproductive and child health; notes with concern the fact that women who smoke are three times more likely to have children with low birth weight and that smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage, stillbirth and death of the newborn; takes cognisance of the fact that over a quarter of Scottish mothers smoke during pregnancy; asks the Scottish Executive to take on board the remarks made by Dr John Garner, chairman of the BMA Scottish Council, on the fact that the Scottish Executive's target to reduce smoking has not changed despite the release of its recent Tobacco Action Plan, and, in light of these comments, urges the Scottish Executive to set much more ambitious targets for the reduction of smoking in this group.
