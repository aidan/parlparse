 *S3M-5949 Jim Hume: Save Knox Academy Cadet Forceâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the plans to close the Combined Cadet Force (CCF) at Knox Academy in Haddington, the only CCF remaining in a state secondary school in Scotland; recognises that the CCF offers cadets a huge range of opportunities and experiences, which they might otherwise not be able to access; further recognises that the CCF plays an important role in giving young people confidence and life and leaderships skills, and calls urgently on all stakeholders, including the Ministry of Defence, East Lothian Council and the headteacher of Knox Academy, to enter into constructive discussions with a view to ensuring the continuation of this vital and proud, 200-year tradition of the CCF at the school.
