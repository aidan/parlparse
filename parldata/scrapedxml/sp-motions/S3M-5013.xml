 *S3M-5013 Patrick Harvie: Doubt over Future of Hunterston Coal-fired Power Stationâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that Dong Energy has withdrawn from the plan to build a new coal-fired power station at Hunterston; regards unabated coal as the most damaging and unacceptable energy source and opposes any expansion of it in Scotland; calls on Peel Energy, the remaining company involved in the Hunterston plan, to drop the project altogether, and calls on the Scottish Government to commit to investing in slashing energy demand instead of permitting the expansion of unsustainable and polluting energy technologies that belong in the dustbin of history.
