*S3M-6999# Mike Rumbles: Armed Service Advice Project (ASAP)—That the Parliament thanks and honours all those who have served in the armed forces; welcomes the new Armed Services Advice Project (ASAP) as the focal point for providing advice, information and support to members of the armed services community in Scotland and their dependents; congratulates Citizens Advice Scotland for agreeing to deliver the service through its existing outlets in the north east and across Scotland and a new national telephone helpline; thanks all of the organisations that have contributed to the project’s £600,000 in funding, including Poppyscotland, the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund, the Maritime Charities Funding Group, ABF The Soldiers Charity, the Soldiers, Sailors and Airmen Association Forces Help, the Robertson Trust and Turn2us, and hopes that both current and former personnel of the armed services in Scotland will find ASAP useful in alleviating the particular pressures that they face in reintegrating into civilian society.
