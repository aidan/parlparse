*S1M-3916 Nicola Sturgeon: Proposed Closure of Glasgow City Centre Social Security Office-That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal to close Glasgow City Social Security Office, currently located in Pitt Street, and replace it with a debt call centre responsible for the recovery of benefit overpayments; further notes that to date there has been no consultation with staff or users of this office; is concerned that the closure of the only social security office in Glasgow city centre will result in increased travel for the 6,000 claimants who rely on it for benefits advice and over-the-counter payments, and calls on the management of Job Centre Plus and the Department for Work and Pensions to reconsider these plans.
