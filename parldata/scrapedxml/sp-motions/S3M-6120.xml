 *S3M-6120 Liam McArthur: Fly the Flag on St Magnus Day—That the Parliament notes that 16 April 2010 is St Magnus Day, the day when Orcadians remember the martyrdom of St Magnus, after whom St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall, considered one of Scotland’s finest ecclesiastical buildings, is named; welcomes the practice that has developed in Orkney of celebrating St Magnus Day by flying the Orkney flag, a flag that symbolises the islands’ Scottish and Norwegian heritage with the red and yellow from the Scottish and Norwegian royal coats of arms and the blue from the Scottish saltire and from the sea around the islands, and calls on all Orcadians, and others with Orkney connections, to fly the flag on St Magnus Day, wherever in the world they are to be found. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
