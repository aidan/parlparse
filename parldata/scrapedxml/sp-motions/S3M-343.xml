*S3M-343 Hugh O’Donnell: NL Kidz—That the Parliament recognises the success of the first NL Kidz event which promoted personal safety, health and security to almost 4,000 young people across North Lanarkshire in Strathclyde Country Park earlier this year, a partnership event delivered through the North Lanarkshire Community Safety Partnership; congratulates the project on the publication of its first report, the NL Kidz annual report, which was published during July and shows that many of these young people are retaining the vital messages delivered through NL Kidz, and looks forward to the continuing success of the project in coming years.
