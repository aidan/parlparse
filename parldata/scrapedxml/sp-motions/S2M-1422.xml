 *S2M-1422 Rosie Kane: Withdrawal of British Troops from Iraq-That the Parliament believes all British troops should be withdrawn from Iraq as soon as practically possible; believes the decision to invade Iraq was based on lies, deceit and distortion and that George W Bush and Tony Blair are guilty of wilful deception in relation to weapons of mass destruction, Iraqi links to Al-Qa'ida and Iraq posing an imminent "45-minute" danger to British interests; believes that the invasion of Iraq was illegal under international law and the continued presence of coalition troops represents an illegal occupation of a sovereign country; believes that the United Nations was wrong to support the bombing of Afghanistan and that its regrettable inability to prevent the invasion of Iraq exposes its inherent weakness in relation to US domination of our world by legal or illegal means; supports world aid agency efforts to help rebuild Iraq's infrastructure free from a US-imposed constitution of privatisation and to divert resources to the Red Cross, Red Crescent and Médicins Sans Frontières, and reiterates its belief that peace across the Middle East will only be possible when Israel withdraws from its illegal occupation of Palestinian territories and a viable Palestinian state is allowed to exist.
