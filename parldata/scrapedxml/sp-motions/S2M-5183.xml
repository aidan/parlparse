 *S2M-5183 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Congratulations to James Simpson and the Scottish Drugs Forum for the Success of the Addiction Workers Training Project—That the Parliament congratulates James Simpson for his achievement in being named as the nation’s Champion Learner of the Year 2006 and further congratulates the Scottish Drugs Forum on the success of its ground-breaking addiction workers training project; recognises that this course was set up to help overcome the barriers to employment that former users face because of their drug history while preparing them for work in the field; notes that students learn about topics such as models of addiction, record-keeping, confidentiality issues and calming and supporting people and are able to take up placements at various different drug support agencies; acknowledges that measures to tackle drug problems will only be most effective when drug users are offered a route out of their problems through jobs, education and training, and applauds James Simpson for facing up to, and overcoming, his problems and the Scottish Drugs Forum for giving him a route out of his addiction.
