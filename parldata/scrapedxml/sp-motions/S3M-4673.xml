 S3M-4673 Robin Harper: Same as You, Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability—That the Parliament notes the contents of the research published by the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability, Adults with Learning Disabilities Implementation of "The Same As You?", published on 10 August 2009; notes in particular that adults with learning disabilities now have access to a wider range of day opportunities, that full-time attendance at a day centre has declined from 37% in 2003 to 12% in 2008, that 16% has used a Local Area Co-ordinator to help them become more involved in their community but that only 18% are in paid employment and that one in five aged 35 and over still live with a family carer; congratulates, however, local authorities on the progress that they have made so far, while noting that it is essential that efforts continue to ensure that people with learning disabilities benefit from government policies to promote independent living, and calls on the Government to continue to support and assist in the extension of the scope of support presently in place for those with learning disabilities.
