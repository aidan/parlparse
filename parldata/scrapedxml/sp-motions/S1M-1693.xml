 *S1M-1693# Mr Alex Salmond: Future of Fishing Industry—That the Parliament notes the decision by Scottish fishing boats to tie-up in port as an attempt to stop the slaughter of juvenile haddock and whiting; recognises that the Cod Recovery Plan in closed fishing areas has forced the fleet into fishing grounds which are teeming with juvenile fish which when caught must be discarded dead back into the sea; further notes that the future of the fishing industry depends on the survival of these juvenile fish; deplores the fact that working fishermen, with mortgages and financial commitments to meet, now apparently care more for the conservation of fish stocks than the Scottish Executive or Her Majesty's Government, and seeks the immediate introduction by the Scottish Executive of a compensation lay-up scheme to allow the industry to move through this difficult period and secure a future for the white fish fisheries.
