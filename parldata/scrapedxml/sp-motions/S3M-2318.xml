 *S3M-2318 Bill Kidd: Carers Allowance, Minimum Income Standard and Earnings Rule—That the Parliament expresses its concern that the Carers’ Allowance of £50.55 per week falls far short of the minimum income standard of £158 per week for a single working-age adult recommended in the Joseph Rowntree Foundation research report, A minimum income standard for Britain: What people think, and represents less than one-third of what is considered to be a socially-acceptable standard of living; expresses further concern that the carers’ allowance is not paid at all to anyone earning only £95 or above per week, and notes that these are issues that need to be reformed in the near term.
