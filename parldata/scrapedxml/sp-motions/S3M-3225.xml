S3M-3225 Liam McArthur: Less Favoured Area Support Scheme Payments—That the Parliament regrets the failure of the SNP government to ensure that Less Favoured Area Support Scheme (LFASS) payments were made before the end of 2008, which the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment undertook to work flat out to do in a parliamentary debate on 18 September 2008 (Official Report c. 10921); believes that the early payment of LFASS and the single farm payment in a single calendar year would ease cash-flow problems and allow Scotland’s hard-pressed farmers and crofters to be able to plan ahead with confidence; further believes that if the correct verification measures are put in place there is no reason why payments of both LFASS and the single farm payment cannot be achieved in a single calendar year, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary to make an early announcement on how he plans to resolve this issue and what steps he is taking, in discussion with the National Farmers Union of Scotland (NFUS), to ensure that the next round of single farm payments and LFASS payments can be made in 2009.
