 *S3M-8217 Bill Wilson: Hypercapitalism and the Demon Drug Myth—That the Parliament welcomes what it sees as the considerable evidence put in the public domain by Canadian academic Bruce K Alexander in his book, The Globalization of Addiction, A Study in Poverty of the Spirit, which examines the causation of overwhelming addiction, argues that there is no such thing as a demon drug, that individuals are not largely responsible for their own addictions and that the vast majority of addictive behaviours can be attributed to psychosocial dislocation caused by what Professor Alexander describes as hypercapitalism; considers that Professor Alexander’s work substantially complements that of Professors Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett on what is considered to be the devastating effects of inequality caused by the predominant economic system, and also complements the contents of a recent report on the opinions of non-governmental organisations and public bodies on alternatives to gross domestic product, The Emperor Has No Clothes; welcomes the suggestions made by Professor Alexander for taming capitalism and promoting psychosocial integration, and agrees with him that only by doing these things can society effectively reduce harmful addictive behaviours.
