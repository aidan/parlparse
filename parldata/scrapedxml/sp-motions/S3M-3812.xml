*S3M-3812 John Lamont: Knighthood for Bill McLaren—That the Parliament supports the campaign calling for Bill McLaren, whom most fans would consider to be the voice of rugby, to be knighted; notes that, during a radio and television broadcasting career that stretched over four decades, he came to be regarded as one of the great sports commentators by rugby fans from across the globe; fondly remembers his particular brand of colourful commentating, which included phrases such as describing a player as being like a demented ferret up a drainpipe; further notes his immense contribution to Scottish rugby as a teacher and rugby coach in his native Hawick, and suspects that there will be dancing in the streets of Hawick and indeed many other communities around the world should this campaign prove successful. Supported by: Jackson Carlaw*, Stewart Maxwell*, Mike Pringle*, Bill Aitken*, Jamie McGrigor*, Jim Hume*, Tavish Scott*, Mary Scanlon*, Ted Brocklebank*, Elizabeth Smith*, Nanette Milne*, Murdo Fraser*, Alasdair Allan*
