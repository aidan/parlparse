*S3M-2734 Robert Brown: Girlguiding UK - Girls Plus Action Equals Changeâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Girlguiding UK on its Changing the World project; notes that 18 charities have teamed up with Girlguiding UK to offer members of the organisation support and suggestions to raise awareness, money or take direct action to make the world a better place; further notes that, as guiding nears its centenary in 2010, over 4,000 girls in Scotland and 50,000 across the United Kingdom are on waiting lists to join this great organisation and that, without the commitment of its leaders and volunteers, many girls and young women would not have the opportunity to enjoy guiding by making new friends, having fun, being challenged by new experiences, thinking for themselves and working as part of a team, and wishes the 3,460 members in Glasgow all success in making a difference in society today.
