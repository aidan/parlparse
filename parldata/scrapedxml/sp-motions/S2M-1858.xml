*S2M-1858 Jackie Baillie: Direct Payments—That the Parliament congratulates those local authorities that actively promote direct payments for people in their area; notes that, since 1 June 2003, local authorities have had a statutory duty to provide direct payments; believes that the use of direct payments can encourage choice and independence, provide flexibility to respond to changing needs and enable tailor-made packages of care to be put in place; acknowledges the positive policy framework established by the Scottish Executive but recognises, however, that there are sometimes substantial differences in approach and implementation from one local authority to the next, and therefore calls on the Executive to encourage and monitor the uptake of direct payments.
