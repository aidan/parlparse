 *S2M-4947 Colin Fox: Strike by Passport Workersâ€”That the Parliament supports the 24-hour strike by Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) members at passport offices across Britain, including the one in Glasgow, on Friday 13 October, in pursuit of a 4.4% wage claim; regrets both the unfortunate disruption that will caused to the general public and that the action is necessary, but believes the union is entitled to feel aggrieved that some two months after the agreed settlement date for the pay negotiations no offer has yet been made, and believes that this effective pay freeze is part of a wider attack on the public sector where workers pay and conditions and pension rights are being diminished and that continuous privatisation eats away at the quality of service to the public.
