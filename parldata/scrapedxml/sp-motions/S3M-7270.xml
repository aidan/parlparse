*S3M-7270 Jamie Stone: Banning Bisphenol A—That the Parliament is concerned that numerous studies and evaluations published in peer-reviewed medical journals have raised consistent and compelling concerns about the potential health risks of exposure to bisphenol A (BPA); understands that BPA has been found to leak from the plastic used in many baby feeding bottles, especially when the bottles are heated or are scratched through continual usage; notes that baby bottles containing the chemical can still be sold in the United Kingdom despite being withdrawn in Canada, Denmark and some American states; further notes Japan’s canning and bottling industry’s successful voluntary use-reduction of BPA and Canada’s recent decision to classify BPA as a toxic substance; expresses support for the No More BPA campaign led by Breast Cancer UK, and urges the Scottish Government to introduce regulations to end the use of BPA, particularly in baby bottles.
