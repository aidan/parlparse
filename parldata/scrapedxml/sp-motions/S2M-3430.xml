 *S2M-3430 Carolyn Leckie: Solidarity with British Columbian Teachers—That the Parliament sends solidarity greetings to all members of the British Columbia Teachers’ Federation who are currently pursuing industrial action against their employer, the British Columbian Provincial Government; is appalled that their employer legislated away their right to negotiate their due pay settlement and subsequently deemed their legitimate strike action illegal; recognises that over 90% of 40,000 teachers voted for strike action, knowing it was technically illegal; commends their courageous stand; welcomes the solidarity of other workers which saw over 100,000 out in support of the teachers and against the British Columbian Government’s cuts in education and other public services; believes that the actions of the British Columbian Government undermine the province’s international reputation which is regrettable in the run-up to its hosting of the 2010 Winter Olympics, and hopes that the British Columbian Government agrees to negotiate and put forward a resolution to this dispute acceptable to the teachers. Supported by: Frances Curran*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*
