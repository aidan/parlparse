 *S3M-6098 Gil Paterson: Opening of the Robert the Bruce Heritage Centre, Rentonâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the Strathleven Artizans on the opening of the Robert the Bruce Heritage Centre in the old railway station in Renton; praises its efforts to promote historical links in Strathleven toward King Robert the Bruce and King David II and hopes that the new centre will further these aims and raise the awareness of the general public to take an interest in these important historical times, and further welcomes the adopt-a-station policy set up by ScotRail, which ensures that non-operational stations are not left to wrack and ruin but can continue to play a part in local communities.
