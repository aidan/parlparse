*S3M-704 John Park: Accessible Public Transport For Allâ€”That the Parliament recognises the importance of accessible public transport to communities across Scotland; expresses concern that many private bus operators do not undertake adequate consultation with communities on changes to local bus services; notes that only one bus operator in Scotland is local authority owned, with all others provided by private sector operators; believes that regulated public transport systems are better for the communities that they serve; further believes that transport services should be run for public need, not private profit, and calls on the Scottish Executive to commit to investment in the Scottish bus network and to move towards the re-regulation of bus services in Scotland.
