 *S2M-627.1 Tommy Sheridan: Progress in Respect of Fuel Poverty in Scotland-As an amendment to motion (S2M-627) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "endorses" to "programmes" and insert "notes that in 2002 the Scottish Executive adopted a definition of fuel poverty as being expenditure of more than 10% of household income on all household fuel use, where household income included housing benefit and income support for mortgage interest; notes that Energy Action Scotland recommended that the Executive should adopt a measure of calculating household income, excluding housing benefit and income support for mortgage interest; notes that Energy Action Scotland estimated that 200,000 households would be re-classified out of fuel poverty as a result of the definition adopted by the Executive; notes that in the first six months of 2003, 10 times as many Scottish gas and electricity customers were disconnected as in the whole of 2001; asks for improvements to the Executive's Warm Deal programme to ensure that more vulnerable households become eligible for assistance and that an appeals system is adopted which does not deter low income households from challenging the decisions of the private contractors, Eaga Partnership Ltd."
