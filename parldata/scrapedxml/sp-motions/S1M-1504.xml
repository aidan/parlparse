*S1M-1504 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Recognition of the Work in Clearing Snow—That the Parliament thanks profoundly the "true grit" workers of Scotland who battled against the blizzards to keep the country running; acknowledges that these workers, many of whom were from local authorities and were in dispute recently over poor pay and conditions, turned out in the public interest and performed a heroic task; moreover, believes that that the gritting crews and snow shovellers everywhere proved that the "the breakdown of civilisation as we know it" would not occur if the grand and titled or politicians ceased to exist, but that civilisation would breakdown in days without the dedicated work and public spirit of manual workers, whose recent labours showed the fallacy of over concentration on high technology; notes that it was not IT but the human hand and brain which beat the weather, and furthermore, not only formally thanks these workers for their contribution but believes that they should be financially rewarded as Scottish business would have lost millions more had people of courage and stamina not come to the country’s rescue.
