*S3M-650 Bashir Ahmad: Show Racism the Red Card - A Fortnight of Action—That the Parliament looks forward to Show Racism the Red Card’s fortnight of action which commences on Tuesday 16 October 2007; congratulates Show Racism the Red Card Scotland for four years of hard work in trying to drive out racism, not just from football but also wider society; notes that one of the best ways to do this is to cultivate role models in our community to come forward with a strong anti-racism message, and continues to pledge its support to such a noble campaign.
