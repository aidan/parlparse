*S3M-7519.2 Jim Mather: The Scottish Economyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-7519) in the name of Jeremy Purvis, leave out from "reform" to end and insert "build sustainable economic recovery; notes the work already undertaken by the Scottish Government on reforming the Enterprise networks and decluttering the delivery landscape, reducing duplication and driving up effectiveness and efficiency; further notes the ongoing Inquiry by the Economy, Enterprise and Tourism Committee on the Enterprise Network and the contribution it is making, and calls on the Scottish Government to consider its conclusions."
