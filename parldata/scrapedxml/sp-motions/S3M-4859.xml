*S3M-4859 Rob Gibson: Supporting Scotland’s Hydrogen Future—That the Parliament welcomes the first hydrogen corridor in the United Kingdom, with the Royal Mail Group, CIFAL Findhorn, members of the Scottish Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Association and others joining forces to create one of the most ambitious hydrogen transport programmes in the world; notes that the Scottish Hydrogen Corridor will run from Aberdeen to Inverness via Findhorn, employing a diversity of renewable energy solutions in different locations, with hydrogen refuelling stations placed at strategic locations along the route to service a range of users, including public transport providers, local authority vehicles, Royal Mail vans and, ultimately, private car users all dedicated to reaching CO2 reduction goals through sustainable mobility and other initiatives; notes the recent letter of understanding addressed to oil and energy companies, government organisations and NOW GmbH, signed by top executives from Daimler, Ford, GM/Opel, Honda, Hyundai/KIA, the Renault-Nissan Alliance and Toyota, committing each company to the cooperative development and market introduction of fuel cell vehicles and an eventual competitive network of commercialised fuel cell vehicles from 2015 onwards; further commends Royal Mail, CENEX, PostEurop and Fuel Cell Europe for joining forces to accelerate development of hydrogen fuel cell postal vans and opening the design brief to all other European postal operators for input in order to stimulate mainstream construction at affordable prices; welcomes delegates to Scotland’s Hydrogen Future Conference, organised by CIFAL Findhorn, UNITAR and many other partners in cooperation with the Scottish Government, taking place at Victoria Quay, Edinburgh, on 15 and 16 September 2009, and praises their commitment to extending the role that hydrogen can play in creating a sustainable economy for Scotland.
