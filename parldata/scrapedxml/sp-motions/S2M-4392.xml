*S2M-4392 John Swinburne: Senior Citizens’ Rebate for Water and Sewerage Rates—That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to review the practice of charging senior citizens, who are in receipt of full pension credit, for water and sewerage rates; notes that water and sewerage rates are currently 5.2% of the full state pension, and considers it sensible to exempt pensioners from paying for water and sewerage rates if they are in receipt of council tax benefit.
