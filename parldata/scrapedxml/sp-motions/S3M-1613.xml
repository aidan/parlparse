 *S3M-1613 Irene Oldfather: Parliamentary Launch of Designing Lighting for People with Dementia—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Designing Lighting for People with Dementia, a new pamphlet which demonstrates how appropriate use of lighting can significantly help people with dementia to understand their environment; acknowledges the importance of research into dementia which can provide improved levels of support and treatment for suffers and allow carers to better manage the condition; congratulates those involved, including the Dementia Services Development Centre at the University of Stirling, the Institute of Lighting Engineers and Vision Call, on the collaborative work which allowed the launch to take place in the Parliament on 20 March 2008, and agrees that studies such as this will help to ensure that Scotland is prepared for the estimated increase in the number of people with dementia over the course of the next 30 years.
