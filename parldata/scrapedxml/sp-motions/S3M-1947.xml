*S3M-1947 Patricia Ferguson: Land Rights of Indigenous Peoples—That the Parliament notes the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples adopted in September 2007 and acknowledges that indigenous people have suffered many historic injustices and continue to be among the poorest and most marginalised peoples of the world; believes that these injustices will be brought to an end and their poverty alleviated only if the land rights of indigenous people are recognised and respected, and further believes that a major step forward in achieving this is the International Labour Organisation’s Convention 169 concerning tribal and indigenous peoples, which puts these rights on a firm legal footing.
