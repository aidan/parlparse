*S3M-7252 Margaret Mitchell: Dyslexia Awareness Week 2010—That the Parliament notes that Dyslexia Awareness Week, now in its 20th year, is scheduled to take place from 1 to 7 November 2010 and that this year’s theme is hidden dyslexia; understands that one in 10 people are thought to be dyslexic in some manner and that this equates to half a million people in Scotland; acknowledges the importance of the early recognition of dyslexia and believes that this should be followed up by appropriate teaching and support at school, in the workplace and at home to ensure that people with dyslexia are not isolated; believes that there is a link between those with unidentified or unsupported dyslexia and offending, mental health issues and unemployment, and hopes that Dyslexia Awareness Week will highlight the issue and help more people recognise and understand dyslexia.
