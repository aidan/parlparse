*S3M-5035 Christine Grahame: Plugged in Safely?—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of a campaign by the Electrical Safety Council, the United Kingdom’s only charity dedicated to electrical safety, to increase awareness of the dangers of purchasing unsafe goods via the internet and, in particular, welcomes the charity’s independent safety testing that has established that 100% of chargers bought from a range of online auction sites and retailers would not pass current UK safety standards and could cause a real danger to Scottish consumers if simply plugged in as intended.
