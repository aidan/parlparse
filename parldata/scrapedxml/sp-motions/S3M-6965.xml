*S3M-6965 Robin Harper: Creative Scotland—That the Parliament notes that the full board of Creative Scotland has yet to meet and believes that this has led to a remarkable degree of uncertainty about that organisation’s function; further believes that this uncertainty has not been allayed by the reported statement made by Creative Scotland’s chief executive, Andrew Dixon, that the organisation is not a funding body in the sense of the former Scottish Arts Council; is concerned that Creative Scotland spent £35,000 on a logo without being certain of what the badging represented; further notes the opinion of Kenneth Roy that the arts, considered a central part of Scotland’s national life, are being surrendered to inexcusable chaos, and urges the Scottish Government to meet representatives of Creative Scotland as soon as possible and demand sight of its strategic plan and mission statement within a reasonable timescale and for Creative Scotland to undertake minimum expenditure on offices, staff and equipment until such time as its function can be fully defined.
