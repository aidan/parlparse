*S2M-4812# Ms Sandra White: Pensioners’ Call for Link of Pensions to Earnings—That the Parliament congratulates the West of Scotland Seniors Forum (WSSF) and the Scottish Pensioners’ Forum (SPF) on their co-ordinated campaign across the country to oppose the Labour Government in stating that it cannot afford to raise the state pension or link it to earnings before 2012; agrees with the WSSF and SPF’s contention that this provides no immediate benefit for pensioners and that one million Scottish pensioners say the government is wrong, and believes that a citizens’ pension, linked to growth in earnings and funded by scrapping the present government refund to the highest-rated taxpayers on their private pension funds, should be introduced. Supported by: Donald Gorrie*, Rob Gibson*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Richard Lochhead*, Alex Neil*, John Swinburne*
