 *S3M-2575 Hugh O’Donnell: FSA Ban on Short Selling—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Financial Services Authority (FSA) to suspend the practice of short selling by traders in the financial markets; believes, however, that this practice should be banned on a permanent basis and that the temporary ban will not resolve the damage that the practice does to the viability of financially-sound companies, and is firmly of the view that both the FSA and Westminster Government should extend the ban permanently.
