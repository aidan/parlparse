 *S2M-230 Pauline McNeill: Child Injury Prevention-That the Parliament notes the extent of accidents causing injury to children and figures recorded at Yorkhill Children's Hospital in 2001 which show that 70% of injuries happen whilst playing; further notes that many such accidents are preventable; applauds the work of Dr NV Doraiswamy, accident and emergency consultant at Yorkhill Children's Hospital, and the Health Promotion Office of Greater Glasgow NHS Board on the Finger Tips safety leaflet, which highlights fingers as being amongst the most mobile parts of a child's body and, as such, vulnerable to being crushed or jammed, sometimes resulting in amputation; believes that the use of simple devices, including doorstoppers or specially insulated doorframes, can prevent such injuries in the home, in schools and in public buildings, and recognises that the Children's Hospital Injury Reporting and Prevention Programme, known as CHIRPP, can assist in raising awareness about the extent and type of accidents or injuries amongst children so that forms of prevention may be identified.
