 *S3M-4302.1 Lewis Macdonald: Cross-party Opposition to UK Government Budget Cuts—As an amendment to motion (S3M-4302) in the name of Maureen Watt, leave out from "Aberdeen City Council" to end and insert "the leader and depute leader of Aberdeen City Council in a letter dated 29 May 2009 to Aberdeen MPs and MSPs about the impact of the UK Government’s budget; notes that this letter fails to recognise the responsibility of Scottish ministers for central government funding of local government services in Scotland; commends the cross-party support that has emerged in Aberdeen calling for the Scottish Government to play its part in ensuring that the city council receives its fair share of public funding, and considers that the citizens of Aberdeen would be better served if councillors of all parties worked together to demand that the First Minister keeps his promise not to leave Aberdeen in the lurch as a result of the council’s continuing financial crisis." Supported by: John Park*, Hugh Henry*, Des McNulty*, Richard Baker*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Elaine Murray*, Jackie Baillie*, Marilyn Livingstone*
