*S3M-2741 Kenneth Gibson: People Living with Epidermolysis Bullosaâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the work of the charity, DebRA, that helps people living with epidermolysis bullosa (EB) to live the best quality of life possible; understands that EB is the name of a group of genetic disorders that causes blistering and shearing of the skin by the smallest amount of friction; is saddened that around 1 in 17,000 live births in the United Kingdom will be an infant with a form of EB; notes the good work of DebRA as the main funder in the UK of specialist EB treatment and research facilities, and further notes that DebRA provides travelling nurses to visit children and adults living with EB, while also providing respite holiday accommodation for families living with the disease.
