 *S3M-1133 Patrick Harvie: TheyWorkForYou.com—That the Parliament recognises the value of the work done by mySociety.org, a charitable project which aims to build websites that give people simple, tangible benefits in the civic and community aspects of their lives and to teach the public and voluntary sectors how to most efficiently use the internet; in particular notes the importance of website TheyWorkForYou.com, which provides accurate and up-to-date information about the work of elected politicians, enabling members of the public to identify and contact their representatives more easily and to track their work; welcomes the news that a Scottish Parliament service will be added to the site shortly, and wishes the site’s publishers well in their efforts to raise funds for this non-profit-making venture.
