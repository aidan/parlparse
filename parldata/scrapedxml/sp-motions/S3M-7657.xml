*S3M-7657 Robert Brown: Closure of Noranside Open Prison—That the Parliament is concerned by the proposal by the Scottish Prison Service to close HMP Noranside, part of the open estate; notes that the open estate population has decreased by 47% since 2007; is concerned that only 36% of long-term prisoners released in 2008-09 spent time in the open estate before full release and that this percentage has decreased in each year since 2006-07; agrees with the comment in Scotland’s Choice: Report of the Scottish Prisons Commission that Scotland "needs a well-run open estate because it is not in the public interest to release long-term prisoners from closed institutions without preparing them for release and training them for freedom"; believes that open prison plays an important function by providing a supported progression back into the community and that it is an integral part of the rehabilitation process, key for reducing reoffending and making Scotland’s communities safer; further believes that open prison is necessary for the re-integration of serious offenders, as stated in the report, Balancing Risk and Need; further agrees with the former Chief Inspector of Prisons, Dr Andrew R C McLellan, when he said "It will require courage to maintain open prisons which are not full in a time of unprecedented overcrowding: but it is courage which will serve the public good"; welcomes the support of John Swinney MSP who has stated that he intends "to put forward a vigorous case to retain the prison as part of the open estate"; is disappointed that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice did not bring this important decision to the Parliament, and calls on the Scottish Government to come before the Parliament and explain why it is proposing to close what is considered an integral part of Scotland’s prison system.
