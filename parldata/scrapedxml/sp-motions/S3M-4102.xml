*S3M-4102 Robin Harper: The Sullivan Report on Low Carbon Building Standards—That the Parliament notes the work of the Scottish Ecological Design Association (SEDA) over the last two decades; congratulates SEDA on its recent conference on Brettstaple Massive Wood Construction; in particular congratulates Howard Liddell and Gaia Architects on the opening of Acharacle Primary School in the Highland region, built using Brettstaple technology and certain to be the most energy-efficient primary school in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Government to respond formally to the recommendations set out in the Sullivan report, A Low Carbon Building Standards Strategy for Scotland, and to publish a roadmap to zero carbon new buildings in Scotland at the earliest opportunity.
