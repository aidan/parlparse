 S3M-5329 Elaine Smith: Working towards a Shared Futureâ€”That the Parliament notes the publication of the report, "Sectarianism" and the Workplace, by the STUC, which found evidence that sectarianism persists in the Scottish workplace; believes that the report highlights the enduring prevalence of sectarian attitudes in Scotland; acknowledges the importance of challenging attitudes early on by engaging with young people to ensure that they enter the workplace with a better understanding of the issue of sectarianism in Scotland; welcomes projects such as the Community Youth Rugby Initiative in the Coatbridge area, supported by Sense Over Sectarianism, which seeks to challenge sectarianism through rugby by engaging children from seven local secondary schools in composite school teams; notes that the initiative also includes a structured programme that seeks to impact on religious intolerance and racism and recognise and respect diversity within the community; further notes that the initiative currently has 300 participants, with numbers expected to double within a year; commends work by the summer holiday project for primary seven pupils from Coatbridge and Airdrie delivered by Albion Rovers Football Club, Strathclyde Police, beCogent and Sense Over Sectarianism that sought to challenge attitudes among primary school-age children; recognises the potential impact that projects targeted at primary and secondary pupils could have in shaping societal attitudes in the future, thus eroding the persistence of sectarianism in the workplace in the long term; realises that Scotland still faces a number of complex challenges in highlighting sectarianism in communities and workplaces, and considers that these challenges are best met via a vigorous, zero-tolerance approach from the Scottish Government and other relevant stakeholders.
