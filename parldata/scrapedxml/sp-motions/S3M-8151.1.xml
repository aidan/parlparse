*S3M-8151.1 Jamie Hepburn: Parliament Questions Behaviour of Minister—As an amendment to motion (S3M-8151) in the name of Helen Eadie, leave out from "that the Minister for Housing and Communities" to end and insert "at what it sees as the use by the Labour Party of misleading, false and inaccurate information about the funding of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust (CRT) and related matters; notes that the Scottish Government has awarded every penny that the CRT requested for its 2011-12 funding, some £1.6 million; considers that the SNP administration has invested an unprecedented sum of nearly £30 million in former mining communities through the Town Centre Regeneration Fund and other funding streams in recent years; deplores the Tony Blair/Gordon Brown-led Labour government’s use of court action against the National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS) in relation to the entitlement of former miners to compensation for various types of lung disease, which it considers resulted in nearly 2,000 Scottish miners dying before they could receive compensation; also deplores what it sees as the silence of Labour politicians on this matter and their presumed acquiescence on this line of action; further notes the dozens of pits that closed while Labour was in government, and calls on Labour MSPs to apologise to the former mining communities for their behaviour in this matter."
