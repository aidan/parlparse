*S3M-4399 Dr Richard Simpson: Patients in Gaza—That the Parliament notes the report in the British Medical Journal on 8 May 2009, "Gaza patients "forced" to help security services in exchange for Israeli medical treatment", based on reports from Physicians for Human Rights-Israel (PHR-I); notes that, according to PHR-I, 428 patients were interrogated by Shin Bet between January 2008 and March 2009, including minors in need of medical care, and, while recognising the right of Israel to ensure its security, supports the calls by Hadas Ziv, director of PHR-I, to end any use of patients, especially interrogation of minors, for the purpose of intelligence gathering and to ensure that any questioning for security purposes results in the least possible delay to patients getting medical treatment.
