 *S3M-6958 Robin Harper: Crossing Guards Cuts Proposals—That the Parliament notes the proposal by Edinburgh City Council to remove 76 lollipop people in order to save £300,000; believes that it is grossly unfair to target low-paid workers and that the savings could be made more fairly elsewhere; is concerned that the proposal contradicts the recently welcomed efforts to make the roads safer for pupils, parents and drivers alike, and is of the view that the withdrawal of the extra security provided by lollipop crossing guards might also discourage children and their parents from walking to school, and that this would be would be a regrettable development.
