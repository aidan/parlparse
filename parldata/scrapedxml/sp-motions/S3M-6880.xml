*S3M-6880 Jamie Hepburn: Vigil to highlight Freedom of Religion and Imprisonment of Bahá’ís in Iran—That the Parliament sends its support to the organisers of a vigil, to be held in St Mungo Museum in Cathedral Square, Glasgow, on Saturday 28 August 2010 from 3 pm until 10 pm, to highlight freedom of religion in Iran and the plight of seven prominent Bahá’ís, who were this month sentenced to 20 years imprisonment by the Iranian authorities; agrees with the comments of Foreign Secretary William Hague that the sentencing is "a shocking example of the Iranian state’s continued discrimination against the Bahá’ís"; believes that people across Scotland should show their support for the vigil as a means of showing solidarity with the Bahá’í community and their commitment to the right of freedom of religious expression, and joins Foreign Secretary William Hague’s in calling on the Iranian authorities to consider any appeal against this sentencing of these seven individuals and to immediately cease discrimination against the Bahá’í community.
