*S2M-5486 Tommy Sheridan: Congratulations to Labour Councillor on Airgun Initiative—That the Parliament applauds Aberdeen Labour Councillor, Norman Collie, on his initiative to bring forward a motion to use bye-law powers to ban the sale and use of air guns in Aberdeen and believes that this initiative should be supported and replicated by Scotland’s other local authorities as it accords with the wishes of the Scottish population, 82% of whom support an air gun ban according to the recent System 3 opinion poll commissioned by Tommy Sheridan in support of his Bill proposal to ban air guns.
