*S3M-3442 Christina McKelvie: Rape as a Weapon—That the Parliament condemns the use of rape as a weapon; notes that the rape capital of the world is the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo where in some areas three-quarters of women have been raped; further notes that in Darfur raped women are scarred or branded or have their ears cut off and that this is often done by police officers or soldiers, in uniform, as part of a coordinated government policy, and calls on HM Government to condemn violence against women, to work to highlight this abhorrent use of force in conflicts around the world and do everything that it can to prevent the systematic use of rape as a weapon.
