*S3M-4161 Bill Kidd: UN Watchdog Warns of Nuclear Proliferation—That the Parliament notes with concern comments made by Dr Mohamed El Baradei, the outgoing director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the United Nations’ nuclear watchdog, that the number of potential nuclear weapons states could more than double in a few years; agrees with Dr El Baradei that the greatest existential threat facing the world today is the acquisition of nuclear weapons by a terrorist group, especially considering that 200 cases of illicit trafficking of nuclear material are reported to the IAEA every year; further agrees that nuclear proliferation on an unprecedented scale can only be avoided in the future if major nuclear powers fulfil their Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations and disarm as rapidly as possible, and believes that the abandonment of Trident by the UK Government would be an apposite beginning to global nuclear disarmament.
