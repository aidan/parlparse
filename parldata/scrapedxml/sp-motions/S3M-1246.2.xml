*S3M-1246.2 Alison McInnes: Accessible Passenger Transport and the National Concessionary Fares Scheme—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1246) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end "recognises the valuable contribution that Demand Responsive Transport (DRT) can make to social inclusion and accessibility, particularly in rural areas and for disabled and elderly passengers; notes with concern that the Scottish Government’s budget has caused uncertainty over the future of DRT provision; considers that expansion of DRT is an essential aspect of improving accessibility in Scotland, and therefore calls on ministers to end the uncertainty and develop DRT services in Scotland."
