*S2M-2189 Murdo Fraser: International Year of the Family Resolution and Doha Declaration—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the UN General Assembly to agree, by consensus, Resolution 59/111, "Celebrating the 10th Anniversary of the International Year of the Family", which notes the outcome of the Doha process; notes that the Doha process includes the important Doha Declaration which had the support of over 149 countries from around the world; further notes that the Doha Declaration reaffirms the central importance of the institution of the family, as set out in Article 16(3) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), as "the natural and fundamental group unit of society"; calls on all nations to "uphold, preserve and defend the institution of marriage"; recognises that the declaration and accompanying resolution represent a significant victory for those seeking to strengthen and support the institution of the family in the international community; regrets that the European Union, Norway, Canada, Australia and New Zealand were unable to wholeheartedly welcome this declaration, in spite of the fact that it does no more than reiterate the commitments of foundation documents of the United Nations, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and calls on both the Scottish Executive and the UK Government to support the Doha Declaration wholeheartedly.
