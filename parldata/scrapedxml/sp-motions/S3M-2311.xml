*S3M-2311 Jackson Carlaw: East Renfrewshire Council’s Proposals for Braidbar Quarry, Huntly Park and Lower Huntly—That the Parliament notes with concern the predicament of East Renfrewshire homeowners whose properties are blighted by their proximity to the disused Braidbar Quarry; further notes the growing fear amongst the local community that East Renfrewshire Council’s current proposal to shore up the ground adjacent to these properties may lead to much-loved green spaces Huntly Park and Lower Huntly being substantially compromised and that the associated development of new housing will inevitably place an additional demand on local amenities that are already widely regarded as being overstretched, and calls on East Renfrewshire Council to investigate an alternative proposal that meets both the needs of affected homeowners and the concerns of the wider Braidbar residential community by guaranteeing that Huntly Park and Lower Huntly are not only preserved but enhanced by any development and that additional demands on local amenities and infrastructures resulting from any new houses are met with sufficient investment and redevelopment to meet that demand.
