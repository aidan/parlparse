*S3M-2270 Stuart McMillan: Air Weapon Ban—That the Parliament recognises the motion supported unanimously by East Dunbartonshire Council in its decision to support the Scottish Government’s call to ban air weapon ownership, other than for recognised and legitimate occupational and sporting interests; further notes the council’s concerns at the ease with which air weapons can be purchased legally throughout Scotland, and commends East Dunbartonshire Council’s action of writing to all other councils in Scotland urging them to support the call to ban ownership and use of air weapons.
