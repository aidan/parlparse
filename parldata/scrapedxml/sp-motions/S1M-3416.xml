*S1M-3416# Shona Robison: Licensing Scheme for Fireworks—That the Parliament agrees with the view of the Association of Chief Police Officers Scotland in calling for the tightening up of legislation relating to the sale and use of fireworks; notes that the association specifically refers to a need for sellers to be stringently vetted in order to ensure that applicants for a certificate to sell fireworks are of good character and should be required to show "need" before being granted a certificate; believes that the best way of achieving this is through the introduction of a licensing scheme for vendors of fireworks, and considers that the Scottish Executive should, as part of the current review of licensing powers under the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982, consider extending licensing powers to include firework vendors.
