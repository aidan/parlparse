*S2M-5262 Frances Curran: Congratulations to President Chavez on his Re-Election—That the Parliament congratulates Hugo Chavez on his re-election as President of Venezuela with a majority, over 60%, of votes on a high turnout; believes that this is a massive vote of confidence by the Venezuelan electors in President Chavez and his "Bolivarian revolution" which consists of a wide-ranging programme of social reforms in health, education and community welfare projects, financed by the revenues from the country’s state-owned oil resources; believes that this result demonstrates the empowerment of communities, women and indigenous populations through the political course steered by President Chavez and vindicates the strategy of building a bulwark of popular regimes, such as Cuba, Bolivia, Ecuador and Nicaragua, on the Latin American continent which now have socialist or left-leaning governments, and hopes that these regimes will build a powerful force for revolutionary change there and send a signal to the US administration that its interference is not welcome in Latin America.
