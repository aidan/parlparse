*S3M-219 Bill Kidd: Strengthening Communities—That the Parliament extends its continuing support to the shared campus and twinning initiatives between denominational and non-denominational schools set up under the previous administration with the intention of breaking down real and perceived barriers and of giving young people the opportunity to build friendships and better understand each others’ backgrounds; agrees with the comments of Cardinal Keith O’Brien in encouraging all Catholic schools to renew their efforts to build effective partnerships with their school neighbours for the benefit of all young people and of Scottish society at large, and firmly believes that further work to actively promote such initiatives should be undertaken. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Rob Gibson*, Gil Paterson*, Kenneth Gibson*, Sandra White*, Christine Grahame*
