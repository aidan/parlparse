*S2M-883 Mr Brian Monteith: Police Recruitment in Forth Valley-That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the three local authorities of Clackmannanshire, Falkirk and Stirling that form the Central Scotland Police Board to provide the chief constable with the funds to recruit an additional 70 police officers over the next year and believes that this will be a welcome boost to combating crime and anti-social behaviour in Forth Valley.
