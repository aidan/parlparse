*S2M-5157 Christine Grahame: Vexatious Exemptions Under Freedom of Information Legislation—That the Parliament notes the increasing pattern of failure of public bodies in Scotland to respond timeously to requests for information under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 and increasingly to use vexatious and inappropriate exemptions in response to requests; further notes that appeals from individuals must be dealt with more swiftly, and therefore urges the Scottish government to lead by example so that all public bodies uphold the spirit of the Act and respond positively to its provisions in order that they are truly open, accountable for their actions and transparent.
