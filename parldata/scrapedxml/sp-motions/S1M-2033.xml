 *S1M-2033# Christine Grahame: Very Sheltered Housing—That the Parliament notes that the answer to question S1W-16178 by Jackie Baillie on 14 June 2001 stated that there were, for the year 1999-2000, 1672 very sheltered houses for older people in the social rented sector; further notes that based on the latest research available the requirement for very sheltered accommodation for older people is 23 dwellings per 1000 of the older population; acknowledges that Age Concern estimates a requirement in the order of 18,055 such dwellings, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should immediately commission a report to confirm very sheltered housing requirements and undertake that the report will be published within the next parliamentary year.
