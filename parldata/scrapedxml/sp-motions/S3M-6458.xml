 *S3M-6458 Duncan McNeil: Bursary Cuts at James Watt Collegeâ€”That the Parliament recognises the importance of further education colleges such as James Watt College in Greenock; welcomes the opportunities that such institutions provide to people from all backgrounds to learn new skills and better themselves; acknowledges that many students would be unable to undertake their studies without financial support through bursaries; is disappointed that James Watt College will be able to pay only 50% of its bursary instalment to students in June 2010 due to a lack of funds and that this will affect 2,471 students, and believes that it is time to examine the method of calculating bursary allocations to better reflect the changing profile of further education students and the increased demand for funding support.
