 *S1M-3088# Tommy Sheridan: Distribution of Grants to Local Authorities-That the Parliament believes that the current system of distributing government grants to local authorities needs to be radically overhauled in order to take account more accurately of poverty and deprivation in each local authority area; believes that the city of Glasgow in particular has been neglected by the Scottish Executive in relation to local government financial settlements because the current system fails to take greater account of the real poverty and deprivation that exists in Glasgow; further believes that, in a number of areas, the current distribution system could be greatly improved in order to recognise the additional needs and costs that arise from providing local government services in an area suffering from high levels of poverty and deprivation; notes that only 1.5% of the total grant available for education services is set aside to provide additional services to "deprived pupils", despite the fact that there is a huge difference between the attainment levels of children from deprived backgrounds compared to those from more affluent backgrounds and that the levels of pupils staying on to S5 and the levels of pupils who enter full-time education are heavily influenced by the pupils' socio-economic background; believes that, in order to address this imbalance, a greater proportion of available grants needs to be made available to provide the additional support required by pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds; further notes that too little recognition is given to the fact that social work is one of the main services greatly affected by levels of deprivation in the Glasgow City Council area and that, while some attempt is made to take account of deprivation, the current distribution system is totally inadequate; recognises that, while it is widely accepted that the vast majority of children who require social work support are from deprived and disadvantaged backgrounds, only 14.5% of the funding for community and residential care services for children is allocated on the basis of indicators that take account of deprivation, the remainder of the resources being allocated on the basis of the total number of children under the age of 16 in each council area; further believes, however, that given that the vast majority of children do not require the support of social work services, it is absolutely perverse and unacceptable that over 85% of the resources are distributed on the basis of the size of this "non-using population" and that it is therefore imperative that the distribution of resources in accordance with the number of children living in poverty, rather than the child population at large, is implemented; further recognises that the system has failed in relation to social work services for disabled people where the only indicator used in the current system to allocate resources to local authorities is the size of the total population aged between 16 and 64 years of age, despite the fact that it is widely accepted that poverty has an impact on the health of individuals and also on their ability to fund service provision, i.e. that, while more affluent persons may be able to afford care from a private provider, this option is not available to persons from a deprived background who are wholly reliant on the services provided by local authorities; further notes that this treatment contrasts sharply with the distribution mechanism introduced by Arbuthnott for distributing resources to health boards for persons with a disability; notes that the above examples, only covering three areas of service provision, clearly illustrate that the grant distribution system is seriously deficient in respect of taking account of the impact that deprivation has on the need for and cost of providing local authority services, and recognises the need for a radical overhaul of the distribution system in order to reflect much more accurately social deprivation in each local authority area.
