*S3M-4370 Alasdair Allan: Non-EEA Fishermen in Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament urges the UK Government to seek a reasonable and sustainable solution to address the current concerns of fishermen from outwith the European Economic Area working within the 12-mile limit in Scottish waters; recognises the contribution that these fishermen make to the wider fishing industry, particularly on the west coast, and calls on the UK Government to take a more measured approach that takes more account of their circumstances while protecting the rights of all fishermen.
