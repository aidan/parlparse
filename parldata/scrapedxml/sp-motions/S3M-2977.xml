*S3M-2977 Christina McKelvie: Remembering the Holocaustâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the funding from the Scottish Government for school pupils to travel to Auschwitz and the agreement between the Scottish Government, the Holocaust Educational Trust and COSLA to organise that travel; notes that this is the first time that a Scottish administration has provided funding directly to this project, and hopes that each new generation in Scotland renews the collective memory of the World War II Holocaust and commits to ensuring that it can never be repeated.
