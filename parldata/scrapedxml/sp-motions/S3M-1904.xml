 *S3M-1904 Alasdair Allan: Coca Cola Schools 7s Football Competition—That the Parliament welcomes the Coca Cola schools 7s football competition and congratulates all teams taking part; believes that sport in schools should be open to all, regardless of race or religion; is therefore deeply concerned that Sgoil a’ Bhac in Lewis, who are due to play in the national final of this competition later this month, are in a situation where they may have to withdraw from the game for religious reasons because the final is, unlike in previous years, being held on a Sunday and the organisers say they are unable to be flexible, and calls on the organisers of the tournament to avert a situation in which a team in the final would be disqualified simply because of the religious traditions of the families from which they come.
