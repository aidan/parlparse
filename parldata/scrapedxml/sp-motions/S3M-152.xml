*S3M-152# Bill Butler: World Refugee Day 2007—That the Parliament notes that Wednesday 20 June 2007 is the United Nations designated World Refugee Day when thousands of organisations in dozens of countries will come together to focus global attention, not only on the plight of refugees and the causes of their exile, but also on their determination, their will to survive and the contribution that they make to their host communities; acknowledges that Scotland has long offered support, understanding and sanctuary to those fleeing persecution; applauds the lead taken by Glasgow City Council in welcoming refugees and asylum seekers to Scotland and hopes that other local authorities will follow this positive example, and welcomes the programme of over 100 Refugee Week events across Scotland which aim to challenge ignorance, fear and negative stereotypes and highlight the benefits that refugees bring to their new communities in Scotland.
