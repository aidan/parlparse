*S3M-78# Sandra White: Glasgow Chinese School 35th Anniversary—That the Parliament congratulates the Glasgow Chinese School on its 35th anniversary; notes that the school was established in 1972 with the aims of teaching Chinese language and promoting cultural understanding and racial harmony and that it has, since its inception, served as a great beacon for multiculturalism in Glasgow and has helped to improve cultural understanding and tackle racial prejudice, and believes that the positive message of the school is one which gives the Chinese community the chance to explore its culture, while at the same time allowing others to share this experience, and that it is a wonderful asset for Glasgow and a great example for communities throughout Scotland.
