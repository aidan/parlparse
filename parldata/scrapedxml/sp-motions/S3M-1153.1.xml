*S3M-1153.1 Bill Aitken: Firearms—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1153) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from "action" to end and insert "laws regarding firearms control should be regularly reviewed but notes that firearms legislation is reserved to Westminster; notes also with regret that the great majority of weapons used in gun crime are held illegally in breach of the existing law; acknowledges that the most effective way of making Scotland’s communities safer is more effective enforcement of the existing law, and calls on the Scottish Government to support an increase in police resources to improve enforcement of current firearms legislation."
