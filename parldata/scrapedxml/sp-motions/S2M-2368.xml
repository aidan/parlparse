*S2M-2368 Carolyn Leckie: Neo-Nazi at St Andrews—That the Parliament notes that it is barely one week from the commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz; believes that it is an insult to the memories of the millions who died in the Holocaust that Nick Griffin, a man proud to stand in the tradition of Hitler and the Nazis, has been invited to speak at St Andrews University debating society; condemns the unfeeling contempt for the victims of the Holocaust displayed by those who extended an invitation to this contemptible extremist, and considers that all MSPs should apply as much pressure as possible to halt this visit and obstruct it by all means possible.
