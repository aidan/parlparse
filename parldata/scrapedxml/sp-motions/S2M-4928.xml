 *S2M-4928 Mrs Nanette Milne: Gordon Highlanders Museum—That the Parliament congratulates the Gordon Highlanders Museum, Aberdeen, on its recent refurbishment, which included the complete re-design and re-interpretation of the museum’s main gallery and the design and build of a new education facility, that actively tells the story of the history of one of the most famous regiments in the British Army and the real life experiences, courage and determination of the men of the north east of Scotland and beyond; notes the museum’s active involvement with the local community, with over 160 volunteers helping to maintain the museum on a day-to-day basis, and further notes that museums across Scotland provide an invaluable asset to the local and wider community in keeping heroic stories alive today, as well as providing a pivotal local community meeting point.
