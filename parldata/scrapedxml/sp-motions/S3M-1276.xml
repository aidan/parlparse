 *S3M-1276# Bill Kidd: Borderline Homelessness Charity—That the Parliament applauds the great work done by the Borderline charity in supporting homeless Scots in London, which despite having only five staff members has helped many homeless Scots in London to find accommodation, return to Scotland, begin work or training and support them in the many other difficulties facing those who find themselves on the streets, and hopes that as we approach Poverty Action Sunday, the culmination of Poverty Action and Homelessness Week 2008, everyone will take the opportunity to reflect on the plight of the poor and homeless in Scotland and help work towards a fairer and more prosperous Scotland.
