 *S2M-3038 Bruce Crawford: Zimbabwe—That the Parliament urges the Scottish Executive to make urgent representations to Her Majesty’s Government in respect of the Zimbabwean Government’s policy of "Murambatsvina" which is causing unnecessary displacement, starvation, misery and death to tens of thousands of the Zimbabwean population; calls on Her Majesty’s Government to suspend the possible deportation of the 116 Zimbabwean asylum seekers, currently held in the United Kingdom, until the internal crisis in Zimbabwe stabilises, and, to that end, supports the intervention of the United Nations and eagerly awaits the report of the UN’s Special Envoy, Anna Tibaijuka. Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Alex Neil*, Shiona Baird*, Rob Gibson*
