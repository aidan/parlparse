*S2M-5344 Margaret Mitchell: Safe Zones—That the Parliament commends Strathclyde Police for its decision to repeat the Safe Zone initiative in Motherwell and Wishaw and elsewhere over Christmas and New Year; notes that the initiative has in the past helped cut alcohol-related violence; further notes that these zones, which are located in car parks near nightclubs and are well-lit and covered by CCTV, help to make town centres safer by ensuring that people out late for the evening do not need to wander the streets in search of a taxi; acknowledges the benefits of the initiative as part of a safety and violence-reduction strategy which will include high-visibility police patrols on the streets during the day and night; urges the Scottish Executive to continue to highlight the potential danger of consuming an excessive amount of alcohol and the sense of ensuring that travel arrangements to return home after a night out are made in advance, and encourages other police forces to create similar zones in town centres for people planning to celebrate over the festive period.
