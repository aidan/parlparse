 * S2M-2298.1 Christine Grahame:Older People—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2298) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from second “recognises” to end and insert “for example, as role models, carers and volunteers; recognises the progress that has been made through policies such as free personal care, the central heating programme and the commitment to national free bus travel by 2006; considers, however, that the state pension is inadequate for a basic living standard and requires to be supplemented by the means-tested pension credit which some 30% of pensioners fail to claim; notes that one in five pensioners live in poverty, with some 70% in council tax poverty, and that excess winter mortality rates are three times higher in Scotland than in Germany and Sweden, and asserts that, without an increase in the powers of the Parliament to deliver a citizen’s pension providing a decent standard of living which will bring security, dignity, independence and choice, improvements to the lives of Scotland’s elderly can only be at the margins.”
