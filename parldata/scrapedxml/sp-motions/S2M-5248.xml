*S2M-5248 Tommy Sheridan: Celebrating the Life of John MacLean - The Fighting Dominie—That the Parliament notes that 30 November 2006 is the 83rd anniversary of the death of John MacLean, who died at the age of 44 in 1923; recognises that during his lifetime John MacLean was a world-recognised Scottish socialist who fought rent rises, supported workers striking for better pay and provided courageous opposition to the cruel carnage that was the First World War; notes also that he fought for a world of fairness and justice and that MacLean’s brand of socialism is as much required today for ordinary workers as it was in his lifetime; also notes that, in MacLean’s native Scotland in 2006, 20% of individuals live on less than £5,000 per annum and 21% of households survive on less than £10,000; believes also that MacLean would have led the anti-war campaign against the carnage in Iraq and Afghanistan, and calls for 30 November to be partly dedicated to the celebration of the life of one our greatest sons, the great John MacLean, the fighting dominie.
