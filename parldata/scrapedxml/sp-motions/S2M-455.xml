 *S2M-455# John Swinburne: Pension Credit—That the Parliament notes the introduction of Pension Credit a new means-tested benefit for senior citizens; recognises the cost of implementing another mean-tested benefit and the complicated and demeaning process of applying for this benefit for senior citizens; agrees that a decent state pension is a right for our senior citizens and should not have to be supplemented with means-tested benefits, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should urge Her Majesty’s Government to deliver on Gordon Brown’s pledge nine years ago to abolish means-testing and introduce a state pension which provides all senior citizens with a reasonable quality of life, with the link to earnings restored to provide a greater economic stability to those senior citizens.
