 *S3M-6905 Kenneth Gibson: The Withdrawal of Mixtard 30 (Biphasic Isophane Insulin)—That the Parliament notes with regret the decision made by the Danish drug company Novo Nordisk to withdraw its only conventional human biphasic insulin, Mixtard 30 from the United Kingdom; notes that this decision will affect up to 90,000 patients, including 9,000 in Scotland; is aware that alternative biphasic analogue insulins are more expensive, leading to expected increased prescribing costs of £1 million in Scotland alone, excluding the additional resources required to review patients to discuss and decide on alternative treatments and the disruption and concern that it believes these changes might cause affected individuals; acknowledges that this decision means that biphasic insulin will no longer be available in the ergonomic InnoLet device and believes that this will leave many users with poor eyesight or reduced manual dexterity dependent on others for their insulin administration; further believes that the withdrawal of this medicine will have a major impact on patients, health care professionals and health care expenditure; considers that there is no evidence that biphasic analogue insulins have any advantage over conventional human biphasic insulins in terms of efficacy, long-term outcomes or safety; notes that, following protests, Novo Nordisk have continued to allow Mixtard 30 to be administered in Germany by way of a FlexPen, and urges the Scottish Government to protest directly to Novo Nordisk about this withdrawal and to engage the company with a view to ensuring that Mixtard 30 is not withdrawn from the Scottish and wider UK markets.
