 *S3M-988 Hugh O’Donnell: Our Vote Our Voice Launch—That the Parliament congratulates Outside the Box Development Support on the launch of its online election voting pack for adults with learning difficulties; recognises that people with such difficulties have as much right to accessible information on matters that affect their lives as other members of Scotland’s communities; welcomes the contribution that people with learning difficulties made to the production of the pack, and believes that the election pack should inform and influence the planning of elections by those who have responsibility for doing so, such as returning officers and the Electoral Commission, to ensure the maximum participation in elections by all eligible voters.
