*S2M-1318# Mike Pringle: Hospital Catering-That the Parliament notes the Channel 4 "Dispatches" programme of 13 May 2004 and the revelations of the appalling standards and conditions that exist in the Tillery Valley Foods factory which produces food for Scottish hospitals, in particular the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, and believes that the Minister for Health and Community Care should carry out an urgent inquiry into the facts and, in the short term, suspend the contract and make alternative arrangements for the patients in the Royal Infirmary to receive a better standard of service.
