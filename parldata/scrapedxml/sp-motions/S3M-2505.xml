 *S3M-2505 Sarah Boyack: Supporting Our Renewables Industry—That the Parliament applauds the Scottish renewable energy industry for its contribution to the national economy and to combating climate change; welcomes the publication of Scottish Hydropower Resource Study, commissioned by the Forum for Renewable Energy Development in Scotland (FREDS) Hydro Group and carried out by Nick Forrest Associates, detailing opportunities for new sites to take advantage of Scotland’s untapped hydroelectric potential; congratulates the engineers on the successful completion of the Glendoe Hydro Scheme and commencement of filling, and calls on the Scottish Government to give serious consideration to amending the terms of its tender for electricity supply in such a way as to reinstate a requirement for 100% of the electricity to come from renewable sources, including hydroelectric power, thereby supporting our renewables industry as was the case in the last three contracts put in place by the previous administration.
