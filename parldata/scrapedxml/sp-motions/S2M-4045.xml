*S2M-4045 Christine Grahame: Southern Reporter 150th Anniversary—That the Parliament congratulates the Southern Reporter, based in Selkirk, serving the central and western Borders and for many years under the stewardship of the Smail family, on its 150th anniversary; notes its lead in recent years on such issues as education overspend, Miss X, saving the regiments, particularly the King’s Own Scottish Borderers, and of course, under the headline "The Final Betrayal", exposing the closure of factories in Selkirk by US asset-strippers, Viasystems, who, having helped themselves to £24 million of public funds, after one year threw 1,200 Borderers on the scrap heap, and wishes the publication continued success, along with other Borders’ newspapers, in reflecting and campaigning on issues at the core of Borders life.
