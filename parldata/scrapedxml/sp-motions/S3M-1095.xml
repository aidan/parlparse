*S3M-1095 Kenneth Gibson: Portencross Castle—That the Parliament congratulates the Friends of Portencross Castle (FOPC), North Ayrshire, for their hard work, persistence and dedication in restoring this fine 14th century edifice; notes the strong historic connections between the Stewart monarchs and Portencross Castle, where a charter to bring the Western Isles, Mull and much of the west coast into the Scottish realm was signed in 1372; is aware that a ship of the Spanish Armada was wrecked off the castle in 1588; recognises that, although Portencross Castle was abandoned in the 17th century, it remains a remarkably intact, if neglected, medieval building of national, historic significance; commends the FOPC for securing the title to Portencross Castle in 2005 after seven years of painstaking work and negotiation along with a £50,000 grant from British Nuclear Fuels; congratulates the FOPC on obtaining a £510,000 grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund and acknowledges that an application to Historic Scotland for £400,000 has also been accepted, and believes that, by raising £55,000 themselves and continuing their fundraising efforts, the FOPC have proven their sustained commitment to renovating Portencross Castle and establishing a publicly oriented trust that will allow people to access and enjoy the beauty of Portencross Castle in perpetuity.
