S3M-3215*#* Irene Oldfather: People with Dementia in Accident and Emergency - Recognising Their Needs—That the Parliament notes the launch of the report, People with Dementia in NHS Accident and Emergency- Recognising Their Needs, by the Cross Party Group on Alzheimer’s; is concerned that evidence suggests that while an estimated 70% of elderly people attending accident and emergency will show some sign of having mental health problems including dementia, less than 10% of problems are identified by admitting doctors; notes evidence which suggests that the average length of stay for an older person with dementia in accident and emergency is between three and seven hours and that readmission for this vulnerable group is likely to result in high levels of functional decline; further notes that mortality rates for patients with dementia admitted to hospital are higher than for other elderly people with some studies suggesting that as many as 30% of such patients die within six months and more than 10% are readmitted and may be placed in institutional care as a consequence; recognises the report’s recommendation that where clinically possible there should be a presumption against admission for patients with dementia and that specialist community-based care, including consultant support and diagnostic testing, is desirable; welcomes as a starting point the decision by NHS Ayrshire and Arran to appoint a mental health liaison nurse to lead the development of protocols, policies and guidelines relevant to patients with dementia, and believes that it is important that people with dementia are given appropriate and timely treatment that respects their dignity and independence.
