*S2M-4668 Donald Gorrie: Sales Promotions of Alcoholâ€”That the Parliament is concerned at the effect which the very low prices charged by some supermarkets for alcohol in some of their recent sales promotions are likely to have in increasing the level of alcohol abuse and especially of binge drinking and under-age drinking and believes that the Scottish Executive and licensing boards should encourage supermarkets to end their sales promotions of alcohol and agree with them arrangements to remove the incentive for customers to buy larger quantities of alcohol than their normal consumption because of very low prices.
