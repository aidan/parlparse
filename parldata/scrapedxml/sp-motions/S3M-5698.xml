*S3M-5698 Rob Gibson: Celebrating Global Non-genetically Modified Crop Successesâ€”That the Parliament welcomes a lengthening list of non-genetically modified seeds and crops that are being grown successfully around the world and that include allergen-free peanuts, striga-resistant cowpeas, salt and drought-resistant wheat, corn, maize and rice, beta-carotene rich sweet potatoes, virus-resistant cassavas and blight-resistant potatoes; recalls that the evidence of increased yields, environmental security and consistent results has never been proven for GM varieties; anticipates that non-GM plant varieties will continue to promote biodiversity, security of production in both subsistence and commercial farming; believes that these non-GM seeds and plants deserve far wider publicity and understanding, and congratulates scientists who are adding to the success of non-GM varieties across the globe.
