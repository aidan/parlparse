*S2M-5386.1 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Education with specific reference to Skills Academiesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-5386) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from "along the lines" to end and insert "in an education setting that offers a broad and balanced curriculum and equality of opportunity for all; believes that in order for all our young people to reach their full potential it is essential that class sizes be reduced to no more than 20 and, for composite and practical classes, to no more than 15, and further believes that segregation of pupils is inappropriate and that the proposals for skills academies are a diversion which will narrow opportunities rather than broadening them."
