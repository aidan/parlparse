*S3M-4041♦ Anne McLaughlin: Time to End Sri Lankan War, Time for Humanitarian Concerns to Take a Priority—That the Parliament welcomes the fact that the United Nations, European Union and other international institutions are calling for an immediate ceasefire in Sri Lanka between government forces and the Tamil Tigers; considers it vital that humanitarian assistance is able to reach the hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians who are suffering as a result of the conflict without adequate shelter, food and medicine; recognises that the Tamil community in Scotland, the vast majority of whom live in Glasgow, are desperately worried about relatives in the conflict zone with whom contact is restricted if existent at all; supports the international community in doing more to put pressure on both sides in the conflict to lay down arms and create humanitarian corridors for safe passage of aid; considers that the vast majority of people of Sri Lanka do not want this war, and believes that, after 26 years of brutal conflict and more than 70,000 deaths, it is now time for the voices of those people to be heard and for them to be able to live in peace.
