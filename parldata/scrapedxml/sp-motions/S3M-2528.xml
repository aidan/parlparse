*S3M-2528 Sandra White: Police and Firefighters’ Pensions—That the Parliament welcomes the commitment of the Scottish Government to provide over £32 million this year to meet the extra cost of revised pension commutation arrangements for police officers and firefighters despite the refusal of the UK Treasury to meet its obligations under the terms of the Barnett Formula; notes with concern that the previous Labour-Liberal administration was made aware of these issues yet appears to have taken no action to plan for the consequences of the Home Office’s decision, and urges all parties in the Scottish Parliament to work together to ensure that HM Treasury provides the necessary extra funding for firefighters and police officers in Scotland as it has for England and Wales. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Stuart McMillan*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Brian Adam*, Alex Neil*, Christina McKelvie*, Jamie Hepburn*, Bob Doris*
