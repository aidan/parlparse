*S1M-327.2 Mr Keith Harding: The Plight of Scotland's Pensioners—As an amendment to motion (S1M-327) in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from "recognises" to end and insert: "regards care and concern for Scotland’s elderly as a major priority; recognises that the measures necessary to achieve this must include a reversal of Her Majesty's Government’s decision to tax pension funds, which will cut retirement incomes, healthcare provision without fear of discrimination on the grounds of age and the introduction of an integrated concessionary fares system enabling the elderly to maintain contact with friends and family on an affordable basis; further recognises that the transfer of council housing stock would enable better housing provision to be made for the elderly, particularly those in need of sheltered accommodation, and that the rising crime rate has resulted in an increased number of elderly people, particularly those living alone, being afraid for their personal safety and the security of their homes, and undertakes to take the appropriate steps to provide reassurance and improve the quality of life for our elderly population."
