*S2M-1621 Richard Baker: Agenda for Change—That the Parliament notes that Agenda for Change, the biggest ever modernisation of pay and conditions in the NHS, is due to be rolled out from 1 December this year; believes that, as part of NHS pay modernisation, Agenda for Change is integral to service modernisation in the NHS; further believes that the recent agreement to defer changes to unsocial hours payments is a welcome pragmatic step and that it is important to acknowledge the need for ongoing testing and work on some areas of the package, but also accepts that there is no "plan B" and that everyone involved with its implementation must continue to work together in true partnership to make it a success, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that it provides the resources needed to implement Agenda for Change in Scotland successfully and that NHS boards deliver it locally.
