*S3M-110 Liam McArthur: Village Halls—That the Parliament recognises the importance of village halls in rural areas, such as Orkney and Shetland, where they play a vital part in community life, providing a venue for activities for the whole community, young and old; further recognises that village halls depend for their survival on the support of volunteers who give up many hours of their time to support their local halls; believes that these volunteers deserve improved support and so backs the SCVO petition which calls on the Scottish Executive to create a Scottish halls fund to refurbish or modernise community buildings in order to increase the level of community use and improve the range and quality of services provided, to fund a village hall support service, to establish a fair relief scheme for water charges for all charities that will maintain the exemption beyond 2010 and to work with appropriate partners to cut regulatory burdens and support the interests of hall committees.
