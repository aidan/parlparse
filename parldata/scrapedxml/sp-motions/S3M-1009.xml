*S3M-1009 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Napier University - Best Widening Participation Initiative—That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh’s Napier University for winning the Widening Participation Initiative of the Year award at the Times Higher Awards 2007 for its innovative NUstART programme; notes that NUstART runs drop-in workshops for people of all ages, allowing students from disadvantaged areas to work in a variety of painting and drawing media at their own pace, with flexible attendance to suit people’s commitments, health and abilities; further notes that the workshops regularly attract about 80 aspiring artists who between them sold more than 50 paintings with a total value of £4,000 at this year’s summer exhibition, raising £1,250 for charity; commends the NUstART organisers for their groundbreaking initiative which has a powerful impact on the self-esteem and life chances of participants, and supports them in their plans to set up more groups throughout Edinburgh and the Lothians and establish spin-off ventures such as a permanent gallery.
