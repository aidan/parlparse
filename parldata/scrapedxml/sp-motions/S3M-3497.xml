*S3M-3497 Hugh O’Donnell: Fairbridge Works—That the Parliament congratulates the youth work charity, Fairbridge, on the vital work that it undertakes to ensure that every young person has a fair chance to succeed in life; notes the strong contribution that Fairbridge makes to the More Choices, More Chances strategy and the Curriculum for Excellence, by working with over 680 disengaged or excluded young people each year across Dundee, Edinburgh and Glasgow, many of whom face issues such as low self-esteem, poor social and life skills, mental health issues or drug and alcohol addictions; recognises that Fairbridge offers individuals a fresh start, someone to believe in them and a chance to develop the skills and confidence that they need to change their own lives, and considers that ongoing investment in early intervention and first-step services at a local level is essential to closing the opportunity gap among Scotland’s young people.
