 *S3M-4525 Ken Macintosh: Participation in the Edinburgh International Film Festival—That the Parliament welcomes the 2009 Edinburgh International Film Festival and the contribution that the event makes to Scottish cultural life; appreciates the pleasure that the festival has brought audiences and the platform that it has provided to film makers from Scotland and around the world; recognises the importance of film in challenging prejudice and tackling controversial subjects; notes, for example, the number of Arab, Palestinian and Israeli productions focussing on the ongoing Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the number of those films reflecting varied and opposing points of view that have received funding from the Israeli Film Fund; therefore expresses concern at the decision of the film festival to return a grant made by the Israeli Embassy to help an Israeli director participate in this important cultural event; calls for all communities and voices to be heard in such a creative forum, and greets with relief the news that the Israeli director will be able to attend the Edinburgh International Film Festival after all.
