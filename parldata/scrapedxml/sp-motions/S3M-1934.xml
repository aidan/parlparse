 *S3M-1934 Nanette Milne: CLIC Sargent Food and Nutrition for Children and Young People with Cancer—That the Parliament is concerned that children and young people with cancer are not always offered food in hospital that is appetising and responsive to their needs; considers food and nutrition to be vital to these children and young people who need to keep up their immunity from infection, whose taste buds will change as a result of chemotherapy, and who are likely to be in hospital for some time; notes with concern that a survey of families by children’s cancer charity, CLIC Sargent, shows that 92% of families surveyed in Scotland have seen their food spending increase while their children were undergoing cancer treatment, and that all parents reported bringing food into the ward for their children; is concerned that food is being wasted in hospital due to its unappetising nature, and calls on the Scottish Government, through its Choosing the Right Ingredients discussion, to ensure that all children with cancer in Scotland are served good quality, appropriate food in hospital.
