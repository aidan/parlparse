*S3M-1305 Christine Grahame: Lets Go With ".sco"—That the Parliament urges the Scottish Government to make representations to the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority to introduce a standard ".sco" top level domain name for all official public bodies in Scotland; recognises that such a move would enhance Scotland’s international reputation both in terms of e-commerce and also international relations; notes that the ".gov.uk" suffix attached to existing public bodies has become seriously tarnished in recent years due to controversies over the mass loss of personal data from UK public bodies, and notes the growing confidence that Scotland is enjoying as the nation sets its own policy agenda free from dictat or interference from Westminster politicians.
