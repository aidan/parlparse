 *S3M-2281 Dr Richard Simpson: Dental Charges—That the Parliament recognises the importance of dental care in an individual’s overall health and wellbeing; notes that the current maximum charge in Scotland is 80% of up to £348 (£278.40), whereas England and Wales introduced new scales for dental charges on April 1 2008 whereby an individual pays a standard fee of £16.20, £44.60 or £198 for three levels of treatment, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring Scotland’s dental charges to the standards set by England and Wales.
