 *S3M-7888 Margaret Mitchell: Armed Services Advice Project—That the Parliament welcomes the Armed Services Advice Project (ASAP), which was established in September 2010; understands that this service is a focal point for members of the armed services community in Scotland to access information and support on a variety of issues including benefits, housing and relationships; notes that ASAP is provided by the 83 branches of Citizens Advice Bureaux (CABx) across Scotland and is funded by Poppyscotland, the Royal Air Force Benevolent Fund, SSAFA Forces Help and many other armed forces-related organisations; acknowledges that the service is for regular and reserve members of the armed forces, and their dependants, who are serving or have served and also members of the Merchant Navy; further notes that the Lanarkshire CABx have seen 54 veteran servicemen and women since September last year, helping them with nearly 160 different issues, and hopes that the Armed Services Advice Project will continue to help the many members of the armed forces community in Scotland in the future.
