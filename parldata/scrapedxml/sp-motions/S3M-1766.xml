*S3M-1766 Gil Paterson: Scotland Not Best Served by British Airports Authority—That the Parliament believes that the Scottish travelling public is not best served by the British Airports Authority (BAA) in its current form; calls for the monopoly operated by BAA to be broken up so that airline services in Scotland can be improved by creating a market place where direct flights become the norm rather than the few currently available from BAA airports, and further calls for this action in order to reduce wasteful double flights, landing charges and taxes which add not only extra expense and inconvenience to the travelling public but disadvantage Scottish commerce and industry while at the same time causing greater environmental damage than direct flights.
