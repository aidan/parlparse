 *S3M-3467 Jamie Hepburn: UK Government Anti-terror Programme Restricts Civil Libertiesâ€”That the Parliament expresses its concern, following the publication of a three-year global study by the International Commission of Jurists, at findings that the UK Government has actively undermined international law through measures in its anti-terror programme; agrees with comments made by Dame Stella Rimington, a former head of MI5, that UK ministers have exploited fears of terrorism in order to bring in laws that restrict civil liberties, and calls on the UK Government urgently to reassess its anti-terror programme.
