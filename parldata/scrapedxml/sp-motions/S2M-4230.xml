 *S2M-4230 Robin Harper: "We’re Trashin’ It"—That the Parliament welcomes the actions by Greenpeace to highlight its new report, Eating Up The Amazon, which reveals the role played by the fast food giant McDonald’s in the destruction of the Amazon rainforest; notes that campaigners have for the first time been able to track the trade in soya beans from illegally cleared Amazon rainforest to the Chicken McNuggets eaten in restaurants across Europe; notes with concern a report in the science journal, Nature, that 40% of the Amazon will be lost by 2050 if current trends in agricultural expansion continue, threatening bio-diversity and massively contributing to climate change, and calls on McDonald’s and other UK fast food chains and supermarkets to immediately stop buying meat products from animals fed on soya from the Amazon rainforest, to demand full chain of custody for all Brazilian soya used by meat suppliers to ensure that it comes from legal sources outside the Amazon rainforest and to develop responsible animal feed supplies in order to eliminate the pressure on the world’s remaining ancient forests.
