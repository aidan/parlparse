 *S2M-4935 Patrick Harvie: Congratulations to Fairbridge in Scotland—That the Parliament congratulates Fairbridge in Scotland on the publication of its latest annual review which details the excellent work undertaken by the organisation to support some of society’s hardest to reach young people; recognises the dedication and talent that Fairbridge demonstrates in its work to support the development of those young people’s self-esteem and personal and social skills, and encourages the Scottish Executive and other public bodies to continue to show their support for voluntary sector organisations, such as Fairbridge, by making more secure funding available to enable them to build on their services and help many more young people reconnect with their own human potential, whether through education, employment and training, or in the wider aspects of their lives. Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Mark Ballard*
