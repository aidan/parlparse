*S3M-4978 Aileen Campbell: Human Development Report 2009—That the Parliament notes the publication of the United Nations Human Development Report 2009; further notes that Norway is ranked first in the human development index rankings and that its consistently high performance in the index and its desirable living standards have been attributed, in large part, to its wise use of the revenues generated by its natural gas and oil deposits; notes that Iceland and Ireland also feature in the top 10, with Denmark and Finland in the top 20, and that all these countries are identified in the Scottish Government’s National Conversation document as being part of the arc of prosperity; notes also that the United Kingdom is ranked twenty-first; recognises that, even though the figures were compiled in 2007, before the economic downturn, the human development index does not simply take economic factors into account but also social indicators including life expectancy and poverty levels, which means that these countries can expect to maintain relatively high rankings in future publications of the index, and looks forward to the day when Scotland takes its place among the countries of the United Nations, has the normal powers of the 182 other countries featured in the index and can work towards achieving the best possible ranking in the index and quality of life for people in Scotland.
