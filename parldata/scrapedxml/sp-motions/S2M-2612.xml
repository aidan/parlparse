*S2M-2612# Alex Neil: Crisis of Management in Kilmarnock Prison—That the Parliament considers that the Minister for Justice should adopt a proactive approach, rather than her current complacent one, to dealing with the crisis of management in Kilmarnock Prison; believes that, if she continues to ignore this problem, she will lose the confidence of the Scottish people and this Parliament; further believes that the Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service has failed to ensure that the contract between Premier Prison Services and the Scottish Prison Service for the running of Kilmarnock Prison is being properly implemented and that he has totally ignored the breaches of contract, illegal activities and morally-decadent behaviour which are occurring in the prison, as well as failing to ensure that suicide watches have been properly carried out and monitored, as a result of which there has been an unnecessary and avoidable loss of life; believes that he should resign forthwith and that the Chief Inspector of Prisons should launch an immediate, open and transparent investigation into the allegations made in the BBC documentary into Kilmarnock Prison, broadcast on 9 March 2005, and further believes that the latest report of the Chief Inspector of Prisons into Kilmarnock Prison should be published immediately.
