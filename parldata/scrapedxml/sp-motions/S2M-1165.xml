 *S2M-1165# Alasdair Morgan: Shirley McKie-That the Parliament notes that Strathclyde Police has been granted a court order entitling it to seek recovery of legal expenses of £13,000 from Shirley McKie following unsuccessful legal action raised by her against the board; recognises that, while Strathclyde Police may be legally entitled to seek recovery of this sum, there is no moral case for it to do so following the acquittal of Shirley McKie on a charge of perjury in the High Court of Justiciary, and considers that Strathclyde Police should abandon further attempts to recover this sum.
