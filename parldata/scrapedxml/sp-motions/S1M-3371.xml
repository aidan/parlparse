 *S1M-3371 Michael Russell: Scottish Media Group - Sale of Publishing Business—That the Parliament notes the decision of the Scottish Media Group to sell The Herald, The Sunday Herald and The Evening Times as well as a range of magazine titles; expresses the view that it is important that the sale, particularly of the newspapers, helps to increase the diversity of media ownership in Scotland and does not further concentrate it in a few hands; calls on Her Majesty’s Government to ensure that any consideration of monopoly issues which may be raised by the sale is based on the recognition of a Scottish media market as opposed to a UK one, and is firmly of the opinion that any sale must not compromise the editorial independence, integrity and overall quality of the newspapers which presently make a considerable contribution to Scottish life.
