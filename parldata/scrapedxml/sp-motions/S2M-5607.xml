 *S2M-5607 Richard Lochhead: The Environment—That the Parliament welcomes the recent ruling by the High Court in London that declared the UK Government’s decision to back new nuclear power stations illegal due to a failure to consult adequately; recognises that the judgement is a further blow to the UK Government’s pro-nuclear policy, and rejects the case for new nuclear power stations in Scotland in favour of developing our nation’s enormous renewables and clean energy potential which is the quickest, most effective, safest and less expensive energy option for tackling climate change.
