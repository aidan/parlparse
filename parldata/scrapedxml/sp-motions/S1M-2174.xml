*S1M-2174 Tommy Sheridan: Maintenance of Manufacturing Base-That the Parliament deplores the decisions of companies such as Compaq, BAe Systems and Marconi to axe thousands of jobs across Scotland, thereby not only putting at risk the livelihoods of workers and their families but also the very manufacturing base of which Scotland is justifiably proud and agrees that action needs to be taken to ensure the long-term security of Scotland's skilled manufacturing base and that ways should be examined, including the seizure of these companies' assets, to prevent Scotland from being turned into an industrial wasteland by global corporations whose only motivation is profit.
