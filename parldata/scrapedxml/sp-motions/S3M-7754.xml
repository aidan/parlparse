*S3M-7754 Michael Matheson: Mountain Rescue Debt—That the Parliament calls on the UK Government to treat mountain rescue teams fairly and refund or remove VAT from mountain rescue services, which is estimated to cost teams in Scotland between £150,000 and £200,000 per year; notes that, on 4 May 2010, two days before the UK election, Danny Alexander said that, as part of the debt owed to mountain rescue teams, they should be refunded their VAT; believes that the UK Government owes mountain rescue teams more than a debt, it owes them hundreds of thousands of pounds in VAT, and calls on the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, to deliver for Scotland’s mountain rescue teams and provide them with a VAT refund.
