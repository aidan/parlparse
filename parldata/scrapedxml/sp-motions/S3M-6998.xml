 *S3M-6998 Marilyn Livingstone: Congratulations to Torbain Primary School—That the Parliament congratulates the headteacher, staff and pupils of Torbain Primary School on their recent HM Inspectorate of Education report, which it considers outstanding; further considers that, by being awarded four excellent and two very good ratings, Torbain Primary School is one of the top primary schools in Scotland; is encouraged by the findings that the school is making a difference to children’s life opportunities through its emphasis on high achievement, health and wellbeing, rights, responsibility and respect; notes that the report found that the strengths of the school include that it is very welcoming, children have a strong commitment to their own and others’ learning, partnerships with parents are excellent and that there is a high-quality provision for children who require additional support, and believes that the report reflects the standing of the school in the community and that the headteacher, staff and pupils will continue to meet these high standards in the future.
