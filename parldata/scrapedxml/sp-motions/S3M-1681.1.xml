 *S3M-1681.1 Alasdair Allan: HITRANS Supports Equal Treatment for All Island Ferries—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1681) in the name of Liam McArthur, leave out from "further notes" to end and insert "welcomes the first step towards this wider progress represented by the Scottish Government’s decision to implement its manifesto promise for an RET pilot in the Western Isles, not only for residents but also for freight and tourist traffic; recognises that all Scotland’s island communities need to develop their transport infrastructure if they are to grow economically; acknowledges that this issue is nowhere more urgent than in the Western Isles, which has GDP per head well below that of many other parts of Scotland, and which has seen its population fall by 18% in the last 20 years, at a time when the Highlands and Islands as a whole has seen relative stability in its overall population, and recalls that when in government the Liberal Democrats declined to introduce RET anywhere, as the answer to parliamentary question S2W-15038 by the then Minister for Transport, Nicol Stephen, on 29 March 2005 makes clear."
