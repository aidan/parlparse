 * S2M-1639 Frances Curran:Palestinian Hunger Strike—That the Parliament notes that thousands of Palestinian political detainees imprisoned in Israeli jails are currently on hunger strike; notes that the number of detainees is increasing by the day; notes that during the Intifada over 8,000 Palestinians, ranging in age from 10 to 75 years old, have been arrested; notes that many detainees have been denied access to health services, subjected to physical torture, housed in over-crowded and unsanitary conditions and are regularly in solitary confinement and subjected to humiliation, including being forced to stand naked during interrogation; notes that child detainees have been prevented from continuing their education and many detainees are denied all contact with their children and families; expresses its solidarity with the struggle of the Palestinian detainees for basic human rights and condemns the Israeli state’s continuing denial of these same rights, and calls on Her Majesty’s Government to take action, including the use of sanctions, to call Israel to account.
