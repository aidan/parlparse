 *S3M-3613 Cathy Peattie: Women’s Environmental Network—That the Parliament notes that the Women’s Environmental Network aims to empower women to make positive environmental change, increase awareness of women’s perspectives on environmental issues and influence decision-making to achieve environmental justice for women; further notes the publication of Gender and Environmental Chemicals, a scoping study to identify key gender-related issues for international policy-making on chemicals management and safety, commissioned by the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which recommends how best to have a gender perspective and input to environmental policy and processes; recognises that the biological, physiological and sociological differences between men and women need to be taken into account when considering how exposure to chemicals in the environment may affect them; considers that a gender equality approach needs to be taken to protect women’s health and help women participate more in environmental decisions about policies, processes and forums; believes that it is essential that women are brought into the mainstream of environmental decision-making processes, whether community-based or those initiated by governments; is concerned that new research shows that environmental and occupational exposures to toxins are contributing, or suspected of contributing, to a range of serious health problems in humans, as well as in many other species, and in particular notes the evidence of problems arising from early exposures, pre-natally and in infancy; notes that in view of the strength of evidence for the hormone-disrupting actions of BisphenolA (BPA), several US States, Canada and several commercial firms have voluntarily withdrawn products containing BPA; believes that, as a precautionary measure, polycarbonate plastic baby-feeding bottles and other drinks bottles should be removed from sale, and further believes that a toxic use reduction programme should be considered.
