 *S1M-3148 Christine Grahame: Water Charges Soaking up Small Borders Businesses—That the Parliament notes that for a small business in the Scottish Borders with a rateable value in the order of £20,000-£25,000 per annum the water bill will be some £593.60 as compared to £383.89 for a similar business in Berwick; notes that a substantial increase in charges to small Borders businesses is directly attributable to the 179.1% increase from last year in the daily charge, the 45% increase in the sewerage daily charge and the 71.4% increase in the surface water drainage charge; notes that, additionally, the surface water drainage charge impacts disproportionately on small businesses comprising as it does some 50% of the total billing so that small local Borders businesses, such as post offices, newsagents, other retailers and manufacturing companies and offices employing 50 or less, which are still reeling from foot-and-mouth and the consequential downturn in tourism, are further burdened by punitive water charges; considers that the historic method of calculating commercially metered water rates requires radical overhaul, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to review the entire system of charging commercially metered water without delay.
