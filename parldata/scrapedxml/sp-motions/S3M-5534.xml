*S3M-5534 Mike Pringle: Congratulations to Lothian and Borders Police—That the Parliament congratulates Lothian and Borders Police on seizing almost £1.5 million worth of cocaine in the last nine months; commends the Serious Organised Crime Unit that was launched in September 2009 for its role in the proactive approach that Lothian and Borders Police are taking to tackling drug crime; notes that, if seizure rates are maintained, Lothian and Borders Police are on course to beat both of its previous records of £1.9 million worth of cocaine and £2.4 million worth of class A drugs, consisting almost entirely of cocaine and heroin, seized in a calendar year, and wishes Lothian and Borders Police every success in its continuing efforts to tackle drug crime.
