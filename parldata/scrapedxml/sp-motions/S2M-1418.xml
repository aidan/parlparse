*S2M-1418 Trish Godman: Tolled Bridges-That the Parliament notes the comments by the Deputy First Minister and Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning in the debate on the economy of the Highlands and Islands on Thursday 3 June 2004: "However, I reaffirm and reassure members and John Farquhar Munro that the Executive is committed to ending the discredited tolling regime on the Skye Bridge. Professional advisers have been appointed and discussions with Skye Bridge Ltd have already begun. Having conferred with the Minister for Transport on the issue in anticipation of such a question, I believe that we can achieve our goal by the end of this year." (Official Report, c 8834 - 35) and seeks assurances from the Scottish Executive that, if the tolls on the Skye Bridge are lifted in the timescale suggested, tolls on the Erskine Bridge and other tolled bridges are lifted simultaneously in the interest of consistency and fairness.
