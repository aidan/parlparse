 *S3M-3145 Bill Kidd: Scottish Consortium For Learning Disability eSAY Information Resourceâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the fact that from spring 2009 local authorities will be able to make use of the eSAY information resource, which is run by the Scottish Consortium For Learning Disability (SCLD), by sending anonymous information to the Scottish Government about the numbers of people with learning disabilities and autistic spectrum disorders in their areas, making planning services for people with learning disabilities easier, and commends the role that the SCLD plays in working in partnership with people with learning disabilities of all ages and family members with a caring role to challenge discrimination and to develop and share good practice.
