 *S3M-7005 Kenneth Gibson: Impact of Changes to the UK Benefit System—That the Parliament notes with concern the publication of a recent report by the Scottish Local Government Forum Against Poverty regarding the impact on people, local authorities and the economy of the proposed changes to the UK benefits system; is alarmed that official government sources show that Scotland stands to lose up to £614 million from its economy over the next few years, which could result in the loss of as many as 14,220 jobs; considers that such job losses would place an enormous strain on local authorities as the demand for social work, housing and advice services increases at a time when they are expected to cut current spending levels by up to 25%; is deeply concerned that, in an effort to meet the demand for the aforementioned services, other valuable services such as education, leisure and cleaning will inevitably suffer; further considers that the impending changes will place a huge financial strain on some of the poorest and most vulnerable in society at a time when unemployment is high, higher education places are scarce and living costs are rising as a result of higher than anticipated inflation and the forthcoming VAT increase; is perturbed by the scale and severity of proposed benefit cuts, which are likely to see Scots lose a total of over £27 million in Local Housing Allowance, £260 million in Disability Living Allowance and £235 million in Incapacity Benefit over four years, £48 million in Child Benefit annually, while over-65-year-olds face losing a total of £28 million per year in Attendance Allowance; believes, in light of the economic climate, that the UK Government should look more closely at the implications of such drastic cuts and should instead seek to grow the economy by furnishing the Scottish Parliament with full fiscal autonomy.
