*S3M-7536 Gil Paterson: Scottish Cot Death Trust Research Makes its Mark on the World—That the Parliament notes that members of the Scottish Cot Death Trust attended the international meeting on cot death in Sydney, Australia, in October 2010; notes that delegates at the meeting accepted the trust’s poster presentation and that the trust supported five research papers arising from work carried out by scientists in England, Australia and the United States of America; believes that this is quite an achievement for a small Scottish charity in its 25th anniversary year, and wishes the trust the very best of luck in its endeavours to tackle what it considers to be the scourge of cot death in Scotland and the world as a whole.
