 *S3M-5621.1 Jackie Baillie: Tennent’s Support for Minimum Price of Alcohol—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5621) in the name of Michael Matheson, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes that the University of Sheffield study of minimum unit pricing indicates that the profit that would accrue to retailers and alcohol producers is in the order of £90 million per year if the unit price is set at 40p; further notes that the amount being spent on alcohol treatment by the Scottish Government is £120 million over three years, which represents less than half of the money that would be generated by a minimum unit price over the same period, and strongly believes that this money is better spent on alcohol education, treatment and enforcement rather than increasing the profits of retailers and alcohol producers."
