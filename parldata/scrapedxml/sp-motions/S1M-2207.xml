 *S1M-2207 David McLetchie: Improving Patient Care—That the Parliament welcomes the opening of the new hospitals built thanks to the PFI programme initiated by the last Conservative governments but notes with grave concern that the delivery of health care in Scotland has fallen far short of the standards people expect, with local hospital services under threat and patients waiting longer for treatment and facing the prospect of being forced to go abroad to get the treatment they need in a reasonable time; calls upon the Scottish Executive to extend the principle of partnership with the independent sector to the delivery of health care and begin discussions with the independent sector with a view to signing a "concordat" in similar terms to that already established in England, and further calls upon the Executive to initiate a debate in Scotland about how to improve standards of health care to the levels of the best European countries without raising taxes to unacceptable levels and whilst ensuring that access to high quality care is guaranteed for all.
