*S3M-6048 Jackie Baillie: Help for West Dunbartonshire Council—That the Parliament notes with concern the Accounts Commission best value follow-up report on West Dunbartonshire Council; further notes that this is the third such report and that SNP-controlled West Dunbartonshire Council is the only local authority out of 32 across Scotland that has failed to make sufficient progress; understands that the Accounts Commission has raised concerns about the lack of strategic leadership, the continuing poor level of staff morale and difficulties with officer/member relations; further understands that the report highlights the financial position of the council and the lack of reserves, which stand at only £258,000; further notes the report’s conclusion that the council faces significant pressure in achieving operational sustainability and financial stability; believes that the council’s response to these findings has been shockingly complacent, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to intervene and provide much-needed support for the council in order to protect the interests of the people of West Dunbartonshire and the hard-working council staff.
