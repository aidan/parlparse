*S1M-3650 Mr Brian Monteith: Educationâ€”That the Parliament believes that the Scottish education system should move to the post-comprehensive era, where schools keep the comprehensive principle of equality of opportunity but are opened up to new and different ways of education built round the needs of the individual child and where there is a greater range of specialist schools for parents to choose from, offering excellent routes into university and skilled employment.
