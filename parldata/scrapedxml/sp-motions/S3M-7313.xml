*S3M-7313 David Whitton: Thomas Muir Heritage Trail—That the Parliament welcomes the proposed new 11-mile heritage trail in East Dunbartonshire, which highlights buildings and features that have a connection to the political reformer considered the founding father of Scottish democracy, Thomas Muir; notes that the trail begins at Clachan of Campsie, traversing through Lennoxtown, Kirkintilloch and other places of importance to Muir before ending at his home at Huntershill House in Bishopbriggs, and hopes that this heritage trail will raise awareness of what it considers this almost forgotten hero and, at the same time, promote outdoor activities, education, local history and tourism.
