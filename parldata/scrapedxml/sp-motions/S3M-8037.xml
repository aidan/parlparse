 *S3M-8037 Alex Salmond: 2015 Electionâ€”That the Parliament notes the potential clash of UK and Scottish general election dates in 2015; with reference to section 2(5) of the Scotland Act 1998, agrees that the Presiding Officer should have the power to propose to Her Majesty that the poll for the Scottish general election be held up to one year earlier or one year later than the due date; expects that after 5 May 2011 the next Scottish general election will be held in May 2016, and looks forward to the UK Government consultation on a legislative provision that would set apart UK and Scottish general election dates on a permanent basis.
