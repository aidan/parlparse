*S3M-6853Robert Brown:Edwin Morgan, Scotland’s National Poet—That the Parliament notes with sadness the death of Scotland’s national poet, the Scots Makar and Glasgow’s first poet laureate this week at the age of 90 in his care home in Glasgow; notes that Edwin Morgan is regarded as one of the greatest and influential poets of our time, known for his differing, experimental and wide-ranging styles, his love poetry and his work as a translator of poetry, as a teacher and as a playwright; notes that Morgan was born in the west end of Glasgow then brought up in Rutherglen, which inspired his first published piece, The Cathkin Braes, in 1952, and went on to teach in the University of Glasgow, and believes that Glasgow and Scotland have sadly lost an artist of irreplaceable literary brilliance.
