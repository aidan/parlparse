*S2M-2108 Jackie Baillie: Early Introduction of Consumer Credit Bill—That the Parliament welcomes the inclusion of a consumer credit bill in the Queen’s Speech; notes that, whilst debt enforcement is a devolved issue, the regulation of credit is reserved to Westminster; recognises that, in order to tackle the growing problem of debt in Scotland, action is required in both parliaments; notes that the current legislation is 30-years-old and inadequate; welcomes the opportunity for specific Scottish reforms afforded by the bill, and urges the UK Government to ensure that the proposed Consumer Credit Bill is introduced at a sufficiently early date to allow a successful passage through Westminster before dissolution, if this is to occur in 2005.
