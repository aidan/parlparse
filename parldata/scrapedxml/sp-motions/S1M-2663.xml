*S1M-2663 Roseanna Cunningham: Mike Tyson-That the Parliament notes and applauds the decision of the Nevada Athletic Commission in the United States of America not to approve an application from Mike Tyson for a licence to box in Las Vegas; expresses its concern at speculation that the fight might be re-arranged to a UK venue; recollects the anger that was caused by the Home Secretary's decision to allow Mike Tyson, a convicted rapist, to enter the UK for a fight in Glasgow on 24 June 2000; further notes that Mike Tyson has at no time expressed public remorse for the crimes of violence for which he has been convicted; expresses the hope that boxing promoters and venue managers will resist suggestions that a second Tyson fight be held in Scotland, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make a firm commitment that it will oppose the licensing of any boxing match involving Mike Tyson in Scotland and that it will make representations to oppose any visa application that might be made.
