*S3M-2701 Liam McArthur: Science and the Parliament 2008, Educating our Scientists of Tomorrow—That the Parliament welcomes the 2008 Science and the Parliament event on 5 November 2008 on the theme of educating our scientists of tomorrow; recognises the role of the Royal Society of Chemistry in organising this annual event with the involvement and support of a range of organisations from the scientific and engineering communities in Scotland; believes that the focus on science education is important and timely given the consideration currently being given to education at all levels, and acknowledges that ensuring that our education system gives a good grounding in scientific knowledge and methods to future specialists and to the whole population would greatly enhance the opportunities for Scotland in the future.
