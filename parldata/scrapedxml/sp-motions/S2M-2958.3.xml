 * S2M-2958.3 Carolyn Leckie: Sexual Health—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2958) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from “and welcomes” to end and insert “is concerned, however, that inequalities of access to non-judgmental sexual health education, advice, support and services remain and that their future delivery is undermined by insufficient accountability mechanisms and resources specific to sexual health services, and therefore believes that specific resources and people with specific responsibility need to be allocated and dedicated to ensure delivery of improved sexual health services that are available consistently, equally and universally throughout Scotland.”
