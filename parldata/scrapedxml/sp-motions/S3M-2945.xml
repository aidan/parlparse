*S3M-2945 Robin Harper: Call for Parliamentary Scrutiny of Aid Effectiveness—That the Parliament congratulates and commends the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association UK branch on its timely International Parliamentary Conference which was held between 17 and 21 November 2008 in the Palace of Westminster for 92 colleagues from across the Commonwealth and beyond on the scrutiny of the effectiveness of international aid; notes that, following the Accra High-Level Forum in September 2008, the conference debated the vital role of parliamentarians in donor and partner legislatures in holding their executives to account on international aid effectiveness and commitments made under the Paris Declaration in 2005; further notes that the conference discussed the need to enhance the capacity of partner parliaments to undertake more effective scrutiny; recognises an outreach responsibility in this Parliament to assist in strengthening the capacity of partner parliaments, and calls on the Scottish Government to seek a meeting between representatives of the Scottish Parliament and the Malawi Parliament’s International Relations Committee with a view to mutually improving parliamentary scrutiny of the bilateral aid agreements between Scotland and Malawi.
