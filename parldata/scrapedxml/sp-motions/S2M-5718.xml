*S2M-5718 Dr Jean Turner: Hospital Car Parking Charges - a Pay Cut for NHS Staff?—That the Parliament expresses great concern about the motives behind car parking charges for hospitals since they penalise NHS staff who have to use their cars to travel to work; notes that, for example, at the Southern General employees are charged double rates (£6 to £12) if they park for more than seven hours in a day; expresses concern that, because charges are only levied during the day, daytime employees will spend up to £2,700 per annum out of their salaries on parking, causing implications for recruitment, retention and morale of existing staff, and calls for the elimination of these charges, which equate to a pay cut for daytime staff only, and for a review of car parking charges for staff which are at present at variance throughout Scotland.
