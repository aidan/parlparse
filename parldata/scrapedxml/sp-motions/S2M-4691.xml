*S2M-4691 Mr Bruce McFee: University of Paisley—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal to change the name of University of Paisley which would completely remove any reference to Paisley; further notes that the proposed new name, the University of the West of Scotland, does not have a direct association with Paisley; appreciates the added value that a university brings to the status of each of Scotland’s university towns and cities; believes that the university is a vital part of the culture and the future of Paisley; is concerned that changing the name in this way will undermine the good work done in building the reputation of the University of Paisley and will undermine the desire for city status, and calls on managers of the University of Paisley to open a consultation exercise to allow Paisley to be in the name of the new institution.
