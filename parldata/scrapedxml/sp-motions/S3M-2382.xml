*S3M-2382 Mary Scanlon: Economic Situation in Unst—That the Parliament welcomes Highlands and Islands Enterprise (HIE)’s appraisal of the economic situation in Unst; notes that in 2005 the island was dealt a severe blow when the Ministry of Defence decided to leave RAF Saxa Vord, an early warning radar base that was the centre of the island’s economy from 1957; further notes that the outlook at the time was bleak for the 720 residents of the island with a report predicting 172 job losses and gross household income falling by £3.245 million; congratulates the residents of Unst, Shetlands Isles Council, HIE and Military Asset Management on their tremendous work to ensure that island life continued and prospered, and further notes that Military Asset Management has converted part of the base into self-catering accommodation and a restaurant while Foords Chocolates currently operate on the site and advanced plans are in place for the island’s Valhalla Brewery to relocate and expand at the site, all of which helps to diversify and strengthen the economy of Scotland’s most northerly island.
