*S3M-7328 Sandra White: The Hub—That the Parliament welcomes the opening of Scotland’s biggest voluntary sector hub in the Merchant City area of Glasgow, which is to house over 20 charities, such as the International Network of Street Papers, anti-sectarian body Nil by Mouth and the Scottish Mentoring Network; believes that this is an innovative initiative that will help to encourage networking and partnership in Scotland’s biggest city, which itself is home to around 2,349 registered charities, and hopes that, by working collaboratively, these organisations can go from strength to strength.
