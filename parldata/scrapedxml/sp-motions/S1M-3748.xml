 *S1M-3748 Cathy Jamieson: Review of Child Protection-That the Parliament notes the findings of the report of the Child Protection Audit and Review, It's everyone's job to make sure I'm alright; expresses concern that, despite examples of good practice in child protection across Scotland, many children and young people are still at risk of abuse and neglect, and supports the Scottish Executive's plans for a sustained programme of reform, building on effective inter-agency working, and its continued emphasis on closing the opportunity gap for Scotland's most vulnerable young people.
