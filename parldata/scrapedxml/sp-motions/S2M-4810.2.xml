*S2M-4810.2 Mr Mark Ruskell: A Greener, Fairer Scotlandâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-4810) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from "notes" to end and insert "recognises the seriousness of climate change and the grave threat which it poses to humanity; notes the reality, as evidenced in the latest report from the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, that it is vital to implement a major new programme of action to cut carbon emissions within the next four years if we are to play our part in keeping global temperatures below dangerous levels, and calls on the Scottish Executive to adopt a target for a 3% year-on-year overall reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and to take action to achieve this target including reducing road traffic levels, bold energy efficiency measures, promoting micropower technologies and decentralised energy generation, the rapid expansion of renewable energy and the carbon-proofing of all Executive decisions and policies to ensure a consistent rather than contradictory approach to emissions reduction."
