*S3M-3595 Willie Coffey: See Me Campaign—That the Parliament notes that one in four of the population will experience mental health problems, while many more will suffer from poor mental wellbeing, at some time in their lifes; commends those companies signing up to tackle discrimination against those with mental ill-health; notes that the recent NHS Ayrshire and Arran annual workplace conference had the theme of mental wellbeing in the workplace; welcomes the news that, following the conference, a further nine firms, including Johnnie Walker whisky makers Diageo and Kilmarnock firm New Horizons Creative Solutions, signed up for the see me campaign, bringing the number of Ayrshire firms that have signed up to 26, and endorses the message from Suzie Vestri, director of the see me campaign, that we can all play a part in stamping out the stigma of mental ill-health.
