*S3M-5524 Bill Kidd: Reversal of Ministry of Defence Decision to Sell Kentigern House—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Ministry of Defence to abandon its plans to sell off Kentigern House in Glasgow for £47.7 million and lease the building back on a 20-year contract at an annual rental of almost £3.6 million; congratulates the Public and Commercial Services union (PCS) and the Ministry of Defence civil servants and Hewlett Packard staff working at the site on their successful campaign to reverse the decision, and considers that the sale-and-leaseback proposal would have been gravely shortsighted, at a cost of £150 million to the taxpayer in the long run, and that common sense has prevailed over such myopic decision making.
