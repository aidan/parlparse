*S3M-2500 Bill Wilson: Congratulations to WRVS Renfrewshire—That the Parliament congratulates the WRVS in Renfrewshire on the opening of its new information centre and cafe in Paisley; considers that WRVS chose to launch this major new way of delivering on its charitable purposes in Paisley and in Scotland because it wanted to launch in a place with the energy and initiative to make its vision come to life; also considers that the centre’s model of sustainable social enterprise, founded on partnership working with both local voluntary and statutory organisations in the Reaching Older Adults in Renfrewshire (ROAR) initiative and Renfrewshire Council, is a positive one designed for success; recognises that older people in particular and the people of the communities of Paisley and Renfrewshire as a whole will now be able to enjoy and benefit from a first-class facility that simultaneously serves a social and a recreational purpose, and hopes that such positive approaches to meeting social challenges, involving partners from the voluntary, public and, indeed, private sectors flourish in future.
