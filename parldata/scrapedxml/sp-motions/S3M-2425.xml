*S3M-2425Mary Mulligan:Save West Lothian Pensioners’ and Disabled People’s Concessionary Travel—That the Parliament condemns the decision of the SNP and hospital councillor-led administration on West Lothian Council to withdraw the budget of a concessionary travel scheme providing subsidised rail travel for pensioners and disabled people by April 2009; notes that this scheme, started by the previous Labour administration, provides for 130,000 journeys each year at an annual cost to the council of only £110,000, and contributes to meeting targets in the Scottish Government national outcomes document, and calls on the SNP-led administration of West Lothian Council to think again about its rejection of the Labour councillors’ call to retain this valued concessionary travel scheme and to listen to the many voices in West Lothian that have expressed outrage and disgust at what is seen as a mean-spirited attack on pensioners and disabled people.
