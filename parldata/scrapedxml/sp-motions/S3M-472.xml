*S3M-472 Rob Gibson: Removing Barriers to Clean Energy Production—That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of European practices with grid connection, reinforcement, constraint and charging of renewable energy projects, the report commissioned by Highlands and Islands Enterprise which states that energy producers in north Scotland "almost certainly" face the highest charges in Europe to connect to the national grid; believes that it is unacceptable that renewable energy producers pay up to 30 times more in charges here than similar producers in Denmark, and further asserts that if the highlands and islands are to be the renewable power house of Europe then OFGEM must reduce this cost and that Scotland must have a energy policy that removes this barrier to clean energy production immediately.
