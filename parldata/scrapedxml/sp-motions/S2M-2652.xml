 * S2M-2652 Rosie Kane: Defend the Gypsy, Traveller and Roma Community against Attackâ€”That the Parliament views the comments of the Conservative Party leader, Michael Howard, in respect of the traveller community as utterly abhorrent; notes that, as Home Secretary responsible for the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994, Mr Howard made trespass a criminal offence, strengthened police powers of eviction and removed the statutory duty to provide sites for Gypsies and travellers, resulting in traveller sites becoming overcrowded and forcing many young Gypsies and travellers into a cycle of trespass and eviction, and calls on all members and representatives of the Conservative and Unionist Party to disassociate themselves from remarks that will inevitably result in an increase in hostility to the traveller, Gypsy and Roma community.
