*S3M-4639 Robert Brown: Proposed Closure of Thistle Nursery by Glasgow College of Nautical Studies—That the Parliament is concerned at the decision by Glasgow College of Nautical Studies (GCNS) to close its longstanding Thistle Nursery by 2010 and to stop taking children under two years of age from September 2009; notes that GCNS takes almost half its 5,786 students from deprived areas, many of whom are dependent on adequate and convenient childcare facilities to enable them to study; is aware that GCNS intends to continue funding childcare from the college fund but believes that the lack of onsite facilities will cause substantial disruption for many students and act as a deterrent to new students; notes that the college is merging with other city centre Glasgow colleges but that the new super college campus of 50,000 students is not expected to house a nursery or childcare facility; urges GCNS to reconsider its decision, and further believes that the Scottish Funding Council should examine the issue more generally with a view to ensuring adequate and convenient childcare and nursery facilities are available to all college students who need them to continue their studies.
