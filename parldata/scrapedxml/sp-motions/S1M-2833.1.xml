 *S1M-2833.1 Fergus Ewing: Scotch Whisky Industryâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-2833) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, insert at end "welcomes the raising by the Scottish Conservatives of an issue that is reserved; believes that the taxation imposed on whisky by successive UK governments has disadvantaged Scotch in the home market, where whisky is taxed at higher levels than wine or beer, and has also allowed other countries to seek to justify their own discriminatory tax regimes by reference to those in the UK; further believes that a tax stamp system would constitute a barrier to trade, would be inefficient and ineffective as a means of combating fraud and illicit trade, will cause many practical and technical problems in respect of, for example, labelling and storage and will impose substantial costs on the industry, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to demand that all powers relating to the regulation and taxation of the whisky industry be transferred to the Scottish Parliament."
