 *S3M-3538 Cathy Peattie: Cultural and Social Enterprise—That the Parliament considers that social enterprises have an important role in the promotion of social cohesion and sustainable development within our communities, generating substantial social, cultural, environmental and economic benefits; notes the emergence of cultural social enterprises throughout Scotland, building on the long history of cultural organisations using entrepreneurial talent to deliver social benefits and creating a bridge between the artistic and business communities; considers that the social enterprise model delivers high quality businesses that use their more-than-profit ethos to meet social needs and are capable of delivering sustainable growth despite economic recession, in circumstances where traditional commercial organisations would struggle to survive; notes, however, that support for social enterprise is currently provided through many diverse routes and believes that it would greatly benefit the sector if there were greater clarity and a more coordinated approach between funding bodies; congratulates the Scottish Social Enterprise Coalition for its membership-led championing of the cause of the diverse range of cultural and other social enterprises, and wishes the coalition and the sector every success for the future.
