 *S3M-2872 Alex Neil: Management Report—That the Parliament notes, from an article in the Sunday Herald on 27 September 2008, that the Chief Executive has commissioned a report from Turner and Townsend Management Solutions, a group of construction and management consultants, with the remit to produce proposals that will assist in laying the foundations for an optimal senior management structure in the Scottish Parliamentary Service; while welcoming the commissioning and completion of this report, regrets that MSPs were not informed about it and are being denied access to it; believes that the refusal to publish this report runs contrary to the founding principles of the Parliament with respect to openness, transparency and accessibility, and demands that the report be made available immediately. Supported by: George Foulkes*, Margo MacDonald*
