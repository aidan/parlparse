 *S2M-4949 Frances Curran: Human Rights in Mexico—That the Parliament expresses its grave concern about the situation in Oaxaca, Mexico; notes that, according to Amnesty International, there have been reports of arbitrary arrests, threats, beatings and intimidation of protestors who are calling for the resignation of Oaxaca’s governor, that attacks on the protestors have resulted in at least six deaths and that other activists have "disappeared", and urges Mexico’s federal government to desist from repressive actions against the people of Oaxaca and to ensure that the human rights of all protestors are respected, including the right to demonstrate peacefully and not to be arbitrarily detained or subject to threats, harassment or ill-treatment, and that all measures taken to address the crisis in Oaxaca fully respect international human rights law and do not contribute to a worsening pattern of human rights violations in Mexico.
