*S2M-3672 Chris Ballance: CIA Rendition Flights—That the Parliament considers that there are sufficient grounds to justify a full police inquiry into the possible use of Scottish airports by CIA rendition flights; believes that the Lord Advocate should instruct the police to instigate that inquiry without delay, and further believes that he should instruct the police to conduct searches of planes landing at Scottish airports suspected of being operated by the CIA to ensure that no one aboard is being tortured, being transported in an inhumane manner or being illegally detained against their will.
