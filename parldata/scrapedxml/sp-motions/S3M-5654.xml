 *S3M-5654 Robert Brown: Glas-goals—That the Parliament congratulates the Evening Times for its health campaign, Glas-goals, and its three targets of walking or running a million miles for Glasgow, stubbing out a million cigarettes for Glasgow and shedding half a million pounds in weight for Glasgow over the next year; notes that Glasgow has a poor health record and that 48% of males and 29% of females exceed weekly recommended alcohol limits, that 190,000 Glaswegians smoke and that, by the end of 2010, nearly a third of the population will be clinically obese; believes that campaigning newspapers like the Evening Times can have a tremendous effect in changing attitudes and lifestyles, and wishes Glas-goals all success in its challenge in the year ahead.
