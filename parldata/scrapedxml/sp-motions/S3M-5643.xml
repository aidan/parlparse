*S3M-5643 Gil Paterson: Benefits of Milk at an Early Ageâ€”That the Parliament is aware that health specialists the world over promote the drinking of milk during early years, emphasising the long-term health benefits for children, particularly girls, brought about by the consumption of calcium and vitamin-rich milk; condemns the Labour Party group on West Dunbartonshire Council for proposing to remove free school milk for primary school children, and encourages politicians, at all levels, to consider the long-term consequences for the most vulnerable in society when removing vital and nutritious food.
