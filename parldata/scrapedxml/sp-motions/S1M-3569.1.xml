 *S1M-3569.1 Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Crime-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3569) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from "and calls on" to end and insert "regrets that the Scottish Executive has presided over rising crime and rising fear of crime; regrets that the Executive is only committed to "maintaining the capacity of the police" and not increasing the number of police officers on our streets; regrets that the Executive has chosen to focus on politically correct issues such as smacking, and calls on the Executive to address the real issues of concern to the Scottish public by increasing the number of police officers and procurators fiscal, overhauling the youth justice system and dealing adequately with the drugs problem that blights our communities."
