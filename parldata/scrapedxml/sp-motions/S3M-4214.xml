*S3M-4214 Rob Gibson: Historic Re-establishment of WILPF in Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the historic re-establishment of the Scottish branch of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF), which in 1916 had a branch in Edinburgh with 43 members; notes that WILPF is the oldest women’s peace organisation, founded in 1915 at the Hague, Netherlands, when 1,300 women met during a congress of women to protest against the war in Europe; further notes that WILPF has national sections in 35 countries, covering all continents, and has Economic and Social Council consultative status with the United Nations formally to lobby its agencies on issues related to WILPF’s work on peace, disarmament and economic justice; highlights the upcoming inaugural meeting of the Scottish WILPF branch at 7 pm on Tuesday 26 May 2009 at St John’s church hall in the west end of Edinburgh, and encourages all interested citizens to attend this historic first meeting and get involved with the admirable work that WILPF’s members are doing.
