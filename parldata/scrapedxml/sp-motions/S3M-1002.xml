 *S3M-1002♦ Jamie Hepburn: True Cost of PFI—That the Parliament notes with concern the article entitled "Lifting the Lid on PFI", published in issue 43 of Scottish Left Review, which concludes that many PFI/PPP projects in Scotland, including projects in the Central Scotland parliamentary region, are being paid for on a one-for-the-price-of-two basis due to the massive returns accruing to the contractors, that local businesses are regularly squeezed out of the tendering process and that there is still not enough transparency in PFI/PPP contracts; believes that much more needs to be done to improve the availability of information and monitoring of the true cost of PFI/PPP projects, and considers that there should be a full-scale inquiry into the reality of PFI/PPP contracts across Scotland.
