*S3M-7502 Alasdair Allan: Outer Hebrides to Mexicoâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the former crofter, Seumas MacDonald from South Uist, for representing the interests of threatened coastal communities around the world when he travelled to Mexico on 26 November 2010 in advance of the global UN climate change talks due to take place over the next fortnight; notes that Mr MacDonald, together with Oxfam Scotland, has raised awareness of the dangers faced by communities in Uist from coastal inundation and the wider lessons that these provide for coastal communities around the world at a time of rising sea levels; considers that, in Uist, there is a powerful example of the human as well as environmental impact of shifting coastlines and climate change, and welcomes the attention that Mr MacDonald is bringing to this issue.
