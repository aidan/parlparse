*S1M-791# Mr Kenneth Gibson: Broadcasting of Parliament while in Glasgow—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision of the Parliamentary Bureau to downgrade broadcasting coverage of the Parliament during the period when the Parliament sits in Glasgow; recognises the value of broadcasting coverage in Glasgow as there are fewer spaces in the public gallery there; notes that the decision will create a significant disruption to the continuous picture archive of the Parliament; further notes that the Parliament’s own rules of broadcasting coverage cannot be observed with the reduced camera pattern; is concerned that the decision will cause a deterioration in coverage of the Parliament during its important and historic Glasgow sittings; concurs with the unanimous view of Glasgow City Council that this decision gives an unfortunate signal to Glasgow about the way it is considered by the Parliamentary authorities and the Executive, and agrees that the Parliamentary Bureau should reverse its decision. Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon*
