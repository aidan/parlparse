 *S3M-7179 Liam McArthur: St Andrew’s School Green Flag Award—That the Parliament welcomes the news that St Andrew’s Primary school in Orkney, which provides nursery and primary education for the children of Deerness, Holm, St Mary’s, Tankerness and Toab, raised the flag for its first Green Flag award on 7 October 2010; believes that the school community has worked hard to recycle waste and to develop its grounds by planting bulbs, trees and bushes and developing a pond and wetland area; further notes that the award adds to what is considered the excellent record of Orkney schools in the Green Flag awards, and congratulates the St Andrew’s School staff, pupils and parents on their Green Flag award, which recognises their hard work to develop a green school that matches what is seen as the pristine Orkney environment in which it sits.
