*S2M-855.2 Carolyn Leckie: The Scottish Economy-As an amendment to motion (S2M-855) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from "with" to end and insert "the complete absence of real economic powers for example in its ability to eradicate pensioner poverty by raising the state pension, its inability to raise the taxes of the rich and its inability to set a decent minimum wage rate for all workers in both the private and public sector and believes that it will only be when the Parliament has full control of fiscal and economic policy that Scotland will be able to achieve substantial and lasting economic growth."
