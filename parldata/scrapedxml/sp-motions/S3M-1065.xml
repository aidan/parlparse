*S3M-1065♦ Cathy Jamieson: Proposed Closure of Rural Schools—That the Parliament believes that small rural schools can provide a learning environment that promotes confidence, responsible citizenship and the opportunity to contribute effectively, as well as a positive educational and social experience for children; believes that small rural schools can effectively deliver the Curriculum for Excellence; recognises the wider role that local primary schools play within rural communities; notes that the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning intends to legislate to introduce a presumption against the closure of rural schools, and commends the local parents, pupils, teachers and members of the community who are making a positive case to keep open Sorn, Littlemill, St Xavier’s and Crossroads primary schools following the publication of SNP-led East Ayrshire Council’s closure proposals.
