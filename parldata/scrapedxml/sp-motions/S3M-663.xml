*S3M-663 Cathie Craigie: Integration of Prison Health Services—That the Parliament notes the publication of the Scottish Consortium on Crime and Social Justice’s paper, The Cost of Unnecessary Imprisonment; agrees with the proposal that the Scottish Prison Service needs to accelerate its integration of health services, including mental health and addictions services, with the NHS; believes that an approach of interventions integrated with the patients’ pathway determined by NHS practitioners and, where appropriate, followed up by provision in the community on release would result in reduced crime and reoffending, reduced costs to the taxpayer and fewer people in Scottish prisons, and calls on the Scottish Executive to support the Scottish Prison Service and the NHS in achieving this integration.
