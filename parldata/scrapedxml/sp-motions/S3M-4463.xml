 *S3M-4463 Bill Kidd: Foreign Affairs Committee Calls for Trident Debate—That the Parliament welcomes calls by the Foreign Affairs Committee in its report, Global Security: Non-Proliferation, for a debate in the House of Commons in 2009 on the Initial Gate stage of the Trident replacement project, when the decision to start initial design work is to be made, so that the issue can be sufficiently scrutinised; believes that the cross-party support for Jeremy Corbyn MP’s Early Day Motion (EDM 660) that "requests that the Initial Gate decision be delayed until Parliament is in session and can be presented with the report for scrutiny" provides a clear indication of the consensus that exists, irrespective of party allegiances, for transparency and democratic accountability surrounding the Trident replacement debate, and considers that the attempt to approve this multi-billion pound project behind closed doors flies in the face of appeals for increased transparency on the part of the profligate UK Government.
