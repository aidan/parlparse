*S3M-7825 Elaine Murray: International Year of Chemistry—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the United Nations in recognising 2011 as the International Year of Chemistry (IYC), which was launched at the UNESCO headquarters in Paris on 27 January; notes that the IYC is a UN-approved initiative with the support of chemical societies and other organisations around the world; notes that the IYC aims to increase the public appreciation of chemistry in meeting world needs, to engage young people in chemistry and to generate enthusiasm for chemistry’s creative future, and welcomes the constructive role that it considers the society continues to play in the fulfilment of its charitable aims to serve the public interest by consistently strengthening the relations between science and parliamentarians, including its plan to hold a science hustings meeting in advance of the 2011 Scottish Parliament election.
