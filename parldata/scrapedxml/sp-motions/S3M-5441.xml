*S3M-5441 Mike Pringle: Thank You to the Forestry Commission—That the Parliament thanks the Forestry Commission Scotland for its generosity in providing a Christmas tree to all MSPs for donation to a local charity or organisation of their choice; notes the hard work of all the staff at Royal Blind Braeside House, the purpose-built care home for older people who are blind or visually impaired in Edinburgh; congratulates them and all the cheerful residents on the opening of their new sensory garden and their successful 10th anniversary year; hopes that they are enjoying their donated tree, and trusts that there will be many more successful years to come.
