 *S3M-1128 Jackie Baillie: Car Parking at the Vale of Leven Hospital—That the Parliament notes that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde decided in July 2007 to impose car parking charges in hospitals across its area; further notes the conclusions of the review group established by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to investigate the effect of the car park charging policy; considers that all management options should be exhausted before moving from providing free car parking; acknowledges that one of the stated reasons for introducing car parking charges is to discourage commuters who use hospital car parks but do not attend the hospital; nevertheless strongly believes that the Vale of Leven Hospital should be exempt from car parking charges because it is not affected by this problem of commuters using car parking inappropriately; recognises that car parking charges would be an unfair burden on low-paid staff, patients and visitors alike, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to exempt the Vale of Leven Hospital from the car parking charges scheme.
