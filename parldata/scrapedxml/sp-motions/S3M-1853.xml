 *S3M-1853 Robin Harper: The Fife Diet—That the Parliament congratulates the ongoing committment of the volunteers who created, and are living on, the Fife Diet; recognises their commitment to local food and eating a diet based on produce from Fife, as opposed to imported into Scotland from around the world; further recognises that eating locally grown high-quality food can help to reduce carbon emissions, as well as improving Scotland’s diet and building local economies, and believes that the Scottish Government should follow the example of community projects like the Fife Diet in order to support and promote healthy, low-carbon, local, fresh food as part of its national food policy. Supported by: Patrick Harvie*
