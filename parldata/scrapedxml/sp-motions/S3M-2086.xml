*S3M-2086 Jim Hume: Hawick Common Riding—That the Parliament warmly congratulates the organisers of this year’s Hawick Common Riding, the first of the Borders’ festivals; notes the historical importance of such an event which celebrates the ancient custom of riding the boundaries of the parish and the capture of an English flag in 1514; recognises that common ridings festivals allow Borderers to pay their respects to those who risked their lives protecting the townspeople, and wishes all participants well.
