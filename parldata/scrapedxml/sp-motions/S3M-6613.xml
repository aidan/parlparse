* S3M-6613 Sarah Boyack: Break the Silence, Buy Radios for Burma—That the Parliament notes that Burma, also known as Myanmar, has been under military rule since 1962 when the parliamentary government was overthrown by an army coup; believes that access to a radio could help a family or community learn about their rights and let them hear of the international solidarity that Burma’s military regime works so hard to block out; further believes that freedom of information and expression is a fundamental human right that empowers individuals and communities to learn about and strive for justice and a whole range of other rights and freedoms, and therefore welcomes the new initiative by Amnesty International to mark the 65th birthday of the pro-democracy leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, by supplying radios to the people of Burma as a means of empowering them through access to crucial information that radios provide.
