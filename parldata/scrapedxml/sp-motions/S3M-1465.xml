*S3M-1465 Murdo Fraser: Stop T in the Park Ticket Touting—That the Parliament congratulates T in the Park music festival on its continued success and for being the annual highlight for many Scots music fans; recognises the importance of T in the Park to Scotland’s international image as well as the festival’s importance to tourism, culture and the economy; acknowledges the massive demand for T in the Park tickets and that this year’s festival sold out in record time; notes that unfortunately yet again ticket touts are buying T in the Park tickets and then selling them online the same day for massively inflated prices, with hundreds of fans that missed out on tickets now being made to pay up to several times the face value for a ticket; welcomes the action being taken by the T in the Park promoters in trying to stop the practice of ticket touts by setting up a ticket exchange programme where fans can swap or buy tickets from each other at face value in a secure fashion; furthermore calls for action to stop internet touts re-selling T in the Park tickets at massively inflated prices, and backs a voluntary code of conduct to be put in place to end the practice.
