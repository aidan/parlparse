*S2M-1355 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Murrayfield Alcohol Ban-That the Parliament recognises the vital role played by the Scottish Rugby Union in promoting rugby both at international and grassroots level; further recognises the financial difficulties and burdens faced by, and placed upon, it; is aware of the proposal within the Nicholson report to trial alcohol sales at a sports ground; notes the success of the BT Cup Final and the Scotland versus Barbarians matches at Murrayfield at which alcohol was sold; recalls that there has never been any history of crowd trouble at rugby internationals in Scotland; notes that alcohol may be sold at pop concerts, rugby league games and American football matches but not at rugby internationals at the stadium; further notes that Murrayfield is the only major venue in the Six Nations rugby tournament to have alcohol provision precluded at international matches, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to review its proposal to continue the ban on the selling of alcohol at international games at Scottish rugby's national stadium.
