 *S2M-4686 Elaine Smith: Trans-shipment of US Arms Through Scottish Airports—That the Parliament expresses alarm regarding the Israeli military assault on Lebanon; conveys particular concern at the Foreign Office’s weak response to the issue of the trans-shipment of US arms to Israel via Prestwick Airport; considers that the consignment of "bunker busting" bombs, which have already passed through Scotland, will likely be used against Lebanese targets, with the potential to injure innocent civilians; recognises findings which show that 61% of Britons do not support the nature of Israel’s actions in Lebanon; suggests that the Scottish Executive should liaise with Her Majesty’s Government to ensure the immediate cessation of such arms trans-shipments, and further requests that it expresses support for the demand for an immediate ceasefire as outlined by UN Secretary General, Kofi Annan.
