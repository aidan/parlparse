 *S1M-1686# Tommy Sheridan: Compensation for Miners—That the Parliament notes the cross party support for motion S1M-1329 lodged in November 2000 which (a) considered that the Scottish Executive should launch an urgent and wide-ranging inquiry into the circumstances causing severe and unacceptable delays in relation to the compensation for miners in Scotland who have contracted serious and debilitating illness and injuries as a result of their employment as miners and who are still awaiting compensation for the contraction of illnesses such as emphysema, bronchitis and vibration white finger among others and (b) supported the involvement of the National Union of Mineworkers in Scotland, retired Scottish miners branches and the families of deceased Scots miners in this wide-ranging inquiry which should also investigate the objectivity of medical examinations with a view to streamlining the whole procedure and, given the support for this motion from every party represented in the Parliament, believes that the Scottish Executive should launch the aforementioned investigation as soon as possible.
