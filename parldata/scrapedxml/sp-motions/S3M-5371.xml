*S3M-5371 Mike Pringle: Congratulations to Lloyds Pharmacy for ALCulator Initiative—That the Parliament congratulates Lloyds Pharmacy on its excellent ALCulator initiative as part of its Neighbourhood Health Watch campaign; considers that the ALCulator is a valuable and accessible tool that allows internet users to type in the volume of alcohol that they are consuming each week, calculates an annual total and offers health advice depending on the results; notes that, between 2007 and 2008, there were 43,210 alcohol-related admissions to hospitals in Scotland, 33% of which were repeat admissions; recognises the need for a coordinated and consistent approach to tackling the over-consumption of alcohol, and further recognises the value of frontline services, such as pharmacies, that seek to educate the public about the dangers of over-consumption, both in relieving pressure on the NHS and in helping to tackle Scotland’s deadly relationship with alcohol.
