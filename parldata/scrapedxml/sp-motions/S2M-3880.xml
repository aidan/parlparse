*S2M-3880 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Food Production for Communities not for Profit—That the Parliament notes the continuing stress endured by many in the dairy and wider farming community; further notes that this stress is a direct result of the current free market economic policy in world food production, which is based on profit rather than on promoting locally grown food, and calls on the Scottish Executive to promote Scottish farming in an environmentally, economically and socially just manner under the control of the workers, based on the needs of Scotland’s communities rather than the profits of big business.
