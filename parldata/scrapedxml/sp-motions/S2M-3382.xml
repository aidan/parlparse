*S2M-3382 Frances Curran: Justice for Co-op Financial Advisers—That the Parliament condemns the actions of the Co-operative Insurance Society in writing to over 2,000 of its financial advisers, threatening to sack them if they do not sign up to new terms and conditions; notes with concern that these new terms and conditions could lead to earnings being reduced by around 30% and that refusal to accept these conditions could lead to employees receiving dismissal notices from 17 October 2005; is further concerned that the employer has refused to agree to binding arbitration which has been offered by Usdaw, the trade union representing the threatened workers; offers support and solidarity with the Usdaw members who have now voted in favour of strike action with a two-to-one majority; agrees with the workers that the Co-op’s intractability has left them with no other option; believes that the Co-op’s actions in this dispute bring its reputation as an ethical and esteemed community-based co-operative organisation into disrepute, such action being more in keeping with the activities of multi-national corporations against workers in Latin American countries such as Colombia, and urges the company to, at the very least, agree to the compromise offered by Usdaw members of entering into binding arbitration talks or, at best, withdraw these threats of dismissal and maintain fair and favourable terms and conditions for all of its employees.
