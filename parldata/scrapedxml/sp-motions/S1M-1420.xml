*S1M-1420# Irene McGugan: Scottish Berry Project-That the Parliament notes that the rate of coronary heart disease in Scotland is now the highest in western Europe, that Scotland has a long-established soft fruit industry that is suffering economic distress, that advances in medicine have conclusively demonstrated a link between increased consumption of fruit and vegetables and a reduction in risk from coronary heart disease, but that Scottish consumption falls far below even the World Health Organisation recommended minimum of 400g per day; further notes that a holistic approach to these factors which crosses traditional government departmental structures has enabled Finland in the last 25 years to reduce its rate of coronary heart disease by 50% and that a plan for such a cross-sectoral approach has been put forward as a "Berry Scotland Project", and recommends that the Scottish Executive takes forwards a cross-sectoral project that reflects the aims of the original "Berry Scotland Project" in order to raise consumption of soft fruit, especially the home produced product, which the Finnish experience has demonstrated could significantly benefit both the rural economy and public health.
