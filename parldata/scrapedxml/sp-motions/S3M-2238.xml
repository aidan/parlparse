 *S3M-2238 Michael Matheson: Woodburn Day Nursery—That the Parliament notes the proposal by the Labour/Tory/Independent Falkirk Council to close the Woodburn Day Nursery in Falkirk; notes that the nursery is a well-established community facility whose staff play an active part in the wider community; recognises that to close the facility would be contrary to the council’s stated policies of community participation and that Woodburn Nursery should remain in the community which it serves, and calls on the council to abandon its centralisation agenda.
