 *S2M-1914.1 Mr Brian Monteith: Voting Irregularities in the US Presidential Elections—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1914) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from "with concern" to end and insert "that the US Presidential Elections have been conducted with minimal disruption and with a record turnout in six states as over 120 million people across America exercised their right to vote; considers this a tremendous success in contrast to the first elections to the Scottish Parliament in 1999 when considerably long delays were experienced as over 2000 votes went uncounted in Lothians and votes in the City of Edinburgh Council elections were similarly uncounted; notes the increase in turnout in the United States of America with 60% of the electorate casting a ballot in comparison with the reduced Scottish Parliament turnout in 2003 of 49%, and considers it inappropriate in the circumstances to suggest that the United States has anything to learn from MSPs on the conduct of a full and fair democratic election."
