* S3M-6599 Willie Coffey: Mathématiques sans Frontières—That the Parliament notes that the Mathématiques sans Frontières competition, the Scottish final of which was recently held at Heriot-Watt University, is a truly European annual event involving tens of thousands of students from all European countries; notes further that, in each country, one of the complex maths problems to be solved by participants is presented in a foreign language, with the Scottish competition featuring a problem outlined in French; congratulates all participants in the national final, who came from local authority and independent schools from all over Scotland, for their success in winning through to the final of a very challenging competition, and congratulates in particular the team from Stewarton Academy who fought off tough competition, dropping only one point in the process, to be declared outright winners.
