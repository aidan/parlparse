*S3M-966 David McLetchie: Human Trafficking—That the Parliament commends the work of Amnesty International and Lothian and Borders Police who have joined forces to host the Slave Britain exhibition at Edinburgh Airport; hopes that this exhibition raises awareness among staff and passengers of the horrendous trade in human beings into Scotland; notes that the trafficking of human beings is hugely profitable for traffickers, is therefore rising globally and will likely continue to rise in Scotland; notes the necessity of victim support for those who have been trafficked to facilitate the prosecution of traffickers, and supports the ongoing work of the police forces throughout the United Kingdom in the detection, arrest and prosecution of traffickers who profit from this immoral and criminal trade.
