*S1M-3318 Pauline McNeill: Scotland vs Israel Under 21s Football Match-That the Parliament expresses its deep concern at the recent decision by the Scottish Football Association to arrange a fixture on 4 September 2002 between the Scottish and Israeli under-21 football teams whilst the state of Israel flaunts its illegal actions against Palestinian citizens in the face of international condemnation and successive UN resolutions; notes that Israel denies young Palestinians their right to participate in international football tournaments by refusing to accept that there are two sets of people, Israelis and Palestinians, requiring two separate and independent states; is further concerned that under Israeli conscription, the under-21 team members will be serving soldiers in the Israeli Defence Force which is conducting a war of attrition against innocent Palestinian civilians in the occupied territories and which has obliterated Palestinian sports facilities, denied Palestinian football teams the right to travel to play matches, and closed down and driven tanks through Palestinian schools and universities playing fields, and calls on the Scottish Football Association to recognise the strength of opposition to this fixture and postpone the match until the day that Scottish, Israeli and Palestinian youths can play football together on an equal basis and in a spirit of friendship and recognition.
