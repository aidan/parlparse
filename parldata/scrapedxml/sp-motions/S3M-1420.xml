*S3M-1420 Christine Grahame: St Andrew’s Medal—That the Parliament believes that a special award should be commissioned to reward acts of civilian bravery and recognise exemplary acts of gallantry by individuals in, or meriting recognition by, Scotland; notes that the UK Government presently issues its own gallantry medal to its subjects in the form of the George Medal, depicting St George of England slaying a lion, but that the Scottish Government currently has no formal method to recognise acts of bravery and heroism by its own citizens, and therefore urges Scottish ministers to consider instituting an award for bravery, entitled the St Andrew’s Medal, as a way to recognise and acknowledge acts of great bravery by individuals in Scotland.
