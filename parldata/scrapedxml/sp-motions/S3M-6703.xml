 *S3M-6703 Kenneth Gibson: It’s Scotland’s Oil—That the Parliament notes the recent exceptional oil find made in the Catcher field in the North Sea off the coast of Aberdeen worth an estimated $23 billion, one of the largest discoveries in a decade; observes oil and gas firms rushing to further develop North Sea fields, with bids for 356 development blocks, the largest number since the first licensing round in 1964; considers with regret that Scotland’s oil continues to fund Westminster’s nuclear weapons and illegal wars when an enormous oil fund could have been created for Scotland’s people instead; further notes the recent Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (GERS) figures, which showed that an independent Scotland would see a budget surplus of over £1 billion while the UK is struggling with a deficit of almost £50 billion; considers it contradictory for Scotland’s unionist parties to effectively argue that Scotland is a parasitic burden while at the same time fighting tooth and nail for Scotland’s natural resources to be sent south; considers the case for financial independence to never have been stronger although expects that such an event would bring attempts by the London-based parties to prevent Scotland from laying claim to North Sea oil; notes that, in previously confidential advice to ministers, Professor McCrone said that an independent Scotland could be transformed by oil revenues and become a leading power in Europe; considers that the BBC article at news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4303750.stm recognises that the then Labour government deliberately lied to the Scottish people about the extent of North Sea oil wealth and that UK governments have since tried both to minimise Scotland’s economic potential and undermine its national self-confidence; looks forward to a time when Scotland and its people will, through independence, be allowed to realise the country’s full economic potential as Norway has, and calls on the Chancellor of the Exchequer to transfer Scottish oil and gas wealth into the hands of the Scottish people.
