 * S2M-3150 Mr Brian Monteith: Justice and Mercy?—That the Parliament notes the decision to reject the opportunity to display Alexander Mylne’s 1637 statues of Justice and Mercy; supports the opinion of Duncan Macmillan, Professor Emeritus in the History of Scottish Art at the University of Edinburgh, that “a parliament that has no place for Justice and Mercy is either too feeble to exercise such fundamental virtues of government, or else too unprincipled to care about them”, and calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to accelerate the establishment of its advisory body for the display of art and artefacts in the Parliament and to take a decision to ensure that Justice and Mercy are part of the new Scottish Parliament. Supported by: Alex Johnstone*, Murdo Fraser*, Brian Adam*, Mr Ted Brocklebank*
