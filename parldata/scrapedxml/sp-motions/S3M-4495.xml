 *S3M-4495 Dave Thompson: Interest Rate Cap Required—That the Parliament expresses dismay at the irresponsible lending practices in Scotland whereby legal credit lenders are able to charge borrowers extortionate interest rates, often affecting the most vulnerable members of society who become consumed in a debt spiral, forced to borrow further in order to repay previous debts; is concerned that, at a time when the UK base rate is 0.5%, mainstream lenders and store cards charge interest rates of 30% and higher, with over 45,000 people in Glasgow alone borrowing at a rate of 164%; notes that the UK is the only EU country not to have a legal cap on interest rates, and calls on the UK Government to introduce immediately a legal limit on interest rates to protect vulnerable consumers, strengthen the economy by stabilising lending practices and ensure that lenders as well as borrowers are required to act responsibly.
