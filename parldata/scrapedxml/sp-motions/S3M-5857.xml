* S3M-5857# Elaine Murray: Local News Coverage in the South of Scotland—That the Parliament notes that the current news coverage provided by ITV Tyne Tees &amp; Border consists of a six-minute opt-out for the former Border region plus 21 minutes of coverage from Tyne Tees; is concerned that residents in Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders are receiving a disproportionate amount of news content that is of little relevance to them; believes that residents in the South of Scotland are being disadvantaged compared with the rest of Scotland with regard to coverage of matters relating to the activities of the Scottish Parliament, and further believes that the UK Department for Media, Culture and Sport’s proposals to fund regional TV pilots provides an opportunity for bidders to offer a half-hour current affairs programme relevant to the South of Scotland and thereby build up capacity in TV broadcasting and stimulate the creative industries across the region.
