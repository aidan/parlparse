*S1M-3445 Irene McGugan: Chris Hoy Track Cycling Success—That the Parliament congratulates Scottish cyclist Chris Hoy on winning gold in the Men’s 1 km time trial at the Track Cycling World Championships, held in Copenhagen between 25 and 29 September 2002; further congratulates Chris Hoy on adding this significant and well-deserved success to his Commonwealth Games title won in Manchester in August 2002; regrets that Chris Hoy, along with other professional Scottish cyclists, is forced to further his cycling career away from Scotland owing to the lack of an adequate all-weather facility at the Meadowbank velodrome in Edinburgh, currently the only velodrome in Scotland; supports the urgent need to provide such all-weather sporting facilities for both "elite" cyclists and others interested in pursuing a healthy and active lifestyle, many of whom are young people and children, and urges the Scottish Executive and sportscotland to provide the funding necessary to the creation of these facilities.
