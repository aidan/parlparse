*S2M-5196 Shona Robison: HMRC Rationalisation—That the Parliament is disappointed by the recent announcement from Her Majesty’s Revenues and Customs (HMRC) concerning the rationalisation of work which will result in up to 90 civil service jobs leaving Dundee; is disappointed by the way in which the announcement was communicated to workers and their union representatives; calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Westminster to urge the reversal of the decision to centralise work and cut jobs, and agrees with the PCS union that if further job losses occur they will render the HMRC unfit for purpose.
