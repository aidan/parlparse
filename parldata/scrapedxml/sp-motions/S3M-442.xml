 *S3M-442 Des McNulty: Retention of Our Lady of Loretto’s Church, Dalmuir—That the Parliament notes that the Archdiocese of Glasgow has indicated to parishioners that the Our Lady of Loretto’s Church in Dalmuir, Clydebank will no longer be used as a place of worship; recognises that this church was one of the few buildings in Clydebank to survive the Blitz in 1941; further notes the central place that this building occupies in the life of the community of Dalmuir, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work with the Archdiocese of Glasgow, West Dunbartonshire Council and local people to ensure that an appropriate alternative use is found for this important building, retaining it as a landmark in the Dalmuir area.
