 *S1M-919# Fergus Ewing: Scottish Raptor Working Group—That the Parliament believes that the report of the Department of the Environment, Transport and the Regions’ Raptor Working Group does not reflect the particular circumstances and problems in Scotland; believes that there should be a Scottish Raptor Working Group established and that this should include within its membership representatives from all relevant organisations and bodies especially those whose livelihood depends upon the rural economy including representatives of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association, the Scottish Landowners Federation, the Scottish Association for Country Sports, the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, the Scottish Homing Union and Scottish Natural Heritage; furthermore expresses its concern that growth in the population of certain raptors may have been at the expense of the population of pigeons, songbirds, grouse and other ground nesting birds and that certain groups espousing conservationist causes appear unwilling to accept that the protection of one bird species may result in the predation of others, and believes that the membership of any Scottish Raptor Working Group should not be dominated by such bodies professing a conservation objective.
