*S1M-2498 Trish Godman: Overcrowding of Trainsâ€”That the Parliament regrets the lamentable failure of ScotRail to deal with overcrowding of trains; believes that it is a matter of serious concern in respect of not only passenger comfort but also passenger safety; is of the view that passengers should be guaranteed seats when purchasing their rail tickets, and calls upon ScotRail to address this issue in the interests of their long suffering customers and passengers.
