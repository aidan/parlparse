*S2M-1683 Mike Pringle: Congratulations to All at South Edinburgh Healthy Living Initiative—That the Parliament congratulates all the staff and volunteers at South Edinburgh Healthy Living Initiative for the work they have done in its first year of operation, including setting up health walks, advising of damp problems in homes, offering support to new mothers in feeding their babies, providing support for parents of difficult teenagers, offering stress management courses and running cookery classes for those on low incomes, and hopes that this scheme can be used as a model in other local authorities in dealing with the chronic problem of unhealthy lifestyles.  *S2M-1682 Jackie Baillie: NHS Argyll and Clyde’s Clinical Strategy Review—That the Parliament recognises the strength of public opposition to the proposals in NHS Argyll and Clyde’s clinical strategy review; notes that over 4,000 protestors took to the streets on Saturday 4 September 2004 to protest against the proposed downgrading of the Vale of Leven Hospital and the closure of the Dumbarton Joint Hospital and the Helensburgh Victoria Infirmary; congratulates Save our Services, the Vale of Leven Hospital Services Forum and the GMB Trade Union for organising the demonstration; recognises the anger and frustration that the proposals have generated; believes that NHS Argyll and Clyde should maximise services at the Vale of Leven Hospital and consider the use of Gartnavel Hospital and the Golden Jubilee National Hospital for specialist services; urges the Minister for Health and Community Care to defer any decision until the national framework is in place in 2005, and asks the minister to reject any clinical strategy that fails to adequately demonstrate regional planning.
