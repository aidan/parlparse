 *S3M-3244 Jackie Baillie: School Shelters—That the Parliament recognises the importance of outdoor facilities for young people at school; believes that, while it is important that newly built or refurbished schools have state-of-the-art facilities internally, more attention should be paid to the landscaping of the grounds within the overall school campus; notes that Scotland enjoys more than its fair share of inclement weather and that pupils are often unable to take breaks outside in the fresh air, causing congestion in the school building, such as occurs at Hermitage Academy in Helensburgh; accordingly believes that shelters should be an integral part of the outdoor facilities in school campuses so that pupils can enjoy the outdoor area, and calls on the Scottish Government to include this in any guidance issued to local authorities about the design of the school estate.
