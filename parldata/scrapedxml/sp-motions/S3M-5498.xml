 *S3M-5498 Margaret Mitchell: Red Cross Supporting Scotland through the Snow—That the Parliament commends the vital emergency relief and support that Red Cross teams are providing to snowbound communities across Scotland and notes that specially adapted Red Cross four-wheel-drive vehicles have been transporting people in Falkirk and Grangemouth to and from hospital and that, across Scotland, dedicated volunteers and staff continue to provide essential health and care services and to support Scotland’s statutory authorities, while in Bellshill, Cumbernauld and Glasgow Red Cross wheelchairs have been allocated to people who have injured themselves as a result of the weather, thus reducing pressures on NHS stocks.
