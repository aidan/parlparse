 *S3M-6532 Mary Scanlon: Carers and Young Carers in Remote and Rural Areasâ€”That the Parliament acknowledges during Carers Week, from 14 to 20 June 2010, the specific needs of carers and young carers in rural and remote areas; acknowledges the work done by the Princess Royal Trust for Carers, Connecting Carers, the Moray Carers Project and other carers centres across rural Scotland in reducing isolation and enabling carers to have a life of their own and connect with other carers; further acknowledges the work that these centres do in helping young carers access the support that they need to achieve and move on successfully into adult life, and notes that it is believed that these services will face significant funding challenges now and in future, despite the invaluable contribution that carers make and the lifeline services that carers centres and projects provide to 50,000 carers and young carers across Scotland.
