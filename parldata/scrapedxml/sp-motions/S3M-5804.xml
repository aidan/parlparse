*S3M-5804 Ian McKee: Edinburgh Named Europe’s Best Small City of the Future—That the Parliament congratulates the City of Edinburgh for being named Europe’s best small city of the future for a second successive year by fDi Magazine’s European Cities and Regions of the Future; notes that the award was judged on seven criteria including quality of life, business friendliness and economic potential; further notes that the city also came out on top in the best economic potential category, which took into account gross domestic product and employment growth; considers that this award reflects Edinburgh’s qualities as a city with a highly skilled workforce, a flourishing and competitive business community, globally recognised expertise in financial services, human and animal life sciences and the creative industries and an excellent quality of life, and believes that this award will provide an essential boost to the city’s confidence following the country’s deep economic recession.
