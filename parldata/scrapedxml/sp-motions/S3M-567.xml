 *S3M-567 Liam McArthur: Orkney Schools Lead Scotland on Standard Grades—That the Parliament notes that 90% of S4 pupils in Orkney attained five or more standard grades; further notes that this is a higher percentage than in any other Scottish local authority area and is well above the Scottish average of 75%, and congratulates the Orcadian pupils and their teachers for these excellent results which must be the result of both first-rate teaching and sustained hard work by the pupils.
