*S3M-3769 Marilyn Livingstone: Town Centre Development—That the Parliament recognises the importance of town centres as a site of local economic and social activity and the key role that they play in Scotland’s economic future; believes that town centres must be supported during the current economic downturn; notes with concern the closure of many establishments key to town centre economic activity in Kirkcaldy and the need for town centre regeneration in Burntisland and Kinghorn, and recognises the need to work with public and private stakeholders to improve town centres across Scotland.
