 *S1M-2825# Pauline McNeill: Shipbuilding on the Clyde—That the Parliament welcomes the blueprint for the long-term future for shipbuilding on the Clyde announced on 4 February 2002, as set out in the report of the Clyde Shipyards Task Force and, in particular, the re-training agreement with Transco for those who will be made redundant to fill a skills shortage for gas central heating installers and gas operatives; notes that the recommendations in the report, if implemented, will ensure that the shipbuilding industry has the skills and infrastructure in place to compete successfully for work coming on stream over the next 10 years; further notes the planned £75 million investment in the Clyde shipyards by BAE Systems, and believes that the Scottish Executive should continue working with the Task Force, the Scotland Office, employers and trade unions to ensure the co-ordination of short- and long-term measures to protect skills and jobs on the Clyde.
