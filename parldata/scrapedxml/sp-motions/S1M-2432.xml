*S1M-2432 Tommy Sheridan: Benefits Agency Industrial Actionâ€”That the Parliament supports the current industrial action being taken by members of the PCS at Benefits Agency offices throughout Scotland in pursuit of their demand for the retention of safety screens in the new Jobcentre Plus offices; finds it unacceptable that Benefits Agency workers should be exposed to increased physical attacks from members of the public without adequate protection; believes that these workers on the front line of government services should be able to expect that their concerns are addressed promptly and in full, and recognises that, until these workers are adequately resourced to deliver realistic benefits and compassionate services, they will require the retention of these screens.
