*S3M-2269 Aileen Campbell: Scotland’s Youth Say "Hear Our Voice"—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Hear Our Voice report by NCH Scotland, which publishes the results of its survey among young people of their priorities for public policy in Scotland; notes that the top priority was reducing poverty, the second was tackling homelessness and the third was providing better access to leisure and recreational opportunities; believes that these chime well with the Scottish Government’s ambition for a fairer, healthier Scotland and represent an encouraging commitment to social justice on the part of Scotland’s young people, and calls on all MSPs, government and civil society in Scotland to continue listening to and learning from young people.
