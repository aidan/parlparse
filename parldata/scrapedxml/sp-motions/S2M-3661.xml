 *S2M-3661 Mr Andrew Arbuckle: World Heritage Site Status for the Forth Rail Bridge—That the Parliament supports the continued inclusion of the Forth Rail Bridge on the UK Tentative List for World Heritage Site Status; considers that the bridge has outstanding universal value and cultural qualities and should therefore be awarded this status; believes that Historic Scotland, the Scottish Executive and Fife Council should back the motion passed by the City of Edinburgh Council to support the inclusion of the bridge on the list; considers that the UK Government should make the appropriate representations to UNESCO, and believes that the award of this status for the Forth Rail Bridge would be a welcome addition to Scotland’s four other World Heritage Sites. Supported by: Mr Jim Wallace*, Mr Jamie Stone*
