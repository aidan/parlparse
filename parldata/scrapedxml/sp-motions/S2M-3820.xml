*S2M-3820 Shiona Baird: Proposed Closure of Environmental Research Stations—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by the Natural Environment Research Council (NERC) to close four UK environmental research stations, including one at Banchory, which form part of the Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology (CEH);  expresses regret that this would result in the redundancy of up to 200 staff; believes that the proposed restructuring has the potential to damage the world-class environmental research into biodiversity, climate change, air pollution, water and environmental sustainability issues which is currently carried out by CEH; further believes that the proposal serves to undermine the Scottish science base and degrade the policy advice provided to key stakeholders such as the Scottish Executive, Scottish Natural Heritage and the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, and urges NERC to reconsider its restructuring plans as a matter of urgency. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
