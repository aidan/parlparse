 *S3M-6868 Willie Coffey: Community Service Hit the Medals at First Attempt—That the Parliament congratulates East Ayrshire Council Community Service for its award-winning display at Ayr Flower Show 2010; notes that the display, which celebrated 50 years of Ayr Flower Show and won two prestigious awards, a silver gilt medal and first place for the most innovative garden, was the team’s first exhibit at the show; notes in particular that more than 20 offenders, aged from 16 to 65, undertaking community service were involved in this display, using planning, design, gardening and construction skills to bring the project to completion, and welcomes the decision to relocate the award-winning display to the Rosebank Daycare Centre in Kilmarnock where it will be maintained by community service squads for the rest of the summer.
