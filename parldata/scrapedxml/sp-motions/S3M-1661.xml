*S3M-1661 Jamie Hepburn: Zimbabwe Vigil in Glasgowâ€”That the Parliament sends its support to the organisers of a regular vigil in Glasgow to protest against human rights abuses in Zimbabwe; regrets the continuing food shortages, monetary crisis and political instability in Zimbabwe, ahead of national elections on 29 March 2008, and believes that people across Scotland should show support for the vigil as a means of showing solidarity with people in Zimbabwe and expressing desire for a peaceful and democratic end to the crisis.
