*S3M-2475 Sandra White: Hospital Car Parking Charges Abolished—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Scottish Government to abolish car parking charges at NHS hospitals across Scotland; notes that these charges have been criticised by members of all political parties as a tax on the sick and believes that this decision reaffirming the founding principles of the NHS, namely that it should be free at the point of delivery, is one that should be welcomed across the political spectrum.
