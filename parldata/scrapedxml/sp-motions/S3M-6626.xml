*S3M-6626 Alasdair Allan: Taxation on Lifeline Air Routes—That the Parliament expresses concern at the effects that proposals to replace air passenger duty (APD) with a per plane tax will have on remote and rural communities in Scotland; notes that, under current tax rules, passengers departing from Highlands and Islands airports and those flying on any service operated by aircraft with less than 20 seats or 10 tonnes maximum take-off weight are exempt from APD; believes that any proposed change is likely to force airlines to reduce the number of flights that they operate as their planes will need to be full in order to make them profitable; considers that the Highlands and Islands are dependent on lifeline air routes and will be directly affected by any change in air tax; further believes that the added tax will result in increased costs, a reduction in services and a greater unreliability, and notes that the Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander MP, commenting in 2007 on previous plans to introduce per plane tax, stated that it would be "…a serious blow to the Highland economy…" and "…a reversal of the Government’s recognition" that the services are a lifeline to the Highlands and Islands".
