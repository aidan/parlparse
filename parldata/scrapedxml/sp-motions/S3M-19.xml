 *S3M-19 Ross Finnie: A Renewables Revolution for Scotland—That the Parliament believes that the moratorium on onshore renewables developments resulting from the planning review proposed in the SNP’s 2007 manifesto would be damaging to the renewables companies working in Scotland and would have a negative impact on the industry’s confidence and commercial success; is concerned that this could lead to Scotland missing existing renewable electricity targets; believes that Scotland should lead the world in a renewables revolution with more investment in wave, wind and tidal power; recognises the economic potential of exporting our expertise and creating thousands of new jobs and billions of pounds of new investment; believes that 100% of Scotland’s electricity should come from renewable sources by 2050, and further believes that this ambition should be the basis for the future energy policy of the Scottish Executive. Supported by: Tavish Scott*, Jim Hume*, Jim Tolson*, Alison McInnes*, Liam McArthur*, Jeremy Purvis*, Iain Smith*, Margaret Smith*, Mike Rumbles*, Mike Pringle*, John Farquhar Munro*, Robert Brown*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Nicol Stephen*, Hugh O’Donnell*
