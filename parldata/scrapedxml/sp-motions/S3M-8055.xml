*S3M-8055 Sandra White: Glasgow UK’s Best Convention Bureau 5th Year Running—That the Parliament congratulates everyone at Glasgow City Marketing Bureau on its being named the UK’s Best Convention Bureau at the 2011 Meetings and Incentive Travel Awards for what is considered an amazing fifth year in a row; sees this as a prestigious endorsement that is invaluable in showcasing Glasgow as one of the top international destinations for conferences and conventions; understands that such success has brought in over £600 million to Glasgow’s economy in the last five years, and further believes that, alongside the completion of the £74 million Riverside Museum, Scotland’s new national arena at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre in 2013 and the major works associated with the 2014 Commonwealth Games, this will help to ensure that Glasgow continues to flourish as one of the most attractive cities for people from the rest of the UK and abroad to visit and do business in.
