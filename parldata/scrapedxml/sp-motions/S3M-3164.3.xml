*S3M-3164.3 Rhona Brankin: National Qualificationsâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-3164) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, insert at end "; is therefore concerned at the continued lack of clarity over the implementation of the Curriculum for Excellence (CfE) within the new examinable framework; highlights the need for parents, teachers and other stakeholders to be involved to a far greater extent in developing the CfE and for teaching staff in particular to be given the time and investment needed to develop materials for it; believes that literacy and numeracy are central to the development of the CfE; believes that it is unacceptable that fewer than half of P7 pupils are well established in reading; calls on the Scottish Government to establish an assessment regime for basic literacy in primary schools, linked to individual programmes for pupils who have failed to attain adequate literacy skills, with the expectation that all pupils should leave primary school functionally literate, and calls for a greater show of leadership and direction from the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning."
