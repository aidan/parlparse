 *S3M-2971.1 Patrick Harvie: Right of Suffrageâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-2971) in the name of Stuart McMillan, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "considers that the increasing use of non-custodial sentences raises a question as to why only prisoners, and not other convicted offenders, should be prevented from voting, and further considers that, even if the bar on prisoners voting remains, a distinction must be made between prisoners serving long sentences who cannot expect to be at liberty during the electoral term in question and those serving a very short sentence that simply happens to coincide with a particular election."
