*S1M-2684# Cathy Peattie: Draft Guidance on the Circumstances in which Parents may Choose to Educate their Children at Home-That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive's consultation on the draft Guidance on the Circumstances in which Parents may Choose to Educate their Children at Home; believes that this will provide an opportunity for the views of children and parents, who clearly have concerns about the content of the draft guidance, to be taken into account, and further believes that the right to choose education outwith school should be facilitated with due respect for data protection and human rights legislation and that the guidance should not discriminate unreasonably between those children who have never attended and those who are removed from state schools.
