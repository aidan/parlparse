*S2M-1941 Christine Grahame: Borders Rail: Delay on Business Case—That the Parliament notes the comments of David Quarmby of the Strategic Rail Authority in The Scotsman on 2 November 2004 that the business case on purely transport grounds "looks rather weak frankly" and that "I believe the section as far as Gorebridge may have a strong business case, but the project beyond that has much weaker value for money"; further notes with concern the delay by the Scottish Executive in announcing a decision anent the business case for the reinstatement of the Waverley Line from Galashiels to Edinburgh; reminds the Executive that the Parliament unanimously endorsed the restoration of the line from Edinburgh to Carlisle on 1 June 2000, that the business case was received by the Executive on 9 June 2004 and that a holding answer regarding a decision on the business case was sent to Christine Grahame MSP on 30 September 2004, and, in light of all of the above, calls on the Executive to deliver its response now.
