 *S3M-2354 Dr Richard Simpson: Lost Without Words Campaign—That the Parliament welcomes the Stroke Association’s Lost Without Words campaign, which aims to raise awareness of the impact of stroke-related communication disability; notes that thousands of people in Scotland are currently living with this problem; recognises the real and lasting benefits of communications support in improving communication skills, restoring self confidence and helping reintegration into families and the wider community, and encourages NHS boards to seek more information about this disability by routinely collecting data on the incidence of stroke-related communication disabilities and plan services accordingly, which recognise ongoing communications support as a vital component that must be fully integrated into the stroke care pathway.
