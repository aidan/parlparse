*S2M-81# Pauline McNeill: Planning Law —That the Parliament welcomes the forthcoming Planning Bill proposed by the Scottish Executive in the consultation paper Your place, your plan: A White Paper on Public Involvement in Planning; considers that the consultation is of extreme importance in assessing the outstanding needs to improve our planning law; believes that there is a particular need to build in greater fairness for local residents affected by planning decisions and that changes to the law should include a qualified right of appeal against decisions of the planning authority for those directly affected by a planning decision; further believes that there must be improvements in the neighbourhood notification system and a new right for objectors to receive some expert assistance to present their case; believes that, as the relevant elected representatives, MSPs should be directly notified by the Scottish Executive of planning appeals received from within their constituencies, and considers that the Executive should consider fully these changes and ensure that the process of decision making in planning is open and transparent at both local authority and Executive level.
