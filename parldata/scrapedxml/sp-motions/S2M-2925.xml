 * S2M-2925 Mr Andrew Welsh: Remembering the Special Friendship Between Scotland and Norway—That the Parliament supports the Montrose Bamse project to celebrate the 100th anniversary of Norway’s independence and the special friendship between Scotland and Norway; recognises that for the allied Norwegian troops the Norwegian St Bernard dog, Bamse, became a symbol of freedom against the Nazi occupation; notes that Bamse captured the hearts of the people of Montrose and that his last years were spent as a crew member of the minesweeper, Thorodd, in Montrose where he died and was buried in 1944; further notes that Bamse has since been remembered by the Norwegian navy and Montrose residents and that, in memory of the special relationship with Norway, Montrose Heritage Trust is raising £50,000 to erect a statue by the sea facing Norway, and seeks the support and good wishes of all MSPs in this Scottish/Norwegian celebration.
