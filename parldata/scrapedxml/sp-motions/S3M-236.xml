*S3M-236 Alasdair Morgan: Devolved Fuel Duty—That the Parliament commends the right held by the French government to vary fuel duty under certain circumstances; notes that this policy could lead to cuts in fuel duty of up to 3% in rural areas; considers this to be a valuable means of alleviating a proportion of the financial burden on rural drivers who often rely on private transport to access essential services, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consult the other devolved legislatures with a view to presenting a case in favour of this policy to the UK Government.
