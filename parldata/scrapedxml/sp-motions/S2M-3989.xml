 *S2M-3989 Richard Baker: AUT Pay Campaign—That the Parliament supports the campaign by the Association of University Teachers (AUT) for better pay for academic and related staff; notes that the AUT is taking strike action on 7 March 2006, supported by NUS Scotland, and boycotting assessment activity from 8 March 2006 onwards; further notes that academic salaries have declined by 40% in real terms in the last 20 years; considers that fair pay in universities and colleges is essential for the recruitment of well-motivated academic staff on whom we rely to create a highly skilled economy in Scotland, believes that the Scottish Executive has acted to ensure that the investment in higher education will enable staff to be better paid and address problems of recruitment and retention of academic staff, and calls on university principals to increase staff salaries through the new funding, as promised in their spending review submission.
