 *S2M-2110 Chris Ballance: Safeguarding Rural Shops—That the Parliament notes with alarm that proposals being considered by the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) to deregulate the system of wholesale distribution of newspapers and magazines could jeopardise the guaranteed distribution of publications to rural retailers, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the OFT without delay to guarantee consumers continuing access to a wide range of reasonably priced publications and diminish the threat of closure to rural village shops.
