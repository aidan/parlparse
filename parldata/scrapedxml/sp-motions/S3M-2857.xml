*S3M-2857 Bill Kidd: A Right Belter—That the Parliament congratulates the People’s Postcode Lottery, a lottery for charities in Scotland that was launched in November 2007 and has since raised over £1 million for Maggie’s Cancer Care Centres, Children 1st and the Scottish Wildlife Trust; further notes that on St Andrew’s day the Postcode Belter will see the biggest prize pot so far with a cool £1 million going to the lucky winners, and wishes all Scots the best of luck on the day.
