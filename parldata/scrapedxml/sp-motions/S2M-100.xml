*S2M-100 John Swinburne: Recognition of Kinship Care—That the Parliament recognises that many grandparents have become the new foster care parents of children whose mothers and fathers have become disconnected from mainstream society; acknowledges that such care arrangements are more stable and have a positive impact on the young person as a result of grandparents’ strong sense of values in respect of providing care, but share concerns about the financial consequences experienced by grandparents in providing this care, should they have to leave work early or reduce their working hours, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to recognise this form of kinship care by giving it the attention and social work resources that it deserves and by making recommendations to Her Majesty’s Government to offer these grandparents, many of whom are pensioners, the same level of financial support as other foster carers.
