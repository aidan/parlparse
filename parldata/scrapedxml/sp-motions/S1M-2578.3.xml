 *S1M-2578.3 Tommy Sheridan: Scottish Executive's Priorities-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2578) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, insert at end "furthermore, accepts that the delivery of first class public services by well-paid and motivated public service workers is incompatible with the continued use of PFI/PPP methods of public service financing; resolves therefore to end the havoc of service and staff reductions caused by PFI/PPP and instead to ensure adequate funding of public service expansion and improvement through public investment dedicated to the needs of all Scotland's citizens, instead of through PFI/PPP which is dedicated to the delivery of profit to private corporation shareholders, and resolves that 2002 should become the Public Investment in Public Services year, delivering tangible improvements in public services throughout Scotland and improving significantly the wages and working conditions of the army of currently underpaid and undervalued public service workers."
