 *S3M-6389 Sarah Boyack: Captain Taylor’s Kitchen—That the Parliament congratulates Streetwork UK on securing planning permission to develop a new café that will be staffed by homeless people; notes that Captain Taylor’s Kitchen aims to help to rehabilitate homeless staff by providing on-the-job training and a steady income and that money raised by the project will help fund Streetwork’s other projects in Edinburgh, including the reopening of the Ark Café soup kitchen; further notes that Streetwork intends to have the café open in time for the 2010 Edinburgh Festival, with the Ark Café reopening shortly afterwards, and wishes Streetwork every success in implementing its plans.
