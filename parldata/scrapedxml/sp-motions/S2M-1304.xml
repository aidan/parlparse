*S2M-1304# Bill Butler: Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital-That the Parliament acknowledges the pioneering work carried out at the in-patient unit of the Centre for Integrative Care at Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital in Glasgow Anniesland; notes that this service offers treatment for people with difficult chronic problems and is based on a multi-disciplinary "whole person care" model; recognises the excellent results achieved and the cost-effectiveness of this approach; welcomes research that clearly shows the substantial relief of suffering effected; believes that this unique example of patient-centred care, education and research deserves to be imitated; views with dismay reports that this service is to be closed by Greater Glasgow NHS Board in order to achieve cost savings; opposes any such proposal, and considers that the Scottish Executive should support the continuation of appropriate homeopathic care within the NHS. Supported by: Bristow Muldoon*, Richard Baker*, Mr Kenneth Macintosh*, Ms Wendy Alexander*, Mike Watson*
