 *S3M-6746 Karen Whitefield: Campaign to Save Newhouse from Closure—That the Parliament is disappointed at the news that MSD, formerly Organon, plans to close its research facility at Newhouse, North Lanarkshire; observes that this would result in job losses for approximately 250 highly trained scientists who have undertaken pioneering research in the field of life sciences; considers that the site provides valuable funds for collaborative research and plays a pivotal role in the training of student scientists; considers that the closure of the plant would be a considerable blow to the scientific and academic communities in Scotland, and calls for a cross-party campaign to save the Newhouse facility and safeguard the jobs of its employees.
