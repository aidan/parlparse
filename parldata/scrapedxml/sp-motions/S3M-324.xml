*S3M-324♦ Liam McArthur: Supporting Renewables in the Highlands and Islands—That the Parliament notes the proposals of Ofgem on zonal transmission losses; regrets that the recommendations, coupled with transmission charges and business rates, could see Scottish renewables projects, particularly those in the Highlands and Islands, put at a disadvantage by paying on average 22% of turnover on regulatory costs, while in southern England generators would in effect be receiving a subsidy, and considers that urgent representations should be made to the UK Government to ensure that Scottish renewables projects are not disadvantaged and to consider a reduction in business rates for renewables generators.
