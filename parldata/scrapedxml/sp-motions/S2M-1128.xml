*S2M-1128 Mr Adam Ingram: National Depression Week, 19 to 25 April 2004-That the Parliament recognises that one in five people will suffer from depression at some point in their lives and considers that National Depression Week will highlight the problem; notes the sharp increase in prescription of medication for depression with little or no psychological support and the continued use of the anti-depressant Prozac for those under 18; considers this to be an intolerable situation, and calls for the support and resources required to enable a holistic approach to treating depression to be put in place as a matter of urgency.
