*S1M-358.1 Mr Alex Salmond: Sea Fisheries—As an amendment to motion (S1M-358) in the name of Mr John Home Robertson, insert at end "negotiate the transfer of lead responsibility for European Union fisheries negotiations from Her Majesty’s Government to the Scottish Executive, in recognition of Scotland’s dominant position within the UK industry; pursue a control regime for the Scottish industry that does not place it at a competitive disadvantage in comparison to other EU fleets, and influence the forthcoming reform of the Common Fisheries Policy by bringing forward proposals to introduce the concept of zonal management thereby involving the industry itself in the decision-making process, whilst maintaining the founding principles of the original agreement, namely relative stability, the Hague preferences and historic fishing rights, to re-affirm that the Common Fisheries Policy is not a free-for-all.
