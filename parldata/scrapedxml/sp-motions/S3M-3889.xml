*S3M-3889 Tricia Marwick: MS Awareness Week—That the Parliament notes that MS Awareness Week will take place from 27 April to 3 May 2009 with the theme of misconceptions about multiple sclerosis (MS) and the impact that these can have on the lives of people living with the condition; believes that, as around one in 500 Scots have MS, it is crucial that service providers and the general public have a greater understanding and awareness of MS and how it affects individuals and families, and commends the MS Society Scotland for the work that it does to raise awareness and provide support for people affected by the condition.
