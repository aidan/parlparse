 *S3M-6398Kenneth Gibson:Afghan Heroin—That the Parliament notes with concern the ever-increasing presence of opium production in Afghanistan and its ill-effects on Scotland and the wider world; observes that many counter-narcotics policies have been less than effective and is disappointed that Afghanistan has grown to supply 93% of the world’s heroin while under Allied control; regrets the growing dependence on opium of Afghan youth and notes the linkage of this dependence to the future security and stability of the region; remembers an Afghanistan where orchards of apricots and pomegranates filled the landscape rather than the poppy fields of today and sees these as potential alternatives; is concerned by the worldwide damage created by the opium trade, with 30,000 annual drug-related deaths in Russia alone where heroin addiction is best described as a tsunami; acknowledges Russia’s rebukes to NATO for allegedly standing by while opium production continues under its nose and petitions NATO to accept outside assistance; seeks a robust and balanced counter-narcotics policy whereby eradication efforts are part of a wider strategy that focuses on long-term alternative livelihoods and combating corruption, and hopes that greater progress will be made in containing this scar on the global community.
