 *S3M-1233 Richard Baker: Speedy Progress Required On Haudagain Roundabout in Aberdeen—That the Parliament supports the Aberdeen Evening Express’ campaign, "Our Fight to Fix Jam", which aims to speed up action to tackle traffic congestion at the Haudagain roundabout; notes that the roundabout is among Scotland’s worst congestion hotspots, costing businesses every year and causing considerable delays to commuters; notes that it has been estimated that the Haudagain could now be costing the north-east economy upwards of £30 million a year in lost productivity, trade and extra fuel for the 20,000 vehicles that use it at peak times and can result in delays of up to 30 minutes; notes that consultation on making improvements to the roundabout has been delayed, and believes that consultation should be carried out and acted on expeditiously and should include the option of a flyover.
