*S1M-2525# Mr Duncan McNeil: Railtrack and the Gourock Projectâ€”That the Parliament notes with dismay the decision by Railtrack plc not to support four Scottish Executive funded enhancement projects, including the project at Gourock train station; recognises that this decision has a particular impact on the Gourock project as it jeopardises the future of the joint capital project between Railtrack, the Scottish Executive, Inverclyde Council and private companies to redevelop the Gourock waterfront; further notes that this project, which would include an integrated transport hub, offers substantial benefits to the Inverclyde economy, and asks Railtrack, as a matter of urgency, to reconsider this short-sighted decision before the project is lost and the people of Inverclyde are robbed of a major economic opportunity.
