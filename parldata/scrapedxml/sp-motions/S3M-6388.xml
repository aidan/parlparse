*S3M-6388 Jim Tolson: Forth Rail Bridge—That the Parliament considers that the Forth Rail Bridge should be nominated as a world heritage site; acknowledges that there is widespread recognition that world heritage status is a deeply advantageous accolade, bringing responsibilities for protection and preservation as well as rewards in terms of tourism and investment, and understands that the bridge meets UNESCO’s criteria for the assessment of outstanding universal value and is regarded as a world-class industrial archaeological monument and that world heritage status is an acknowledgement of the global significance of such a site.
