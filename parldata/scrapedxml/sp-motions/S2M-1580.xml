*S2M-1580 Mr Stewart Maxwell: More Powers for Scotland-That the Parliament welcomes the findings of the State of the Nation 2004 survey, carried out by the Joseph Rowntree Reform Trust, which found that 66% of people living in Scotland wanted the Parliament to have more powers; recognises that only by having these powers can the Parliament and the country truly begin to fulfil their enormous potential, and urges all members to follow the public mood and campaign for all the normal powers of a sovereign nation to be transferred from Westminster to Holyrood forthwith.
