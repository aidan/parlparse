*S3M-5484 Joe FitzPatrick: Malawi Anti-homosexual Arrest—That the Parliament condemns the arrest and treatment by the Malawian authorities of Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga, two men who were arrested on 28 December 2009 and charged with unnatural practices between males and gross public indecency; condemns the attempts of the Malawian authorities to subject the men to forced anal examinations; considers the arrest to be discriminatory, homophobic and illegal and to violate equality and non-discrimination clause 20 of the Malawian Constitution, the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights and international human rights documents, and calls on the Scottish Government to urge the Malawian authorities to release the two men immediately and unconditionally, to ensure their safety on release, to end the criminalisation of homosexuality in Malawi, to halt the reported police harassment of and the legal proceedings against HIV educators and human rights defenders from the Centre for the Development of People (CEDEP), three workers of which have been arrested following their public defence of the men and apparently as a result of their HIV education work with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people, and to continue to support the rights of LGBT people at both domestic and international level.
