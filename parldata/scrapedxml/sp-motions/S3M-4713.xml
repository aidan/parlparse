*S3M-4713 Liam McArthur: Arctic Convoys Memorial at Lyness—That the Parliament welcomes the planned unveiling, on the 22 August 2009, of the Arctic Convoys memorial at Lyness; further notes that this will provide long overdue recognition of the bravery and sacrifice of the many people who took part in the convoys which carried vital supplies to Russia and on which some 3,000 British and allied seamen lost their lives; believes that it is fitting that the memorial should be sited at the former naval base at Lyness on the shores of Scapa Flow, the base for the Home Fleet which provided the naval protection for the merchant ships in the convoys; applauds the international co-operation between Orkney and Russia which has resulted in the construction of the memorial, and notes that Orkney and Russia will be represented at the unveiling ceremony by the Convener of Orkney Islands Council, the Chairman of the Parliament of the Province of Ugra and the Consul General of the Russian Federation.
