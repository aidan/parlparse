*S1M-2122 Ian Jenkins: Bus Company Competition and the Needs of the Passenger—That the Parliament believes that aggressive competition between bus companies within the Edinburgh travel to work area is detrimental to the long-term interests of passengers as demonstrated by the withdrawal of services from outlying areas whilst companies compete for control of the most profitable city centre routes; believes that this trend is unsustainable, running contrary to the aims of the Executive’s integrated transport policies, and urges Ministers to work with the area’s local authorities to assess whether powers bestowed by the Transport (Scotland) Act 2001 can be used to ensure that stable and dependable bus services are maintained at an appropriate level for bus users in settlements outside Edinburgh. Supported by: Robin Harper*, Margaret Smith*
