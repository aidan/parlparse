*S3M-6271 Ms Wendy Alexander: Save the Foundation, Charities Unite against Lloyds Banking Group—That the Parliament welcomes the renewed campaign to save Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland; considers the importance of this well-respected funder to communities and charities across Scotland and the vital contribution of £85 million made to those communities since 1985; notes the latest call from Scotland’s voluntary sector for Lloyds Banking Group to reverse its decision to terminate its historic covenant with the foundation; believes that the decision of the bank is a cynical one, putting the interests of this taxpayer-funded bank before the needs of disadvantaged communities across the country; welcomes the petition that can be found at www.savethefoundation.org, calling on Lloyds Banking Group to reinstate the covenant, and wishes the campaign well.
