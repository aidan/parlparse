*S1M-3306 Tommy Sheridan: Greater Glasgow Acute Services Reviewâ€”That the Parliament notes the decision of the Minister for Health and Community Care to support the Greater Glasgow NHS Board plan for acute hospital services across Glasgow; believes that this decision fails to take account of overwhelming opposition expressed by citizens throughout Glasgow to the reduction of acute receiving centres to only two for the whole city; further believes that the Greater Glasgow NHS Board did not properly consult the citizens of Glasgow about its plans and ignored the response to the limited consultation that took place which rejected the proposals to reduce the status of both the Victoria and Stobhill Hospitals; has no confidence in the ability of the Greater Glasgow NHS Board to reflect the opinions or demands of the Glasgow population; further believes that the proposals will leave Glasgow inadequately served in relation to emergencies and the number of acute receiving beds across the city, and calls on the Minister for Health and Community Care to reconsider his position and refuse to support the unrepresentative proposals of the Greater Glasgow NHS Board.
