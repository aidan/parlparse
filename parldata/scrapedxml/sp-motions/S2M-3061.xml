S2M-3061 Ms Sandra White: Napalm and Iraqâ€”That the Parliament notes the recent admission by Adam Ingram, Minister of State for the Armed Forces, that the US army used Mark 77 firebombs, "which are essentially napalm", in Iraq; further notes that napalm has been banned by the United Nations since 1980 and that, as well as causing horrific burns, napalm removes all the oxygen from the strike area so that it is only possible to survive this deoxygenation by being on the extreme periphery of the target area, and believes that it is the duty of the Parliament to highlight the use of these terrible weapons in Iraq and to campaign actively against their continued use in Iraq and elsewhere. Supported by: Michael Matheson, Campbell Martin
