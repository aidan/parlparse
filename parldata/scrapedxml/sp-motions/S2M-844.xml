*S2M-844# Carolyn Leckie: Hutton Report-That the Parliament notes that there are widespread allegations that the Hutton Report is a cover-up conducted by a hand-picked member of the British legal establishment who previously represented British soldiers in the now discredited Widgery Inquiry into Bloody Sunday which many consider covered up the role of British paratroopers; views the attacks on the BBC in the Hutton Report as an attempt to create a climate of fear and intimidation within the organisation and further evidence of moves towards the suppression of free and open reporting within the UK; congratulates all BBC staff in Scotland and the rest of the UK for taking action in defence of journalistic integrity within the organisation; is outraged at the apology offered to the government by the former political secretary to Margaret Thatcher who is now acting chair of the BBC Board of Governors, and further considers that the war against Iraq was based entirely on a tissue of lies and therefore that the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, should resign.
