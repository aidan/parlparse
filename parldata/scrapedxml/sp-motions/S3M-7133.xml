*S3M-7133 Robin Harper: HIV Infectionsâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the figures for HIV infection for Scotland and, in particular, Edinburgh, which were released on 30 September 2010 showing a significant rise in HIV infection across the community; recognises the importance of education in sexual health in schools, extra support that social services can supply and the role that health services can play in delivering preventative strategies; believes that there is no room for complacency, and urges the Scottish Government to consult urgently with all stakeholders to ensure an appropriately effective and early response to the situation that appears to be developing.
