 *S2M-4078 Maureen Macmillan: Solar Panels at Culduthel Farm—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Tulloch Homes of Inverness to install solar panels as standard in over 80 houses which they are building at Culduthel Farm; notes that this will make a significant contribution to reducing heating bills for the residents and will also save a tonne of carbon dioxide emissions on average per house, and urges other private builders to install solar panels or other micro-renewables as standard.
