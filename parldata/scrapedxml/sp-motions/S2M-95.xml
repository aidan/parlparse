*S2M-95 Mike Pringle: Edinburgh Fringe and International Festivalâ€”That the Parliament acknowledges the importance of the role of the Edinburgh Fringe and International Festival in the annual calendar of Scottish tourism and its huge magnetism for the global tourism market; notes the wealth of jobs it gives rise to, both in Edinburgh and throughout Scotland; recognises the difficulties faced by the organisers this year in the wake of the fire in the Cowgate area of the city, both in finding alternative venues and promoting a "business as usual" image to the international market, and urges the Scottish Executive to work with VisitScotland to ensure that the festival organisers have the necessary support and assistance to make this year's festival a success.
