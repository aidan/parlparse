*S2M-2224# Murdo Fraser: Perth City Bid—That the Parliament notes that Perth, whilst an ecclesiastical city, does not have the legal status of city conferred on Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee, Aberdeen, Inverness and Stirling; recognises Perth’s historical and present day importance to Scotland and its contribution to Scotland economically, culturally and socially; believes that Perth has all the qualities that are taken into account when a place is being considered for city status, including notable features, regional significance, history, and a forward-looking attitude; is concerned that, without legal city status, Perth does not gain the benefits that the six legal cities in Scotland enjoy, for example in relation to Scottish Executive funding or as the centre of possible future city regions for planning purposes; believes, therefore that Perth deserves full legal recognition of city status, and considers that when the next opportunity arises for a Scottish bid for the creation of a new city the Scottish Executive should support a bid from Perth.
