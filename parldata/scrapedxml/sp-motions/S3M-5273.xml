*S3M-5273 Bill Wilson: A Limit to Pay Differentials in Publicly Funded Organisations—That the Parliament, in view of research by Professors Richard Wilkinson, Kate Pickett and Richard Layard suggesting that an unequal society is unhealthy and unhappy and that even the wealthiest in very unequal societies suffer significant disbenefits, calls on the Scottish Government to set a limit to pay differentials in publicly funded bodies such as universities and local authorities, such that the remuneration of the best-paid staff does not exceed that of the worst paid by a factor of, for example, 10, and also calls for the disbenefits associated with high pay differentials to be explicitly considered in all public procurement decisions.
