 *S1M-1091.2 Mary Scanlon: Modernisation in the NHS-As an amendment to motion (S1M-1091) in the name of Susan Deacon, leave out from first "the Scottish" to end and insert "that the delivery of a modern NHS requires both resources and reform; calls upon the Scottish Executive to abandon those policies which foster a spirit of divisiveness, to adopt policies which will restore the morale of the health service workers at all levels and to work with medical professionals and relevant authorities to address the need for investment in equipment and training and ensure that the Â£135 million underspend is fully committed to benefit patient care, and further calls for the development of a new approach to long-term and community care through unified health and social work budgets."
