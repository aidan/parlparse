*S2M-3368 Mr Mark Ruskell: Climate Change Emissions Figures—That the Parliament considers that the apparent reduction in greenhouse gas pollution since 1990, from 5.7% last year to 10.1% this year, as announced by the Scottish Executive during the Environment and Rural Development Committee debate on its inquiry report on climate change, was because of a change in the way the emissions were calculated and not because of any reduction in emissions last year; notes, indeed, that there was no reduction in Scotland’s carbon dioxide emissions and that there was a less than 0.5% reduction in total greenhouse gas emissions in the last year, and calls on the Executive to act on the recommendations of the Environment and Rural Development Committee’s 5th Report, 2005 (Session 2): Report on Inquiry into Climate Change.
