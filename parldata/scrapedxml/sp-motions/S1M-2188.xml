*S1M-2188# Ms Sandra White: Glasgow Underground Privatisation Threat-That the Parliament notes the legislation on the award of public service contracts in passenger transport currently under consideration in the European Parliament; recognises that this legislation would force public transport to be put out to competitive tender and could lead to the part privatisation of Glasgow's underground system; notes that this could have serious implications for the efficient and safe running of this key part of Glasgow's public transport system, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the European Parliament requesting it not to pass any legislation forcing the privatisation of any part of our public transport system.
