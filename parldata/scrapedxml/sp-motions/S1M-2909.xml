*S1M-2909# Tommy Sheridan: Underfunding of Glasgow City Council in Respect of Roads Maintenance, Winter Maintenance and Street Lighting -That the Parliament believes that Glasgow City Council is badly underfunded in terms of Grant-Aided Expenditure (GAE) in respect of roads maintenance, winter maintenance and street lighting; notes (a) that GAE for roads maintenance is calculated using a standard set of parameters, based on carriageway length without taking account of road width, except in the case of dual carriageways, additional funding also being granted for principal roads and roads constructed over peat, (b) that Glasgow, in common with other cities, has a large number of roads greater in width than is standard, resulting in, for example, a five-lane road such as Hope Street, which is not untypical in the city, receiving the same allocation as a single track road in Argyll, (c) that Glasgow City Council is adversely affected by parameters concerning the lengths of roads classified as principal routes, i.e. routes that link population centres, whereby Glasgow, as a population centre, is linked to other such centres by roads of which the majority of the length lies in other authority areas, such as (i) Perth and Kinross Council area through which principal routes pass in order to link centres outwith the authority area and where 433km of such routes account for 18% of total road network and (ii) Western Isles Council area where 333km of principal routes constitute the main road network and account for 28% of total road network, compared with 132km of principal routes in the Glasgow City Council area which account for only 7% of total road network, (d) that the parameters on lengths of principal routes do not result in the calculation of a figure that is fair to urban authorities and, consequently, a secondary factor is applied, based on the number of private light goods vehicle licences registered within the local authority area, which, as an indicator, is also of little use as light goods vehicles and cars do little damage to the structure of the road compared with heavy goods vehicles (HGVs), (e) that the registration of HGVs cannot be used as a measure as, for example, they are registered at the address of the company's headquarters which is not necessarily located in the area in which the vehicles operate, (f) that buses similarly have a more detrimental effect on roads and, whilst roads in rural areas may only see two or three buses a day, 2,780 buses use Hope Street in Glasgow each day, (g) that other factors not considered for the purposes of calculating GAE include (1) commuting, tourism and shopping, which are obviously major issues for Glasgow but for few other authorities and almost none of the rural authorities, (2) drainage of rainwater from roads, which, in Glasgow, necessitates the maintenance of a network of road gullies whilst in rural areas rainwater drains into adjacent fields and ditches, (3) footways, which, in Glasgow, are often wide in order to cope with large numbers of pedestrians whereas there are often no footways on rural roads and (4) the provision of street furniture, such as signs, pedestrian barriers, bollards and traffic control, which is more widespread in Glasgow than in rural areas, (h) that, in cities, there are many more customers for public utilities which, in turn, leads to more excavation of carriageways and subsequent re-instatement to a standard that leads to potholes and general deterioration of the road surface, whilst in rural areas such excavations are few and far between leading to fewer potholes and a more homogeneous surface and (i) that, in Glasgow, almost all roads are lit whilst in rural areas only a small percentage of roads are lit; considers that the combined effect of such factors is such that, in comparison with local authorities that are responsible for rural areas, Glasgow is considerably worse off, and further considers that the method of calculating GAE in respect of roads maintenance, winter maintenance and street lighting should be changed and improved in order to deliver more adequate funding for Glasgow City Council and for other urban authorities.
