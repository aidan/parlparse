*S3M-5580 Jackie Baillie: Fairness for Thalidomide Survivors in Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the recent statement of regret from the Right Honourable Mike O’Brien QC MP, Minister of State for Health, for the pain and suffering endured by thalidomide survivors and their families; further welcomes the pilot scheme of £20 million to explore a more personalised way of meeting their health needs; congratulates the National Advisory Council of the Thalidomide Trust for successfully campaigning to ensure that the needs of thalidomide survivors are adequately met by health and care services; recognises that the trust will use its expertise and knowledge to distribute money to survivors to minimise deterioration of their condition, which is likely to reduce long-term demands on the NHS; further recognises that almost 30% of survivors live in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; warmly welcomes the decision of the Northern Ireland Assembly to contribute funding over and above the £20 million for pilot schemes, and calls on the Scottish Government to commit resources for similar pilots to meet the assessed health needs of those people who have suffered the effects of the drug, thalidomide, and invest in preventative care for thalidomide survivors in Scotland.
