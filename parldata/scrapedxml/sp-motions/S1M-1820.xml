*S1M-1820 Mr Mike Rumbles: Proposed Health Professions Council—That the Parliament notes that Her Majesty's Government intends to regulate 12 health professions as if they were a single profession, including chiropodists/podiatrists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, radiographers, dieticians, speech and language therapists, medical laboratory scientific officers, prosthetists and orthotists, orthoptists, arts therapists, clinical scientists and paramedics; further notes that this approach does not take account of the lack of similarity in the qualifications for, and clinical practice of, these professions; believes that there should be parity of treatment for all health professions with self regulation for chiropodists and podiatrists as well as doctors, nurses, midwives, dentists and others; notes that, at the time the enabling legislation passed through the House of Lords, it was stated by Her Majesty’s Government that the Health and Social Care Bill would "provide stronger self-regulation" but that the Department of Health consultation paper gives no details of how uni-profession input will be secured, and suggests that most matters can be dealt with on a multi-professional basis; believes that commitments made at the time the Health and Social Care Bill’s passage through Westminster should be respected; further believes that the proposals ignore devolution and disenfranchise Scotland, as well as Wales and Northern Ireland, by not recognising that each country should have effective national representation from each of the professions to be regulated, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government to work more closely with the Society of Chiropodists and Podiatrists, and other professions concerned, and bring forward new proposals that command greater professional support and will provide better protection for the public.
