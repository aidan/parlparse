*S2M-4428 Sarah Boyack: The Energy Challenge—That the Parliament believes that the argument for new nuclear build in the United Kingdom has not been made; notes that, even with an accelerated planning system, new nuclear power stations could not contribute either to plugging the "energy gap" or to carbon reductions by 2020 when existing electricity generating capacity is run down and carbon emissions have to be curbed; further notes that existing Scottish electricity generation is provided 22% by gas, 26% by coal, 35% by nuclear and 13% by renewables but that around 17% of electricity generated in Scotland is exported; further notes that massive investment in new infrastructure across the UK is providing for a diversity of gas supply from many countries including Norway, with Russian gas only contributing around 1%, and that new clean coal technologies are now available; also notes that the supply of wind power is growing faster than predicted and that in Germany wind power capacity is already equivalent to UK nuclear capacity; further believes that new nuclear build would be inconsistent with environmental sustainability, adding to the legacy of highly toxic nuclear waste and the huge public cost of decommissioning and storage; urges the Scottish Executive to see the bigger picture in which electricity accounts for just 19% of total energy consumed in Scotland and carbon emissions by sector were last recorded as 17% transport, 11% domestic, 12% business and 37% energy supply, and further urges the Executive to recognise the enormous potential for reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions by energy efficiency and conservation, greater use of combined heat and power and rapid investment in the full range of renewable technologies, including microgeneration and biomass.
