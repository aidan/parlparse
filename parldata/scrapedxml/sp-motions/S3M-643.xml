 *S3M-643 Kenneth Gibson: Turkish Membership of the European Unionâ€”That the Parliament notes the work of the successors of Kemal Ataturk in attempting to build a modern, secular Turkish Republic that looks outwards and towards Europe; believes that Turkish membership of the European Union would undoubtedly bring significant benefits to the Turkish people, but is nevertheless of the view that Turkish membership of the EU should not be considered until Turkey (1) abandons its military occupation and colonisation of North Cyprus, (2) accepts that the genocide of more than one million Armenians took place during the First World War and was carried out by Turkish forces on Ottoman territory, (3) allows Kurdish citizens the right to speak their own language, celebrate their own culture and move towards self-determination if they so wish and (4) ensures that the democratic and human rights of all Turkish citizens are respected.
