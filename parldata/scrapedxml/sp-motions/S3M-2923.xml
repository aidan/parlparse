*S3M-2923 Robert Brown: Clydeside Action on Asbestos—That the Parliament congratulates Clydeside Action on Asbestos on winning the Public Campaign of the Year at the Scottish Politician of the Year Awards 2008; notes that for 23 years the group has campaigned tirelessly to raise awareness of asbestos-related diseases and to fight for the rights of victims of asbestos exposure; further notes the group’s successful campaign to secure the Rights of Relatives to Damages (Mesothelioma) (Scotland) Act 2007, which means that victims no longer have to decide whether to claim damages for themselves or wait so that their relatives can claim after their death with the possibility of obtaining a greater level of compensation; welcomes also the campaign to secure the Damages (Asbestos-related Conditions) (Scotland) Bill, which will restore the right to claim damages to those who suffer from pleural plaques as a result of exposure to asbestos, and looks forward to a time when the work of Clydeside Action on Asbestos and other asbestos campaign groups is no longer needed.
