*S3M-6369 Jack McConnell: Why Women Can’t Wait—That the Parliament recognises what it considers to be the vital, yet unrecognised, role that women play in the fight against hunger; believes that poor women hold the key to tackling hunger and malnutrition because they are largely responsible for buying, selling, cooking and growing food in the developing world, yet they remain largely overlooked by current agricultural policies; recognises that there are over a billion people going to bed hungry each night, the majority of whom are women; commends Concern Worldwide for its Woman Can’t Wait campaign, which seeks to highlight this important issue with world leaders in advance of the UN Millennium Development Goals summit in September 2010, and encourages people to sign up to the Woman Can’t Wait campaign in order to send a strong message to decision makers that urgent action on hunger is needed, these remarkable women can’t wait.
