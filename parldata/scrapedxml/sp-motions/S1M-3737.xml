*S1M-3737 Pauline McNeill: Noise Pollution-That the Parliament notes the increasing number of complaints of domestic, industrial and street noise; notes the noise impact of the increasing popularity of wooden and laminate flooring in tenement dwellings reducing noise insulation of which many people are not aware; recognises the need for tighter regulation over particular noise pollution such as construction works in residential areas and the rules generally allowing all types of activity seven days a week until 1am with few restrictions; believes that there should be one clear day in the week free from construction noise in residential areas, and considers that there is a need for either new legislation or more restrictive hours applied to certain types of activity with respect to the relevant sections of the Civic Government (Scotland) Act 1982.
