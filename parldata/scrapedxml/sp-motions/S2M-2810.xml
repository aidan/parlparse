 * S2M-2810 Carolyn Leckie:Solidarity with the NUJ and BECTUâ€”That the Parliament recognises the magnitude of the anger demonstrated by the recent NUJ and BECTU industrial action ballot results; applauds the solidarity expressed by their membership but deplores the actions of BBC management that have led to the imminent dispute, and believes that the BBC should take urgent action to begin meaningful negotiations and reach agreement with the trade unions to secure employment and quality public service broadcasting.
