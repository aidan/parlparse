*S3M-7701♦ Jamie Hepburn: Possible Introduction of Car Parking Charges at Croy Railway Station—That the Parliament welcomes the opening of a new park-and-ride facility at Croy Railway Station in Central Scotland; considers this development to be long-overdue and believes that it will improve the travel and commuting experience for thousands of rail passengers in Croy, Cumbernauld, Kilsyth and beyond; notes that, in its submission to Transport Scotland’s 2009 consultation on station car parking policy in Scotland, North Lanarkshire Council stated its position that "station parking charges would probably only be required in town centres or other areas where they might be used by non-rail travellers."; therefore notes with concern reports that North Lanarkshire Council is considering the introduction of a daily charge for users of the facility; believes that a charge for use of the park-and-ride will have a negative economic impact on travellers who currently rely on the car park as part of their daily journey and would act as a disincentive for drivers who might otherwise choose to complete their journeys by rail via Croy Station, and believes that a consultation with station users on these plans would show a lack of support for car parking charges at Croy Railway Station.
