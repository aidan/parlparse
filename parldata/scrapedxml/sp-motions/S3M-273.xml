 *S3M-273# Brian Adam: MacMillan Cancer Support’s Recovered but not Covered Campaign—That the Parliament condemns the extortionate premiums charged by many travel insurance firms to cancer patients or persons with a history of cancer treatment, which often lead to their travel insurance prices being considerably higher than journey costs; acknowledges that this problem will worsen with growing numbers of people diagnosed with cancer and living longer who want or need to travel; recognises its impact on patients and their families in Aberdeen North and elsewhere in Scotland; furthermore supports MacMillan Cancer Support’s Recovered but not Covered campaign which seeks to make it easier for people affected by cancer to get fair travel insurance prices, and welcomes joint research between MacMillan and the Royal Bank of Scotland to investigate how cancer sufferers can obtain fairer travel insurance, but considers that these discriminatory and insensitive charges should be ended by other insurance companies. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Bob Doris*, Malcolm Chisholm*, Bill Wilson*, Rob Gibson*, Michael McMahon*, Bill Kidd*, Jamie Hepburn*, Stuart McMillan*, Ian McKee*, Christina McKelvie*, Elaine Smith*, Kenneth Gibson*, Christine Grahame*, Alex Neil*, Sandra White*, Cathie Craigie*, Dave Thompson*, Joe FitzPatrick* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
