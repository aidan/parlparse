*S3M-7428 Marilyn Livingstone: World COPD Day—That the Parliament notes that Wednesday 17 November 2010 is World Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) Day, an annual event organised by the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease to improve awareness and care of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; notes with concern that the prevalence of COPD has more than doubled in the last two decades, killing more women than breast cancer and more men than prostate cancer and making it the fourth biggest cause of death in the United Kingdom; believes that events such as World COPD Day are important in raising the profile of the disease and its causes and encouraging people to have their symptoms checked as soon as possible, and congratulates the British Lung Foundation and Breathe Easy Kirkcaldy and other Breathe Easy groups across Scotland for promoting the importance of respiratory health and providing support and information to those with lung conditions.
