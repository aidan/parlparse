*S3M-703 Tavish Scott: Faroe - Shetland - Orkney - Scotland Fibre Optic Cable Link—That the Parliament welcomes the news that the Faroese telecom company, Føroya Tele, has completed the laying of its £16 million SHEFA-2 fibre optic cable which connects Faroe to Scotland via Shetland and Orkney; notes that this places the islands at the heart of the North Sea information superhighway, and encourages BT and other telecommunications companies to grasp the opportunity that the cable provides to upgrade the service they provide to their island customers and so make the islands even more attractive to businesses and people wanting the benefits of an island environment with 21st century communications.
