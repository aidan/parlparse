 *S2M-4445&lt;&gt; Cathy Peattie: Carers Week 2006—That the Parliament notes that 12 to 18 June is Carers Week 2006; recognises the valuable work of national and local carers’ organisations, such as Carers Scotland and the Falkirk and Clackmannanshire Carers Centre which this year celebrates its 10th anniversary; recognises the importance of supporting carers in employment and enabling them to fulfil their caring and work responsibilities without detriment to their own health and well-being; notes that the health of the Scottish economy depends on the health and well-being of unpaid carers and their ability to juggle work and care; further notes that recent research has shown that 58% of carers who provide a substantial amount of care give up work because of their caring responsibilities, and believes that the Scottish Executive, local government and employers should consider and support the adoption of flexible alternative care solutions and carer-friendly working arrangements to give more carers the opportunity to remain in, or take up, employment.
