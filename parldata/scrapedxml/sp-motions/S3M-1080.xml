*S3M-1080 Elaine Smith: Outlawing Prostitution—That the Parliament supports the recent commitment by the Leader of the House of Commons, Harriet Harman MP, to work towards outlawing prostitution, as is already the case in Sweden; congratulates her for her recent action to prevent local newspapers from carrying adverts for brothel services which are believed to be linked to human trafficking, and urges ministers to increase funding in Scotland for work that challenges the demand for women to be traded for men’s sexual gratification and to provide more services to enable women to exit prostitution, drawing on existing good practice.
