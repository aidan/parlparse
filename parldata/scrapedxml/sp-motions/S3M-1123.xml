*S3M-1123 Kenneth Gibson: Scientific Whaling - Commercial Whaling in Disguise—That the Parliament condemns the ongoing actions of the Japanese whaling fleet, which on 18 November 2007 left Japan for the Southern Ocean to kill 935 minke whales and 50 fin whales for scientific whaling; considers scientific whaling, carried out primarily by Japan and Norway, to be cruel, unnecessary, barbaric and nothing more than commercial whaling in disguise, and supports the work of organisations such as Greenpeace which monitors whaling fleets to show the world the terrible cost of scientific whaling and campaigns to secure a global ban on this needless slaughter.
