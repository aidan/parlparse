*S1M-2163.1 Mr Adam Ingram: Erskine Bridge Tolls Bill-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2163) in the name of Sarah Boyack, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "does not agree to the general principles of the Erskine Bridge Tolls Bill because it wishes first to examine the whole issue of bridge tolling and requests that the Transport and the Environment Committee stages an inquiry into the economic and legal impact of bridge tolls in Scotland and makes recommendations on what legislation, if any, is required."
