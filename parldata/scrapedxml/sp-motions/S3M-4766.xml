*S3M-4766 Jamie Hepburn: Celebrating 40 Years of Cumbernauld Colts Football Club—That the Parliament congratulates Cumbernauld Colts Football Club on reaching its 40th anniversary in 2009, having been formed as Cumbernauld new town’s first youth football club in 1969; notes that the club went into a period of decline with a reduction in the number of teams being run till the last remaining team was disbanded during the 1998-99 season before being reformed in 1999; further congratulates those involved over the 10-year period since the club was reformed for growing the club to 22 teams, including a number of boys’ teams, two girls’ teams, an under-21 team and an adult male amateur team; commends the club for becoming the first in the central region to be awarded the SFA Quality Mark Community Level award in August 2008, and wishes the various Cumbernauld Colts teams all the best for this football season and the club in general well for the future.
