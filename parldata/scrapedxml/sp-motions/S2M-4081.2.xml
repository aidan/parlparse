*S2M-4081.2 Tommy Sheridan: Agriculture Strategy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4081) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "recognises the current crisis in world agriculture based on the fact that food is produced for profit and not for communities; calls on the Scottish Executive to implement a strategy that addresses poverty and hunger, manages natural resources sustainably and produces primarily for local markets rather than for export, and recognises that people in every country must have the right and ability to define their own food, farming, and agricultural policies, the right to protect their domestic markets and the right to maintain public subsidies that support economically, socially and environmentally sustainable production, ensuring safe and affordable food for all members of society, these rights being fundamental to the world’s citizens’ demands for political sovereignty, democracy and peace."
