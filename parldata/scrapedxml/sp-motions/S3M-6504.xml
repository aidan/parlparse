*S3M-6504 Willie Coffey: 2014 Commonwealth Games Legacy—That the Parliament welcomes the allocation of funding from the Big Lottery Fund’s 2014 Communities Programme; notes that this is the first programme in Scotland to support community groups and organisations to build a legacy from the 2014 Commonwealth Games; welcomes, in particular, the award of £1,000 to Stewarton Academy to support boys’ and girls’ football and basketball teams; endorses the aims of the 2014 Communities Fund to encourage more people to take part, or volunteer, in sport or physical activity and to foster community cohesion, and calls on the UK Government to back these aims by releasing to Scotland the estimated £165 million of Barnett consequentials that should have been generated by regeneration work related to the 2012 London Olympics and the estimated £150 million of lottery funding diverted from good causes in Scotland to support the London Olympics.
