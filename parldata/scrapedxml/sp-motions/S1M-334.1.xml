*S1M-334.1 Bill Aitken: Equalities—As an amendment to motion (S1M-334) in the name of Jackie Baillie, leave out from "and to" to end and insert "regardless of race, sex, class or faith and further recognises that this will not be achieved by positive discrimination or politically correct strategies which label people as categories, but by a commitment to limited government and enhanced personal freedom."
