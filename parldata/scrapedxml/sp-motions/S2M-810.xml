*S2M-810 Carolyn Leckie: Saudi Arabian Ambassador's Reception-That the Parliament notes the US Department of State's report on Saudi Arabia which states that Saudi citizens have "neither the right nor the legal means to change their government", that "security forces continued to abuse detainees and prisoners, arbitrarily arrest and detain persons, and hold them in incommunicado detention", that "the Government prohibits or restricts freedom of speech, the press, assembly, association, religion and movement" and that "other continuing problems included discrimination and violence against women, discrimination against ethnic and religious minorities, and strict limitations on worker rights"; believes that it is completely unacceptable for any member to accept an invitation to dine with the Ambassador of Saudi Arabia, Prince Turki Al Faisal, on 26 January 2004 in Edinburgh as he is an official representative of a dictatorial and oppressive regime, and calls on all members to boycott this reception.
