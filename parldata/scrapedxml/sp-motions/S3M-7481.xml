*S3M-7481 Bill Kidd: No Place for Prejudice in Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes that the individual responsible for posting hateful anti-Semitic comments on The Scotsman website in March 2008 has been given a deferred sentence of 12 months, having plead guilty to the charges; commends the work of the police and the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in bringing this case to court, and considers that this reaffirms the message that racism, or prejudice of any kind, has absolutely no place in Scotland.
