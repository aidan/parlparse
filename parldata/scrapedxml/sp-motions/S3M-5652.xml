*S3M-5652 Robert Brown: Scottish Government Blocking Public Right to Freedom of Information—That the Parliament is appalled at the Scottish Government’s refusal to provide information to applicants under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 when the request is in the form of a request for a copy of a document; considers that the attitude of the Scottish Government on this matter is a transparent breach of the obligations imposed on the Scottish Government under the Act; notes the terms of the Scottish Information Commissioner’s Guidance on validity of FOI requests following Court of Session Opinion on 30 September 2009, dated 27 January 2010, that a public authority that is asked for a copy of a document should respond to the request as one properly made under the Act if it reasonably clear that the request is for the information contained in the document; urges the Scottish Government and its directorates and agencies to carry out their obligations under the Act fully and in a spirit of maximum transparency, and condemns the actions of any government that seeks to keep secret important information to which the public has a right of access.
