 *S1M-3897# Mr Kenneth Gibson: Suicide Emergency Telephone Hotline—That the Parliament notes with concern that in 2000 there were 880 reported suicides in Scotland, 676 males and 204 females, although the true figure could be higher; is conscious that many thousands of other people attempt to take their own lives each year; regrets that only a minority of the population know the telephone number of the Samaritans or any other organisation they could contact for help when feeling suicidal; believes that, to assist in achieving the goal of a 20% reduction in the incidence of suicide by 2013 set by the Scottish Executive in its National Strategy and Action Plan to Prevent Suicide in Scotland, everyone should be made aware of an all-Scotland telephone number to call for help; acknowledges that in the United States anyone can call a nationwide toll free number from anywhere in the country, 1-800-SUICIDE or 911, to ask for help which is provided swiftly if they say they are in ‘suicidal danger’; believes that the Scottish Executive should set up a suicide prevention crisis hotline, whereby calls from suicidal individuals are treated as an emergency, through using the existing 999 emergency number from which they can be referred directly to a dedicated suicide prevention 24-hour hotline, and further acknowledges that the purpose of this line would be to save lives through dissuading suicidal people from killing themselves and that the Executive should, once such a line was established, take steps to let the public know about it.Supported by: Colin Campbell*, Linda Fabiani*
