 *S2M-4606 Mr Stewart Maxwell: European Football Championshipsâ€”That the Parliament believes that holding major sporting events, such as the European Football Championships, in Scotland brings enormous benefits, including the opportunity to promote Scotland on the world stage; recognises that these benefits would be accompanied by the opportunity to enhance the Scottish tourist industry and to promote sport and healthy living to the next generation; acknowledges that for such a bid to be successful it must involve the combined effort of the Scottish government, the Scottish football authorities and the public and private sectors all working together to secure the tournament for Scotland, and urges the Scottish government to throw its weight behind a Scotland-only bid for the European Football Championships.
