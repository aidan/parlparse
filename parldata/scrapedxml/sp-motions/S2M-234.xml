*S2M-234 Carolyn Leckie: United Kingdom Cabinet Should Resign-That the Parliament sends condolences to the family of Dr David Kelly; considers his death to be another waste of human life, in addition to the deaths of over 7000 civilians caused by the unjustified and continuing slaughter of the war and occupation of Iraq; recognises that the declared justification for war by the Blair-led Government has been shown to have no credibility whatsoever; further recognises that the real aims of the war were to achieve domination of Iraq and all its resources and to annex the oilfields for the benefit of the American Government and its multi-billion dollar corporate backers; calls on the Scottish Executive to recognise that it was misled by Her Majesty's Government and declare that it was wrong to support the war; calls on the whole discredited United Kingdom cabinet who championed the drive to war, including the Prime Minister, to resign, and calls for the immediate withdrawal of all British forces from the region and the immediate return of Iraq's resources to the Iraqi people and for reparations to be paid for the desperate loss of life, injury and destruction of Iraq's infrastructure.
