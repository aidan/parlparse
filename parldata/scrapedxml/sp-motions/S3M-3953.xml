*S3M-3953 Cathy Jamieson: Dalmilling Golf Course—That the Parliament notes with great concern the proposal to close Dalmilling Golf Course in Ayr; recognises that Dalmilling Golf Course is a much-loved and vital public sports facility; considers that its closure would lead to a serious decline in the provision of sports facilities for local people, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to make urgent representations to South Ayrshire Council to prevent the closure of Dalmilling Golf Course.
