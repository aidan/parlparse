 * S2M-2337 Mr Kenny MacAskill:Recognition of Social Workers—That the Parliament welcomes the report, Housing &amp; Social Work: Performance Indicators 2003/2004, from Audit Scotland; recognises the positive results of the report, such as 95.5% of court reports being submitted by the due date and a 13% rise in the number of community service orders being completed, and congratulates social workers on achieving these results, despite the huge problems that persist in the recruitment and retention of staff and the obvious knock-on effect this has on the remaining staff trying to cover the caseloads of staff who have left.
