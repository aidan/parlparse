*S3M-6069 Liam McArthur: Sudden End to Home Renewables Grant and Home Loans Schemes—That the Parliament believes that the Scottish Government’s decision to bring forward the deadline for applications under the change to the Energy Saving Scotland (ESS) home renewables grant and home loans schemes without consultation or warning will unfairly penalise the very many innovative individuals looking to take forward microrenewables projects; is concerned that the way in which grants were removed and loans reduced under the ESS schemes risks undermining public confidence in schemes of this type in the future, and calls on the Scottish Government to reconsider how applicants and prospective applicants affected by the premature closure of the scheme can be helped.
