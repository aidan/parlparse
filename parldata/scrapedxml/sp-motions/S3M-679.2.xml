 *S3M-679.2 Ross Finnie: Free Personal Care—As an amendment to motion (S3M-679) in the name of Mary Scanlon, leave out from "with concern" to end and insert "the judgment of Lord Macphail on personal care and its consequences; notes with disappointment the SNP Government’s handling of this issue and recognises the need for urgent clarity to allay the concerns of older people and their families as well as to give clear guidance to service providers; calls on the Scottish Government to take the appropriate steps to provide this clarification as soon as possible, including a statement to the Parliament on the issue, and further calls on the Scottish Government to take all steps necessary to ensure that local authorities do not find that in providing free care for self-funders they are acting ultra vires."
