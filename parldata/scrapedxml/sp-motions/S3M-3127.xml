*S3M-3127 Kenneth Gibson: Keep the "Wee Paper" in Largs—That the Parliament notes with concern Clyde and Forth Press’s decision to close the office of the Largs and Millport Weekly News in Largs from January 2009, with likely redundancies, and move the remaining staff to a portakabin 14 miles south in Ardrossan; believes that this will greatly diminish the quality and community linkages of an excellent local newspaper that has faithfully served the people of Largs, Cumbrae, Fairlie, Seamill, Skelmorlie and West Kilbride from Largs for 132 years and is known affectionately by readers as the wee paper; acknowledges that many organisations have already expressed their shock at the removal of a newspaper with which they are strongly connected, on the basis of a decision about which they were not consulted; is aware that the Largs and Millport Weekly News is, by all accounts, a profitable newspaper with solid income streams; appreciates the high and loyal level of readership in the area that the wee paper serves and worries that by leaving the heart of Largs it will lose its local focus and readers and ultimately may not remain viable, and therefore calls on Clyde and Forth Press to rescind its decision to abandon Largs, allowing the Largs and Millport Weekly News to flourish in the heart of its circulation area. Supported by: Stuart McMillan*, Bill Kidd*, Alasdair Allan*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Sandra White*, Ross Finnie*, Keith Brown*
