*S2M-3573 Patrick Harvie: Dawn Raid on Ahmed Family—That the Parliament condemns the treatment endured by the Ahmed family, who were removed in a dawn raid recently from their Royston home; considers that the Home Office practice of dawn raids is unacceptable; believes that the horrific experience of the Ahmed family again demonstrates the inhumane and unnecessary methods used by the UK Government in the removal and detention of families with children prior to deportation, which cause fear and distress to the children involved as well as the wider community; further condemns the UK Government for separating 16-year-old Fahad Ahmed, who is still a child under the terms of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, from his family by deporting them to Pakistan without his knowledge; considers that any protocol which is put in place to protect the welfare of children in asylum cases must cover all children, including 16 and 17-year-olds, and calls on the Scottish Executive to demand urgently an end to the practice of dawn raids in Scotland in order to protect the welfare of the children concerned.Supported by: Christine Grahame*
