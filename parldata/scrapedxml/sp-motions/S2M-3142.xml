*S2M-3142 Patrick Harvie: Identity Cards Oversold by the Home Officeâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the acknowledgement by UK Minister Tony McNulty that the Home Office has exaggerated and oversold the advantages of an identity card and national identity register; believes that the Identity Cards Bill offers an ineffective response to problems of security and fraud and poses an unacceptable threat to civil liberties; recognises concern that ID cards could worsen harassment of minority groups by providing another pretext for stop-and-search, often directed at ethnic minorities; notes the falling public support for this impractical, unworkable and costly scheme, which has dropped from 78% to 45% in two years; further notes that any ceiling placed upon the cost of an individual card will not lessen the overall cost of the scheme to the public purse, and repeats its call for the UK Government to drop its proposals for an identity card scheme.
