*S3M-306 Bob Doris: Regulation of TV Phone-in Competitions—That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the BBC inquiry into its phone related competitions and that as a result the BBC director general has implemented an immediate suspension of all phone-in and interactive competitions and taken a number of steps to put the corporation’s house in order; further notes that issues with this form of interactive product are not confined just to the BBC but to a range of broadcasters and interactive products including Call TV quiz shows, that there is no single regulatory body to monitor this area and that ICSTIS, OFCOM and the Gambling Commission all have regulatory responsibilities, and considers that a single regulator with extensive powers must be established to police this sector effectively and that where there is strong evidence that illegal activity may have taken place, including fraud, this should be a matter for appropriate court proceedings.
