 *S3M-4254 Marilyn Livingstone: Housing Investment in Fife—That the Parliament notes with concern the acute shortage of affordable housing investment in Fife; expresses concern that Fife has received the same funding allocation for housing investment in 2009-10 as in 2007-08, with no increase; recognises the importance of this funding for Fife as a means to tackle the recession, create and sustain jobs and to deliver affordable housing, and urges the Scottish Government to ensure that Fife obtains a fair share of the estimated £53.8 million in increased funding in housing investment that will be channelled to Scotland from the UK Budget.
