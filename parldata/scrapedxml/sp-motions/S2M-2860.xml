 * S2M-2860 Brian Adam:2011 Census - Additional Question on Closure of Records—That the Parliament regrets the current unwillingness of the Scottish Executive to open the 1911 and 1921 Scottish census records; believes that this policy is mistaken, and invites the Executive to reconsider by including a new question in the 2011 census which would allow individuals to retain the 100-year closure by opting in, but otherwise opening the census records for perusal at a much earlier point, and also by consulting over what the standard closure period should be.
