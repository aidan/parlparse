 *S3M-4333 John Wilson: Citizens Advice Scotland Report on Debt Levels among CAB Clients—That the Parliament notes the publication of Drowning in Debt - Scottish CAB Clients and Debt by Citizens Advice Scotland; is concerned that the average debt levels for Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) debt clients seeking advice from their local CAB is £20,193, a 50% rise since 2003; further notes that the report highlights the bleak reality for low-income households in debt, including the finding that debt has had a negative impact on health for nine out of 10 debt clients; is also concerned at the increasingly ruthless behaviour adopted by creditors in seeking debt repayment, which at times has been unlawful; applauds Citizens Advice Bureaux in Scotland for the free, confidential and impartial frontline advice that they have provided to the people of Scotland for the last 70 years; recognizes their successes in advocating for improvements in public policy, and urges the UK and Scottish governments to assist indebted households throughout Scotland by pursuing the report’s recommendations to curb unreasonable creditor behaviour, increase access to affordable credit, increase the number of debt solutions for those on low income and ensure that advice services are appropriately resourced.
