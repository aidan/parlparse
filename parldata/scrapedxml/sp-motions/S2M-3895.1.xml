 *S2M-3895.1 Fiona Hyslop: Scottish Schools (Parental Involvement) Bill—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3895) in the name of Peter Peacock, insert at end "but, in so doing, notes that parental involvement in the management of schools as institutions is not the same as parents’ involvement in their own children’s education which should be the focus of policy, and regrets that the Scottish Executive has failed to provide detail about its proposals for the role of parents in the appointment of headteachers and senior staff before introducing the Bill or the debate and vote on Stage 1 of the Bill, noting that this is now the most contentious part of the Bill since the Executive latterly introduced proposals for elected parent councils similar to elected school boards into the Bill."
