*S3M-6700 Kenneth Gibson: Palm Oil and Deforestation—That the Parliament is concerned at the serious issue of deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia, much of it thought to be caused by the production of palm oil; recognises that palm oil has become a popular commodity that is believed to be used in 50% of all packaged supermarket products, including shampoos, soaps, chocolate, margarine and other foodstuffs; is aware that this has created huge market demand for this relatively cheap commodity, which in turn has led to the expansion of land under cultivation for palm oil from 2,000 square kilometres in 1967 to 30,000 square kilometres in 2000; acknowledges that, since then, 18,000 square kilometres have been deforested each year, much of it for palm oil production; is further aware that a recent report by the United Nations Environment Programme highlighted that 98% of Indonesia’s rain forest could be destroyed by 2022; is concerned by the environmental impact of such industrial-scale deforestation that threatens the indigenous population, local wildlife, including orangutans, elephants and tigers, and has also resulted in Indonesia becoming one of the world’s largest carbon dioxide emitters as peat-lands, which store large quantities of carbon dioxide, are cleared, drained and burned thus releasing 1,400 million tonnes of stored carbon into the atmosphere every year; notes that the increasing demand for biofuels has also played a major role in creating such massive demand as scientists identified that palm oil mixed with diesel reduces CO2 emissions from engines; considers, however, that this is a false economy as the plant would itself absorb greater amounts of CO2 in its lifecycle; is concerned that this demand could be the result of EU biofuel targets that effectively encourage businesses to adopt biofuel technology, of which palm oil is the cheapest; believes that the EU should not be setting targets on biofuel technology until mechanisms are put in place to provide sustainable sources of a variety of biofuel sources instead of creating what is viewed as a dangerous and regressive palm oil dependency, and further believes that leading manufacturers, including Kellogg’s, Cadbury, Mars, Kraft, Unilever, Premier Foods, Northern Foods and Procter and Gamble, should also do more to prevent such widescale destruction, seen ultimately as driven by their seemingly insatiable market appetites.
