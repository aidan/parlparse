*S2M-2606 Frances Curran: Jamie Oliver’s School Meals Programme and On-line Petition—That the Parliament congratulates Jamie Oliver and Channel 4 on the excellent programme "Jamie’s School Dinners" which concluded on 16 March 2005; believes that Mr Oliver has put the Westminster Government to shame in highlighting the devastating state of school food served to children in England and the consequent threat to the future health of an entire generation and, in doing so, has underlined the urgent need for government intervention; notes the petition launched by Mr Oliver’s website which urges people to sign up to the following statement: "I believe kids need a healthy diet so we need to change school dinners to ban the junk and get fresh, nutritious meals back on the plate. I support the Feed Me Better campaign"; further notes that within two days of the petition being launched, well over 50,000 people have already signed, with the number of signatures going up by the second; congratulates Hull City Council on its three-year pilot programme of providing free and healthy school breakfasts, dinners and after-school snacks to all primary schoolchildren, and the Welsh Assembly on its free school breakfasts policy for all children, and looks forward to Glasgow City Council carrying out its manifesto promise to provide free, nutritious school meals to all primary schoolchildren in Glasgow by 2007.
