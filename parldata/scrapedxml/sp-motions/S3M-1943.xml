*S3M-1943 Shona Robison: Hepatitis C—That the Parliament recognises the leading role that Scotland is taking in tackling hepatitis C as a significant public health issue; acknowledges the launch of the Scottish Government Hepatitis C Phase II Action Plan, backed by funding of £43 million, on 19 May 2008 as a significant step forward in seeking to prevent hepatitis C and in delivering testing, treatment, support and care services to those affected by the disease, and considers that this will enable NHS boards and others identified in the plan to deliver on the actions set out to improve hepatitis C services for patients and others in Scotland. Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon*
