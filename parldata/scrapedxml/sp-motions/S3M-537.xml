 *S3M-537 Patrick Harvie: Proposed Abortion Law Review—That the Parliament notes the First Minister’s view that a commission might examine the provision of abortion services in Scotland and the question of whether this should be devolved; welcomes the answer issued on 6 June 2007 to parliamentary question S3W-433, and endorses the view that, irrespective of the level of government which makes policy on this matter in future, it is essential that women in Scotland should be able to access safe abortion as well as a full range of sexual and reproductive health services.
