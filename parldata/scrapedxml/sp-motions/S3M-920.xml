*S3M-920 Kenneth Gibson: The Rights of Cohabiteesâ€”That the Parliament notes that the nature of relationships has changed over recent years and that many couples, for a variety of reasons, choose to cohabit rather than marry; is aware that many individuals have found themselves with no legal protection when their relationship breaks down after investing a great deal in it over many years; understands the need to articulate the law with regard to the rights of cohabitees clearly, given that many mistakenly believe that they have greater legal protection than they do in reality, and understands that, on the whole, it is women who find themselves disadvantaged by this lack of clarity.
