*S1M-595# Mr Kenny MacAskill: Fuel Duty Rebate and Rural Services—That the Parliament notes the difficulties faced by rural communities due to their geographic isolation and the high cost of fuel, and the vital role which mobile shops, mobile libraries, school buses and community and voluntary bus services have in such communities; further notes the threat to the viability of these services posed by increasing fuel prices; believes that assistance should be offered to sustain mobile shops, libraries, school buses and community and voluntary bus services and thus the communities they serve, and therefore believes that an inquiry should be set up to investigate the extension of fuel duty rebate to these services.
