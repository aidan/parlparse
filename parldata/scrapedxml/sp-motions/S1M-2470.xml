*S1M-2470 Michael Russell: Birthplace of John Muir in Dunbar—That the Parliament recognises that the proposals to gut the interior of John Muir’s birthplace in Dunbar and replace the internal structure with a modern one are controversial and need wide public debate; notes with concern the reservations and objections strongly expressed by the Scottish Civic Trust, the Muir family, the Sierra Club and many others which seem to have been ignored; questions the right of a small group of self appointed trustees to make such a decision without much wider consultation; is surprised by the decision of the Planning Committee of East Lothian Council to pass the proposals, given the huge weight of objections from Scotland and overseas compared to the very few indications of support; regards the permission to alter a listed building subsequently given by the Scottish Executive as hasty, and suggests to the Heritage Lottery Fund that, giving the continuing controversy surrounding this matter, a final decision on grant aid for the project is withheld pending further consultation and discussion.
