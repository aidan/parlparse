*S3M-7472 Bill Wilson: Irish Prohibition of Depleted Uranium Weapons Bill 2009—That the Parliament congratulates the chair of the Irish Green Party, Dan Boyle, on his Private Member’s Prohibition of Depleted Uranium Weapons Bill 2009 clearing its fifth parliamentary stage, and in doing so, winning praise from senators from across the Irish political spectrum and an endorsement from Dick Roche, the Minister of State at the Irish Department of Foreign Affairs, and expresses the hope that it will swiftly complete its successful passage through the Dáil; calls on the UK Government to enact similar legislation and to properly investigate the effects of depleted uranium on people and to immediately release what information it holds regarding the deployment of weapons containing depleted uranium; considers that this latter information is important in investigating the potential links between depleted uranium and cancers, birth deformities and stillbirths, and believes, with reference to motion S3M-7332 by Bill Wilson, UN Vote on Depleted Uranium, that reluctance to release such data can only lend weight to speculation that the governments of the UK, the USA, France and Israel are attempting to cover up the impact of depleted uranium on health.
