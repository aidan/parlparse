 *S2M-5476♦ Alex Neil: London Olympics Funding Shortfall—That the Parliament notes with concern press reports that indicate that an additional £51 million of Scottish lottery funding may be siphoned off to help fund the 2012 London Olympics, which are now grossly over budget with an additional £900 million having been identified as necessary thus far; heeds the concerns of the Big Lottery Fund Scotland that the demand for Scotland’s lottery cash will grow further as well as those of Sir Clive Booth, director of the Big Lottery Fund in England who has claimed that "dark forces in Whitehall" are going to use lottery monies to plug the Olympics black hole; believes that Scotland has already paid more than its fair share towards the 2012 London Olympics, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make clear the level of opposition that exists in Scotland to having Scottish lottery funds plundered to pay for the 2012 Olympic Games at the expense of grassroots sport in Lanarkshire, Ayrshire and across Scotland and of other good causes.
