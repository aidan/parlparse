*S2M-304 Susan Deacon: Banking Facilities at Post Officesâ€”That the Parliament believes that all those who currently receive pension payments, tax credit and benefits through the Post Office should be able to continue to do so; considers that the Communications Workers Union "Banking on You" campaign highlights the need to better publicise the banking facilities that Post Offices now offer; further considers that access to the Post Office Card Account should be made easier, and believes that all major banks including HSBC, HBOS, Royal Bank of Scotland and Natwest should be urged to sign up to universal banking by making all current accounts available at Post Offices.
