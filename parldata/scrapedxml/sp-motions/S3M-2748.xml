*S3M-2748 Jamie Hepburn: United Nations Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities—That the Parliament notes the decision by the UK Government not to be present at the Conference of State Parties taking place at the United Nations (UN) headquarters in New York between 31 October and 3 November 2008, which will discuss implementation of the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities; further notes that this convention is the first human rights treaty of the 21st century and that the United Kingdom is a signatory but has not yet ratified the treaty; expresses concern that the UK Government intends to opt out of the convention on crucial areas, including education, armed forces, mental capacity and asylum/immigration; believes that, since the convention allows for progressive realisation of social and economic rights, such action is unnecessary, and calls on the UK Government not to pick and choose on this issue, but to live up to its signed commitment to recognise fully the human rights of disabled people in the UK and around the world.
