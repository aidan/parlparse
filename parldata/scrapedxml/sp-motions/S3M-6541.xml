*S3M-6541 John Lamont: Borders Common Ridings—That the Parliament recognises the cultural and historic importance of the 11 common ridings and festivals across the Scottish Borders, including those at Hawick, Jedburgh, Selkirk, Yetholm, Kelso, Duns and Coldstream; notes both the rich traditions of these events, dating back to the 16th century and also their modern-day value in bringing communities together; further congratulates this year’s principals on their appointment, and wishes organisers and participants every success and enjoyment during the festivities of 2010.
