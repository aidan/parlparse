*S3M-2162 Rhoda Grant: Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers Gobi Desert Challengeâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Robert Holding who is preparing to run 140 miles across the Gobi Desert in order to raise funds for the Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers Project; notes that Robert Holding has overcome significant challenges in his own life and is now supporting young people in the Skye and Lochalsh area who are facing difficult challenges, including feelings of isolation, vulnerability, loss, stigma and underachievement in their education; further notes that these young people have significant caring responsibilities for family members who have a diagnosed disability, chronic illness or addiction issue and that the Skye and Lochalsh Young Carers Project increases the confidence and self-esteem of these children and young adults who are more used to putting the needs of others before their own, building on their existing strengths; encourages MSPs and others to sponsor this extremely worthwhile event by logging on to: www.sponsorformsonline.co.uk/skyeyoungcarers.asp, and wishes Robert Holding every success in this challenge.
