*S3M-7427 Jim Mather: AV Referendum and 2011 Scottish Parliament Election Clash—That the Parliament notes with real concern the UK Government’s intention to hold a referendum on voting reform for UK Parliament elections on the same day as elections to the Scottish Parliament and other devolved institutions in May 2011; regrets the UK Government’s failure to consult the Scottish Government or the Scottish Parliament on this matter, and calls on the UK Government to work with the Scottish Government to agree a new date that will avoid a clash with elections to this parliament. Supported by: John Swinney*
