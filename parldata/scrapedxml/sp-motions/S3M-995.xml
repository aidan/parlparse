*S3M-995 Bill Wilson: UK Failure to Tackle Child Poverty—That the Parliament recognises the Prime Minister’s promise to "end child poverty" as incompatible with this year’s Comprehensive Spending Review and Pre-Budget Report, which throws a mere 50 pence a week each at the 250,000 children in Scotland living below the poverty line; believes that tackling child poverty, with reference to the Child Tax Credit, will require more than an additional £25 per family per year; calls on Westminster to investigate the capacity of citizens’ incomes to tackle the issue of rampant child poverty throughout the United Kingdom, and acknowledges that an independent Scotland would not fail to act in the interests of a quarter of a million children living below the poverty line.
