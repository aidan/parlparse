*S3M-7361# Kenneth Gibson: Epilepsy Awareness Trainingâ€”That the Parliament believes that there would be merit in epilepsy training becoming an integral part of the student teacher training course curriculum so that teaching staff are equipped to detect potential seizures in children and young people and can be proactive in providing appropriate support to pupils with epilepsy and agrees that this could boost teacher confidence in handling as many as 7,000 children in Scotland with active epilepsy, enable early detection of seizures in over 800 children each year, provide more tailored learning and emotional support to normalise the condition and reduce classroom stigma for children in North Ayrshire and across Scotland. Supported by: Ms Wendy Alexander*, Mary Mulligan*, Alasdair Allan*, Aileen Campbell*, Bill Wilson*, Christina McKelvie*, Bill Kidd* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
