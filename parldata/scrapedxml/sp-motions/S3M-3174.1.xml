*S3M-3174.1 Richard Baker: Protecting Scotland’s Communities - The Scottish Government Offender Management Plan—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3174) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from "supports" to end and insert "expresses concern that the Scottish Government’s proposals for the abolition of six-month sentences are unworkable and will not improve community safety; agrees that it is right to seek to expand the provision of tough effective community sentences and payback but that to be effective such measures must be properly resourced and that this is not the case under current national and local funding settlements, and believes that any changes to the sentencing system must put first the delivery of justice and protecting the public."
