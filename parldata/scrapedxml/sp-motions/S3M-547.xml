*S3M-547 Bill Wilson: The Industrial and Provident Societies Act, Need for Reform—That the Parliament notes the Scottish Agricultural Organisation Society’s response to HM Treasury’s Review of the GB Co-operative and Credit Union Legislation June 2007; recognises the valuable contribution that agricultural and rural co-operative enterprises make to the people and economy of Scotland; notes, however, that these co-ops are relatively underdeveloped in Scotland and that co-ops, registered under the Industrial and Provident Societies Act, are at a significant disadvantage compared with bodies registered under the Companies Act, not least in that they are forbidden to use electronic means, such as email, for business communication and are not included in online electronic registers, and accordingly calls for the UK Government to reform the relevant legislation to remove outdated and damaging restrictions on Scottish agricultural and rural co-operative enterprises.
