*S2M-4875 Dr Jean Turner: Breast Cancer Awareness Month 2006—That the Parliament welcomes Breast Cancer Awareness Month 2006; notes that Breast Cancer Awareness Month is an annual national health campaign organised by the major breast cancer and cancer charities to increase awareness of the disease, raise funds for research into its cause, prevention and cure and offer vital information and support to those affected by it; notes also that the majority of breast cancers are detected by women who report unusual changes to their doctor but that only 43% of 55 to 64-year-olds check their breasts, which is worrying considering that this group is most at risk as the chances of developing breast cancer increase with age; notes that this is an indication that, despite the advances made in the treatment of breast cancer, women of the most potentially high risk are still not checking their breasts, showing that awareness is still a vital part of the fight against breast cancer, and commends all the organisations involved in continuing to try to get the message across that early detection is vital and checking your breasts regularly is part of the fight against cancer of the breast. Supported by: Mr John Swinney*, Tommy Sheridan*, Murray Tosh*, Shiona Baird*, Carolyn Leckie*, Karen Gillon*, Colin Fox*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Mrs Nanette Milne*, Fergus Ewing*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Bruce Crawford*, Mr David Davidson*, Ms Maureen Watt*, Kate Maclean*, Mr Brian Monteith*, Ms Sandra White*, Mr Bruce McFee*, Mr Mark Ruskell*, Brian Adam*, Mr Jim Wallace*, Margaret Mitchell*, Christine Grahame*, Stewart Stevenson*, Mr Kenneth Macintosh*
