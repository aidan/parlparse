*S2M-5287 Bill Butler: Trident Renewal Debate—That the Parliament notes the publication by the UK Government of its White Paper on the future of the Trident nuclear missile system on Monday 4 December 2006; acknowledges the Prime Minister’s call for "a very full process of debate" on this profoundly serious area of policy; recognises the need for the debate fully to explore the military, economic and political consequences of Trident renewal; believes that a convincing case can be made, in military, economic and political terms, for the non-renewal of Trident, and therefore advises electors to lobby their Westminster representatives to urge them to vote against the renewal of Trident in any debate held on that subject in the House of Commons. Supported by: Marlyn Glen*, Trish Godman*, Michael McMahon*, John Swinburne*, Stewart Stevenson*, Tommy Sheridan*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Patrick Harvie*, Mike Rumbles*, Elaine Smith*, Kate Maclean*
