*S3M-3892 Helen Eadie: A Tribute to Kenneth Munro and Professor Neil MacCormick—That the Parliament expresses its profound sadness at the recent loss of both Kenneth Munro and Professor Neil MacCormick, whose contribution to a European vision and ideals was inspirational and who made a real difference to the lives of the people that they touched with their major impact in developing progressive relationships all over Europe; celebrates their lives that demonstratively expressed real commitment to all the values cherished by caring people across not just Scotland but the wider United Kingdom and beyond; considers that their huge personalities, humour, wit and ability are legendry and that they will be missed, and mourns their passing but believes that Scotland is a better place for them having passed our way.
