* S3M-6325 Johann Lamont: Honouring Gordon Brownâ€”That the Parliament pays tribute to Gordon Brown, a proud and honoured son of Scotland; celebrates his powerful contribution as Prime Minister, as one of the great reforming chancellors and as a key architect of the Scottish Parliament; praises his record, as Chancellor of the Exchequer, in securing historic advances for working people, such as the minimum wage; celebrates his legacy as an international statesman in helping to reduce third-world debt and in making real the aims of the Make Poverty History campaign; recognises his central role as Prime Minister, acknowledged across the world, in tackling the global financial crisis, and believes that his leadership in tackling inequality and in protecting families and communities from the impact of recession confirms his commitment to social justice and emphasises the need for government to act on behalf of people in troubled times, not abandon them.
