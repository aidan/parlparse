*S3M-2229 Marlyn Glen: Listening to Migrant Workersâ€”That the Parliament congratulates UNISON Scotland on its successful Listening to Migrant Workers event, held at Holyrood on Wednesday 18 June 2008, at which it launched its Voluntary Code of Practice on Employing Migrant and European Workers; notes that, while many migrant workers in Scotland and the United Kingdom have a positive experience in this country, others do not; further notes that migrant workers are often the victims of exploitation, including poor accommodation and bad employment practices; welcomes the economic and cultural contributions that migrant workers bring to Scotland; recognises the need for employers to be better informed about migrant workers arriving in Scotland; applauds employers who take responsibility to support the safety and integration of migrant workers into the community, and encourages local authorities and public bodies to sign up to the code of practice to help to make Scotland a welcome place for migrant workers.
