*S2M-5465 Carolyn Leckie: Bloody Sunday—That the Parliament remembers the 28 unarmed civil rights marchers who were slaughtered or wounded by forces of the British state in Derry on Sunday 30 January 1972 and who it considers were slandered by the UK Government and media which falsely claimed that they were armed, including in the official, now discredited, Widgery Report; pays tribute to the survivors and relatives of the dead who have battled courageously for 35 years to establish the truth and are still waiting for the report and conclusions of the Saville Bloody Sunday Inquiry; believes that they have been unfairly scape-goated for the greed of lawyers, causing the inquiry to cost hundreds of millions of pounds, and finally notes that the military personnel who took part in the events of Bloody Sunday were honoured by the Queen which further brings into disrepute the whole honours system.
