*S3M-3971 Cathy Peattie: Remember the Dead, Fight for the Living—That the Parliament supports International Workers’ Memorial Day on 28 April 2009, which has the theme, good occupational health for all workers; notes that International Workers’ Memorial Day commemorates the two million workers who die from accidents and diseases at work, the 1.2 million who are injured and the 160 million who fall ill each year due to unsafe, unhealthy or unsustainable work and workplaces; notes that such deaths greatly exceed the number of deaths caused by war and that many such deaths are preventable by improved health and safety; calls for this day to be widely observed in Scotland through action to improve safety and provide a healthier working environment, and believes that the Scottish Government and others should formally recognise International Workers’ Memorial Day as an annual event when they take stock and advance plans for health and safety improvements and seek to provide a healthier working environment in the year to come.
