 *S1M-2685# Mr Brian Monteith: Funding the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park-That the Parliament notes with concern that the level of funding to be given by the Scottish Executive for the first year of operation of its proposed Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park at £2.8 million is half the amount of £5.6 million required by the Park's interim committee; further notes that this contrasts sharply with the £14 million of taxpayers money which is being spent on landscaping the new Parliament building at Holyrood, and believes that the Scottish Executive should, without delay, reconsider its grant aid to the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park and should commission research to establish how many additional tourists and what impact on traffic flows there will be following the creation of the National Park, so that any further demands on the local transport infrastructure can be determined.
