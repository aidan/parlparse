 *S2M-2275.2 Alex Johnstone: Climate Change—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2275) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the Scottish Executive’s review of its Scottish Climate Change Programme and the corresponding review of the UK Climate Change Programme and, however, urges the Executive to take a more meaningful and balanced approach in supporting other renewable technologies like wave and tidal power and energy from biomass and waste, as well as nuclear technology, which offer long-term opportunities for Scotland at a lower cost to our landscape."
