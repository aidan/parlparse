*S3M-6460 Tavish Scott: Shetland’s Cancer Relief Relay for Life—That the Parliament applauds the 2010 UK Cancer Relief Relay for Life, which took place in Shetland on 26 and 27 May 2010 and which involved 133 teams and over 1,900 participants who walked round the Clickimin athletics track from 8 pm to 8 am; notes that the purpose of the walk was to highlight the importance of research into cancer and to remember lost loved ones while sharing experiences with friends and family; applauds the organising committee, ably led by Olive MacLeod, which set a record for the largest relay in the United Kingdom and which has already raised almost £160,000 from a group of islands with a population of some 22,000, and salutes the Shetland community for its tremendous spirit of togetherness.
