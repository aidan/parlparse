 *S3M-2472# Stuart McMillan: Sailing and Boating Continues to Expand and Contribute to the Scottish Economy—That the Parliament acknowledges that sailing and boating continues to expand as an industry bringing substantial benefits to the economy and offering people jobs; notes that there are some 250,000 yachts in the United Kingdom, of which 15,000 are currently resident in Scotland and that, of these, approximately 5,000 are based on the River Clyde, with 3,000 in marinas and 2,000 on moorings in the Clyde; further notes that the leisure marine industry turnover in Scotland is £98.9 million per annum, that the industry employs 1,816 full-time equivalents in Scotland and supports 7,900 jobs and that the economic benefit of recreational boating in Scotland is estimated to be in excess of £250 million; acknowledges that further marina development is scheduled throughout Scotland with proposals for marinas in Greenock that would further enhance the reputation of sailing on the west coast; congratulates everyone connected with recreational sailing and boating for this economic success, and looks forward to even more economic delivery in the future.
