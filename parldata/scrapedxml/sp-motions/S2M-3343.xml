*S2M-3343u Ms Sandra White: Sex Discrimination - Ending the Public Sector Pay Gap—That the Parliament notes that November will mark the 30th anniversary of the passing of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 which, at the time, represented a watershed for equal opportunities campaigners; notes that, despite the Equal Pay Act 1970 and an equal pay strategy agreed by unions and local authorities in 1999, more than 50,000 female local authority workers in Scotland have been paid less than their entitlement and are now threatening to take court action over their claims; notes that the total cost could be as much as £500 million unless an amicable solution can be found by local authorities; notes that the Scottish Executive failed to issue any guidelines to local authorities on the issue of fair pay; notes that it is often women who are among the lowest-paid workers in local authorities working often part-time and that currently their collective bargaining punch is seen as limited by employers; further notes that independent nations, like Norway and Sweden, place a high premium on childcare, removing employment barriers for pregnant women and recognise the need for flexibility among female workers as a means to narrowing the gender gap, and considers that Scottish ministers should engage with local authorities and ensure that resources are in place so that women are fully paid and properly valued.
