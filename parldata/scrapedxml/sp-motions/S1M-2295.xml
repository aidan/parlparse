 *S1M-2295 Michael Russell: Kidney Donation and Provision of Renal Unitsâ€”That the Parliament records its concern at the current shortage of kidneys for transplant to patients suffering renal failure and that many such patients in Scotland die for want of a transplant; notes that Scotland has fewer renal units per head of population than most other European countries and is near the bottom of the European league for transplantation rates, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to bring forward proposals to address these problems, which may include a "presumed consent" system for organ donation of the kind which operates in several other European countries and an improved provision of renal units, particularly in rural Scotland, where patients often have to travel huge distances several times a week for dialysis.
