 *S3M-7656 Bob Doris: Criminal Cash Better Spent in Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the significant increase in criminal asset recovery under the proceeds of crime legislation and what it considers to be the tremendous success of the Scottish Government’s Cashback for Communities initiative, which allocates seized criminal assets to community projects in some of Scotland’s most deprived areas; considers that, while the annual limit of £30 million that Scotland is permitted to retain under the current rules has never before been reached, this figure is expected to be exceeded by the end of the 2010-11 financial year; believes that any such additional money would be better spent helping Scotland’s crime-affected communities than going to HM Treasury, and calls on the UK Government to recognise the success of the scheme and immediately remove the £30 million threshold. Supported by: Mary Scanlon*, Bill Kidd*, Anne McLaughlin*, Bill Wilson*, Nigel Don*, Stewart Maxwell*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Kenneth Gibson*, Sandra White*, Maureen Watt*, John Wilson*, Brian Adam*
