*S3M-2697 Dr Richard Simpson: Regret for Continuing Complacency on Reducing Clostridium Difficile Hospital Infections—That the Parliament notes the most recent Health Protection Scotland (HPS) statistics on healthcare associated infections; while recognising the continuing improvement in MRSA, notes that the number of cases of Clostridium difficile in the most recent quarter (April to June 2008) showed an increase from the same quarter in 2007 of 150 cases or around 9%; regrets that HPS, having tried to explain the increases over the previous two quarters (October 2007 to March 2008) as "probable seasonal variation", now suggests that the small reduction from the two winter quarters represents a real reduction rather than a continuing year-on-year increase; further notes that, unlike England, Scotland still reports on the basis of NHS boards and not individual hospitals, thus preventing the public from having any information about their local hospitals; considers that the continued rise in antibiotic resistance reflects the continuation of a failure to implement effective antibiotic policies; calls on the Scottish Executive to urgently review hand hygiene policies, practice and reporting to ensure that alcohol wipes and hand washing are not conflated in hand hygiene reports and ensure that the denominator of observations is standardised for each hospital and also that inspection is rigorous and independent for each hospital, thus ending self reporting, and further calls on the Scottish Executive to set tough targets for a reduction in Clostridium difficile cases by 2011 to match or exceed the 30% target set in England.
