 *S2M-4674 Mr Mark Ruskell: Protecting Scotland from GM Contamination—That the Parliament notes the publication by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs of a consultation exercise on the coexistence of GM, conventional and organic crops; further notes comments by Ian Pearson MP, UK Minister of State for Climate Change and the Environment, that GM contamination of conventional and organic crops is inevitable should GM crops be grown commercially in the United Kingdom; observes that Mr Pearson’s warnings are borne out by the experience of farmers in North America where organic and conventional farmers have been driven out of business following contamination by GM material; acknowledges widespread public rejection of GM agriculture and observes that as long as this remains the case there will be no market for GM produce in the UK; welcomes the unprecedented growth in demand for organic produce, up by 30% over the past year and now valued at £1.6 billion across the UK, in marked contrast to the GM sector; supports the right of the organic and conventional agricultural sectors to protect their products, market reputation and livelihoods from the effects of GM contamination; finds it strange that the UK Government seems intent on jeopardising the future of a valuable and thriving agricultural sector by supporting the interests of the agricultural biotech industry, whose products virtually no-one wishes to either purchase or consume; strongly believes that whatever coexistence measures are put in place must be backed up by a rigorous strict liability regime, with any economic damages suffered by non-GM farmers fully compensated by the GM industry, and calls on the Scottish Executive to publish its own consultation on GM coexistence and liability and to take a more precautionary approach that genuinely protects the interests of Scottish farmers and consumers, the overwhelming majority of whom wish to remain GM-free.
