 * S2M-2543.1# Murdo Fraser:Scotland’s Depopulation Crisis—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2543) in the name of Ms Sandra White, leave out from “expresses” to end and insert “further notes that only a small proportion of immigrants coming to the United Kingdom who are entitled to settle in Scotland choose to do so; believes that, in light of Scotland’s low levels of entrepreneurship and business start-ups compared with the rest of Britain, it is the economic policies pursued by the Scottish Executive which are responsible for Scotland’s low levels of immigration and net loss of young people; further believes that the Fresh Talent initiative is nothing more than a UK Home Office scheme being piloted in Scotland and a distraction from the real issues, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should take concrete steps to make Scotland more economically competitive by reducing the size of the public sector and cutting red tape and business rates.”
