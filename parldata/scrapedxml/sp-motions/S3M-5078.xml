*S3M-5078 Patrick Harvie: Draconian Action against Filesharing—That the Parliament welcomes the poll findings published by YouGov that show that 70% of the UK public opposes plans to force internet service providers to disconnect customers suspected of filesharing; deeply regrets the enthusiasm being shown for these plans by the Secretary of State for Business, Lord Mandelson; considers that the proposal would lead to an increase in routine encryption, hijacking of internet protocol addresses and wi-fi networks, the unjustified disconnection of many individuals and a wider impact on other members of disconnected households; agrees with the UK All Party Parliamentary Communications Group that "much of the problem with illegal sharing of copyrighted material has been caused by the rightsholders, and the music industry in particular, being far too slow in getting their act together and making popular legal alternatives available"; recognises the growing importance, especially in rural areas, of reliable internet connections for access to public services, financial inclusion, education, democratic debate and other purposes, and urges the UK Government to abandon the current proposal and develop alternative approaches that properly balance creative artists’ right to fair recompense with the wider interests of the public.
