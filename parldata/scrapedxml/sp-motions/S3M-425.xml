*S3M-425# Mary Scanlon: Bog Myrtle (Sweet Gale) Industry—That the Parliament recognises the potential for the bog myrtle (sweet gale) industry in the Highlands and Scotland; considers that support should be accelerated for the industry, which sees bog myrtle grow wild and be cultivated on plantations across the Highlands, and is soon to be expanded to other regions including Moray, Aberdeenshire and the Borders; notes that immediate support is necessary to establish development, planting and research study which will ensure that the industry develops quickly and that crofters, farmers and landowners involved in the production of bog myrtle see an immediate effect, and believes that support should be given to the commercial planting programme to help mitigate the risk undertaken by initial growers to establish crops in order to see the production of bog myrtle increase in the Highlands and establish the crop in other parts of Scotland in an effort to meet the anticipated global demand for this plant from the healthcare industry and drinks manufacturers and ensure that the subsequent planting by growers continues on a sustained basis.
