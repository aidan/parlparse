 *S3M-7947 Bob Doris: Home Heating Help for Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the recent Scottish Government announcement that more households across Scotland will receive assistance to heat their properties if regulations are approved by the Parliament; looks forward to the proposed extension that the regulations will deliver to the Energy Assistance Package, which is forecast to assist up to 48,000 additional people, including people who are severely disabled or terminally ill; notes that the measures include repairing or replacing central heating systems and fitting insulation or draught proofing facilities, and urges all those who are in fuel poverty and think that they may be eligible for additional assistance to contact the Scottish Government’s Home Energy Scotland Helpline on 0800 512 012.
