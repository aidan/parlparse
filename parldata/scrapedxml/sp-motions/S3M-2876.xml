*S3M-2876 Aileen Campbell: UK Government’s Ideas for the Future of the Post Office—That the Parliament notes comments by the Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform, Lord Mandelson, that he believes in the future of the Post Office and that the financial services it offers could be developed in the light of global economic difficulties; considers that the Network Change Programme was foisted on the Post Office by the UK Government and has decimated the Post Office branch network in Scotland, devastated local communities and put increasing pressure on the remaining branches; believes that any decision to remove the card account from the Post Office will further weaken the network; further believes that these actions of the UK Government stand completely at odds with Lord Mandelson’s comments, and calls on the UK Government to halt and reverse the closure programme, retain the Post Office card account, and work to enhance the range of services available at all branches.
