*S2M-98# John Swinburne: Regulation of Care Home Provision—That the Parliament recognises that standards are not as required in some residential homes; notes with concern the apparent inconsistent care of the elderly within some care and nursing homes where, despite being charged nearly £400 per week for their care, residents develop malnutrition from not receiving proper meals or are abused at the hands of care workers; considers therefore that the Scottish Executive should ensure that its regulating care commission regularly monitors all care homes, is given more powers to address the incidence of poor care provided in residential homes by tightening their registration and regulation and improving the standards of staff training required, and further considers that appropriate action should be taken against residential home owners who are guilty of mismanagement and unacceptable care.
