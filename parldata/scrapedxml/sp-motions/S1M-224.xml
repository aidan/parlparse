*S1M-224# George Lyon: French Ban on Scottish Beef—That the Parliament welcomes the return of Scottish Beef to European markets but condemns the French government’s continuing ban; calls upon the Scottish Executive to work with its colleagues in Westminster and Brussels to ensure that this illegal ban is removed as quickly as possible; notes with alarm that livestock feed in France is reported to contain animal and possibly human waste; in the light of these reports calls for the European Commission to take urgent action against France to stop this illegal practice, and urges the Scottish Executive to take steps to introduce stricter labelling regulations both to allay consumer fears and to ensure that Scottish produce is properly promoted, so as to provide consumers the information they need to buy Scottish.
