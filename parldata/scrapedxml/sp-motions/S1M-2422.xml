 *S1M-2422 Mr Gil Paterson: Scotland's Oil-That the Parliament notes that the Brent oil field in the North Sea is 25 years of age and is conservatively expected to be in production for a further 25 years; further notes the pessimistic predictions made by some unionist politicians during the 1970s that Scotland's oil would not last long and would be finished before the decade was out, and draws comparison between Scotland and Alaska on how oil wealth has been used to benefit the citizens of both countries by highlighting that in Alaska every citizen enjoys an annual dividend of $1,850.88 which they are free to spend as they see fit whereas in Scotland, the oil producer of the European Union, our children are born to fail in higher numbers proportionately than elsewhere in the EU.
