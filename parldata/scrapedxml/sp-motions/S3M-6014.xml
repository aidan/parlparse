*S3M-6014 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Microgeneration Feed-in Tariffs—That the Parliament welcomes the pioneering contribution made by households and businesses that have installed microgeneration capacity; expresses concern that, under the UK Government’s Clean Energy Cashback scheme, those who installed their technology before 15 July 2009 will effectively be penalised for their forward thinking by receiving only nine pence per kilowatt hour for selling to the national grid compared with new feed-in tariff payment rates of up to 41.3 pence per kilowatt hour that apply to new generators who installed their technology after that date, and calls on the UK Government to recognise the innovation of those who broke new ground in this area and reward them at the same level as those installing microgeneration capacity for the first time after 1 April 2010.
