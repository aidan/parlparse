 *S3M-1493 Alasdair Allan: Coastguard Industrial Action—That the Parliament recognises the vital work carried out by the dedicated staff of the Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA), including those staff in Scotland, and notes the many lives that they save each year; notes the industrial action due to take place on Thursday 6 March 2008 following strike ballots by the Public and Commercial Services Union, and urges Her Majesty’s Government to take seriously the concerns of MCA staff, including the fact that many coastguard watch assistants earn just above the national minimum wage and that there are significant disparities in pay rates between the MCA staff and comparable jobs in other emergency services. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Rob Gibson*, Alex Neil*, Aileen Campbell*, Sandra White*, Bill Kidd*, Stuart McMillan*, Bill Wilson*, Christina McKelvie*, Kenneth Gibson*, Brian Adam*
