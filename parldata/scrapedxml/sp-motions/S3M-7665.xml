*S3M-7665 Patrick Harvie: Cuts to Glasgow Bus Servicesâ€”That the Parliament condemns the decision of FirstGroup to discontinue a number of bus routes in Glasgow and make what is considered to be a severe reduction in service levels across many others; considers that it is not too late for FirstGroup to rethink these plans and put its responsibility to passengers ahead of that of shareholders, and calls on the Scottish Government to increase the powers of local authorities to regulate the operation of bus companies and impose requirements on them as well as to refocus its own national transport spending priorities away from major new road developments and toward creating a properly funded Scottish public transport system that is fast, reliable, affordable and fit for a low-carbon 21st century.
