*S3M-2709 Mary Mulligan: Alcohol Consumption and Infant Healthâ€”That the Parliament welcomes recent work by BMA Scotland on alcohol consumption and infant health; notes that 55% of women in the UK report drinking alcohol during their pregnancy; recognises that alcohol consumption during pregnancy can lead to foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD); calls on the Scottish Government to issue clear and consistent advice that women who are pregnant, or who are planning a pregnancy, should not consume any alcohol, and further calls for guidelines to be developed and implemented for diagnosis and referral for those with FASD.
