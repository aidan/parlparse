 *S3M-6091# Aileen Campbell: Brownsbank Fellowshipâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the decision by South Lanarkshire Council to withdraw its funding for the Brownsbank Writing Fellowship, a position aimed at promoting creative writing throughout the local authority area and which has helped maintain Brownsbank Cottage, near Biggar, in the South of Scotland region, the final home of Scots makar Hugh McDairmid, as a centre of literary activity; notes that withdrawal of funding will result in withdrawal of match funding from the Scottish Arts Council and lead to the end of the fellowship; believes that since its inception in 1993, the six Brownsbank fellows to have held the post have helped improve literacy and appreciation of Scottish literature in South Lanarkshire and beyond, and hopes that a way can be found to help the Biggar Museum Trust, which administers the fellowship, to continue supporting this important position.
