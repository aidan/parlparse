*S3M-2730 Tavish Scott: Ofcom Charges for the RNLI—That the Parliament notes with concern Ofcom’s consultation document, Applying spectrum pricing to the Maritime and Aeronautical sectors, which proposes cost increases for the use of VHF radio frequencies; further notes with particular concern section 1.18 of the consultation, which states that "we are inviting views on whether charities whose objective is the safety of human life in an emergency should receive a discount"; understands that the annual charge to the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) could increase from £40,000 to £260,000; recognises that the RNLI is a national charity, supported and financed by volunteers, which provides a vital life-saving service; further recognises that the proposed cost increases will certainly threaten both local and national sea and mountain search and rescue charities across the country; believes that all charities whose objective is the safety of human life should receive a 100% discount on using radio frequencies, and calls on Ofcom to reject its current proposals and enter into a process to introduce a 100% discount for these vital life-saving services.
