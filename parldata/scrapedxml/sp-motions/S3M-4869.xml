 *S3M-4869 Linda Fabiani: Nova Scotia Day—That the Parliament welcomes the proclamation signed by Darrell Dexter, Premier of Nova Scotia, that "Whereas it is fitting in Scotland’s International year of Homecoming to recognize the strong historic, linguistic and cultural links Nova Scotia shares with Scotland; and whereas these links go far back to the time of Sir William Alexander, who played an important role in the beginning of European migration to Nova Scotia and is commemorated by a statue in Victoria Park, a public space located in our province’s capital city of Halifax; and whereas through Sir William’s personal efforts the foundation of Nova Scotia was laid by Royal Charter in 1621 through which our province later received its coat of arms and flag and in recognition that Sir William and the Knights Baronet of Nova Scotia represent a foundation of the affectionate relationship enjoyed between Nova Scotia and Scotland; and whereas it is fitting to acknowledge those who have influenced Nova Scotia’s language, culture and heritage which, having evolved over the centuries, can be proudly acknowledged as diverse because of the vibrant cultures that have shaped our history", that 10 September 2009 be Nova Scotia Day and that Nova Scotia will continue to build on its mutual historic, linguistic, cultural and entrepreneurial ties with Scotland.
