*S1M-4012.5 Nora Radcliffe: The Current International Situation—As an amendment to motion (S1M-4012) in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from first "believes" to end and insert "condemns the failure of the Iraqi regime to respect international law and human rights; supports the United Nations’ (UN) efforts to disarm Iraq of weapons of mass destruction under UN Security Council Resolution 1441; calls for the inspectors to be given sufficient time and resources to continue their work as long as the Security Council assesses that progress can be made; believes that only as a last resort, once all other options have been exhausted, should military action in Iraq be undertaken, and opposes any military action not sanctioned by a further resolution from the Security Council and an affirmative vote on a substantive motion in the House of Commons."
