 *S3M-3126 Cathy Peattie: Postal Workers’ Walk-speed Pressure—That the Parliament is very concerned that postal workers are facing pressure to complete unrealistic delivery routes as a result of the Pegasus software system; believes that some delivery workers are being given delivery rounds that are too long to complete within normal hours; believes also that several postal workers have recently been injured due to treacherous conditions underfoot; notes that the Communication Workers Union (CWU) has an agreement with Royal Mail to review jointly all aspects of Pegasus, but considers that the Royal Mail is pushing ahead with changes without input from the union, leading to high volumes of complaints and a deterioration in industrial relations and service standards, and finally believes that the Royal Mail should reconsider its actions and review this system with the CWU.
