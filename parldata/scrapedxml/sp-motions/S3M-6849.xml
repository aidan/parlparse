*S3M-6849Bill Wilson:National Poet Edwin Morgan—That the Parliament is saddened to hear of the passing of Scotland’s National Poet, Edwin Morgan; recognises his reputation as one of the leading poets of the twentieth century; believes that his huge catalogue of work embodies the spirit of the makars of old; notes that he was named Scots Makar in 2004, and is confident that his work and standing will long be acknowledged the world over.
