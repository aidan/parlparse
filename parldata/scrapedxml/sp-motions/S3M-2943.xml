*S3M-2943 Mr Frank McAveety: Molendinar Park/Moore Street Housing—That the Parliament commends the opening of the Moore Street housing development in the Gallowgate in the east end of Glasgow; compliments Molendinar Housing Association in producing a high-quality, mixed-tenure housing project that brought together four architectural practices to create a fantastic, new residential quarter in the east end; further commends the engagement with local residents in regenerating a former derelict site, and calls on the Scottish Government to learn from the experiences of organisations such as Molendinar Housing Association in how best to utilise resources for maximum benefit in the housing sector.
