*S1M-3204 Mr Brian Monteith: Encouraging Diversity in Education—That the Parliament believes that schools should be given the flexibility to organise learning in the ways that best meet the needs of their pupils; further believes in the fundamental importance of diversity in education; supports the view that the elimination of denominational schools would be damaging to Scotland’s education system, and recognises that the key challenge is to improve educational opportunities for all Scotland’s young people through encouraging greater diversity and devolved management.
