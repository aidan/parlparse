*S1M-2623# Tavish Scott: Lifeline Air Links to the Islandsâ€”That the Parliament recognises that the lifeline air services to the Scottish islands are necessities, not luxuries; believes that the commercial air fares charged by the airlines are a tax on island life, handicapping individuals, businesses and public bodies alike, and considers that the Scottish Executive should enter into discussions with Her Majesty's Government and the airlines with a view to using a Public Service Obligation subsidy to reduce the airfares to a more reasonable level.
