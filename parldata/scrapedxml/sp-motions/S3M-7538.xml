 *S3M-7538 Kenneth Gibson: Congratulations to Noddsdale Houseâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the replacement of the micro-hydro system at Noddsdale House in Largs by the Evans and Robertson family; notes that the previous system had run continuously since 1927, providing light to the house and estate cottages; congratulates Gilbert Gilkes &amp; Gordon Ltd on what it considers to be the significant engineering works undertaken by it to replace the old turbines with a modern 50KW turbine, which will provide heat, lighting and hot water for five local homes and export surplus output to the national grid, and believes that such schemes will help reduce reliance on fossil and other non-renewable fuels and should be encouraged wherever possible.
