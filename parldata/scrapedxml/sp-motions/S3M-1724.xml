*S3M-1724 Sarah Boyack: Offensive Anti-Scottish Campaign by the English Democrats—That the Parliament condemns the offensive publicity campaign by English Democrats candidate for the London Mayoral elections, Matt O’Connor; believes the use of slogans such as "Chop Jock, Vote English", "Tartan Terror", "Repatriate the Prime Minster" and "Save London from Labour’s tartan taxes" as well as pictures including a robber wearing a tartan balaclava are inflammatory, border on the racist and ignore the important contribution which Scots make to the whole of the United Kingdom, including London; is particularly concerned that such billboard posters have appeared in Scotland despite being for the elections for the Mayor of London, and believes that such narrow-minded nationalism will rightly appal people from and across all parts of the United Kingdom.
