 *S1M-3507.2 Mr Brian Monteith: Broadcasting and the Mediaâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-3507) in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from "and expresses" to end and insert "; believes that the public interest is best protected by maximising competition and liberalising the current strict laws that apply to the media; supports the principle that such matters are dealt with at a UK level but considers that the current regulatory structure is detrimental to the growth and prosperity of the sector, and supports the right of broadcasters and publishers to make their own commercial decisions with the minimum possible interference from the state.
