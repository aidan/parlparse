 S3M-4561 Willie Coffey: Johnnie Walker Plant in Kilmarnock—That the Parliament condemns the decision by Diageo to close the Johnnie Walker plant in Kilmarnock with the loss of 700 jobs; notes that the Johnnie Walker brand was born in Kilmarnock in 1820 and has contributed to the huge financial success that Diageo now enjoys; recognises that Johnnie Walker Red Label is the world’s number one whisky and that the town of Kilmarnock has played an integral part in this success, and calls on Diageo to reverse its decision and to work with all parties to secure a long-term future for the Kilmarnock workforce, including, if necessary, the sale of the Johnnie Walker brand and plant to a company committed to maintaining operations in Kilmarnock.
