 *S3M-7229 Jackie Baillie: 10th Anniversary for Helensburgh and Lomond Carers Project—That the Parliament congratulates the Princess Royal Trust Helensburgh and Lomond Carers Project on reaching its 10th anniversary in October 2010; understands that the project aims to provide carers with support and guidance on all of the options that are available to them; notes that the Helensburgh and Lomond Carers project is part of a network of 144 independently-managed carers’ centres that deliver round the clock support to over 400,000 carers and approximately 25,000 young carers; understands that it is estimated that the number of carers in the United Kingdom will increase by 3.4 million in the next 30 years; believes that this will result in an even greater need for carers’ centres, and hopes that the Helensburgh and Lomond Carers Project will continue to offer valuable support and assistance to carers in the area.
