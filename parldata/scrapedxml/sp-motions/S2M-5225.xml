S2M-5225 Sarah Boyack: World AIDS Dayâ€”That the Parliament recognises World AIDS Day on 1 December 2006; welcomes the World AIDS Day campaign theme of accountability which calls on all governmental leaders to honour the promises they have made to set the targets necessary to achieve universal access to care, treatment and support and to provide sufficient resources to tackle the AIDS pandemic; notes the ongoing problem of the lack of availability of antiretroviral drugs, in particular to the people of developing nations; recognises that the United Nations recently announced that an estimated 39.5 million people worldwide are infected with HIV, with 4.3 million of those people having been infected this year, and that 2.9 million lives have been claimed by AIDS this year; recognises that, despite the declining HIV infection rates being observed in some countries, many countries are seeing a resurgence in new HIV infection rates which were previously stable or declining, and welcomes the commitment of Scottish charities, in particular Waverley Care and its two main projects, SOLAS and Milestone House, which have recently celebrated 15 years of support for people living with HIV and AIDS.
