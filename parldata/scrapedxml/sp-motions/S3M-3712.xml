 S3M-3712 Stuart McMillan: Full Steam Ahead for Wemyss Bay Stationâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the work being carried out by the Friends of Wemyss Bay Station, a newly formed group of volunteers with a keen interest in and admiration for Wemyss Bay station; notes that the group has been granted the use of the empty accommodation at the station to use as a heritage site, and further notes that the group plans to collect and display photographs of the station in its Edwardian prime and has reintroduced floral displays as a reminder of the days when the station was famous for its displays of potted plants and hanging baskets.
