*S2M-5167 Tommy Sheridan: Reverse the Manufacturing Slump—That the Parliament notes the dramatic collapse in manufacturing industry as far as share of gross domestic product (GDP) and percentage of jobs across the economy are concerned, as reflected in the most recent statistics which reveal that manufacturing’s share of the United Kingdom’s GDP has slumped from 21% in 1997 to only 13.6% in 2006, that the number of workers employed in the manufacturing sector in Scotland is now only 235,000, representing 10.3% of all jobs, and that manufacturing’s share of GDP in Scotland has dropped from 21.8% in 1997 to less than 15% today; believes that manufacturing is a critical sector for economic development and success but that without more direct public control and democratic administration of wealth-creating manufacturing concerns, allied to significant investment in research, development and skills improvements, our ability to provide a decent, improved and sustained standard and quality of life for all our citizens will be diminished, and calls for public ownership of our financial sector to facilitate real investment in our manufacturing capacity.
