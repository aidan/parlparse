*S3M-4832 Patricia Ferguson: Diageo’s Social Responsibility—That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement by Diageo that it is intent on closing its plants at Port Dundas and Kilmarnock; regrets that this decision was made in spite of widespread support for the campaign to save jobs at both sites and the loyalty and commitment of its workforce; believes that Diageo must recognise its continuing responsibility to the workers at both plants, and asks the Scottish Government to indicate what it will do to ensure that Diageo recognises and honours that commitment.
