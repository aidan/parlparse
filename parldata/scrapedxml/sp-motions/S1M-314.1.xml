*S1M-314.1 Bill Aitken: Social Justice Targets—As an amendment to motion (S1M-314) in the name of Ms Wendy Alexander, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "notes the Scottish Executive’s publication of Social Justice - a Scotland where everyone matters which sets out statements not targets; does not provide any proposals for action or details of funding; does not set out any meaningful way in which progress on the issues highlighted can be measured, and completely fails to address the needs of Scotland’s people."
