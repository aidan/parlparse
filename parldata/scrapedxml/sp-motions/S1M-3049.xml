*S1M-3049 Pauline McNeill: Freedom Day for South Africa, 27 April 2002—That the Parliament notes that 27 April 2002 was Freedom Day for South Africa, marking the promulgation of the non-racial democratic constitution in 1994; further notes that Freedom Day also coincides with the first multi-racial elections in South Africa in 1994 in which the ANC won 64% of the vote and Nelson Mandela was elected the first black president on 10 May, and resolves to send the Parliament’s warmest greetings to the government and people of South Africa around their important national day. Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone*
