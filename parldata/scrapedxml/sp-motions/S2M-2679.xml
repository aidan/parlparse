 *S2M-2679# Colin Fox: How We Should Rule Ourselvesâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the publication of How We Should Rule Ourselves by Alasdair Gray and Professor Adam Tomkins of Glasgow University; hopes that the book will further stimulate the debate over the form of government which best serves Scotland, either a modern democratic republic or a monarchy; recognises the tremendous success of the 2004 Declaration of Calton Hill which again drew attention to the case for a republic in Scotland, and further recognises the breadth of interest there is in the subject throughout civic Scotland. Supported by: Carolyn Leckie*, Frances Curran*, Tommy Sheridan*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*
