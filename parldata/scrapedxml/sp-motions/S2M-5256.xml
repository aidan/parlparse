*S2M-5256 Tommy Sheridan: Solidarity with Glasgow City Council Workers—That the Parliament expresses solidarity with those Glasgow City Council workers who have been compelled to take industrial action next week in opposition to the council’s unacceptable single status pay deal; rejects the council’s proposal that low-paid council workers should pay for the uprating of other low-paid council workers’ wages, and demands that equal pay legislation is implemented from council resources and additional Scottish Executive funding not from the wage packets of already hard-pressed council staff. Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne*
