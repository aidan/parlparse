*S2M-1965 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Low Pay in the South of Scotland—That the Parliament notes the Office for National Statistics’ annual survey of hours and earnings which shows that the gross average weekly wage for a British worker is now £421 a week, whilst the average wage in the Scottish Borders Council area is the lowest in Scotland at £299 a week; condemns the economic policies that have fostered the creation of a low-wage economy in the south of Scotland and the misery that poverty pay brings to families and communities, and calls for investment in the infrastructure in the region, equal opportunity to access education and training and the creation of skilled, higher-paid employment opportunities.
