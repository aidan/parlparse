 *S2M-2597.1 Fiona Hyslop: Education—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2597) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from "acknowledges" to end and insert "recognises the efforts of teachers to deliver a quality education for pupils in increasingly challenging circumstances, the potential of Scotland’s pupils to succeed and the need for national government resources, which directly impact on the classroom experience, to provide sufficient time and attention for pupils from teachers in a peaceful, stimulating environment with a relevant, flexible curriculum for them to achieve that potential, and calls on the Scottish Executive to, in particular, develop policies to cut class sizes, to examine the plethora of initiatives and complexity of competitively bid-for funding streams and to reassess the impact of, and support given to, its social inclusion and mainstreaming agenda to ensure that all children can get the most out of their time in school education."
