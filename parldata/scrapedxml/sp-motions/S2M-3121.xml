*S2M-3121 Christine Grahame: Waverley Bill Gets the Green Lightâ€”That the Parliament notes the terms of the Preliminary Stage Report on the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill published 22 July 2005; commends all the campaigners in their efforts to reopen this railway to the Borders as a reality and rejects a termination of the railway at Gorebridge; notes, however, the criticism in the report of Scottish Borders Council in its preparation of the case and the caveats that follow from its failings to prepare adequately; notes that the broader economic case for the railway to the Borders has been recognised and, in particular, the social inclusion and tourism possibilities; further notes that the committee in principle supports a station at Stow and recognises the role for Waverley Route Trust, and urges the Scottish Executive to recognise the support reflected throughout the committee and the Parliament for the reinstatement of this lifeline link to the Scottish Borders.
