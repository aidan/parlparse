*S3M-3704 Jamie Hepburn: UN Report Criticises UK over Torture Cases—That the Parliament expresses its concern following the publication of a UN report by Martin Scheinin, the UN special rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering terrorism, which is highly critical of the UK Government for breaching basic human rights, trying to conceal illegal acts from bodies or judicial authorities in its counter-terrorism activities and using the threat of terrorism to switch from ordinary law enforcement to the use of special intelligence agencies so as to circumvent necessary safeguards in a democratic society, abusing thereby the usually legitimate secrecy of intelligence operations; agrees with the conclusion of special rapporteur Scheinin that the active or passive participation by states in the interrogation of persons held by another state constitutes an internationally wrongful act if the state knew or ought to have known that that the person was facing a real risk of torture or other prohibited treatment, and calls on the UK Government to launch an immediate inquiry into the role of UK security and intelligence officials in the US intelligence service’s secret transfer of detainees to "black sites" around the world.
