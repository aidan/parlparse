 *S1M-4059 George Lyon: Over Thirty Months Scheme-That the Parliament notes Scottish farmers' and crofters' deep concerns and anger over the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs' proposal to cut the compensation to them for animals slaughtered under the Over Thirty Months Scheme; further notes that this cut is for apparent financial reasons prior to the completion of the Food Standards Agency's review of the scheme, and calls on the Scottish Executive to press for a delay in the cuts until the Food Standards Agency's consultation on changes to the scheme is completed and a proper strategy put in place for the gradual withdrawal of the scheme causing minimum disruption to the market place.
