*S3M-3456#Cathy Peattie: International Women’s Day—That the Parliament welcomes the many events being organised throughout the world to mark International Women’s Day on 8 March 2009; notes the role that this day plays in recognising, promoting and celebrating women’s issues worldwide; considers that there are still many aspects of women’s rights, representation and welfare that need to be addressed through a gendered policy approach, including the gender pay gap, the under-representation of women in senior positions within the public and private sectors and as elected representatives, and with regard to the provision of violence-against-women support services; recognises the requirement under the Gender Equality Duty for the Scottish Government, local authorities and other public bodies to undertake needs analyses and equality impact assessments, and believes that these are central to single outcome and other agreements. Supported by: Bill Butler*, John Park*, Patricia Ferguson*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Elaine Murray*, Angela Constance*, Karen Whitefield*, Dr Richard Simpson*, Jackie Baillie*, Liam McArthur*, Marlyn Glen*, Malcolm Chisholm*, Hugh Henry*, Margaret Curran*, Lewis Macdonald*, Elaine Smith*, Mary Mulligan*
