*S2M-3112 Shiona Baird: Wood Fuel for Warmthâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the Sustainable Development Commission on the publication of its recent report, Wood Fuel for Warmth; welcomes the findings of the report that wood-fuel heating could radically cut climate-changing emissions from household heating systems, while creating jobs and tackling fuel poverty at the same time; notes that households with wood fuel heating systems can cut carbon emissions from heating and hot water by up to 96%; believes that wood provides a valuable fuel resource in rural areas where fuel choices are often limited, and calls on the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to take a more flexible attitude to wood fuel installations.
