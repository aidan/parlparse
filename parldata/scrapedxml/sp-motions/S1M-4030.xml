*S1M-4030 Alex Fergusson: Double Ear Tagging of Sheep—That the Parliament notes with extreme concern the European Commission’s proposals that Scottish flockmasters should "double ear tag" and record the individual identification numbers of every sheep in the country; further notes that such proposals are impractical, unworkable and unpoliceable on Scotland’s extensive upland and mountain sheep farms and that they would add nothing to the effectiveness of either meat or disease traceability that is not already achieved by current systems of flock identification, and urges the Scottish Executive to work with Her Majesty’s Government to resist these proposals vigorously as being against the interests of Scotland’s flockmasters.
