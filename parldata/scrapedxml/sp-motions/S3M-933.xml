*S3M-933 Robert Brown: RNIB Report on Election Experiences of People with Sight Loss—That the Parliament welcomes the RNIB report, Make it count, on the election experiences of people with sight loss; notes the issues identified from individual experience in the report, particularly those of staff training, design including font size and colour contrast, the need for good lighting, better polling booth design and voter advice and information in polling stations, and the problem of delayed despatch of postal ballot papers; notes also the recommendation for the appointment of a Chief Returning Officer; urges the Scotland Office and the Scottish Government to consider and act on the report along with the recommendations in the Gould report and to involve organisations like RNIB more closely in arrangements for future elections, and believes that it is an urgent requirement of any democracy that all its citizens should be able to cast an effective vote in a manner suited to their needs.
