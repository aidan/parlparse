*S2M-1613 Robin Harper: Low Frequency Sonar Systems Threat to Whales and Dolphins—That the Parliament expresses its deep concern over the use of low frequency sonar systems by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) which could cause death and distress to whales and dolphins around Scotland’s coasts; notes the legal move by the United States of America which has seen the US Navy banned from deploying low frequency sonar systems; considers that the certain impact of deployment of low frequency sonar on Scotland’s inshore environment is an issue that is devolved to the Scottish Parliament, and calls on the Scottish Executive to seek legal advice with a view to instituting legal proceedings against the MoD over its plan to deploy the £340 million sonar system.
