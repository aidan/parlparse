 *S3M-4634 Brian Adam: Aberdeen Airport 75th Birthday—That the Parliament congratulates Aberdeen Airport at Dyce on its 75th birthday; notes the entrepreneurial spirit of Eric Gandar Dower who first decided to build an airport at the site, which was opened on 28 July 1934 by Viscount Arbuthnott, providing vital links to the Northern Isles and London among other destinations before being used by the RAF in World War II; further notes that it has since become the world’s busiest commercial heliport, transporting 500,000 people offshore every year, a pivotal asset to Scotland’s oil and gas industry, as well as contributing to the north east economy by being a major employer in the area and providing a regional transport hub for business and tourism with more than three million passengers a year using its terminal; welcomes the investment from BAA in resurfacing of the runway and improving the terminal facilities, and wishes the airport all the best for the next 75 years.
