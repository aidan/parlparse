*S1M-3874# Marilyn Livingstone: The Scottish Fire Service—That the Parliament recognises and values those who provide fire services in Scotland: supports a fair pay claim for firefighters and control staff and a new formula to achieve this; believes that a lasting resolution of the current fire dispute lies in meaningful negotiation; acknowledges the need for consultation on the future of the fire service; considers that such consultation should include reference to a number of sources, in particular the Scottish Executive publication The Scottish Fire Service of the Future; agrees with the Scottish Executive and the Fire Brigades Union that emphasis on community fire safety is necessary, and believes that a Fire Services bill should be introduced in the next Parliamentary session which would be subject to full and extensive consultation and scrutiny.
