*S3M-162# Bill Kidd: Car Parking Charges Review—That the Parliament broadly welcomes the outcome of the review of car parking charges by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde; expresses concern, however, that this review was only undertaken after concerted pressure from patient groups, staff and MSPs and that the review fails to recognise and admit that the previous regime was indeed unfair; shares the concern of nurses that they will still have to pay £300 per year in charges, and considers that, following discussion with nursing organisations, guidelines should be issued to cap the amount that can be charged to staff.
