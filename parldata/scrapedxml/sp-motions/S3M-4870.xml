*S3M-4870 Pauline McNeill: UN Condemns War Crimes in Gaza—That the Parliament notes the findings of an official UN report that accuses Israel of deliberately using disproportionate force in the three-week operation in December 2008 and January 2009; further notes that the report, led by South African judge Richard Goldstone, found evidence "indicating serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were committed by Israel during the Gaza conflict"; notes the report’s finding that that there is evidence that both Israeli and Palestinian forces committed war crimes in the conflict and that it accuses Israel of imposing "a blockade which amounted to collective punishment" in the lead-up to the conflict; also notes Mr Goldstone’s recommendation that the UN Security Council seek reports within six months about its own investigations into the alleged crimes, including the potential involvement of the International Criminal Court if these reports are deemed unsatisfactory, and calls on the international community to respond to the call by President Obama earlier this year to urgently lift the siege in Gaza in tandem with a Middle East peace process. Supported by: Elaine Smith*
