*S2M-2155.2 Dr Jean Turner: Fair to All, Personal to Each - The Next Steps for NHS Scotlandâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-2155) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from first "supports" to end and insert "welcomes the additional investment on health promotion, including its targeting of heart disease, cancer and stroke; however, urges the Scottish Executive as part of its next steps strategy and to fulfil its aim of returning all patients to the heart of the NHS, to include as part of the strategy a comprehensive review of services dedicated to palliative care and chronic conditions and, further, develop a national programme of diagnostic care, all of which continue to be under-resourced and under-funded, and believes that such a review will save the NHS money by identifying, treating and controlling such conditions in a more structured, preventative and cost-effective manner which will alleviate the consequent pressure on hospital beds and in-patient services."
