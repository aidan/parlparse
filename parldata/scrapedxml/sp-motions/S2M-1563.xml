 *S2M-1563 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Clear Labelling for Scotch Beef-That the Parliament welcomes the confirmation of the new rules governing Protected Geographic Indicator status for Scotch beef through the European Commission's Official Journal on 1 July 2004; recognises that these rules will ensure that any beef labelled as Scotch must be sourced from cattle that are born, bred and slaughtered in Scotland and have been reared exclusively through farm assurance schemes; congratulates Quality Meat Scotland (QMS) on its continuing hard work in promoting Scotch beef and believes that this decision can only assist QMS in further promoting Scotch beef worldwide, and agrees with NFU Scotland that this decision will protect and enhance the integrity of the world-leading Scotch beef brand in the face of an even more market-oriented environment by showing the value and strength of Scottish farm assurance schemes.
