*S3M-6415 Alasdair Allan: 70th Anniversary of the 51st (Highland) Division at St Valéry—That the Parliament notes the 70thanniversary of the Allied forces efforts at St Valéry-en-Caux between 4 and 12 June 1940; recognises the bravery and loyalty shown by the troops of the 51st Highland Division who were tasked to remain in occupied France after the evacuation of Dunkirk and who, in so doing, single-handedly maintained the pledge that Britain would "never abandon her ally in her hour of need", and pays tribute to the memory of the Highland soldiers lost and captured in the engagement.
