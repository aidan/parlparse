 *S2M-750 Eleanor Scott: Flow Country-That the Parliament notes that the Flow Country constitutes the biggest blanket bog in the world; remembers that significant damage has been done to it, including afforestation at taxpayers' expense, in the past; commends the partners in the Life Peatlands Project for their work on its ecological restoration; notes that bog restoration could reduce Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions by up to 10%, and urges the Scottish Executive to ensure that this national treasure is given the highest possible protection and is reconsidered for nomination to UNESCO as a World Heritage Site.
