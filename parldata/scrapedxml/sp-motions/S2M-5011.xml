 *S2M-5011 Ms Maureen Watt: Ambitious Building Standards to Combat Fuel Poverty and Climate Change—That the Parliament notes that energy standards within the Building (Scotland) Regulations 2004 are currently under review; believes that ambitious energy standards have great potential to reduce both fuel poverty and greenhouse gas emissions in Scotland; welcomes the aim of reducing CO2 emissions from new buildings contained in the proposed new standards; urges Scottish ministers to set ambitious targets for insulation and CO2 reduction from buildings proportionate with achieving a 60% reduction in emissions from buildings by 2050; notes research undertaken by the Building Research Establishment which suggests that compliance with energy standards in English building regulations may be as low as 57%; believes that research into Scottish compliance levels is required urgently, and calls on Scottish ministers to ensure that compulsory random air-tightness testing is introduced in all new buildings to ensure compliance with energy efficiency standards.
