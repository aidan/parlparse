*S3M-572 Bill Wilson: Trapping of Songbirds in Catalonia—That the Parliament supports Birdlife International, including RSPB and Spanish partner Sociedad Española de Ornitología (SEO), in its campaign to stop proposals by the Catalan government (Generalitat de Cataluña) to permit hunting of songbirds using limestick traps and net-traps; notes that this will pose a threat to hundreds of thousands of songbirds such as thrushes, warblers, flycatchers and fieldfares as they make their autumn migration through the Ebro region; further notes that the majority of redstarts from the United Kingdom will pass through Iberia en route to their African wintering grounds and that this species is declining in Europe; recognises that this is the type of indiscriminate and unsustainable hunting that the EU Birds Directive is designed to prevent, and calls on the Scottish Government to make representations to the Catalan government to reverse its decision on conservation grounds, both directly and via the UK and European Union.
