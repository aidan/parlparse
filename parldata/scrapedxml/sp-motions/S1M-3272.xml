*S1M-3272 Kay Ullrich: Coach Accident in France and School Trips Abroadâ€”That the Parliament notes the terrible accident in France involving a coach carrying pupils and staff from Largs Academy, which resulted in injury to passengers and the tragic and untimely death of Katherine Fish; expresses its sympathy to the family of Miss Fish, her friends and those who were injured; further notes the current position of the Scottish Executive in relation to routes and mode of travel for school trips abroad, as defined in the answer to Parliamentary Question S1W-26630 on 24 June 2002, and asks the Executive to reconsider its position and to encourage directors of education to explore other modes of travel for school trips abroad, including air and rail travel and, where coaches are used, to consider using the ferry route from Rosyth in order to minimise driving hours.
