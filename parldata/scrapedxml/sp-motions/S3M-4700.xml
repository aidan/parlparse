 *S3M-4700 Kenneth Gibson: Conservative Party Attacks on the NHS—That the Parliament notes with concern the vicious attacks being made on the NHS by right-wing Republicans in the United States; regrets the support being given to such attacks by Conservative Party politicians; is aware that Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan denounced the NHS on American television saying that he "wouldn’t wish it on anybody" and calling it a "60 year mistake"; acknowledges that his colleagues Roger Helmer MEP and Peter Bone MP backed these comments; agrees that this is a clear and calculated insult to everyone who works in the NHS, with the latter MEP calling it a "Stalinist system"; wonders whether such disgraceful views are widespread in the Conservative Party, and calls on the Conservative leader in the Scottish Parliament to publicly repudiate such comments and apologise to NHS staff and patients.
