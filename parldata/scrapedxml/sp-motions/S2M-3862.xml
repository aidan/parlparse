 S2M-3862 Bill Butler: Glasgow City Council and Fairtrade—That the Parliament warmly welcomes Glasgow City Council’s announcement that all coffee and tea served at the estimated 2,700 meetings and functions held each year in Glasgow City Chambers will now be fairtrade products; acknowledges that this is part of the city’s bid for fairtrade status, which is awarded to cities that meet the five goals set by the Fairtrade Foundation; expresses the hope that businesses and organisations across the city follow the council’s lead and use fairtrade products on a day-to-day basis; recognises that fairtrade products provide a practical, easy and ethical way of supporting producers in the developing world, and wishes Glasgow well in its bid to obtain fairtrade city status. Supported by: Mark Ballard, Linda Fabiani, Sarah Boyack, Frances Curran, Mr Alasdair Morrison, Mr Stewart Maxwell, Ms Sandra White, Mr Bruce McFee, Robin Harper, Christine May, Patrick Harvie, Cathy Peattie, Marlyn Glen, Eleanor Scott, Mrs Mary Mulligan, Trish Godman, Marilyn Livingstone, Tommy Sheridan, Brian Adam, Mr Kenneth Macintosh, Jackie Baillie, Karen Whitefield, Mr Charlie Gordon, Shiona Baird, Mr Jamie Stone, Mike Pringle, Karen Gillon, Janis Hughes, Chris Ballance
