*S3M-2733 John Scott: Proposed Increase in Charge to RNLI for Radio Channel Use—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by Ofcom that the annual charge paid by the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) for the use of radio channels should be increased from £40,000 to £260,000; notes that the RNLI is a charitable organisation, whose lifeboats are staffed by volunteers who over the last year have rescued almost 8,000 individuals; believes that the increase in charge proposed has the potential to impact damagingly on the service provided by the RNLI, and urges Ofcom to abandon this proposed charge increase.
