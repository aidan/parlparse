 *S3M-6031 Murdo Fraser: Afterwards—That the Parliament appreciates the contribution of Mark Frankland, author of the book, Afterwards, and the Scottish veterans who told their stories of battling with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); notes that the three veterans talk of their experiences in Northern Ireland, the Falklands and Iraq as well as their experiences when they attempted to reintegrate themselves into civilian life; recognises that Scotland’s veterans have given everything for their country and that it is important to understand the stories that they bring back from these conflicts; considers that veterans are courageous and dignified individuals who have served their country with pride, and believes that greater support is required for veterans with PTSD and that ex-servicemen and women should be given the level of care that reflects the service and commitment that they gave to protect their country.
