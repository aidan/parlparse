*S3M-3351 Liam McArthur: Retained Firefighters and the Working Time Directive Opt-out—That the Parliament notes with regret the vote by the European Parliament on 17 December 2008 in favour of removing Britain’s working time directive opt-out; also notes with serious concern the effect that the removal of the opt-out will have on retained firefighters across Scotland and the consequences that it may have for public health and safety; further notes that of 391 fire stations across Scotland 321 are staffed by 3,429 retained firefighters; notes the valuable service that these volunteer firefighters provide to their communities and that the Retained Firefighters Union opposes the removal of the opt-out; considers that, if the opt-out is removed and Retained Duty System (RDS) fire stations are proven unviable under the working time directive, 91% of the United Kingdom will lose valuable emergency fire cover, and notes the serious and potentially fatal consequences that the removal will have on communities across Scotland.
