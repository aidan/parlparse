*S2M-612 Roseanna Cunningham: Potential G8 Summit at Gleneagles-That the Parliament notes reports that Gleneagles is being considered as a potential venue for a G8 summit meeting; expresses concern at the disruption this could cause for strategic road and rail links and the negative impact that would have on both the local and national economy; recognises the immense pressures that would be placed on police by the scale of the security operation required; supports the bringing of international events to Scotland but believes that the G8 summit represents a poisoned chalice, and regrets that the decision to consider Gleneagles appears to have been based on a belief amongst the Foreign and Commonwealth Office that Gleneagles is remote.
