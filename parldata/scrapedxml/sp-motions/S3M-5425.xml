*S3M-5425 Jamie Hepburn: Tony Blair Finally Reveals the Truth on Iraq—That the Parliament recalls that the House of Commons voted in favour of the United Kingdom participating in the United States-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 based on the premise that the Iraqi Government possessed weapons of mass destruction despite it being the case that UN weapons inspectors in Iraq had found no such weapons in the period before the invasion, that many people at the time considered it unlikely that any such weapons existed and that no such weapons have been found since the invasion; further recalls that this invasion took place in the face of significant domestic and international opposition to war; considers that the war in Iraq has led to the deaths of hundreds of coalition combatants and tens of thousands of civilians as well as unleashing previously unknown sectarian and political terrorism in Iraq; further considers that the recent revelation by Tony Blair that he would have supported military intervention in Iraq regardless of whether or not the Iraqi regime possessed weapons of mass destruction is telling in the extreme and suggests that those arguments that the regime did possess such weapons were no more than a charade used to justify an already-decided-on invasion that was more to do with Western political and economic interests than it ever was about removing any tangible threat posed to the UK or US by Iraq; believes that the actions of George Bush’s "coalition of the willing" in Iraq have served only to destabilise the world; notes the body of legal opinion that suggests that the invasion was illegal, and believes that this opinion should be put to the test by having those leaders who authorised the invasion tried before internationally recognised courts for their alleged criminality.
