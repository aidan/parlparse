*S3M-8065 Bob Doris: Clockwork Orange, Keeping Glasgow Moving—That the Parliament notes that it is estimated that up to 100,000 extra passengers used the Glasgow subway system during the month of December 2010 as a result of inclement weather conditions, which hampered many overground transport services in the city; commends the SPT staff team for rising to the challenge of keeping Glasgow moving during the severe weather; believes that this displays the reliance that many Glaswegians put on the subway system, which it considers would greatly benefit from modernisation, and looks forward to positive support from the Scottish Government to appropriately back SPT Subway to allow the modernisation plan to proceed.
