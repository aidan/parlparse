*S3M-1150 Helen Eadie: Congratulations to The Initiative—That the Parliament commends the work of Rev David Adams and the  parishioners of Cowdenbeath Trinity Church in working to establish The Initiative, a project based in the Cowdenbeath and Kelty area of Fife to support younger members of the community aged 11 to 18 by delivering employment and training courses through a full-time youth worker and a "transition programme" for pupils making the transition from primary to secondary school; further notes that they intend to develop this provision by reaching the over 18 age group, who face challenges such as becoming single parents, bereavement, relationship or debt issues; notes that the organisers of The Initiative are working with the input of professionals to enable them to put together a feasibility study to establish the strengths and weaknesses of the current project, to develop a strategy to address these findings and, going forward, to work out how best to meet the demands and needs of their targeted beneficiaries and their vision of the future, and finally welcomes the announcement by the Big Lottery Fund that it has awarded £10,000 towards this splendid work.
