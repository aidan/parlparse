*S1M-938 Mr Adam Ingram: Expenditure on Beach and Coastal Maintenance—That the Parliament notes that only three of Scotland’s beaches have won the European blue flag award; further notes that a mere £0.6 million has been spent by the Scottish Executive on the upkeep of Scotland’s coastline, and that Scotland’s councils have spent considerably more than this on coastal protection and maintenance, despite severe financial constraints; believes that current expenditure levels are insufficient to ensure that more Scottish beaches reach the blue flag standard, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to reconsider budget allocations with a view to ensuring that local authorities can bring more of Scotland’s beaches up to standard.
