 *S3M-3346 Aileen Campbell: Closure of New Lanark Post Officeâ€”That the Parliament notes with regret the closure of New Lanark Post Office on 28 January 2009 as part of the Post Office Network Change Programme; notes that this closure, like the vast majority of closures included in the programme, was bitterly opposed by the local community; believes that the closure is particularly ironic given its location within a world heritage site that is a major tourist destination and an important attraction during the year of Homecoming as well as an important community in its own right, and calls on the UK Government immediately to halt any further post office closures and its privatisation plans for the Royal Mail.
