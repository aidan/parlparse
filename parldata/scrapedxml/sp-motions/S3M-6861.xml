 *S3M-6861 Jackie Baillie: You Take The High Road And I’ll Take The New Road—That the Parliament congratulates the Helensburgh and District Access Trust on its work establishing the Three Lochs Way; understands that this new 50 km long-distance path links Loch Lomond, the Gareloch and Loch Long; notes that the Three Lochs Way joins towns and villages on the west side of Loch Lomond between Balloch and Inveruglas; further notes that the path is considered to be a gentle, mainly low-level route and that it can be walked easily in three to four days; commends the work of the Helensburgh and District Access Trust on this project since 2004, and hopes that people from across Scotland will come and enjoy the beauty of what is believed to be one of the most majestic landscapes in the world.
