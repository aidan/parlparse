 *S3M-5478♦ Mary Scanlon: Highlands Dairy Industry—That the Parliament notes with serious concern the state of the Highlands dairy industry where the number of producers has fallen from 43 in 1998 to 11 today; further notes the management buyout that will result in 60 job losses at Claymore Dairies in Nairn but provide a future for the remaining dairy farmers in that there will be a local market for their produce; welcomes the fact that this may encourage the remaining producers to continue milk production rather than consider leaving the industry, which will ensure that milk is still produced and processed in the Highlands, and  would welcome support for Claymore Dairies from local businesses and major retailers to help secure the remaining 72 jobs at the plant and a market for dairy farmers in Moray and the Highlands.
