 *S3M-1271# Elaine Murray: Hunting of Wild Boar with Dogs—That the Parliament is very concerned by reports in the Sunday Times of 27 January 2008 that commercial hunting of wild boar with dogs is being organised on an estate in Dumfries and Galloway; is further concerned that such activity may cause suffering to both the boar and dogs concerned, and believes that the legality of such activity should be investigated and that, if the hunting of wild boar with dogs is permitted under current legislation, legislation should be introduced to ban such activity.
