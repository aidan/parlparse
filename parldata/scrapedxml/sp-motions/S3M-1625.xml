 *S3M-1625 Jamie Hepburn: International Committee of the Red Cross Report on State of Iraq—That the Parliament notes the publication of Iraq: No Let-up in the Humanitarian Crisis by the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC); expresses its serious concern at the findings of this paper which include that "millions of Iraqis have insufficient access to clean water, sanitation and health care", that "tens of thousands" of Iraqi civilians have disappeared since the invasion of Iraq in 2003, that there are only 30,000 hospital beds in public hospitals when 80,000 are required, that a "lack of midwives means that many women giving birth at night must do so without assistance", that even though the estimated average monthly salary in Iraq is now around US $150 that many Iraqi families must spend around US $50 per month on water as the production of drinking water has steadily worsened over the last year, which directly contributed to an outbreak of cholera in 2007; commends the ICRC for its humanitarian work in Iraq alongside the Iraqi Red Crescent which has included clarifying the status of many missing Iraqis, as well as providing assistance to tens of thousands of displaced persons and needy Iraqi residents with food and other essentials and supporting the delivery of medical services; believes that the findings of the ICRC are further evidence of the humanitarian catastrophe caused by the invasion of Iraq in 2003, rubbing further salt into the wounds of the Iraqi people following the disaster of a decade of sanctions, and calls on the international community to work positively with the ICRC and other non-governmental organisations trying to improve the lives of ordinary Iraqi citizens.
