*S3M-3974 Mr Frank McAveety: Retreat to Glasgow—That the Parliament commends the efforts of the Lodging House Mission and, in particular, wishes the organisation well for the Retreat on the Streets project, organised for Thursday 7 May 2009; recognises that the project, which invites Glasgow residents to spend the day in the city centre with nothing to do except reflect on their surroundings and the people with whom they share a city, spending only £1.50 throughout the whole day, is likely to raise awareness of social inequalities within the city of Glasgow; praises the project for its encouragement of quiet contemplation within the boundaries of a busy city environment, and hopes that the Retreat on the Streets project will be a success and provide many people in Glasgow with the chance to view their city in a new light and maybe lead to spiritual enlightenment for some.
