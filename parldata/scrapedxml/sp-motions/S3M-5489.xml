*S3M-5489 Ken Macintosh: Why Must Our Children Pay?—That the Parliament supports the Educational Institute of Scotland in its campaign, why must our children pay?, to promote Scottish education and to protect the funding of schools and colleges; considers that Scotland’s pupils and students should not be forced to pay for the mistakes of others by having their education damaged due to budget reductions; deplores the loss of almost 2,500 teachers over the last two years and the similar decline in numbers of support staff; expresses alarm at the cuts made in education budgets and classroom resources across the country at a time of vital curricular reform; agrees that in times of economic difficulty it is even more important that young people are encouraged to stay longer in education and training; recognises that it is the countries that invest in education and training that reap the rewards in terms of jobs and economic prosperity, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that our education system is properly supported and adequately resourced, allowing all our young people to reach their potential.
