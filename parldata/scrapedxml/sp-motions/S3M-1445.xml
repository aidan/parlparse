 *S3M-1445 Keith Brown: A Berry Good Solution for Scottish Public Health—That the Parliament recognises the parallels between diet-related public health problems in Scotland and those formerly prevalent in Finland; notes the practical and successful health initiatives put forward by the Finnish Government to support and encourage dietary changes, in particular the consumption of locally grown soft fruits; expresses support and encouragement for small businesses in this sector, such as Ella Drinks Ltd in Alloa; applauds the work of Berry Scotland in advocating these policies in Scotland but notes concerns existing at grassroots in the berry sector at other bodies in the industry having an excessively UK-wide focus that impairs the ability to promote their sector in the particular Scottish health context and that does not compare favourably with well-supported representative bodies in related sectors such as Quality Meat Scotland; acknowledges that the scale of enterprises in this sector means that solutions to this imbalance such as a levy-based trade organisation would almost certainly require central co-ordination and support; welcomes existing support for soft fruit businesses delivered through the Scottish Government’s enterprise arms, and encourages the Scottish Government to build on this by entering a dialogue with the sector to establish how further critical support could also be delivered from a health standpoint so that the sector can be recognised for and release its potential to help address many of Scotland’s underlying health problems.
