*S3M-2328 Kenneth Gibson: Brussels to Allow USA Access to Private Dataâ€”That the Parliament condemns EU proposals to allow law enforcement and security agencies in the United States of America access to private information on EU citizens; acknowledges that this will include personal data from banks, credit card companies and other agencies; notes that firms that supply information to US agencies at present, in breach of data protection laws, can be prosecuted but that if this agreement is signed and ratified such firms will be protected; regrets the lack of public awareness and debate on this issue, and believes that access to such private data is in breach of EU law and should be vetoed by the governments of member states to prevent final agreement and implementation later this year.
