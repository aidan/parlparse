*S2M-594.3 Chris Ballance: Celebrating 150 Years of Public Libraries in Scotland-As an amendment to motion (S2M-594) in the name of Mr Frank McAveety, leave out from "and, in particular" to end and insert "; congratulates Scotland's librarians but notes with concern falling visitor numbers and calls on the Scottish Executive to do all it can to reverse this situation; notes that libraries have great potential as community hubs and that their outreach and social inclusion functions are vital and often overlooked and applauds those libraries that are imaginatively tackling these important issues, and further congratulates those libraries that have put their catalogues online and engaged fully with new technology, enabling more of the population to access them."
