 * S2M-2913 Eleanor Scott: Protection of the Environment of the Cromarty Firthâ€”That the Parliament recognises the significance of the Cromarty Firth Special Protected Area, with its component Sites of Special Scientific Interest, in protecting the most northerly major wintering site in Europe for waders and water birds; considers that the Cromarty Firth is a highly important part of the Moray Basin ecosystem and that any pollution of its waters would endanger wildlife, such as bottlenose dolphins and ospreys, throughout the basin, and therefore opposes any proposal to use the Nigg fabrication yard in the Cromarty Firth for decommissioning ships contaminated with toxins.
