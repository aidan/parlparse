 S2M-1861 Patrick Harvie: Air Pollution in Glasgow—That the Parliament notes the mass support from the people of Scotland for a ban on smoking in public places due to their concerns about the danger that smoking causes to public health; further notes that recent research into levels of nitrogen oxides in the air has shown that breathing the air in Glasgow is the equivalent of smoking more than 14 cigarettes a day; is concerned that, even if the ban on smoking in public places is implemented, city-dwellers will still be exposed to dangerously high levels of pollutants caused by emissions from motor vehicles; calls upon all those who support a ban on smoking in public places to support all measures that would lessen the severe effects of road traffic on human health, and further calls on the Scottish Executive and Glasgow City Council to abandon their plans to build the M74 Northern Extension and invest the cost of the motorway, currently estimated at between £375 million and £1 billion, in traffic reduction measures and improvements to public transport.
