*S2M-3135# Rob Gibson: Wallace and Moray Commemoration—That the Parliament welcomes BBC Radio Scotland’s vibrant new series which interprets the history of William Wallace and Andrew de Moray when they raised the Scots banner to regain Scotland’s independence; believes that the ideas and inspirations of medieval Scots, their allies and neighbours should form an essential part of every child’s experience in Scottish schools, and considers that the Minister for Education and Young People should make a response in this 700th anniversary year of Wallace’s execution to indicate how such key events in Scotland’s history can be brought to life as part of a critically-tested, multi-cultural curriculum.
