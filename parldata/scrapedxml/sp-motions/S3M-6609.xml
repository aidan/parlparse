 * S3M-6609 Bill Wilson: Tackling Traffickers and Helping Trafficked People—That the Parliament welcomes the Anti-Trafficking Monitoring Group report, Wrong kind of victim? One year on: an analysis of UK measures to protect trafficked persons; is dismayed that it found that the UK Government has yet to satisfactorily implement the entirety of its obligations under the Council of Europe’s Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings, that the National Referral Mechanism is apparently failing to meet the needs of people who have suffered abuse and trauma and that the system has not facilitated prosecutions and bypasses the UK’s framework to safeguard children; congratulates Strathclyde Police and Dumfries and Galloway Constabulary, however, on the report’s statement that participants had highlighted the fact that these forces had made good progress on addressing trafficking, and calls on the relevant institutions in the UK to share best practice and implement all the report’s recommendations as soon as possible.
