*S3M-266 Jamie Hepburn: Ticket Prices for France v Scotland—That the Parliament notes with concern the ticket prices of £41 and £82 being imposed on the fans of the Scottish national football side for its upcoming European Championship qualifying match against France in Paris and, given that these prices are far in excess of those applied to the previous fixture in Glasgow, asks the Scottish Football Association to engage with the French Football Federation to look at this again and to apply pricing that is reasonable for the average, loyal football supporter.
