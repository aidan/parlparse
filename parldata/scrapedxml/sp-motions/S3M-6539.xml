*S3M-6539 Bill Kidd: Welfare Reform and Means-testing of DLA—That the Parliament notes that the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions has stated in his speech, Welfare for the 21st Century, that "… for some people, the move from welfare into work means they face losing more than 95 pence for every additional £1 they earn. As a result, the poor are in effect being taxed at an effective rate that far exceeds the wealthy."; is of the firm opinion that, while welcoming any reduction in taxation or benefit withdrawal rate on poor people, it should not be funded by a reduction in other benefits; believes in particular that Disability Living Allowance (DLA) should not be made means-tested, as was suggested in the paper, Dynamic Benefits, in its proposal for a Universal Life Credit, which "would be a simple means-tested benefit that provides additional income to those on low or no earnings. It would replace Housing Benefit, Council Tax Benefit, Child Tax Credit and Disability Living Allowance", and is of the view that DLA is a benefit that all people who meet the relevant disability criteria should be allowed to continue receiving. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
