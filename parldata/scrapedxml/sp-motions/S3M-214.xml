*S3M-214 Irene Oldfather: EU Ban on Cat and Dog Fur—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the European Parliament to support a complete ban on the import, export and trade of cat and dog fur across all 27 member states; places on record its disgust at the practice of breeding cats and dogs for the purpose of killing them for their fur; hopes that, in conjunction with similar existing bans in the USA and Australia, this will signal the end of this abhorrent trade in the global market, and congratulates animal rights agencies and concerned European citizens who successfully lobbied the European Parliament on this issue.
