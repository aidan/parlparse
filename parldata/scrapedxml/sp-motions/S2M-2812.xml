 *S2M-2812 Michael McMahon: Keir Hardie Memorial Primary School Eco School Award—That the Parliament congratulates Keir Hardie Memorial Primary School, Newarthill, Lanarkshire as it celebrates obtaining permanent Eco School status; notes that it is the only school in Scotland to have both permanent Eco School status and the Charter Mark; notes that it is the only school south of Perth so far to receive permanent Eco School status; recognises the efforts of staff, pupils and parents over a number of years in securing this achievement, and hopes that the school’s success will encourage others to reach the same level of success in making both schools and the wider community aware of the importance of protecting the environment. Supported by: Donald Gorrie* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
