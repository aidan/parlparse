 *S2M-2497# Carolyn Leckie: TETRA Masts—That the Parliament congratulates North Lanarkshire Council’s planning committee for rejecting two applications to erect TETRA masts in Cumbernauld; agrees with the committee in asking for the burden of responsibility for considering the health risks of TETRA to be transferred to the Scottish Executive; believes that there is mounting evidence of serious health risks associated with TETRA and other forms of electro-magnetic radiation; notes that the applicant, O2, did not challenge the health evidence presented by the objectors and therefore believes that at least the precautionary principle should apply; considers that there should be a moratorium on the erection of these masts whether under current legislation planning permission is required or not; further considers that in future planning legislation health should always be admissible as a material consideration, and in the meantime encourages all local authorities to follow the example of North Lanarkshire by refusing to grant similar applications.
