 *S2M-5535.1 Mark Ballard: Forth and Tay Road Bridges Tollsâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-5535) in the name of Tricia Marwick, leave out from "the tolls" to end and insert "existing tolls on the Forth Road Bridge and the Tay Road Bridge should be replaced with a scheme of variable charging which takes into account factors such as occupancy levels, peak hour traffic flows and specific exemptions, including for public transport, and that the Tay Road Bridge Joint Board and the Forth Transport Estuary Forum should be given more flexibility to use toll revenues to deal with transport issues in the vicinity." Supported by: Mr Mark Ruskell*
