 *S2M-3424 Ms Sandra White: MRSA Swab Testingâ€”That the Parliament notes the introduction of a swab test to detect MRSA which has been developed by Heartland Hospital in Birmingham; notes that the results take two hours to obtain; notes that other tests for MRSA can take up to 48 hours to give results and that in this time the infection could spread to other patients, and believes that the Minister for Health and Community Care has a duty of care to those in Scottish hospitals and that there should be a trial of the swab kit in Scotland, in parallel to that recently announced in England.
