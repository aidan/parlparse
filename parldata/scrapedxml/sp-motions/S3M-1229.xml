 *S3M-1229 Richard Baker: Beating Bowel Cancer - 2008 BE LOUD! Campaign—That the Parliament supports Beating Bowel Cancer’s BE LOUD! campaign, formally the Loud Tie campaign, which aims to raise awareness of bowel cancer; notes that bowel cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in Scotland, with around 1,600 people dying from the illness and over 3,500 new cases being diagnosed each year; recognises that early clinical detection and intervention can save lives; welcomes the continuation of the national screening programme, successfully piloted in Grampian, Tayside and Fife, which will see over 650,000 potentially vulnerable people being screened by 2009; urges people to take part in the national screening programme by returning their self-test kits; supports further improvements in bowel cancer services in Scotland which build on increased patient involvement and public awareness delivered through managed clinical networks, and encourages MSPs to support the BE LOUD! campaign between 28 January and 3 February 2008 on behalf of Beating Bowel Cancer.
