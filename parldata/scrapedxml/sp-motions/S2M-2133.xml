*S2M-2133 Irene Oldfather: Road Safety for the Elderly—That the Parliament acknowledges the increased vulnerability of elderly pedestrians on the roads; notes that, in the last four years, an average of 1,103 people aged over 60 and 1,189 people aged over 70 were involved in road accidents; recognises that some elderly pedestrians can be at a greater risk of involvement in accidents due to sight, mobility and hearing impairment; acknowledges the Scottish Executive's continued investment in road safety programmes such as the foolsspeed and Christmas drink driving campaigns, but calls on the Executive to consider running a road safety awareness campaign to encourage drivers to recognise the specific difficulties that elderly and disabled pedestrians face.
