*S3M-2663 Aileen Campbell: Red Cross Civilians and Conflict Month—That the Parliament notes the British Red Cross initiative to mark October 2008 as Civilians and Conflict Month, aimed at raising awareness and understanding of the impact of conflicts around the world on civilian populations; further notes the results of a survey conducted by the Red Cross showing that over 60% of people in Scotland were aware of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, but that fewer than 2% were aware of ongoing conflicts in Sudan, Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo; welcomes the initiative by the Red Cross, including the launch of an online alternate reality game, Traces of Hope, which brings to life the work of the Red Cross’s international tracing and message service through the case study of a young man separated from his mother by conflict in Uganda, and encourages people across Scotland to use this opportunity to learn more about the effect of conflict on civilian populations and to support in whatever way they can efforts to bring about an end to conflicts around the world.
