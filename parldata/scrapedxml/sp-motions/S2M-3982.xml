*S2M-3982&lt;&gt; Des McNulty: Darfur—That the Parliament is gravely concerned about evidence of genocide and the continuing humanitarian emergency in Darfur, Sudan; notes that 9 March 2006 marks the 18-month anniversary of the United States’ declaration that the atrocities in Darfur are genocide; is alarmed that the peace process remains stalled while an estimated 10,000 people continue to die each month; further notes that the people of Darfur lack adequate protection, that physical and sexual violence continues unabated and that humanitarian workers are increasingly being targeted; shares the concerns expressed in a recent House of Commons committee report which described the international communities’ response to the crisis as "scandalously ineffective", and believes that the international community must now fulfil its responsibility to protect the people of Darfur.
