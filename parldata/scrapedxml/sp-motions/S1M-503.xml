*S1M-503 Tommy Sheridan: Drug Addiction in Glasgow—That the Parliament notes that drug addiction in Glasgow is five times higher than anywhere in Britain; recognises that such high levels of drug addiction have pushed drugs services in the City to breaking point; notes that social workers in Glasgow are having to work under unbearable pressure, given that the number of problem drug users in the City has almost doubled in nine years; notes the result of a recent survey, which suggests that one in thirty of Glasgow’s adults are now drug addicts and that there are between 12,419 and 15,368 problem drug users in the city and also reveals that more than 4,000 adults who have been treated by 13 social work projects have dependent children amounting to almost 1,000 youngsters, and believes that, given the serious and grave problem drug using situation within the City of Glasgow, special extra resources must be diverted from the Scottish Executive’s drug enforcement project to allow the City of Glasgow to spend more on drug prevention and treatment.
