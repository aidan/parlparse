 *S2M-4343 Linda Fabiani: Heartstart UK Session in Scottish Parliament—That the Parliament welcomes the British Heart Foundation’s Heartstart UK training session in emergency life support (ELS) techniques for cross-party members of the Parliament and their staff; notes that Heartstart UK is a training course offering basic instruction in ELS techniques, including cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR), and that taking part in a two-hour basic course ensures that participants know what to do in a life-threatening emergency; remains concerned that, despite the significant fall in mortality from coronary heart disease in Scotland in the last decade, heart and circulatory disease is still Scotland’s biggest killer; is encouraged that evidence shows that CPR provided by a bystander more than doubles a victim’s chance of survival; agrees with BHF Scotland that every child leaving school in Scotland should know what to do in a life-threatening emergency, and urges the Scottish Executive to work with the Heartstart UK team with a view to expanding the provision of affiliated schemes in schools across the country.
