*S2M-94 Jackie Baillie: Charity Law Reform—That the Parliament notes that existing charity law is based on a statute that was passed in 1601 and therefore in urgent need of modernisation to reflect today's public perception of a charity; believes that the recommendations arising from the McFadden Commission form the basis of a robust legislative framework fit for the 21st century; recognises public concern about ensuring that charitable donations are used for the core purpose of a charity; welcomes the Scottish Executive's intention to establish the Office of the Scottish Charities Regulator (OSCR) to monitor the activities of charities and ensure transparency; notes that the OSCR will not have full statutory powers to cover all of its functions and that the Scottish Executive will keep under review the need for legislation, but, nevertheless, considers that the urgent need for a comprehensive charities bill is essential to creating a pro-active system of regulation to restore public confidence.
