 *S2M-5526 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Re-engage the Kids, Reduce Class Sizes—That the Parliament deplores the recent figures from the Scottish Executive that show school exclusions to have risen by 18% in four years to an average of 226 per day in 2005-06; notes that there are too many children and young people disengaged from the school system; believes that, in order to begin the process of returning these children and young people to engagement with school, it is essential that there is a national standard for class sizes of no more than 20 and, for composite and practical classes, no more than 15, and further believes that alongside this reduction in class sizes it is essential that all school staff have appropriate training and support to meet the additional support needs of all pupils.
