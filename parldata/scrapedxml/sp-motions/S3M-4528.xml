*S3M-4528 Mary Scanlon: Congratulations to Strathspey Thistle FC—That the Parliament congratulates Strathspey Thistle FC on its move to the Highland Football League (HFL); notes that its first home match in this senior football league will be on 6 August 2009 and believes that many people from the area will turn out to watch this match and continue to support the local team in the months and years ahead; understands the urgency to implement the changes to the ground required in order for the club to take its place in the league following a vote by existing HFL clubs in February to admit three further teams, including Strathspey Thistle, into the country’s most northern senior football league; congratulates the club on its vision to encourage youth football in the area with a youth committee formed to oversee an under-13s and under-14s team for the Moray Youth League and an under-15s team in the HFL Development League, and wishes the entire team, committee and supporters the best of luck for their first season in senior football.
