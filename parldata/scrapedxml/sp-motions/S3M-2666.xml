*S3M-2666 Cathy Jamieson: Maybole Bypassâ€”That the Parliament recognises the importance of improved transport links between South Ayrshire and the rest of Scotland to the economic recovery of the area; agrees that the upgrading of the A77 and the construction of the Maybole bypass will play a vital role in improving transport links to the ports of Stranraer and Cairnryan and in attracting future private investment, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that South Ayrshire connectivity is made a priority when the outcome of the strategic transport projects review is announced.
