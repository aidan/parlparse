 S2M-3998 Frances Curran: Betty Heathfieldâ€”That the Parliament notes with sadness the death of Betty Heathfield, an inspirational figure during the onslaught unleashed by the Thatcher Government against the National Union of Mineworkers in 1984-85; recognises the vital role that she played in the creation and development of the support groups organised under the banner of Women Against Pit Closures which sustained the strike and mining communities as the Tory Government attempted to starve the mineworkers back to work in the winter of 1984; recognises the selfless courage and tenacity which she brought to the struggle, and salutes Betty Heathfield, born 30 March 1927 and died 16 February 2006, as a heroine of the working class. Supported by: Carolyn Leckie, Campbell Martin, Colin Fox, Tommy Sheridan, Bill Butler, Ms Sandra White, Ms Rosemary Byrne*
