 *S3M-22 Jeremy Purvis: Radical Reform on Sentencing Policy—That the Parliament believes that the current sentencing system is failing to change the behaviour of offenders given short prison sentences; notes that this leads to increased crime as these individuals often reoffend following completion of their sentences; considers that a fundamental overhaul of short-term sentencing and the Scottish Prison Service is essential to improve rehabilitation, thus cutting crime; calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward legislation to replace short-term prison sentences with tough community sentences, and further calls for the replacement of the Scottish Prison Service with a Scottish custody and rehabilitation service working with other services, businesses and community justice authorities to reduce reoffending. Supported by: Tavish Scott*, Jim Hume*, Jim Tolson*, Alison McInnes*, Liam McArthur*, Margaret Smith*, Iain Smith*, Ross Finnie*, Mike Rumbles*, Mike Pringle*, John Farquhar Munro*, Robert Brown*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Nicol Stephen*, Hugh O’Donnell*
