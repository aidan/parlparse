 *S3M-4462 Sandra White: Sounding Good—That the Parliament commends the Sound Lab, a registered charity, which helps young people in the east end of Glasgow aged between 12 and 25 to advance their education through music, the arts, media skills and digital technology, for its continuing dedication and innovation in providing a platform for young people to reach their full potential; congratulates the Sound Lab on its most recent successes, which will see it produce a music and drama performance that will be shown during the Getting Real About Alcohol ‘N’ Drugs week and the production of an animation film with the BBC on mental health awareness that will be shown during the Scottish Mental Health Arts and Film Festival, and believes that by offering these exciting opportunities, whilst exploring the social issues affecting many young people, the Sound Lab is a shining example to others.
