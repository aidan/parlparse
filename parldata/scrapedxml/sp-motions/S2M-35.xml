 *S2M-35 Donald Gorrie: Scottish Premier League Rules—That the Parliament congratulates Juventus and AC Milan on reaching the final of Europe's premier club competition, the UEFA Champions League Cup; notes that three of the four competing semi-finalists in the competition share their playing grounds with other clubs; further notes that under current Scottish Premier League (SPL) rules these clubs would not, like Falkirk Football Club, be allowed to play in Scotland's premier league because of the ground sharing rules, and calls on the SPL to review its rules and admit Falkirk Football Club to the premier league with effect from next season as its winning of the Scottish Football League First Division title merits.
