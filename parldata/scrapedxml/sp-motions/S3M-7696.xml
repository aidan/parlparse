 *S3M-7696♦ Brian Adam: Fuel Tax Price Increase Double Whammy—That the Parliament notes that fuel prices throughout Scotland have increased again due to the rise in VAT to 20% and an increase in fuel duty by the UK Government in January adding 0.76p to the price of a litre of petrol and diesel making diesel prices the second highest in Europe; notes that 62% of the cost of an average litre of diesel is tax as opposed to a European average of 49%; notes that in Aberdeen, despite its being known as Europe’s oil capital, petrol and diesel prices in January were again over 130p per litre, which has increased costs for small businesses and the road haulage industry, which it considers have been forced to pass increases on to customers, contributing to rising inflation, and believes that cutting the cost of fuel by 10p per litre in Scotland would cost only about half of the estimated £1 billion in extra revenue that the Treasury is set to take in as a result of rising oil prices.
