*S2M-5543 Tommy Sheridan: Troops Out of Iraq: Don’t Attack Iran—That the Parliament notes the growing, bloody and brutal carnage in Iraq which claims thousands of innocent lives each week; believes that the continued presence of what many consider to be illegally occupying US and UK troops is a major factor in the bloody conflict engulfing Iraq and is not part of the solution; supports the worldwide calls, including from the overwhelming majority of Iraqi citizens according to several opinion polls, to withdraw UK and US troops immediately as a first serious step towards stability and genuine recovery within Iraq; welcomes the Stop the War conference to be held in Glasgow on Saturday 10 February 2007 and the Bin the Bomb rally to be held, also in Glasgow, two weeks later on 24 February; opposes any plans to attack Iran, and believes that the British Prime Minister and Gordon Brown, the current Chancellor of the Exchequer, should issue unequivocal statements now denouncing US neo-con plans to bomb Iran in recognition of the fact that such acts of state terrorism would cause untold misery, suffering and war across the Middle East and the globe.
