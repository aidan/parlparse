*S3M-3098 George Foulkes: Universities Allied for Essential Medicines—That the Parliament recognises and supports the founding principles of Universities Allied for Essential Medicines (UAED), a global student organisation that seeks to ensure that all medicines discovered during research at educational institutions are made as available as possible to the third world; recognises that only 10% of money spent on research and development goes to 90% of the world’s health problems; believes it is unacceptable that only a third of humanity has regular access to essential medicine, and praises the work of students like Sinead Cook and Chris Lawrence who have worked so hard to bring this great cause to the United Kingdom for the first time and ensure that the University of Edinburgh acts as a beacon for international development.
