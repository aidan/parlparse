 *S3M-5023 Pauline McNeill: Water Flows in Memorial Fountain—That the Parliament welcomes the restoration of the A-listed Stewart Memorial Fountain in Glasgow’s Kelvingrove Park; notes that the structure was built in 1872 to commemorate Robert Stewart, the city’s Lord Provost between 1851 and 1854 who championed the Loch Katrine water system, which virtually eradicated cholera and typhus in Glasgow; further notes the comments of the current Lord Provost, Bob Winter, that the drive, determination and energy of the late Lord Provost, Robert Stewart, brought clean water to the people of Glasgow and that that single deed made the biggest impact on the citizens of the city in terms of health, wealth and improvement of social conditions than any other, as well as revolutionising industry; congratulates Glasgow City Council for overseeing the restoration of the fountain in partnership with Glasgow City Heritage Trust, the Heritage Lottery Fund, Scottish Water, the Better Glasgow Fund and The Pilgrim Trust, and believes that the fountain, which was inspired by Sir Walter Scott’s poem, The Lady of the Lake, is a lasting legacy to a man who helped bring clean water to Glasgow.
