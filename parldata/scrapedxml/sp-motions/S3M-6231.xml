 *S3M-6231 Ian McKee: North Pole Haircut for Teenage Cancer Trust—That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh’s award-winning hairdresser, Charlie Miller, for raising around £10,000 for the Teenage Cancer Trust through a fundraising expedition to the Arctic Circle, led and organised by Sir Tom Farmer, which saw the first ever hair cut at the North Pole; notes that the 65-year old hairdresser travelled with entrepreneur Sir Tom Farmer, 69, who agreed to having his hair cut in temperatures below minus 30 degrees and with explorer David Hempleman-Adams, who has climbed the world’s seven highest mountains; further notes that all money raised will go towards the supply of real hair wigs for young cancer patients across Scotland, a charity project that Charlie Miller has been working on for several years, and commends the efforts of everyone involved in the expedition.
