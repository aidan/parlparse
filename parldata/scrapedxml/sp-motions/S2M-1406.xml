 *S2M-1406# Helen Eadie: Reserved Contracts to Support Remploy-That the Parliament recognises the work of Remploy in Scotland in supporting 700 people with special needs in employment and congratulates the organisation on its training and development programme which has seen the creation of dedicated learning rooms at all 10 of its employment sites, with 275 employees currently undertaking skills training in language and mathematics and a further 135 involved in other learning activity, and a commitment of at least 5% of working time over a year to be dedicated to personal development; notes that this programme has been implemented in just over two years, and believes that the Scottish Executive and all publicly-funded organisations should examine their procurement policies with a view to reserving contracts for supported employment organisations such as those working with Remploy.
