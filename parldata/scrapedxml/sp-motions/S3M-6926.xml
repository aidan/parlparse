*S3M-6926 Christine Grahame: Trackplot on Course for Success—That the Parliament notes the success of the Kelso firm, Trackplot, a locally based start-up company that has recently developed an award-winning, and what is considered to be world-beating, product called Trackplot.com that could help save the lives of hillwalkers, mountaineers and sailors by enabling their loved ones and employers to pinpoint their exact location when on the hills or at sea; further notes that, unlike other products offering a similar service, it does not rely on a mobile phone signal, and believes that Borders’ firms such as Trackplot are demonstrating that, despite tough economic conditions, with the right skills and knowledge local firms can still be successful and look forward to expanding in niche markets.
