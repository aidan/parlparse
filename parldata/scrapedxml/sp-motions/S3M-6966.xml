 *S3M-6966 Stuart McMillan: Save Our Shipsâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the reports that the UK Government may be considering scrapping its aircraft carrier orders, which it considers would adversely affect the lives of up to 10,000 families, including apprentices; further notes that the UK Government is conducting a Strategic Defence and Security Review that does not include Trident; welcomes the support of UNISON and the Public and Commercial Services Union that are calling for Trident to be scrapped; calls on the UK Government to reappraise its position and to bring Trident into the review and maintain the orders for the two aircraft carriers to safeguard thousands of jobs and help local communities, and considers that Scotland has a proud tradition of shipbuilding, particularly on the Clyde and that the term Clydebuilt is still world renowned.
