*S3M-4837 Bill Wilson: Asylum Seekers, Victims of Bankers’ Incompetence?—That the Parliament notes the United Kingdom’s history of offering asylum to those people fleeing abuse and persecution, such as those escaping Nazi Germany, the Pinochet regime in Chile, the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Iraq; believes that any nation that would call itself civilised should welcome such vulnerable people and offer them every opportunity to live decently, integrate themselves into society and contribute to it; believes that by not allowing asylum seekers to work and, from October 2009, forcing all single asylum seekers to live on only £5 a day while attempting to surmount the complex hurdles put in their way by the UK Border Agency, the UK Government is making these often traumatised and stigmatised individuals pay the price of the incompetence of well-paid bankers who have no experience of living on £5 a day, far less of rape, torture and genocide, and so is shamefully in breach of its duty of care; notes that this is happening at a time when the number of immigrants and asylum seekers is declining; welcomes comments by representatives of the Scottish Refugee Council, Oxfam Scotland and the British Red Cross criticising the UK Government’s treatment of asylum seekers, and calls on the UK Government urgently to review its policies in this respect.
