S2M-3867 Alasdair Morgan: Broadcasting the Bardâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the fact that BBC Scotland has only two programmes focusing on the work of Robert Burns planned across its television and radio output for Burns Night, one on Radio Scotland and the other on BBC1, while Radio 3 has a single late-night offering from the Celtic Connections Festival and Scottish, Grampian and Border TV have no programmes planned at all; considers this to be a gross under-representation of the undisputable talent and enduring popularity of Burns, and calls on Scottish broadcasters to devote greater efforts to producing appropriate programmes for Burns Night next year.
