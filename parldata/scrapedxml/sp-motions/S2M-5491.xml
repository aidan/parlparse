 *S2M-5491 Helen Eadie: Scotland’s Window on Europe—That the Parliament welcomes the fact that Cardinal Keith O’Brien and Councillor Eric Milligan have been the first two speakers at meetings to launch Friends of Europe which it is hoped will promote exploration across Scotland of ways to strengthen relationships with the people of mainland Europe; supports Friends of Europe’s aims of examining the history, culture, politics and institutions that shape European lives and of considering what initiatives the people of Scotland can take to underpin existing work in this area; recognises the importance of the aspirations of those involved to work in a manner that avoids polarising debates about euros and constitutions, but rather enables us to make real and lasting friendships; appreciates the benefits of striving to incorporate and maintain a high quality and range of language instruction in all Scottish schools at all levels and, in particular, calls on Scotland’s universities to celebrate the entry of Romania and Bulgaria into the European Union by offering language courses in Romanian and Bulgarian and other Slavic languages; supports the suggestion of Councillor Milligan, when he spoke at the second in our series of meetings, that the people of Scotland should work towards achieving an annual event in Scotland that would provide a "Window on Europe", celebrating all that is best about Europe, and plan for the reinforcement of links, especially between ourselves and eastern Europeans who are on the periphery of the EU, and hopes that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body will consider initiating this annual "Window on Europe" in the same way that we now celebrate its initiative on the annual Festival of Politics held in the Parliament.
