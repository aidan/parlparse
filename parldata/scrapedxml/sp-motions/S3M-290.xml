 *S3M-290 Helen Eadie: Scotland Shows Solidarity with Bulgarian Nurses and Palestinian Doctorâ€”That the Parliament profoundly regrets and expresses its dismay at the decision of the Libyan Supreme Court in confirming the death penalty for the five Bulgarian nurses and the Palestinian doctor convicted of infecting children with the Aids virus; believes that Libya instead should give credence to the expert scientific opinion that states alternative reasons as to how the children concerned may have contracted HIV/Aids; pleads with Libya to release the nurses and the doctor, and requests the First Minister to make immediate representations through appropriate channels expressing the deep dismay of the Scottish people and to call for the release of the nurses and the doctor.
