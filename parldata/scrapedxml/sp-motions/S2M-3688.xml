*S2M-3688 Frances Curran: Save Leven Cottage Care Home—That the Parliament condemns the decision of West Dunbartonshire Council to close Leven Cottage care home to save money; notes that it is the only council-run home left in the Vale of Leven and has lost patience with elderly people’s rights being trampled under foot; supports 75-year-old Robert Toole and respects his right to refuse to leave what is his home of 10 years, and further supports local campaigners taking part in a sit-in in support of Robert and to prevent the boarding up and demolition of the home.
