*S3M-775 Bill Wilson: The BBC’s Scots Language Policy—That the Parliament notes the BBC Trust’s publication of the BBC’s public purposes which the BBC is committed to implementing under the terms of its charter; notes the statements therein that the BBC should represent the United Kingdom, its nations, regions and communities and that, in its output, it should support the UK’s indigenous minority languages "such as Gaelic, Welsh, Irish and Ulster Scots"; notes the fact that the Scots language of Scotland, the UK’s indigenous minority language with the most speakers, is not mentioned; expresses its condemnation of this omission, and calls on the BBC to apologise and rectify the situation immediately.
