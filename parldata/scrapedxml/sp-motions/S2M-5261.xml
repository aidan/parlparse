*S2M-5261♦ Rob Gibson: Success of Scots Trad Music Awards 2006—That the Parliament congratulates Hands Up For Trad, its founder Simon Toumire of Footstompin’ Records and the sponsors and supporters who made the 2006 awards ceremony and weekend entertainment in Fort William such a happy and successful gathering; draws particular attention to the staff of the Nevis Centre whose hard work allowed the annual event to move from its Edinburgh base and offer a top-class venue, a friendly Highland welcome and a tremendous warm-up for the major events to be staged there in 2007 during the Scottish Year of Highland Culture; offers congratulations to winners of a wide range of awards, voted on by thousands across the globe, that give significant recognition to the excellence within Scotland’s thriving contemporary traditional music scene; encourages the funding bodies to invest in this success which promotes, through composition, performance and enthusiastic audience response, such a positive message about Scottish cultural confidence, and believes that Scotland’s television media should build on BBC Radio Scotland’s role as the sole consistent champion of our Scottish music and traditions by broadcasting the images and sounds round the world.
