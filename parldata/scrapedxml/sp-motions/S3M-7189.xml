*S3M-7189 Robin Harper: Save Crags Sports Centre—That the Parliament regrets the reported decision by Edinburgh Leisure to close the Crags Sports Centre in the Southside of Edinburgh unless another operator can be found; understands that this closure is in response to recent cuts in Edinburgh Leisure’s funding by City of Edinburgh Council and that other closures may follow, including Dalry Swim Centre, Kirkliston Leisure Centre and Portobello Golf Course; considers that the Crags Sports Centre was opened in 2003 after years of campaigning and fundraising by local people and that it boasts a large sports hall with a well-equipped gym and an all-weather pitch; understands that the Crags Sports Centre is a well-used centre situated beside one of the most deprived areas of the city and that, in addition to the centre serving local people, the Active Schools Programme of neighbouring schools and the locally based Canongate Youth Project depend on the centre for its facilities, and calls on City of Edinburgh Council to ensure that the Crags Sports Centre is kept open.
