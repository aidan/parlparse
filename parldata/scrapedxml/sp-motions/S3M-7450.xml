*S3M-7450 Rob Gibson: Praise for Sustrans Cycle Networkâ€”That the Parliament celebrates the 15th anniversary of the Sustrans cycle network; understands that Scotland performs better than elsewhere in the United Kingdom as the number of trips made on the National Cycle Network in Scotland increased from 31.3 million in 2008 to 37.3 million trips in 2009, a 19.2% increase from 2008, and a 31.8% increase from 2007, exceeding the outcome of a 15% increase in trips on the network that was agreed between the Scottish Government and Sustrans in 2007; congratulates Sustrans and the Scottish Government on this achievement, and calls on the Scottish Government to give further support to the network and encourage more people to cycle.
