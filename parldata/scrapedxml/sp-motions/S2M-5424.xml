*S2M-5424 Carolyn Leckie: Stick Up for the PCS Union—That the Parliament notes that 30,000 PCS members in Scotland are being balloted for strike action as part of a UK-wide ballot and that this involves staff working in devolved and non-devolved areas and the Scottish Executive; regrets that PCS has been forced to ballot for strike action because of intransigent employers and in the face of government-driven job cuts, service cuts, persistent low pay, privatisation and closures; recognises that the Executive is among the lowest paying 25% of public and private sector employers, with a starting salary of £12,000 per annum; believes that the Executive has a responsibility to resolve the issues affecting its staff and ensure a negotiated settlement with the PCS, but, in the absence of such a response, sends full support and solidarity to all those members being balloted and commits to standing shoulder to shoulder with them on the picket lines.
