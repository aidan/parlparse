*S2M-4024.2 Murdo Fraser: Regeneration in Scotland - People and Place—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4024) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the publication of the Scottish Executive’s statement "People and Place: Regeneration Policy in Scotland"; further notes that under the Executive’s stewardship the gap between the poorest and rich in our society is widening, as shown in recent Joseph Rowntree Foundation figures, and that the number of working-age adults without dependent children who are in income poverty has increased from around 300,000 in the mid-1990s to almost 400,000 in recent years; believes that the key to tackling poverty is to have a thriving economy where people can find secure employment, and accordingly calls on the Executive to create an environment for businesses to invest in Scotland by reducing the burden of regulation and tax and by investing in our infrastructure."
