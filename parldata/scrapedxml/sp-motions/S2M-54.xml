*S2M-54 Richard Lochhead: Scotland's Customs Dogs—That the Parliament notes with concern that the customs dogs trained to detect smuggled drugs, money and tobacco are based in Hull and Manchester; further notes with concern that Scotland's ports and airports have only had the services of these dogs for less than 30 days since April 2002; believes that such front-line resources are key to assisting our hard pressed customs officials in the war against drugs and organised crime, and calls on the Scottish Executive to press by any means necessary for the repatriation of control of this service to the Parliament.
