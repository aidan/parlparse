*S3M-2290 Bob Doris: Back on the Buses—That the Parliament welcomes the U-turn by Labour-controlled Glasgow City Council by reversing its previous ill-considered and dangerous move to withdraw school buses from children who live between two and three miles from their secondary school and praises the part played by Glasgow’s Evening Times newspaper in this U-turn by bringing the issue to the public’s attention, by the 10 SNP MSPs who have so far supported motion S3M-2245 demanding that Labour’s plans be halted, by every Glasgow SNP councillor who voted against these plans in February and opposed them again at full council on 26 June 2008 and of course, most importantly, by the parents of Glasgow, including the parents in the Glasgow Milton area, who were not prepared to be dictated to by the Labour council and have their children’s safety and education put at risk.
