*S2M-4646 Patrick Harvie: Rejection of Proposal to Legislate Against Hate Crime—That the Parliament notes the many years of effort by equality organisations in Scotland to make the case for offences motivated by malice or ill will towards an individual based on their sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability to be taken seriously; notes that the headline recommendation of the Scottish Executive’s Working Group on Hate Crime was for the introduction of a statutory aggravation for such offences; notes that ministers have taken over 20 months to respond to the group’s report; notes with deep regret that, despite previous commitments to include legislation in the Sentencing Bill, the Executive has rejected this recommendation, citing the need for consistency in sentencing as its main reason; considers that this stated reason is absurd given that Scotland will now see no consistency, either in the way that different hate crimes are treated in Scottish courts or in the treatment of such crimes north and south of the border; considers that the Executive’s decision to delay its response for so long and then to announce it on the last day before summer recess is insulting to the organisations that have contributed to this process; believes that there exists no good reason to avoid or delay legislation to introduce a statutory aggravation for hate crimes, and calls on the Executive to reconsider this decision urgently.
