*S3M-3515 Robin Harper: Threats to Wildlife through Loss of Set-aside—That the Parliament notes that the amount of land in the set-aside scheme fell by 71%, from 63,000 to 18,000 hectares, over the course of 2008; considers that this represents a huge loss of undisturbed habitat for declining numbers of farmland birds, wildflowers, insects, including bees and butterflies, and other associated wildlife; acknowledges the Scottish Government’s current consultation on the options available to redress the balance, Consultation on the Review of Species Listed on Schedule A1 and 1A of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that a sufficient percentage of cultivated land is managed for environmental purposes.
