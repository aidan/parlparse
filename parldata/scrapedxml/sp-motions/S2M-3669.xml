 *S2M-3669 Rosie Kane: Donation to Glasgow Dog and Cat Home—That the Parliament pays tribute to Kate and Rikki Fulton, who left £800,000 to Glasgow Dog and Cat Home in their will; recognises the generosity of Mr and Mrs Fulton, which is in stark contrast to the terrible cruelty reported recently where some young people in Glasgow killed a hamster by tying it to a firework and lighting it; is concerned that incidents of animal cruelty appear to be on the increase, and finally congratulates the Scottish SPCA for the great work it does in caring for vulnerable and sick animals.
