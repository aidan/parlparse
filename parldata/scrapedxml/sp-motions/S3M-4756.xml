 *S3M-4756 David Stewart: WeeW—That the Parliament welcomes the opening of the new WeeW retail outlet on the main street in Stornoway, Isle of Lewis, in the autumn of 2009; notes that this will help regenerate the town centre, assist with the economic and social regeneration of the island and create 28 new jobs, following the closure of the local Woolworths store earlier in the year; congratulates all those involved, particularly Terry Ovenstone who will be the manager of the new WeeW store, and wishes the new WeeW every success for the future.
