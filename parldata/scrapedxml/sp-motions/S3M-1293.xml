 *S3M-1293 Robin Harper: Nationally Important Marine Areas—That the Parliament congratulates the Marine Conservation Society and organisations associated with the Scottish Environment LINK Marine Task Force on the publication of Finding NIMAs: Making the Case for Nationally Important Marine Areas; notes that this report argues for NIMAs in order to protect nationally important species of fish, birds and marine plants, to meet international commitments, including an ecologically-coherent network of well-managed areas, and to help regenerate our seas; further notes the successful campaigning by the Community of Arran Seabed Trust (COAST) for Lamlash Bay to become the first Community Marine Conservation Area in Scotland, and indeed the United Kingdom; welcomes the recent encouragement given by the Scottish Government to COAST, and expresses the hope that further progress will be made towards developing an all-encompassing Marine Bill for Scotland.
