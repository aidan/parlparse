 *S2M-38# Murdo Fraser: Scottish Water Charges—That the Parliament notes with concern the dramatic increases in Scottish Water charges to small businesses in the current financial year, which in some cases amount to nearly 500% over the amount charged last year; believes that these increased charges bear no relation to the services provided by Scottish Water to small businesses; is concerned that these dramatic increases represent an unfair burden on many small businesses throughout Scotland and in some cases may threaten their future viability, and further believes that the Scottish Executive should direct Scottish Water to review urgently its charging structure with a view to reducing the costs to business.
