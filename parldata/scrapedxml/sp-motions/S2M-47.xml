*S2M-47 Mr Ted Brocklebank: The Need for a New Secondary School in North-East Fife at the Tay Bridgehead—That the Parliament notes the longstanding need for a new secondary school at the Tay Bridgehead in north-east Fife; is aware of widespread local community support in the area for such a school; believes that the school is vital to relieve pressure on Madras College, St Andrews, which is the second largest secondary school in Scotland with a pupil roll of 1,850 and on Bell Baxter High School, Cupar; further notes that the relocation of an additional squadron to RAF Leuchars will increase the pressure on the existing secondary schools and exacerbate the current situation, and, given the seriousness of the matter and the fact that little or no progress has been made on it over the last two decades, considers that the Scottish Executive should intervene and make representations to Fife Council to ensure that a new school is secured.
