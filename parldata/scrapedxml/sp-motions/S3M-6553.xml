*S3M-6553♦ John Scott: Ministry of Defence Hospital Units—That the Parliament applauds the work done by charitable organisations such as Erskine (Erskine Hospital Ltd) and the treatment centre provided at Hollybush in Ayrshire by Combat Stress; also notes, however, that, while there are six Ministry of Defence Hospital Units (MDHU) located across England, none are located in Scotland; believes that, given the high proportion of Scots serving in the UK armed services, there is a strong case for the creation of an MDHU in Scotland, and hopes that discussion between the relevant authorities can progress the creation of such a medical facility for injured servicemen and servicewomen.
