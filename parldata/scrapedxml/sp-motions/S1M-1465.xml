*S1M-1465# John Scott: Non-payment of Redundancy Packages to Ailsa Troon Workers-That the Parliament condemns the action of the Cathelco Group, owners of Ailsa Troon shipyard, which has failed to pay 16 shipyard workers redundancy payments totalling some £300,000 due to them under the terms of their contracts; further notes that these workers had demonstrated their loyalty to the yard by remaining to complete an order after the other workers had been laid off by Cathelco, and urges the Scottish Executive not to award any further publicly funded work to the Cathelco Group until such a time as Cathelco honours its commitment to all its staff.
