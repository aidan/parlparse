*S2M-2444# Frances Curran: Protect Public Sector Pensionsâ€”That the Parliament notes that the Westminster Government proposes to compulsorily raise the retirement age from 60 to 65 for all public sector workers; notes that this will result in a reduced pension for workers retiring before the age of 65; further notes that this has occurred at the same time as MPs and MSPs have enhanced their own pension rights out of the public purse; considers strongly that the Westminster Government should not take this action which will reduce the living standards of working people in their retirement, and expresses its full support for the public sector trade unions in their campaign to defend jobs, conditions and services.
