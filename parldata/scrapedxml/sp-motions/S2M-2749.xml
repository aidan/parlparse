 * S2M-2749 Stewart Stevenson:50 Million Copies of the Firefox Browser: A Victory for Open Source Softwareâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the volunteers working with the Mozilla Foundation on achieving the first 50 million downloads of the free and open source internet browser, Firefox; notes that it is efficient and secure because its workings can be examined by anyone, thus leading to continuous improvement, and believes that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body should consider replacing the bloated, slow, middle-aged and frequently insecure commercial product currently installed on its computers with Firefox.
