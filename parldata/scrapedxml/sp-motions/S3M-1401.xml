*S3M-1401 Ian McKee: No to "Civil National Flag"—That the Parliament notes with disappointment the Private Member’s Bill introduced at Westminster in the name of Andrew Rosindell MP aimed at establishing the Union Flag as the "civil national flag" of the United Kingdom instead of its present status as a government flag or royal banner; recognises the cultural and political differences that exist in each of the constituent parts of the UK, including in the devolved governments at Cardiff Bay, Holyrood and Stormont, and believes that the decision as to which flag to use at civil events within their remit should be at the discretion of those devolved governments.
