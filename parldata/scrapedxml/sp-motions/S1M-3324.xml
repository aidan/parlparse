*S1M-3324 Mr Brian Monteith: The Threat To Haggis, Scotland's National Dish-That the Parliament notes with concern that the Food Standards Agency has made a formal request to the European Commission to ban the use of sheep's intestines across the European Union without any acknowledgement of its unique role in Scotland's national dish, the haggis; further notes the lack of any scientific link between the possible existence of BSE in sheep and its transference to humans through sheep's intestine; believes that using the same weak criteria could see future bans extended to the offal content of haggis and that such unsubstantiated health scares only serve to undermine the genuine need for effective public health campaigns; recognises the crucial importance of haggis to Scotland's national culture, its popularity at home and abroad and the enjoyment it brings to so many people, and further believes that, given the absence of any hard evidence and the exceedingly low theoretical risk to public health, Scots should be free to choose how they like their haggis cooked and served.
