*S2M-5484 Irene Oldfather: James Watt College—That the Parliament is aware of the present financial difficulties being experienced by James Watt College; notes with concern that the college is projecting a deficit of over £5 million, in comparison with the end-of-year accounts for 2001-02 which recorded a surplus of £452,000; is aware that the Further Education Development Directorate (FEDD) at the Scottish Funding Council has investigated the situation and produced a report on the matter; recognises that the college’s board of management met to discuss the FEDD report on 13 January 2007 and subsequently published a financial recovery plan for the college, which has now been issued to staff for consultation; believes that the board of management and the FEDD should ensure that the trade unions are fully consulted and kept informed of proposals to restore the college to financial solvency in order that disruption to staff and students is kept to a minimum; notes the contribution that the college makes to the local community in terms of boosting the economy and expanding the skills base; is aware that the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning is meeting the Chairman of the Scottish Funding Council and the trade unions on 29 January 2007, and therefore welcomes all efforts to get the appropriate parties round the table and reach a solution which ensures the continuity of educational provision at James Watt College.
