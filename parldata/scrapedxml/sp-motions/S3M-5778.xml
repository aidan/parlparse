 * S3M-5778 Kenneth Gibson: Time to End EU Tobacco Subsidies—That the Parliament expresses disappointment at the continuing subsidy by the European Union of tobacco cultivation to the tune of some £260 million each year despite the many more millions paid by the EU in anti-tobacco public information campaigns and billions of pounds worth of damage done to the EU’s economy by the public health impact of smoking as well as the real damage to the health of individuals; believes that tobacco subsidy should end immediately and, if need be, cultivation of alternative crops be explored; wholly supports the campaign by the SNP Member of the European Parliament, Alyn Smith, via his website, www.alynsmith.eu, to achieve this aim, and welcomes the backing of the News of the World for the campaign.
