 *S3M-4336 Christine Grahame: No to Wild Animals in Circuses—That the Parliament regrets the plight of Anne, a 56-year-old elephant currently touring Scotland with a travelling circus despite being unable to perform tricks due to her advancing age and infirmity after decades in captivity; notes the recent publication of research in the scientific journal, Animal Welfare, that describes the unsuitability of wild animals such as elephants for circus life, which involves constant travelling and long spells in inadequate temporary housing; urges the Scottish Government to use its powers under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 to ban wild animal circuses in Scotland, as has already been done by Austria, Bulgaria, Costa Rica, Croatia, Israel and Singapore, with similar bans pending in Brazil, Bolivia and Peru, and, until such legislation is passed, calls on landlords such as local authorities and other landowners to refuse to let sites to circuses using wild animals for an outdated form of entertainment.
