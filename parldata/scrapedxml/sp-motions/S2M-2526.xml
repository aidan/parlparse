*S2M-2526 Christine Grahame: Jamie Oliver Invitation—That the Parliament commends the efforts of the chef, Jamie Oliver, in his endeavours to improve the quality of school meals, in particular given the worrying increase in childhood obesity with its unavoidable health implications, including a documented increase in childhood diabetes; further notes that his menus have been trialled and adopted in 25 schools across Greenwich; commends his reality check, "the Grub Log", encouraging parents to log their children’s food intake, and urges the Scottish Executive to meet Mr Oliver to discuss his proposals with a view to providing pilots and ultimately funding for his menus.
