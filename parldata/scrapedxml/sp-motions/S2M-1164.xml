 *S2M-1164 Robin Harper: Flood Management Research-That the Parliament notes recommendations made by experts in evidence to the Transport and the Environment Committee during the progress of the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Bill in the last session of the Parliament; is concerned about the continued problem of flooding affecting Scotland, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to fund a series of research projects in order to investigate the advantages and feasibility of, and limitations on, changes in catchment land use, including forestry and arable and pastoral farming, in order to complement other forthcoming research and help implementation of existing commitments to sustainable flood management.
