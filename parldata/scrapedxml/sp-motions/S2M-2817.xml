 *S2M-2817# Bill Butler: Congratulations to Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital Campaigners—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the board of NHS Greater Glasgow to retain the in-patient unit of the Centre for Integrative Care at Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital in Glasgow Anniesland and to reject the ill-advised proposal to close the unit in order to effect minimal cost savings; notes that the facility offers specialised treatment for people with difficult, chronic problems and is based on a multi-disciplinary "whole-person care" model; believes that this unique example of patient-centred care, education and research deserves support, not merely in the short-term, but in the long-term; applauds Brian McAlorum and his fellow campaigners, including patients, relatives and supporters, for their determination, commitment and tenacity in pursuit of this positive resolution; acknowledges the excellent results achieved through the imaginative approach pioneered by Dr David Reilly and his team at the Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital, and wishes the hospital, its staff and patients every good wish for the future. Supported by: Jackie Baillie*, Paul Martin*, Sarah Boyack*, Marlyn Glen*, Michael McMahon*, Mr Bruce McFee*, Dr Elaine Murray*, Des McNulty*, Christine May*, Alex Neil*, Margaret Jamieson*, Ms Wendy Alexander*, Scott Barrie*
