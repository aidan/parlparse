 *S1M-4057 Iain Gray: The Scottish Economy—That the Parliament endorses the Scottish Executive’s policy to increase the sustainable growth of Scottish economy over the long term as set out in Smart, Successful Scotland and believes that this, along with the investment in Scottish transport infrastructure outlined in Building Better Transport and the introduction of education for work and enterprise for every pupil at every stage of school to create a culture of aspiration and entrepreneurship, will deliver increased prosperity, thus providing resources for first-class public services and a more socially just and sustainable Scotland.
