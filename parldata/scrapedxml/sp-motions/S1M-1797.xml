*S1M-1797 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Tourism and the Economyâ€”That the Parliament notes the grave impact which the foot-and-mouth crisis is having on the tourism industry; believes that conflicting information about the disease, both at home and abroad, further jeopardises Scottish tourism; further believes that more must be done to secure the future of the tourism industry, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to implement the following recovery plan: (i) immediate action to enable and ensure efficient crisis management, including a public information campaign through the press and broadcast media to make people aware of what can and cannot be done during the crisis, (ii) interim support measures to prevent bankruptcy throughout the duration of the crisis including a rates relief package for the months of April, May and June, interest free loans for affected industries and an exemption to be sought by the Scottish Executive from Her Majesty's Treasury for VAT and National Insurance contributions over a similar period for crisis-affected industries, and (iii) a recovery strategy to ensure the success of the summer tourist season, beginning immediately and including an emergency Scottish advertising campaign in all key markets.
