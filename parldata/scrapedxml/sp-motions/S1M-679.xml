*S1M-679# Irene McGugan: Scottish Rural Development Indicators—That the Parliament acknowledges that rural deprivation has increased in the North East of Scotland, impacting significantly on the quality of life of a substantial number of people who live and work in the area; notes that recent studies have shown that drug addiction, crime, unemployment, poverty and poor health are increasing in Aberdeenshire and that current mechanisms and initiatives to alleviate these problems are hampered by the lack of any system to accurately measure rural disadvantage to allow effective targeting of resources, which has resulted in pockets of extreme deprivation in rural areas being ignored, and believes that a long overdue Scottish Rural Deprivation Index, a means of collecting local rather than region-wide data and a system which ensures fair and equitable allocations of funding should be established and that, in the spirit of inclusive and holistic governance, this work should draw on the expertise of political representatives of rural areas, academics, voluntary organisations, health and social work professionals and representatives of the rural business community.
