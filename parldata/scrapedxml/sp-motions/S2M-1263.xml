*S2M-1263# Richard Lochhead: Proposed Post Office Closures in North East Scotland-That the Parliament expresses its concern over the recent announcement by Post Office Ltd that it intends to close a number of post offices in the north east of Scotland, including one third of the urban post offices in Aberdeen; believes that post offices are a vital part of any community, providing as they do a vital service to some of Scotland's most vulnerable groups; believes that the closure of a substantial number of post offices would have an enormously detrimental impact on those who rely on this vital service, and believes that the Scottish Executive should exert pressure upon the appropriate authorities to ensure that an adequate post office provision is maintained and make representations to Post Office Ltd in order to prevent detrimental closures from being allowed to take place.
