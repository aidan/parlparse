*S3M-1397 Pauline McNeill: The Annexe Healthy Living Centre, Partick, Glasgow—That the Parliament expresses its concern about the continued threat to community health services in west and north Glasgow which are delivered by the Annexe Healthy Living Centre in Partick, which received a very positive evaluation by NHS Scotland last year; notes that healthy living centres across Scotland are still facing possible closure, redundancies or service reductions as a result of continuing funding difficulties and uncertainty despite the last minute announcement of limited transitional funding by the Scottish Government; notes the contribution that healthy living centres have made across Scotland to improving community health and quality of life, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that adequate long-term funding is made available to ensure expansion rather than cuts at the Annexe and the survival of all other centres like it which are doing so much to reduce health inequality in Scotland.
