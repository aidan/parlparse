*S3M-1723 Jamie Hepburn: Pension Parity—That the Parliament notes with concern the status of 525,000 pensioners from Britain who have contributed taxation and national insurance payments to HM Treasury but now live abroad and consequently receive a pension from the UK Government at a rate which differs depending on the country in which they reside; believes that this amounts to discrimination against these pensioners; notes that the UK Government has stated that there is no legal reason for this situation, and further believes that the UK Government should cease its practice of freezing certain overseas pensions and provide the 525,000 affected pensioners with parity to the UK level.
