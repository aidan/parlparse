*S2M-3937 Donald Gorrie: Funding for 7:84 Theatre and Scottish Opera Programmes—That the Parliament commends the good educational work done by 7:84 Theatre Company in touring the play, "Tipping Point", and discussion about the G8 summit around 24 secondary schools and other school and community projects, stimulating students and adults to think and argue about important issues; further commends the well-established programme by Scottish Opera of touring do-it-yourself operas around primary schools, and urges that sufficient funding should be made available by the Scottish Arts Council and from the Scottish Executive’s culture, educational and community budgets to enable these programmes to continue and expand so that many more young people can benefit from these life-enhancing experiences.
