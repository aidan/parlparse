*S2M-4073.2 Tommy Sheridan: Drug Abuseâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-4073) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from first "believes" to end and insert "calls for a radical overhaul of the unhelpful drugs laws which cause more problems rather than providing solutions; further calls for a pilot scheme to be initiated into the prescribing of heroin under clinical conditions; calls for massive investment in drug rehabilitation and treatment, based on the fact that it is nine times more effective to treat drug addicts than pay the cost of drug-related crime, and calls for a recognition of the role of extended family members, particularly grandparents, in supporting and protecting children in families where there is drug misuse."
