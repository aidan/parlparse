*S2M-2982 Michael McMahon: Scotland Supporting the Right to Die at Home—That the Parliament believes that every patient who chooses to die at home should be given the opportunity to do so; congratulates Marie Curie Cancer Care on its campaign, "Scotland Supporting the Choice to Die at Home"; notes the survey by YouGov, commissioned by the charity, which found that 75 per cent of Scots would choose to die at home and the Scottish parliamentary survey, carried out by Marie Curie Cancer Care, which found that 73 per cent of Scottish parliamentarians would also like to die at home; recognises that at present only 24 per cent of terminally ill cancer patients are able to die at home; further notes the economic paper commissioned by the charity which shows that caring for more patients at home would release funds which could be used elsewhere in the NHS, and urges the Scottish Executive to publicly support patients’ rights to choose where they die by ensuring that this choice is available and achievable across Scotland’s NHS boards.
