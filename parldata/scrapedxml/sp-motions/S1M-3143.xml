*S1M-3143# Elaine Smith: Promoting Scotland's Industrial Heritage—That the Parliament recognises that our industrial heritage is of interest to many people from other countries as well as Scots, and believes that the Scottish Executive should look at ways to market ex-industrial areas throughout Scotland such as Coatbridge and give consideration to exploring the idea of state-run hotels, along the line of Spanish paradors, where listed buildings could be restored to provide accommodation for tourists thus allowing itineraries to include non-traditional tourist facilities such as Summerlee Heritage Park in Coatbridge which is home to the only working trams in Scotland.
