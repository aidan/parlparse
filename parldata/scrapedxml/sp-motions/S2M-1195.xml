*S2M-1195 Michael Matheson: Private Prisons-That the Parliament notes the important progress that has been made by the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) "Bridging the Gap" project and, in particular, the constructive relationship that has developed between the SPS and trade union partners to bid for a second new prison; regrets the decision by the Scottish Executive to contract out the first new build prison to the private sector, therefore denying the public sector the opportunity to openly compete for an important public sector service, and calls on the Executive to reconsider this decision.
