 *S1M-1857.1 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Scotland's Skills for Tomorrow—As an amendment to motion (S1M-1857) in the name of Ms Wendy Alexander, leave out from "endorses" to end and insert "notes that, under changing global economic circumstances, a sustainable future for Scotland is dependent on a high skills, high value knowledge economy; recognises that significant skills shortages have been allowed to develop in key sectors in the Scottish economy; regrets that, to date, government has neither quantified nor predicted these shortages, far less been able to take action to fill the skills shortfall, and therefore calls upon the Executive to take immediate action to identify and quantify Scotland’s current skills shortages and likely future shortages, tailor investment in skills to meet current and future demands and shortfalls and work closely with industry to assure a demand-led integrated approach to training, further and higher education."
