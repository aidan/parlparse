 *S3M-2309 Patrick Harvie: Proposal for a Glasgow Museum of Industry, Science and Technology—That the Parliament welcomes the proposal by the Clyde Heritage Trust to set up a museum of industry, science and technology in Glasgow based in the former Howden engineering works in Scotland Street, incorporating the world’s only Subway power station, built in 1886; agrees that such a museum would complement the existing museums in the Glasgow area by concentrating on Scotland’s rich history of industry, engineering and technology and focusing on large-scale working exhibits; recognises that the two unique listed buildings comprising the works would be an excellent site for this enterprise, requiring no major structural alterations and providing ease of access to disabled visitors, and notes that Scotland Street School Museum would benefit from the location of such a museum nearby and that this excellent project has the potential to create employment and provide a unique opportunity for Scotland to celebrate and preserve its industrial heritage.
