*S3M-6557 Robert Brown: Support for Princess Royal Trust for Carers—That the Parliament acknowledges, during Carers Week 2010 and beyond, the practical and emotional support that the Princess Royal Trust for Carers and the carers centres in Glasgow provide for unpaid carers and young carers on a daily basis; notes that the Princess Royal Trust is the largest dedicated resource supporting unpaid carers and young carers in the United Kingdom; recognises that, in Scotland, the trust currently helps some 50,000 carers cope by giving them information, support and advice through their work with the unique network of carers centres and young carers services; notes with concern the funding challenges that such centres are now facing across Scotland, and asks that the new carers and young carers strategies seek to tackle these challenges to help Scotland’s 657,000 unpaid carers and 100,000 young carers to have a life of their own and achieve their full potential.
