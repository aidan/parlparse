 *S3M-7453 Murdo Fraser: Archibald Campbell, the Eighth Earl and First Marquis of Argyll—That the Parliament notes that 27 May 2011 marks the 350th anniversary of the death of Archibald Campbell, the eighth Earl and first Marquis of Argyll; acknowledges Argyll’s dedication to the Presbyterian faith and his role as a leading member of the Covenanters and later the Kirk Party; considers that Argyll had an important role in 17th century Scotland promoting the covenanting cause and Scottish interests in relations with the English Parliament and under the Cromwellian Protectorate; further notes that it was Argyll who carried the crown at the coronation of Charles II at Scone on 1 January 1651, and considers that Argyll’s contribution to Scottish political and religious history ought to be remembered and celebrated.
