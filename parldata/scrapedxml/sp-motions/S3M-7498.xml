*S3M-7498 Richard Lochhead: Annual Fisheries Negotiations—That the Parliament notes efforts to secure a fair outcome in the forthcoming EU fisheries negotiations; believes that any deal must respect the need to harvest fish stocks sustainably in the interests of Scotland’s fishermen and coastal communities and recognise Scotland’s fishing industry’s contribution to fisheries conservation, and urges the European Commission to support efforts to reduce wasteful discards.
