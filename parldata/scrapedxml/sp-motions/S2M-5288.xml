 *S2M-5288 Christine Grahame: Award for Penicuik Teenagers—That the Parliament recognises the quick thinking and actions of Liam Dugan, Daniel Sturrock and Aaron Moore of Penicuik in rushing to the aid of a seriously injured man, when their army cadet first-aid training may very well have saved his life and calls on the Scottish Executive to present an award to three admirable young men who are an example to us all and remind us that, despite young people so often being portrayed as antisocial, the majority are decent, thoughtful people who are an asset to their communities.
