 *S3M-1851 Jamie Hepburn: Presidency of Europe—That the Parliament notes recent reports that heads of government across Europe are increasingly opposed to Tony Blair being nominated for the position of President of the European Union; believes that whoever takes up this position should be capable of uniting the people of Europe behind shared values of peace and justice, and further believes that under no circumstances could the former Prime Minister fulfil such a role, given his responsibility for taking the United Kingdom into an illegal war in Iraq against the wishes of a majority of people in the UK and the European Union. Supported by: Brian Adam*, Alex Neil*, Sandra White*, Christina McKelvie*, Patrick Harvie*, Willie Coffey*, Kenneth Gibson*, Bill Wilson*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Alasdair Allan*, Bill Kidd*, Bashir Ahmad*, Stuart McMillan*, Mike Pringle*, Angela Constance*, Ian McKee*, Joe FitzPatrick*
