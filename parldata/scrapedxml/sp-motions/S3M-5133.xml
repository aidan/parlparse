*S3M-5133 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Britain Needs Better Banks—That the Parliament welcomes the small concession announced by HBOS that a £10 buffer zone will apply before the proposed new flat fee is charged on authorised overdrafts but believes that this does not go far enough; considers that most customers who need to use their overdraft facility will be worse off as a result of the change from charging interest to a daily fixed fee of £1; notes that a £1 fee on a £100 overdraft is the equivalent of 365% APR; welcomes the Britain Needs Better Banks campaign being run by consumer magazine Which? to highlight unfair practices in banking, and calls on the partially state-owned HBOS to stop punishing customers on lower incomes and reconsider the decision to introduce these unfair charges.
