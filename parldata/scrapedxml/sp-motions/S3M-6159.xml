*S3M-6159 John Wilson: £6.9 Million Reimbursed to Miners’ Compensation Scheme—That the Parliament welcomes the repayment of £6.9 million to miners by legal firms that deducted money from damages won in compensation claims; considers that the Coal Health Compensation Schemes were introduced to compensate miners for damage to their health incurred while suffering in dangerous and appalling working conditions; condemns those legal firms that made inappropriate financial deductions, and welcomes the ongoing investigation being conducted by the Solicitors Regulation Authority to ensure that all those involved are held to account.
