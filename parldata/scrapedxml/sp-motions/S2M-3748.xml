*S2M-3748 Brian Adam: North Sea Tax Hikes—That the Parliament notes with concern Shell’s announcement that it is to cut its plans for North Sea exploration; notes that Shell is blaming the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s latest North Sea tax hikes for this decision; further notes that the decision will have a knock-on effect throughout the North Sea supply chain, which will cost jobs and threaten future investment, and calls on the Scottish Executive to lobby the Chancellor in an attempt to get him to review his position and find alternative means of filling the black hole in his budget.
