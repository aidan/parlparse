*S1M-3133 George Lyon: Water Connection Charges-That the Parliament recognises that tens of thousands of households around rural Scotland are not currently connected to either water or sewerage mains; notes that such households are reliant on private, untreated water supplies and are continuing to discharge raw sewage directly into our rivers and lochs; further notes with concern that there are as yet no clear guidelines relating to the cost of, or criteria for, connecting these households to the new water and sewerage mains currently being installed by the water companies; acknowledges that first time connection charges to the water mains represent a considerable cost for domestic residents, and calls on the Scottish Executive to produce a clear, transparent policy on first time connection criteria and charges for Scottish Water.
