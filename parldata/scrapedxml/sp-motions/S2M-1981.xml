 *S2M-1981 Alex Fergusson: National Beef Envelope—That the Parliament regrets the decision to introduce a national beef envelope as part of the reform of Common Agricultural Policy, despite the overwhelming objections to such a measure by the majority of stakeholders; believes that the decision should be reviewed after one year with a view to abolishing the measure and, if the measure is not then abolished, the criteria should be altered to include beef from the dairy herd, and notes that the dairy sector will be contributing to the scheme through modulation whilst deriving no benefit from it, thus further disadvantaging a sector at a time when its financial returns are at an all-time low.
