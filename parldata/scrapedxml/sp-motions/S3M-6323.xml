 * S3M-6323♦ Margo MacDonald: The Status of Scottish Parliament Elections—That the Parliament believes that, in order to preserve the status of the Parliament in Edinburgh and the standards of operational accountability and transparency established by MSPs since 1999 and in view of the Parliament’s acceptance of the findings of the Independent Review of the Scottish Parliamentary and Local Government Elections, there is a need for a method of holding any fixed-term Westminster elections that does not coincide with the dates set for the four-year, fixed-term Scottish Parliament elections.
