*S3M-2380 Stuart McMillan: Police Make Second Largest Drugs Seizure Ever in Scotland—That the Parliament congratulates Strathclyde Police on making the second largest drugs seizure ever in Scotland by recovering cannabis with a reported street value of £1.2 million in Inverclyde; notes that the police estimated that 1,000 plants were being grown but, since the equipment has been dismantled, four times that amount has been recovered; further notes this haul will dent the illegal drugs industry in the short-term, and commends Strathclyde Police for its dedication to removing drugs from our streets and communities.
