*S2M-925 Frances Curran: Johnstone Hospital-That the Parliament congratulates the Save Johnstone Hospital Campaign that succeeded in reversing Argyll and Clyde NHS Board's decision to close the hospital, which provides care beds for elderly people; notes that this victory means that patients will not be moved, providing reassurance to current patients, one of whom is 101 years of age; further notes that many members of the campaign have elderly relatives who are patients in the hospital and that, after launching a petition, taking to the streets and lobbying the NHS board, they succeeded in keeping the hospital open, and agrees that this was a victory for grass roots campaigning.
