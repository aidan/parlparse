*S2M-762 Cathy Jamieson: Delivering a Quick, Effective Youth Justice System-That the Parliament recognises the importance of dealing quickly, firmly and effectively with the minority of young people who offend; acknowledges that progress has been made by local authorities and partners in the statutory and voluntary sectors to encourage rehabilitation, prevent reoffending and tackle and reduce youth crime, but recognises that further work must be done to ensure that the quality of life in our communities continues to improve.
