*S2M-130.1 David Mundell: Investing in Public Transportâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-130) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "believes that only a fully costed programme of investment in transport infrastructure with detailed start and completion dates, rather than platitudes, will deliver the improvements to public transport that the travelling public and Scottish business so desperately need and calls on the Scottish Executive to present such a programme to the Parliament forthwith."
