*S3M-2548 Alison McInnes: Loss of Arctic Ice - Global Climate Concern—That the Parliament notes with concern that the amount of summer sea ice in the Arctic is continuing its alarming downward trend with possibly less ice in this year than in any other year since monitoring began; understands that the continuing loss of older, thicker ice means that the Arctic ice cover has become dramatically younger and thinner this year; also understands that the area of ice that is at least five years old has decreased by 56% between 1985 and 2007; recognises that these changes are affecting the indigenous peoples of the Arctic whose traditional livelihoods depend on healthy ecosystems and that there are signs that species such as polar bears are in peril as climate change erodes the ice platform on which they rely; is concerned that the reduction in sea ice has wider implications for global climate change, as the Arctic ice is like a mirror reflecting the sun’s heat back into space and, as the ice goes, Arctic waters absorb more heat, further adding to global warming; also recognises that this warming will release more greenhouse gases from the Arctic previously locked in permanently frozen ground; considers that the trend of melting Arctic sea ice is also alarming for the rest of the world as the Arctic is key in stabilising the global climate, and therefore believes that we must heed the implications of this loss of Arctic ice cover and take immediate action to reduce emissions by acting now and demonstrating clear leadership on tackling climate change.
