 *S3M-3556 Hugh Henry: Fair Pay for Statutory Redundancies—That the Parliament deplores the huge bonuses and salaries paid to senior staff in banking and financial services; believes that the pension payment to Sir Fred Goodwin is wrong and that failure should not be rewarded; notes with concern the financial difficulties being faced across the country by workers who have lost their jobs, and supports those MPs calling for a review of the current cap on statutory redundancy pay with an early uplift and a mechanism to link it to average weekly earnings.
