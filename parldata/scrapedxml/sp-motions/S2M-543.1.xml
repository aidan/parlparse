 *S2M-543.1 Patrick Harvie: UK Legislation - Planning and Compulsory Purchase Bill-As an amendment to motion (S2M-543) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, insert at end "but, in so doing, expresses its concerns over several provisions contained in the Bill, namely those relating to national security, urgency and enforcement; believes that these provisions could face objectors with a greater disadvantage in Crown planning cases than they are faced with in private planning cases, and considers that the UK Parliament should address these issues during its consideration of the Bill."
