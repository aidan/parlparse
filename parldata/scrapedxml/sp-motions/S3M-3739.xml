*S3M-3739 Helen Eadie: No Support for Local Businesses, Greener Government—That the Parliament expresses serious concern that the Scottish Government, in expanding the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service’s (COPFS) bike-to-work scheme, has chosen to enrich only Halfords, a major multi-national company, rather than permitting the employees of COPFS to opt to purchase and support a local and small business of their choice, such as Sandy Wallace Cycles in Inverkeithing, and expresses serious disappointment that the Scottish Government’s words on policy are not reflected by actions on the ground.
