*S2M-1012 Donald Gorrie: Proposal for a New Crematorium at Sydes Braes, High Blantyreâ€”That the Parliament regrets the planning application made to South Lanarkshire Council in respect of the building of a crematorium at the Sydes Brae site in High Blantyre; believes that such building in that locality is unnecessary as existing crematoria in the area are operating below capacity and that construction will result in the destruction of much-valued public space in an area where there are few such features, and calls on South Lanarkshire Council to reject the application.
