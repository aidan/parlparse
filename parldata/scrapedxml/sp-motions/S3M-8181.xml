*S3M-8181 Robin Harper: Edinburgh Nursery Closures—That the Parliament regrets the decision of City of Edinburgh Council on 10 March 2011 to close two Edinburgh nurseries, the High School Yards and the Princess Elizabeth, in order to make an estimated saving of £200,000; condemns this decision as it considers that these nurseries are thriving; notes that in its most recent Care Commission inspection, carried out in 2008, High School Yards received overall grades of very good against four quality themes and excellent against the theme of quality of care and support; further notes that, in 2009, Princess Elizabeth received an overall grading of very good, with excellent grades being awarded against two of the four quality themes; deplores what it sees as the attitude that having three nurseries in close proximity is a luxury; considers that the interests of local Edinburgh children played no part in the decisions reached, and believes that, in order to give children the best range of opportunities and chances when they are in their most formative years, maintaining successful nurseries is not a luxury but a necessity.
