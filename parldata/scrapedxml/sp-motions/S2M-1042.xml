*S2M-1042 Patrick Harvie: Wedding Invite - Sir Elton John-That the Parliament applauds the decision by Clackmannanshire Council to invite Sir Elton John and David Furnish to tie the knot in a commitment service this summer and believes that, in addition to an endorsement of equality for the people of Clackmannanshire, there is significant tourism potential for the area, perhaps equal to that enjoyed by Gretna Green, in the provision of commitment services for the many couples who have been denied a formal celebration of their relationships and would love to do so in the beautiful settings, such as Alloa Tower, which Clackmannanshire offers.
