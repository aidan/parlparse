 *S2M-4029 Murdo Fraser: Stirling’s Labour Administration Cutting Play Projects Budget—That the Parliament applauds the parents and childminders who are campaigning against Stirling Council’s Labour administration’s plan to axe the annual £150,000 "play projects" budget; calls on local Labour councillors to reflect on the strength of opposition, as evidenced by the 700-strong signature petition against their planned cuts; acknowledges that frontline services of this nature can play a vital role in the early learning of children; believes that the current Labour administration’s plans for large council tax rises and cuts to frontline services are unwanted and unnecessary, and calls on it to rethink its proposed budget.
