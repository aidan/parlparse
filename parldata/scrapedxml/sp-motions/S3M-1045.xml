*S3M-1045 Jim Hume: Bluetongue Disease—That the Parliament notes with extreme concern news from the National Sheep Association that a cow imported from Germany was confirmed as infected with bluetongue disease at its destination farm; recognises the potentially devastating impact that this disease could have on the livestock industry in Scotland; calls on the Scottish Government to produce an emergency plan to prevent bluetongue disease entering Scotland; further calls on the Scottish Government to implement a vaccination programme urgently, and calls on the Scottish Government to make urgent representations to the European Union regarding a stricter application of the rules by all member states to ensure that exported animals do not present a risk to bluetongue virus-free areas.
