*S3M-6556 Murdo Fraser: Duncan Bruce—That the Parliament commends what it considers the important and positive contribution made by author Duncan Bruce toward relations between Scotland and the United States of America; recognises his work, The Mark of the Scots: Their Astonishing Contributions to History, Science, Democracy, Literature and the Arts, which outlines the role played by Scots in American and world history; acknowledges that the book highlights the importance of Scottish ancestry to those living both in and outside Scotland and encourages people to be proud of and to trace their Scottish genealogy; notes that the USA has recognised his contribution to the Scottish-American community with the award of the Ellis Island Medal of Honor and notes his long service on the board of several Scottish-American organisations, including the St Andrew’s Society of the State of New York, the American-Scottish Foundation and Scottish Heritage USA, and believes that the strong Scottish-American bond will continue to grow thanks to individuals such as Duncan Bruce and their efforts to foster good relations between Scotland and the USA.
