*S1M-2823# Pauline McNeill: Planning and Accountability—That the Parliament acknowledges that planning is an issue of exceptional concern to the public and that planning proposals often arouse great interest and political activity amongst local residents affected by the outcome of any proposals; welcomes the improvements made by the Scottish Executive in opening up the planning system and providing more information to the public and acknowledges the on-going reviews that will hopefully continue this process; believes that MSPs have a particular role to play in representing constituents and holding Scottish Ministers to account, and therefore considers that the Planning Divisions in the Scottish Executive Development Department should directly inform MSPs when they receive referrals on planning proposals from within MSPs’ constituencies or regional list areas.
