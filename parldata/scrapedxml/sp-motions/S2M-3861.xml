*S2M-3861 Alex Neil: Scotland’s Renewable Energy Opportunity—That the Parliament welcomes the findings of new research by Dr Shimon Awerbuch of the University of Sussex which shows that increasing the proportion of Scotland’s electricity generated from wind would mean an overall reduction in Scotland’s future electricity costs; notes that such an increase in wind electricity generation will not only reduce overall costs but will improve the security of Scotland’s electricity supply, and calls on the Scottish Executive to consider revising upwards its current targets for renewable energy to take advantage of the findings of this research.
