 *S2M-1648# Christine Grahame: In Touch—That the Parliament, further to motion S2M-822 lodged on 27January 2004, notes with concern that "In Touch", a project based in Galashiels which enables young people between the ages of 16 and 25 to move towards education and employment, which has been continuing on interim funding from Scottish Enterprise Borders and whose funding under the New Futures Fund ceases in March 2005, has failed to secure mainstream funding as advocated by the New Futures Fund Advisory Group and as referred to by the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning in his answers to questions S2W-5798 and S2W-5799 on 10 February 2004; expresses concern that it is possible that this project may disappear and will have to be replaced by a new initiative which will have start-up costs resulting in a waste of resources in equipment and staff built up over five years, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should review its position regarding mainstreaming, which is not in this instance delivering funds, to ensure that the valuable work by "In Touch" and other projects under the New Futures Fund continues.
