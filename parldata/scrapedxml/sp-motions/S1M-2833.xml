*S1M-2833 Miss Annabel Goldie: Scotch Whisky Industry—That the Parliament notes the publication of A Toast to the Future – working together for Scotch Whisky and the Scottish Executive’s pledge to "support Scottish manufacturers where EU and UK policies have an effect on the competitiveness of Scottish Industry" and "take steps to ensure that the regulatory burden is kept to a sensible minimum"; further notes that Her Majesty’s Government is considering applying tax stamps throughout the UK, a measure described by the Scotch Whisky Association as being "by far the greatest threat that the industry currently faces", and calls upon the Executive to demonstrate its stated commitment to the industry, to implement its stated pledge and, accordingly, to make representations to Her Majesty’s against the introduction of tax stamps.
