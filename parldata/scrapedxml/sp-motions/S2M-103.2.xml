*S2M-103.2 Rosie Kane: Young People—As an amendment to motion (S2M-103) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from "believes" to end and insert "recognises, however, that these aspirations are often unachievable with the continuing and increasing levels of poverty and deprivation among Scotland’s young people; further recognises that the removal of the right to claim income support from 16 and 17 year olds has resulted in 11,000 young Scots being unemployed and having no income whatsoever; notes that poverty and deprivation amongst Scotland’s young people have resulted in a tidal wave of despair and alienation; further notes that suicides amongst young men in Scotland have increased by more than 70% in the past 30 years and are now responsible for the deaths of more young men in Scotland than road traffic accidents; believes that the stigmatisation of young people through the use of pejorative language and a generalised association with criminal activity does our young people a grave disservice; further notes that juvenile offending rates have remained unchanged over the past 10 years, and pays tribute to the work of organisations such as NCH Scotland and SACRO which have pioneered work with young offenders to remove them from the adult criminal justice system."
