*S3M-6745 Rob Gibson: Congratulations to Inverness Gaelic Choir—That the Parliament congratulates Inverness Gaelic Choir (Coisir Ghàidhlig Inbhir Nis) on its performances at this year’s Llangollen International Musical Eisteddfod; notes that it is the first Gaelic choir to perform at the Eisteddfod in recent times; commends the choir’s performances, which included the world premier of a tune from Inverness composer Stuart MacRae that was set to the poem of the murder of the Keppoch children in 1688; believes that the choir did a great job promoting Scotland, Gaelic language and culture and that this is evident by its invitation to perform at a music festival in Germany, and wishes the choir the best of luck at its next gig at this year’s Belladrum Tartan Heart Festival and in the future.
