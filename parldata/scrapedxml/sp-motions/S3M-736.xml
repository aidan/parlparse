*S3M-736 Bill Wilson: Renfrewshire Recycling—That the Parliament congratulates Paisley-based charity, Renfrewshire Recycling, on its computer recycling training; notes its recent donation of reconditioned computers to the Banrom Primary School in Thailand, which will benefit underprivileged pupils; further notes the involvement of CXS (the Paisley-based IT arm of Renfrewshire Council for Voluntary Service), Air Sea Scotland and Emirates airline in this donation, and congratulates all those involved in this generous act, which draws attention to the issue of recycling, serves as an example of responsible global citizenship and reflects well on the people of Paisley.
