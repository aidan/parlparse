 *S2M-5280# Maureen Macmillan: Rise in Alcohol-Related Crime Figures in the Highlands and Islands—That the Parliament notes with concern the serious rise in alcohol-related crime figures, released by Northern Constabulary, which show a year-on-year increase in drunkenness, drink-driving, serious assaults and alcohol-related deaths; notes in particular the increase in the number of people being arrested for drunkenness, including the charge of being drunk and incapable; commends the work of CrossReach in Inverness, which provides a purpose-built residential service designed to care for people who have difficulty in managing their alcohol and/or drug abuse and which also provides a "designated place", thereby offering an alternative to custody for those who have been arrested for public drunkenness offences; welcomes the campaign being launched by Northern Constabulary alongside the Highland Drug and Alcohol Action Team’s festive drinking campaign which it is hoped will prevent drinkers ending up in police cells and hospital wards over Christmas and New Year, and endorses the "Don’t push it" campaign being run by the Scottish Executive asking Scots to take responsibility for themselves and to think first before they encourage others to have "just another drink".
