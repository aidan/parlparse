S2M-2766 Mark Ballard: Animal Testing by Inveresk Research—That the Parliament notes the report by Animal Defenders International condemning animal cruelty at Inveresk Research; regrets any unnecessary cruelty in animal research and urges all organisations and institutions engaged in research involving animal testing to make stringent efforts to find replacement techniques; believes that animal tests should only be used if human trials are impossible and that no experimental procedure should be utilised that causes animals unnecessary suffering; further believes that no animal should ever be choked to death with paint, as is alleged to have happened at Inveresk Research, and that drugs for human inhalation should never be injected into monkeys, and calls for an inquiry by the Home Office Inspectorate of Her Majesty’s Government to ascertain what has happened at the Inveresk Research site and for the findings to be made public.
