*S3M-4210 George Foulkes: Scottish Government Should Capitalise on 2012 London Olympics—That the Parliament rejects Christine Grahame MSP’s claim that the UK Government is diverting £150 million of lottery funds in Scotland to help fund the 2012 London Olympics; accepts that Scotland receives more than a Barnett share and will continue to receive lottery funding; recognises that the Games result from a UK bid, not just a London bid; notes that, although London is hosting the games, there are benefits across the UK, for example, football taking place at Hampden; sees the Games as an opportunity for young athletes and competitors across Great Britain to benefit from a higher sporting profile; is aware that Scottish companies can bid for services and construction of facilities, boosting business; welcomes training camps in Scotland, where young Scottish sporting talent will benefit and prosper; recognises the associated tourism benefits that the Games will bring to Scotland and many parts of the UK; is disappointed that motion S3M-4155 appears informed by anti-English sentiment, and regrets that an SNP member would rather express that sentiment than work to capitalise on the potential benefits that the games could bring to Scotland.
