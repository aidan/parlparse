*S2M-2729.2 Murdo Fraser: Financial Services Strategy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2729) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, insert at end "notes, however, that, as a result of Labour’s stewardship of our economy, the savings ratio is at a historically low level, means-testing has been extended to 5 million pensioners, £5 billion per year has been removed in additional taxes from pension funds and public confidence in the pensions industry has been destroyed, and therefore believes that the financial services industry in Scotland requires a UK government that is committed to restoring trust in the industry and improving incentives to save."
