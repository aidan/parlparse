 *S3M-5369# Elaine Smith: Cuban Culture Comes to Coatbridge—That the Parliament welcomes links between Coatbridge and Cuba in 2009, this historic 50th anniversary year of the Cuban revolution; congratulates the Mint in Coatbridge for securing Cuba-friendly status after hosting an evening of Cuban culture earlier this year; recognises that Coatbridge is becoming more Cuba-friendly as this is the second event of this kind in the area, with the first being held at Big Owen’s Bar in 2008; understands that being a Cuba-friendly bar means offering customers the opportunity to purchase Cuban Havana Club rum to help boost the Cuban economy rather than buying Bacardi, the headquarters of which are in Bermuda and which is made in Puerto Rico; considers that Cuba-friendly events provide an opportunity to raise awareness of Cuba’s remarkable achievements in terms of poverty reduction, healthcare and education in spite of particularly difficult circumstances, not least those imposed by the US blockade; considers that Bacardi lawyers were influential in the drafting of the 1996 Helms-Burton Act, which sought to extend the scope of the US embargo against Cuba; further notes that the UN General Assembly last month voted 187 to 3 in opposition to the US trade embargo on Cuba, up from 185 to 3 last year, with only Israel and the Pacific island nation of Palau supporting the United States; believes that the annual vote serves to highlight global opposition to the United State’s hard-line policy toward the socialist island; also believes that there has never been such a wide-ranging and brutal blockade against a people as the US blockade of Cuba, believed by some to be illegal; supports the 248 MPs at Westminster who have signed Early Day Motion 1171, which calls on the UK Government to support better UK-Cuba relations, and believes that Scotland-Cuba relations and Scottish interests in the region can be encouraged through cultural and economic links.
