 *S3M-2103 Christopher Harvie: Congratulations to Balwearie High School, Kirkcaldy—That the Parliament congratulates the pupils, staff and community of Balwearie High School, Kirkcaldy, on receiving an outstanding assessment from HM Inspectorate of Education; notes that awards in the sciences were much higher than the national average and across the school the population of pupils who entered higher and further education was significantly above national averages; further notes that, in particular, Balwearie High School is to be commended on the care taken to reach out to groups with learning difficulties, to develop links with Europe and to incorporate the wider civil society in its educational programme, and recognises that this echoes the ideas of a great educationalist in Fife of the 1950s and 1960s, R F Mackenzie of Templehall School, Kirkcaldy, and Braehead School, Buckhaven and assures the county of the adaptability of its educational system to meet environmental challenges and new technologies.
