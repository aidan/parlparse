*S2M-4655 Pauline McNeill: Welcome Back Kelvingrove, Glasgow Missed You—That the Parliament celebrates the return of Scotland’s favourite museum, the Kelvingrove, which reopened its doors on 11 July 2006 for the first time since June 2003; congratulates the New Century Project and all those who have played a role in its restoration and, in particular, the 9,000 contributors to the Kelvingrove Refurbishment Appeal, whose names are now recorded on the Gallery’s Donor Wall; commends Glasgow for the continuing and worthy commitment to improving arts and cultural opportunities for all her citizens; notes the importance placed on maintaining and expanding the city’s collection by Glasgow City Council and its predecessors throughout the hardest of times as well as the good; further notes that prior to its closure the art gallery and museum were the most visited outside London, and wishes the new and improved Kelvingrove every success for the future.
