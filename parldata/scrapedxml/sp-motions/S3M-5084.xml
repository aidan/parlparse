 *S3M-5084 Stuart McMillan: Recommendation for Princes Gate, Bishopbriggs to Remain with East Dunbartonshire Local Authority—That the Parliament welcomes the revised recommendations published for public consultation on 29 October 2009 by the Local Government Boundary Commission, proposing that the Princes Gate area of Bishopbriggs remain with the East Dunbartonshire local authority area; considers that the residents of Princes Gate specifically chose to live in this area and have maintained and developed their community links with the rest of Bishopbriggs over the years, links that would have been dislocated under the commission’s provisional proposals, with significant financial loss for existing residents; welcomes also the proposed retention of a much-needed affordable housing site in East Dunbartonshire, and congratulates the local residents who have worked tirelessly with the local council to overturn the commission’s provisional proposals. Supported by: Stewart Maxwell*, Alasdair Allan*, Jackson Carlaw*
