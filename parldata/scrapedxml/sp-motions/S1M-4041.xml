*S1M-4041 Tommy Sheridan: Comments by SNP Councillor on Firefighters—That the Parliament condemns the comments of SNP councillor and Convener of the Tayside Joint Fire Board, Frances Duncan, who labelled firefighters who take part in democratic strike action on 20 March 2003 as "irresponsible"; condemns her specific comments in the Dundee Evening Telegraph of 18 March 2003 that "I feel it would be rather irresponsible for FBU General Secretary Andy Gilchrist to encourage his members to strike during a time of imminent war"; believes these comments to be wholly inappropriate, especially in the light of the disgusting attacks on firefighters made by Tory MP Bernard Jenkin to the effect that firefighters were the "friends of Saddam", and upholds the democratic right of trade unionists to engage in legitimate industrial action, including the withdrawal of their labour, regardless of any central government action in an illegal war with Iraq.
