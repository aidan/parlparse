*S2M-329.2 Robert Brown: Treatment of Asylum Seekers in Scotland-As an amendment to motion (S2M-329) in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from "calls for" to end and insert "reiterates its strong support for the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child; believes that decisions affecting children whose parents are to be detained should be made in the best interests of the child; notes that the issue of asylum and immigration policy is reserved to Westminster but welcomes the significant progress made by Scottish Ministers to improve services and support for asylum seekers and refugees in the community; notes that Dungavel is one of eight UK removal centres operated by the Home Office throughout the United Kingdom; notes the reports by HM Inspectorate of Prisons and HM Inspectorate of Education on the educational provision made for the children detained at Dungavel; calls on Her Majesty's Government to take immediate action to implement the recommendations in the two reports and to end a system of detention of children at Dungavel which denies them access to social contact and to educational and other services in the local community, and calls on the Scottish Executive to convey the Parliament's concerns to Her Majesty's Government."
