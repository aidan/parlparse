*S3M-7219 John Wilson: Launch of Abused Men in Scotland Charityâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Abused Men in Scotland (AMIS) charity funded from the National Lottery Awards for All Scotland fund; recognises that AMIS aims to raise awareness of male victims of domestic abuse and highlight the lack of services available to meet their needs and the needs of their children; notes that figures published by AMIS show a 9.4% increase in recorded incidents of male victims of domestic abuse or violence since 2008-09; considers that, despite police statistics indicating a year-on-year increase in reported incidents of male victims of domestic abuse, there remains inadequate service provision designed to meet the needs of male victims throughout Scotland; believes that AMIS, by providing a national telephone helpline and an office in Dunfermline, is a step in the right direction to ensuring that male victims and their children receive the help that they so desperately require, and praises the collaborative approach being used by AMIS, which aims to offer specialist awareness training to organisations that have contact with male victims of domestic abuse and their families.
