*S3M-5207 Jamie Hepburn: Closure of Guantánamo Bay—That the Parliament welcomes the efforts being made by President Obama to close Guantánamo Bay; notes the long legal heritage regarding the writ of habeas corpus that links Scotland, England and the United States of America, and, with the issue of Guantánamo before the US Supreme Court for a fourth time, supports an effective remedy for those prisoners determined to be held there illegally.
