*S3M-7755 Bill Kidd: Don’t Limit Mobility—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the report, Don’t limit mobility, by the organisations Leonard Cheshire Disability, Mencap, Sense and others in response to the UK Government’s proposal to stop paying the mobility component of Disability Living Allowance for disabled people in residential care; expresses its concern that the removal of the mobility component for disabled people in residential care might force people to remain indoors, have a diminished quality of life and greatly reduce their independence, autonomy and opportunities, and strongly urges the UK Government to reverse this decision.
