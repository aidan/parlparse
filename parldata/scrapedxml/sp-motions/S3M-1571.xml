 *S3M-1571 Iain Smith: Roman Catholic Support for Mehdi Kazemi and Pegah Emambakhsh—That the Parliament notes Pope John Paul II’s encyclical, Evangelium Vitae, in which his late Holiness made clear that circumstances where the death penalty is acceptable are "very rare, if not practically nonexistent" and Pope Benedict’s statement when he was Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that, in modern society, it is "practically impossible" to find any cases deserving of the death sentence; also notes that Mehdi Kazemi and Pegah Emambakhsh are at risk of being executed for their homosexuality if they are returned to Iran, and calls on the Roman Catholic Church to join the cross-party campaign for the Home Office to reverse its rejection of their asylum applications.
