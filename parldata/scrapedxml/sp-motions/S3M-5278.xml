*S3M-5278 Rhona Brankin: Coalfields Regeneration Trust in Scotland—That the Parliament notes the evaluation by EKOS of the work of the Coalfields Regeneration Trust (CRT) in Scotland over the last 10 years; welcomes the channelling of more than £15 million over that period into coalfield areas by the CRT in Scotland; notes that for every £1 of CRT investment in project activity since 2005, an additional £1.37 of funding from other sources has been secured; is concerned that despite the excellent work of the CRT the study found that deprivation in Scotland is still disproportionately concentrated in coalfield communities, with particular inequalities evident in relation to income, employment and skills, and considers that further investment is needed in Scotland’s former coalfield communities if the economic and social challenges in these areas are to be fully addressed. Supported by: Cathie Craigie*, Johann Lamont*, Hugh O’Donnell*, John Park*, Claire Baker*, Trish Godman*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Patricia Ferguson*, Jackie Baillie*, David Whitton*, Jim Tolson*, Sarah Boyack*, Mary Mulligan*, Bill Butler*, Karen Gillon*
