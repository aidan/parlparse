*S3M-6174.2 Derek Brownlee: The Economyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-6174) in the name of Andy Kerr, leave out from first "and" to end and insert "; notes that an increase in the rate of VAT for new homes would significantly compound these difficulties, as would further increases in national insurance contributions; asks the Scottish Government to make representations to the UK Government to try to prevent such tax rises, and calls on the Scottish Government to take action on the economy within its own powers by ruling out the transfer of business rates to local authorities, which would significantly increase bills in many parts of the country, including Aberdeenshire, the Borders, East Dunbartonshire, Argyll and Bute and Fife among many others, and by considering the scope within existing revenue projections to extend business rate relief for small and rural businesses."
