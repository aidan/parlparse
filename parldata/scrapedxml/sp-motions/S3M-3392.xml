 *S3M-3392 Patrick Harvie: Aviation and Scotland’s Climate Change Bill—That the Parliament acknowledges the recent report from the World Development Movement, which found that airport expansion in Scotland could create 20,000 climate refugees worldwide by 2050 due to the damage caused by increased climate change emissions; welcomes the plea from some 21,000 people that Scotland’s share of international aviation emissions should be counted in a Climate Change (Scotland) Bill from the start; notes that campaigners will bring this message to the Parliament on Thursday 5 February 2009 in order to highlight the case for the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill to explicitly commit to action on international aviation emissions from the outset; further notes the views of those campaigners that MSPs must not allow the second National Planning Framework for Scotland to support aviation expansion without full and proper public and environmental scrutiny, and believes that aviation expansion remains economically unjustified, especially given that the majority of businesses in the United Kingdom plan to reduce their flying in the next 10 years. Supported by: Robin Harper*, Cathy Peattie*
