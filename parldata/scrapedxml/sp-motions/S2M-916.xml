*S2M-916# Alex Fergusson: Fuel Prices in Rural Scotland-That the Parliament notes with concern the widening gap between fuel prices in urban and rural areas; further notes that between the fuel crisis in September 2000 and summer 2003 the gap remained at a relatively constant two to three pence per litre but has increased since then to a differential of at least six pence per litre, and therefore strongly believes that the Scottish Executive should enter into talks with the major fuel suppliers to ascertain why the differential cannot be maintained at a level that will be less damaging to private, business and tourism interests in rural areas than the current discriminatory level.
