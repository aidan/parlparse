*S2M-679 Sarah Boyack: Fairtrade Universities-That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the Students' Association of the University of Edinburgh to work towards Fairtrade University status; acknowledges the ongoing campaigns of People and Planet groups in the universities of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen and the One World Group in St Andrews to get Fairtrade accreditation for their universities from the Fairtrade Foundation; urges universities and students' associations to respond positively to these campaigns by meeting the five goals set by the Fairtrade Foundation, including requirements to stock and promote Fairtrade goods at university shops and outlets, serve Fairtrade products at university and student union meetings and establish a written policy and steering group on setting and meeting Fairtrade targets; believes such campaigns play an important part in raising the awareness of current unfair trade rules that force millions of people in developing countries into poverty and of the pressing need for trade justice; further believes that supporting Fairtrade plays a practical role in increasing the sale of products that benefit the world's poorest nations, and urges all Scottish universities to become officially-accredited Fairtrade Universities.
