 *S2M-602# Fergus Ewing: Belford Hospital, Lochaber-That the Parliament congratulates the people of Lochaber for their massive attendance at the public meeting on Tuesday, 11 November 2003 to express their support for the future of the Belford Hospital, Fort William; notes that around 2,500 people attended the Nevis Centre, representing about one fifth of the population of Lochaber; recognises that the Belford Hospital has established a very high reputation for the standard of its work, particularly in relation to acute trauma; considers that the Belford Hospital must continue to be recognised as a medical training centre in order to retain its nine junior medical, surgical and casualty staff; believes that consultant-led services must be retained locally to ensure that high quality acute emergency services continue to be provided at the Belford Hospital; notes that the Lochaber Medical Community Option (the "Lochaber option") has the support of a substantial majority of doctors working in Lochaber, as well as the unanimous support of the Belford Hospital staff, including nurses, physiotherapists, domestic staff, porters, secretaries, radiographers, laboratory staff and midwives as well as that of the full Highland Council; believes that the "Lochaber option" has, thus far, not been properly considered nor fully evaluated; further believes that the "Lochaber option" must be included as one of the options in the formal consultation process which is to be launched by the Highland Health Board early next year, and considers that members from all political parties should express their support for the "Lochaber option" being included in the formal consultation process.
