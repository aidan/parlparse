 *S3M-5957 Liam McArthur: Change at the Top of Fishing News—That the Parliament notes that Tim Oliver, the current editor of Fishing News, is to stand down with his place as editor being taken by Cormac Burke; recognises the importance of Fishing News to Scotland’s fishing industry and thus the service to the industry that Tim Oliver has provided over his 23 years at the paper’s helm; welcomes the news that Tim Oliver is not going to be altogether lost to Fishing News as he is to continue to work for the paper part time as a consultant and reporter; offers its best wishes to Cormac Burke for the challenge that he takes on as he steps up to the editor’s chair, and sends its thanks to Tim Oliver for his years of service and its hopes that, as his retirement is only partial, he will not find himself with nothing to do other than to spend more time in the company of Fishing News’s legendary Ms S Betty.
