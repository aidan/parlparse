 *S3M-5818 Bob Doris: Supporting Tir Conaill Harps and Scotland’s Irish Diaspora—That the Parliament expresses its disgust at those people who disgracefully destroyed the minibus of Glasgow’s Tir Conaill Harps Gaelic Athletic Club on Monday 22 January 2010 by throwing a gas canister through the window; notes that this bus contained valuable sporting equipment worth an estimated £3,000 and that both the bus and equipment were to be used for a sporting tournament involving seven primary schools at the Kelvin Hall Arena on Friday 26 February; congratulates all the hardworking and committed volunteers involved with Tir Conaill Harps who have ensured that the tournament goes ahead and, in particular, thanks the Ulster Council of the Gaelic Athletic Association, which has donated almost £1,500 worth of equipment; considers fears by some people that the minibus attack may have been racially motivated against Scotland’s Irish diaspora community as deeply worrying and believes that such concerns should be fully investigated by the police; believes that the members of Scotland’s Irish diaspora have made a long-standing and valued contribution to the fabric of the Scottish nation, and calls on everyone to stand shoulder to shoulder in unity with Scotland’s Irish community to reject any such acts of either mindless violence or racism. Supported by: Joe FitzPatrick*, Anne McLaughlin*, Bill Kidd*, Brian Adam*, Alasdair Allan*, Stuart McMillan*
