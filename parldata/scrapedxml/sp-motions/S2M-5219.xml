*S2M-5219 Tommy Sheridan: Solidarity with Solectron Workers—That the Parliament condemns the decision of Solectron Corporation, based in California, to announce the closure of the Solectron manufacturing plant in Dunfermline and the effective sacking of 440 workers; recognises that Solectron, Dunfermline, has grown in terms of sales and profits for seven consecutive quarters and is one of the most profitable sites in Europe, its quality of work is second to none and it has successfully made the transition to an unleaded manufacturing process more than four months before required by legislation; further condemns the fact that employees at Solectron were told in a webcast by bosses in California that their jobs were safe only to be told the next day that they would be affected by the announcement that Solectron is to shed 1,400 workers in Europe and North America but to employ 800 employees in Romania in order to pursue greater profits for the company; believes that the decision to sack 440 Scottish workers was taken primarily because under current legislation governing employment law in Scotland it is easier and cheaper to close a Scottish factory than one in France or Germany, not least because in the rest of Europe, where employment legislation is fairer, a worker can expect four weeks’ wages in redundancy payments for every year they have worked for a company compared with only one week’s wages for every year in Scotland; calls on the Scottish Executive to demand top-level talks with Solectron Corporation to convince it to reverse its unacceptable decision and to lobby New Labour in Westminster to bring redundancy payments and other legislation designed to protect worker’s rights up to at least European-wide standards and to support the Trade Union Freedom Bill at Westminster, and supports the Solectron workers in whatever action they decide to take in defence of their jobs, factory and living conditions.
