*S3M-3763 Pauline McNeill: The Glasgow School of Art Launches International Competition—That the Parliament welcomes the Glasgow School of Art launching an international competition to design a new campus building opposite its iconic Mackintosh building in the heart of Garnethill; notes that the successful architect-led team will design and deliver the first phase of a two-phase project to create an urban campus, and believes that the project will result in a building that is as inspirational to current and future generations of staff and students as the renowned Mackintosh building, demonstrated by the many thousands of tourists who visit the Mackintosh building every year, will ensure world-class facilities for teaching and research and will enhance the school’s international reputation.
