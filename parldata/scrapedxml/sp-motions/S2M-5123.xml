*S2M-5123 Margaret Jamieson: Fireworks—That the Parliament notes the continuing distress caused to residents and their pets by fireworks; recognises that restrictions on the sale of fireworks at New Year and for a three-week period prior to 5 November under the Fireworks Act 2003 do not prevent the abuse of fireworks at this time and during other times of the year when it is still too prevalent, and believes that the time has come to have a complete ban on the sale of fireworks, except for organised displays where a licence can be granted by local authorities.
