*S2M-4400 Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Sun Awareness Week—That the Parliament notes the importance of National Sun Awareness Week 2006, which takes place between 15 and 21 May 2006, in highlighting the dangers of over-exposure to the sun; acknowledges the extent of the challenge faced in Scotland where rates of melanoma incidence are higher than in the rest of the United Kingdom and where incidence of skin cancer has tripled in the last 30 years; recognises the work of the SunSmart campaign, the national skin cancer prevention campaign run by Cancer Research UK and funded by the Scottish Executive and the other UK health departments; supports this year’s campaign targeting men and outdoor workers, launched on 16 May 2006, and drawing attention to the high numbers of men dying from skin cancer; stresses the importance of early detection, illustrated by a new survey by the charity which found that 60% of men in Scotland never check their backs, where skin cancer often occurs, to see if existing moles have changed or if new ones have appeared; observes that this has contributed to the fact that malignant melanoma rates in men have quadrupled in the last 30 years in the UK, and urges the Executive to review its strategy on skin cancer prevention, recognising the importance of the need to strengthen the good work already being carried out in Scotland within NHS budgets.
