 *S1M-1794 Andrew Wilson: Financial Powers of the Parliamentâ€”That the Parliament notes that the current devolution settlement gives the Scottish Parliament fewer financial powers than any other Parliament in the world; further notes that, while devolution is a recognition of the need for and desirability of policy divergences within the United Kingdom, the financial settlement underpinning it is designed explicitly to produce convergence in public expenditure; recognises that two thirds of Scots already support the devolution of full financial powers to the Scottish Parliament, and calls on the Scottish Executive to respond to this growing consensus and bring forward proposals to deliver full financial powers to the Parliament.
