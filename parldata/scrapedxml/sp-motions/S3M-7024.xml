*S3M-7024 Hugh O’Donnell: Supporting Epilepsy Specialist Nurses—That the Parliament welcomes Epilepsy Action’s report, Best Care: the value of epilepsy specialist nurses; supports Epilepsy Action’s campaign to preserve epilepsy specialist nurse (ESN) posts and welcomes the campaigning activity of Epilepsy Scotland, Quarriers and other organisations; believes that ESNs make an invaluable contribution to patient care; considers that ESNs save costs by reducing demand on consultants’ time, reducing hospital admissions and reducing emergency readmissions; understands that there is an increasing threat to ESNs of redundancy, reduced working hours or assignment to non-specialist duties as NHS boards seek short-term cost savings, and believes that the Scottish Government must ensure that there is a strategic plan to enable all patients across Scotland assessed as requiring access to an ESN to have that access.
