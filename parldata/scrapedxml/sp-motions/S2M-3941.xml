 *S2M-3941&lt;&gt; Ms Sandra White: 7:84 Theatre Company—That the Parliament applauds the work done throughout the years by Glasgow-based 7:84 Theatre Company; reaffirms the valuable artistic and theatrical contribution it has made to the life of Glasgow and Scotland as a whole; condemns the statements contained in Scottish Arts Council (a publicly funded body) reports that 7:84 "has no national role", that there are "serious concerns regarding…the quality of its work", that it is "unclear if the company’s work engages audiences"; further condemns the reports which say the company is "turning sharp political satire into panto for the working classes" and that their audience is "blissfully unassuming"; recognises the fine relationship that the company has with local councils, especially in regard to its excellent outreach programme, and believes that the Scottish Arts Council should commit itself fully to future funding of the company, thereby, not only empowering 7:84 to maintain its high level of contribution to the arts scene, but also discharging its own duties in helping to deliver a pluralistic and artistically diverse Scotland. Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Carolyn Leckie*, Christine Grahame*, Patrick Harvie*, Michael Matheson*, Frances Curran*, Brian Adam*, Linda Fabiani*, Mr Adam Ingram*, Colin Fox*, Alex Neil*, Rob Gibson*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Rosie Kane* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
