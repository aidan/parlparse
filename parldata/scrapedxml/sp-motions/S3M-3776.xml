 *S3M-3776 Lewis Macdonald: Congratulations to Kittybrewster Primary School—That the Parliament congratulates all the staff and pupils at Kittybrewster Primary School following the publication of the HM Inspectorate of Education report; welcomes the progress that has been made by the school, the leadership of the headteacher in taking forward improvements and the strong commitment of staff to improving children’s learning; recognises the importance of confidence in the future of the school on the part of pupils, families and staff, and believes that the achievements of Kittybrewster School would best be recognised by an undertaking from Aberdeen City Council that the threat of closure faced by the school twice in the last two years will not be repeated.
