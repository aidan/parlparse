*S3M-2904♦ Hugh Henry: Alcohol Pricing—That the Parliament recognises the health and social consequences for residents of Paisley South of cheap alcohol; believes that a pricing strategy that applies only to Scotland would have significant consequences for those living in Paisley South; considers that there is potential for increased criminality arising from a Scotland-only pricing strategy and notes the opportunities to avoid such a strategy; also believes that cultural and social attitudes to alcohol consumption need to be addressed through education and awareness, and further believes that any pricing strategy to tackle alcohol abuse is best delivered on a UK basis through taxation, with increased revenues invested in NHS and police services.
