*S3M-5995 Jamie Stone: Continuing Loss of Life at Railway Level Crossings—That the Parliament regrets the continuing loss of life at railway level crossings, most recently at Halkirk in Caithness and, in January 2009, at Gatehead in Kilmarnock and Loudoun; notes that there are 23 crossings in Scotland that are automatic open crossings, of which 21 are in the Highlands and two in Ardrossan; believes that crossings without barriers are intrinsically dangerous and inadequate for the task at hand; further believes that there can be no justification for not taking urgent action to stop further fatalities and injuries at rail crossings, and calls on the Scottish Government to work in conjunction with the many organisations and agencies involved in rail safety and direct Network Rail to install barriers at all 23 open crossings in Scotland.
