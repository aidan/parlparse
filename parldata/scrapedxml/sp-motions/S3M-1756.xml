*S3M-1756 Robert Brown: Supporting People with Autism—That the Parliament welcomes the recent 40th anniversary of the Scottish Society for Autism and the first United Nations World Autism Awareness Day in April 2008; notes the progress that has been made in education for young people on the autistic spectrum, underpinned by the framework of the Education (Additional Support for Learning) (Scotland) Act 2004 and in services for both adults and children by the voluntary and statutory sectors; particularly applauds the work being undertaken by Glasgow City Council to help get people on the autistic spectrum into work but is hugely concerned at the proposals by the UK Government which insist on regular, routine reassessments of people with autism who are on disability benefits; believes that such routine reassessments will be counter-productive, worrying and damaging to people with profound autism, and urges the UK Government to adopt a more supportive approach to supporting people with autism into work.
