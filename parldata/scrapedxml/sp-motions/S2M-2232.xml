*S2M-2232# Elaine Smith: Audit of Services for People with Autistic Spectrum Disorders: Statistical Report (2004)—That the Parliament notes that Audit of Services for People with Autistic Spectrum Disorders: Statistical Report (2004) estimates that 561 children and young people aged 18 and under have been diagnosed with an autistic spectrum disorder (ASD) in Lanarkshire, giving the area the second highest rate of ASD in Scotland: notes, however, that only 37 adults are currently recognised as having an ASD in the area; considers that such apparent inconsistencies in diagnoses between age groups relate directly to variations in service provision; welcomes the Scottish Executive’s commitment to improving services; recognises, however, the urgent need for improvement in adult services, and considers that the Executive should continue its drive to ensure provision of more services for people of all ages with autistic spectrum disorders.
