 *S3M-183 Karen Whitefield: Retinopathy Screening—That the Parliament welcomes the "Think of what you might miss" campaign, being launched during Diabetes Week 2007 and organised jointly by Diabetes UK Scotland and RNIB Scotland to encourage people with diabetes in Scotland to access screening for diabetic retinopathy; recognises that diabetic retinopathy is the main cause of sight loss in people of working age in Scotland; understands that, while many people do have their eyes screened for retinopathy on a regular basis, many others do not and are therefore at risk of losing their sight and that, according to the new report by Diabetes UK and RNIB Scotland, Don’t Turn a Blind Eye, non take-up of screening is at its highest among people from particularly vulnerable groups, including people from south Asian communities; welcomes the support for the campaign from the Scottish Executive through funding from the Scottish Diabetes Group, and looks forward to the campaign roadshow going to every NHS board area in Scotland over the next six months, encouraging people with diabetes in those areas to attend their screening appointments.
