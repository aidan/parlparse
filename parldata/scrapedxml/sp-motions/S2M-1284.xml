*S2M-1284# Janis Hughes: Carers' Week-That the Parliament expresses its admiration for the estimated 600,000 people in Scotland who provide unpaid help and support to a relative or friend who could not otherwise manage because of frailty, illness or disability; is concerned that large numbers of these carers are unknown to the statutory agencies; therefore welcomes Carers' Week, being held this year from 14 to 20 June 2004, including parliamentary events on 15 June, with the theme of carers and health; promotes the principle that carers be treated as key partners in community care and welcomes legislative progress such as the introduction of a right to an independent assessment for all carers including, for the first time, carers under 16; is concerned, however, that two-thirds of carers who provide care for more than 50 hours per week say that their health has been affected by caring; notes that, while carers are frequent users of general practitioners and primary care services, there is much work needed in primary care to identify patients who are carers; further notes that the unpaid work carried out by carers saves the taxpayer a substantial amount of money each year, and considers that there should be provision of further support and services for carers. Supported by: Mr David Davidson*, Carolyn Leckie*, John Swinburne*, Eleanor Scott*, Robert Brown*, Linda Fabiani*
