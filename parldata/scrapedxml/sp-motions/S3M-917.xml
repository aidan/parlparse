*S3M-917 Mary Scanlon: Guidance on Handling of Medicines—That the Parliament notes the publication of The Handling of Medicines in Social Care by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain, the professional and regulatory body for pharmacists; recognises the vital importance of proper systems for managing medicines in social care environments and the serious risks if these systems are not robust enough; welcomes the contribution made by the Royal Pharmaceutical Society to best practice in this area, in particular by publishing practical guidance which draws on the experience of front-line pharmacists who are working in the social care environment; believes that this publication will help ensure that staff and residents in social care can have the confidence they deserve in the management of medicines, and urges the Scottish Government to continue to work closely with the country’s pharmacists on projects like this to make best use of their experience in communities across Scotland.
