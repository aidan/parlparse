 S3M-4679 Des McNulty: Fair Deal for Dunbartonshire—That the Parliament expresses concern that, of the £40 million assigned to 48 towns across Scotland as part of the Scottish Government’s Town Centre Regeneration Fund, nothing whatever has been allocated to either East or West Dunbartonshire; notes that Clydebank was identified by Experian earlier this year as one of five Scottish town centres most at risk as a result of the economic downturn; is concerned that the criteria against which projects were considered were not published in advance, and calls on ministers to explain why none of the four bids put forward by West Dunbartonshire Council was granted funding despite its being the second most deprived council area in Scotland and the area with one of the the highest unemployment rates.
