*S1M-3639# Bill Butler: Firefighters' Dispute—That the Parliament notes with deep concern the beginning of the second phase of the firefighters’ dispute which is due to last for eight days; acknowledges the widespread disappointment and frustration at the breakdown of talks between the Fire Brigades Union and local authority employers on the morning of 22 November 2002, talks which had come so close to arriving at a settlement acceptable to both sides; recognises that everyone involved remains very anxious, given the risk to the general public’s health and safety, to seek an agreement that is acceptable to all sides speedily brokered, and considers that the Scottish Executive should make representations to Her Majesty’s Government to urge it to do all in its power to help provide the conditions that would enable a settlement to be concluded and one which would recognise the aspirations of firefighters for professional status and pay.
