*S3M-4867 Bill Wilson: Ending the GDP Fetish—That the Parliament welcomes the recent report by the Commission on the Measurement of Economic Performance and Social Progress, contributed to by economics professors Amartya Sen, Joseph Stiglitz and Jean-Paul Fitoussi, which calls for an end to "GDP fetishism"; believes that an economic approach focused on ever-increasing GDP to the detriment of other factors is unsustainable and has been disastrous for the wellbeing of individuals and the environment; agrees with the report that a new indicator of progress is needed, one that considers issues such as environmental protection and work/life balance as well as economic output, to rate a country’s ability to maintain the sustainable happiness of its inhabitants; notes that, were such methodology to be used, and, as a result, GDP took into account outcomes and not just financial inputs, the United States of America’s apparently large economic lead over France in terms of its GDP would be greatly reduced due to France’s high-quality health service, welfare system and long holidays, all of which contribute to the wellbeing of its inhabitants; commends French President Nicolas Sarkozy for his response to the report, not least his statement that "the [present economic] crisis doesn’t only make us free to imagine other models, another future, another world. It obliges us to do so", and his instruction to France’s national statistics body, Insee, to update its methods in accordance with the report’s recommendations, and calls on the Scottish and UK Governments urgently to follow his lead and to encourage other countries to do so.
