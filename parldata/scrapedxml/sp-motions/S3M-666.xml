 *S3M-666 Patricia Ferguson: Fruit Trees For Malawi—That the Parliament notes the Fruit Trees for Malawi programme taking place in the United Kingdom from 1 July 2007 to 30 June 2009; recognises the potential value of this project which seeks to recycle aluminium cans and use the proceeds to buy fruit trees to be planted in the Nkhata Bay area of Malawi; further notes the collaboration of Alupro and Ripple Africa in this imaginative scheme and that previous similar projects have contributed to an increase in the amount of aluminium recycled as well as having a beneficial effect on the lives of many communities in Africa, and encourages Scottish local authorities to become involved.
