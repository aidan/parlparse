*S1M-15.1 Richard Lochhead: As an amendment to the motion (S1M-00015) in the name of David Davidson, add at end: "The Parliament also notes the different approaches, levels of financial assistance and timescales being adopted in relation to the implementation of the Directive throughout Europe and recognises that this uneven playing field leaves the Scottish industry at a severe disadvantage. In reaching a solution, the Parliament calls upon the North of Scotland Water Authority to: (a) enter into regular and constructive dialogue with the fish processing industry and (b) avoid building plants which would create an over-capacity in waste water treatment facilities if processors build their own.
