 *S3M-3638 Bill Kidd: Scottish Solutions to Scottish Problemsâ€”That the Parliament condemns UK Government proposals outlined in the Welfare Reform Bill, which it considers amount to the most radical retrenchment of the benefit system in decades and will negatively affect the most vulnerable benefit claimants in Scotland; believes that the draconian measures outlined in the Bill will have hugely negative effects on those who are unemployed and suffering under poverty in Scotland, particularly in areas with high rates of deprivation like Glasgow; shares the concerns of leading UK civil liberties group, Liberty, that provisions of the current Welfare Reform Bill will seriously interfere with the privacy and anti-discrimination rights of benefit claimants, particularly people who are drug dependent; agrees with the former First Minister, Donald Dewar, that "Scottish solutions to Scottish problems" should be sought, and, therefore, believes that the powers of the Scottish Parliament should be extended to include welfare benefits in order to ensure that Scotland does not suffer under these retrograde proposals.
