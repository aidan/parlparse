 *S3M-5938.1 Bill Wilson: School Transport in Renfrewshire—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5938) in the name of Hugh Henry, leave out from first "the decision" to end and insert "that Labour cuts from Westminster will apparently cost Renfrewshire Council £4 million; considers that the PFI system of finance, which it considers to be discredited, has burdened the council with £14 million of debt for this year alone; welcomes the SNP-led council’s consultation with parents’ councils on issues relating to school transport; notes the council’s working relationship with bus companies to support local bus routes; understands that Renfrewshire is coming into line with other councils’ policies relating to free secondary school transport, such as North Ayrshire, East Dunbartonshire, Aberdeenshire, East Lothian, North Ayrshire, South Ayrshire, Scottish Borders, Stirling and many other councils, and believes that, if the Labour Party would like to change the rules for provision of free school transport, then it should state clearly the changes to the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 that it would like to implement."
