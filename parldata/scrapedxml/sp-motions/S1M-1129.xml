*S1M-1129# Mr Kenneth Gibson: Threat to World's Forests-That the Parliament deplores the industrial logging of the world's ancient forests; notes that most terrestrial bio-diversity resides in forests and that many species are being driven to extinction by the sheer scale of logging which now results in the destruction of 10 million hectares per year, threatening millions of forest dwelling people by this devastation and the climatic changes caused by the ensuing environmental destabilisation; calls upon the leading industrial nations to co-operate and ensure greater information sharing while developing countermeasures to illegal logging; further calls upon governments to assist the International Tropical Timber Organisation in securing market transparency and by implementing and enforcing laws against illegally logged timber and buying timber from certified forests such as those carrying the mark of the Forest Stewardship Council, and believes that governments should deny "aid" funding to projects that destroy ancient forests while providing funds, logistical support and training to help other nations battling to stop illegal logging and produce timber from sustainable forests and their communities.
