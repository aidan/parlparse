 *S2M-681# Tricia Marwick: Apology Demanded for Poll Tax-That the Parliament notes the admission by Malcolm Rifkind, the Conservative Secretary of State for Scotland responsible for the introduction of the poll tax on 1 April 1989, that it was "a great political mistake"; rejects the assertion that it was his government's presentation of the poll tax that was flawed, and considers that Mr Rifkind and the Conservative Party in Scotland should now, after 14 years, apologise to the thousands of people in Scotland who were pursued for payment of a tax they could not pay and apologise to the people of Scotland for using Scotland as the guinea pig for their unfair and unjust tax system and their immoral and draconian methods of collecting it.
