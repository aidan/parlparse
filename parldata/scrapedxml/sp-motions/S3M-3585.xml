*S3M-3585 Jackson Carlaw: Prostate Cancer Awareness Month 2009—That the Parliament supports The Prostate Cancer Charity in launching the It Matters campaign, during Prostate Cancer Awareness Month 2009, to highlight that more investment is needed to tackle prostate cancer; notes that 2,500 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer every year in Scotland and between 750 and 800 men die of the disease each year; calls on the Scottish Government to monitor prostate cancer patient experience through the Better Together programme; further notes that in order to decrease mortality from prostate cancer there is a need to invest in more research to develop a new generation test for prostate cancer capable of distinguishing between aggressive and slow-growing forms of prostate cancer, and further calls on the Scottish Government to play an active role in providing leadership in the global search for such a test.
