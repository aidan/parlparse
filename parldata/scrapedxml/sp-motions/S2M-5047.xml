*S2M-5047 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Children in Need at Home—That the Parliament notes the forthcoming Children in Need appeal on BBC television; notes that there are still 240,000 children in Scotland, one in four, living in poverty; further notes that many low-income families are unable to afford the cost of basics such as school uniforms and optional extras such as school trips; notes that many families with incomes below £15,000 struggle to afford these costs while the children risk being isolated, stigmatised and bullied at school and falling behind with schoolwork; further notes that figures from the Department for Work and Pensions estimate that up to £500 million of Working Tax Credit and Child Tax Credit goes unclaimed annually in Scotland; recognises that the UK Government is failing to make progress on take-up rates for means-tested benefits, and calls on the Scottish Executive to do everything in its power to address child poverty in Scotland, including investment in free health care for all, free education for all, decent and affordable social housing and an agricultural system based on producing healthy nutritious food for communities not for profit and to call on the UK Government to implement a taxation system based on the ability to pay, a national minimum wage and benefit system that affords families the dignity to maintain a normal family life and an end to means-tested benefit.
