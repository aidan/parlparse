*S1M-2944# Karen Gillon: Register of Pensioners' Groups—That the Parliament commends the work undertaken by pensioners to create local elderly forums as a means of increasing their democratic participation; recognises that this is inhibited by the inadequate and sparse detail currently held on pensioners’ groups in Scotland, and encourages the Scottish Executive to give further consideration to the establishment of a standard local authority register of pensioner groups in order to facilitate a crucial basis of communication with such groups and promote empowerment through easy access to information, which will allow pensioners’ issues to be pursued on a much broader basis.
