 *S2M-5160.1 Tommy Sheridan: Shipping of Prawns—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5160) in the name of Chris Ballance, insert at end "further recognises that the decision of Young’s Seafood Limited to implement this environmentally destructive plan is driven by the economic madness of unfettered globalisation and the pursuit of maximum profits at any costs, including the loss of 120 jobs in a community of only 8,000, that such rampant globalisation on the basis of the obscenely unfair rigged free market profit system of capitalism makes environmental action inconsistent with the continuation of that system and that being green in the world today requires policies that are socialist led."
