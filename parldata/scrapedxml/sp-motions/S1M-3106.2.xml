 *S1M-3106.2 Tommy Sheridan: Investment and Reform in Health and Community Care-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3106) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end "however, believes that the voice of the health workers articulated by the main health union UNISON, the Royal College of Nursing and the STUC on behalf of all health workers is not being listened to sufficiently, particularly in relation to the use of private finance and the need to tackle low wages and therefore agrees to reject the Executive's Private Finance Initiatives in favour of proper public investment and to prioritise wages for low paid health workers and nurses."
