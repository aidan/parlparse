 *S1M-2456 Mr Adam Ingram: Disposal of Remains from the Foot-and-Mouth Disease Outbreak-That the Parliament deplores the decision by the Scottish Executive to dispose of two thousand tonnes of ash from the incineration of sheep and cattle culled in Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders during the foot-and-mouth outbreak earlier this year at Garlaff in East Ayrshire; supports East Ayrshire Council in its opposition to the decision which results in the import of waste material in the form of ash from the outbreak into a non-infected area without guarantees that the temperature of incineration reached 1000 degrees centigrade, which is the temperature required to kill the BSE prion, and calls on the Executive to arrange for the transportation of the waste for disposal at an engineered site at Carlisle failing the provision of such a site within previously infected areas in Scotland.
