*S3M-4332 Bill Butler: Refugee Week—That the Parliament notes that 15 to 21 June is Refugee Week 2009; congratulates the Scottish Refugee Council, which has organised this important week of events, and the many communities and organisations that have worked tirelessly to deliver over 100 events across Scotland to mark the valuable contribution that asylum seekers and refugees make; deplores the human rights abuses around the world that compel people to seek sanctuary; recognises that it is our humanitarian duty to grant asylum to those fleeing persecution and that Scotland should continue to be a haven for people seeking protection; condemns those who would poison our democracy by spreading hatred, and affirms the role of the Parliament in making Scotland a place of safety where people can rebuild their lives. Supported by: Ms Wendy Alexander*
