*S2M-5109.1 Carolyn Leckie: Violence Against Women—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5109) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end "and, in so doing, expresses continuing concern at the despairingly low conviction rates for rape and sexual offences and the continuing humiliation that the majority of women complainants face through the courts allowing examination of victims’ sexual history and character, and believes that the efforts of the Executive to address male violence against women must be supported by effective change in the criminal justice system."
