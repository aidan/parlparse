 *S3M-7491 Margaret Mitchell: Roots of Empathyâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the first Roots for Empathy pilot scheme in Scotland at New Stevenson Primary School, Motherwell; acknowledges that Roots for Empathy is a classroom-based intervention programme that aims to reduce bullying and aggression in schools in the short term and, in the long term, seeks to encourage future generations to be compassionate citizens and good parents; notes that the programme was developed by Mary Gordon in 1996 and is in place in Canada, New Zealand, the USA and on the Isle of Man, and hopes that the pilot scheme, initiated by Action for Children Scotland and North Lanarkshire Council, is a success and that it could soon be rolled out to other schools across Scotland.
