 * S2M-2848 Linda Fabiani: 3rd Anniversary of Timor-Leste’s Independence—That the Parliament congratulates the world’s newest nation, East Timor, on the third anniversary of its independence; notes that the Australian Government has, since East Timor’s independence referendum in 1999, taken in approximately $1.2 billion in revenue from oil fields much closer to East Timor than to Australia, and is claiming the bulk of the revenues from the largest known field, Greater Sunrise, on the basis of prior occupation stemming from illegal agreements with Indonesia, the former occupier of East Timor; notes that the Australian Government pre-emptively withdrew from the maritime boundary jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea two months before East Timor’s independence, and believes that the Australian Government should now work to establish a fair and permanent maritime boundary with East Timor based on the rule of international legal principles, recognising that the poorest nation in Asia deserves more than shabby revenue deals well short of its legal entitlements.
