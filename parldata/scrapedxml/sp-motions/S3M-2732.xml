*S3M-2732 Sarah Boyack: Energy Saving Week Campaign 2008—That the Parliament congratulates the Energy Saving Trust for organising its 12th annual Energy Saving Week from 20 to 26 October 2008; recognises that energy efficiency is the cleanest, safest and cheapest way of reducing carbon dioxide emissions; notes that energy efficiency can play a key role in tackling fuel poverty but acknowledges that the Energy Saving Trust’s independent research shows that people believe that a lack of time is a barrier to them taking energy saving measures; further notes that many actions, such as installing low energy lightbulbs or boiling only the amount of water that you need for a hot drink, actually take very little time; urges all MSPs to show leadership in their constituencies and regions by supporting Energy Saving Week and encouraging constituents to contact their local Energy Saving Scotland advice centre on 0800 512 012 for free, independent, home energy efficiency advice, and notes that since the Energy Saving Trust was established it has funded or influenced measures giving lifetime savings of over 100 million tonnes of CO2.
