 *S3M-1316.1 Des McNulty: Congratulating Scottish Science—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1316) in the name of Bill Wilson, leave out from "placing" to end and insert "under a Labour government at Westminster and the Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition in Scotland; expresses concern that underfunding of universities by the SNP government poses a serious threat to the continued success of Scotland’s research scientists who were recently placed second in the world behind only Switzerland; recognises that the constitutional changes proposed by the SNP represent an even more serious threat to research excellence, which is why the overwhelming majority of Scotland’s scientists and scientific bodies want research in Scotland to remain part of the UK research funding framework within which Scottish-based scientists have been outstandingly successful, and congratulates our scientists for the quality of their research."
