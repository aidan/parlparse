 *S3M-3067 Bashir Ahmad: Ethical Purchasing within the NHS—That the Parliament expresses its dismay that some British hospitals are buying surgical instruments produced in sweatshop-style conditions in Pakistan by children as young as eight who are being paid as little as £1.40 per day; believes that the NHS should always aim for the best value-for-money contracts during the procurement process but not at the cost of ethical standards, and further believes that non-compulsory NHS guidelines on ethical purchasing are a poor attempt to address the problem and that only the introduction of compulsory guidelines will help to tackle the problem.
