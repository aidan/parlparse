 *S2M-1585 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Dial-a-Bus Service-That the Parliament appreciates the importance of Strathclyde Passenger Transport's (SPT) Dial-a-Bus service to people within the SPT area and that this service is of particular benefit to the old and infirm; notes with concern that SPT is considering the withdrawal of evening and Sunday Dial-a-Bus Services which would affect around 7,300 passengers per year, many of them being elderly or infirm people who use this service to attend religious services within their places of worship in the evenings and at weekends, and urges its members to support any measures that will ensure that SPT keep this valuable service running.
