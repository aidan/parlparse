*S2M-11 Linda Fabiani: South Lanarkshire Council Secondary School Public Private Partnership Proposal and East Kilbride—That the Parliament shares the concerns of parents and pupils in East Kilbride regarding the public private partnership secondary school proposal of South Lanarkshire Council which, if implemented, would mean that 75% of resultant school closures will be in East Kilbride, which will also lose 50% of its secondary schools resulting in school rolls becoming amongst the highest in Scotland, and that the locations of the proposed schools will entail considerably longer school journey times for many pupils; notes that the council's financial proposal is underpinned by the closure of St Bride's School, academically the highest performing school in South Lanarkshire, so that its site can be sold for development; further notes the concern of parents in East Kilbride that the consultation process by the council is inadequate, and calls on the council and the Minister for Finance and Public Services, in consideration of the local community's deep-felt anxiety on this issue, to reconsider this deeply flawed proposal.
