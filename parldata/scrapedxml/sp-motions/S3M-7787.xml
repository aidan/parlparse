 *S3M-7787 Kenneth Gibson: Time to Ban Neonicotinoid—That the Parliament is concerned by the continuing fall in the world’s bee population and the wider impact that this is expected to have on the planet’s ecosystem; is aware that bees are responsible for the pollination of around 90% of the plants grown; recognises the value of honeybees to the economy, estimated to have contributed approximately £1 billion to the UK economy last year; understands that several scientific studies have pointed to the use of neonicotinoid insecticides as the primary cause of colony collapse disorder, which has so devastated the bee population; further understands that in the four countries that have recently implemented bans on this insecticide, France, Germany, Italy and Slovenia, there have been marked improvements in the bee population and a reversal of this steady and worrying decline, and calls on the European Union to pass legislation banning or at least limiting the use of what is considered this harmful insecticide before the bee population is irreversibly decimated.
