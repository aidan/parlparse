*S3M-5168# Anne McLaughlin: The Future of East Coast Rail Services—That the Parliament expresses concern over reports that the east coast rail link between Glasgow Central and London King’s Cross is to be axed, resulting in a loss of 40% of capacity, or 22,000 seats a week, to direct services between London and Glasgow; notes that such a move will also affect travel between Glasgow and the north of England; further notes that the west coast main line is prone to engineering works and delays and that, with no east coast main line, Glasgow business and tourism will be put at a disadvantage; considers that these proposals by the UK Government are a mistake, and believes that the nationalised east coast main line should continue to offer regular direct services to Glasgow from London King’s Cross.
