*S3M-7412 Linda Fabiani: Mushtaq Ahmad—That the Parliament congratulates Mushtaq Ahmad OBE on being appointed Lord-Lieutenant for Lanarkshire; notes that this continues his personal tradition of public service that began with teaching and organising the largest adult basic education programme in Scotland, included terms as a councillor and as the first Asian provost when he served in that role in South Lanarkshire between 2003 and 2007 and is still ongoing with his work at the Citizen’s Advice Bureau, and looks forward to his continuing public service in his new role for some time to come.
