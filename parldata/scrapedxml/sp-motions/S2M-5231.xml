*S2M-5231 Mike Pringle: South Edinburgh Bottle Marking Initiative—That the Parliament congratulates Lothian and Borders Police for launching, on 30 November 2006, a bottle marking scheme in south Edinburgh to tackle underage consumption of alcohol; welcomes the success of the scheme in the Scottish Borders where coded markings are placed on bottles which can be read under ultraviolet light so that the police can trace which shops are selling to underage people or can identify adults who are purchasing drinks for those who are under age; is pleased that most shopkeepers in south Edinburgh have signed up to the scheme, and looks forward to it being rolled out across the city next year. Supported by: Donald Gorrie*
