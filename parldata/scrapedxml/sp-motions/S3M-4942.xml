*S3M-4942 Ross Finnie: Inverclyde Community Maternity Unit Must Remain 24/7—That the Parliament notes that, despite NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde agreeing, in August 2008, to retain a community maternity unit (CMU) at Inverclyde Royal Hospital for a further three years while a community education programme was run to promote the benefits of the CMU, the board has now decided to change the operations of the CMU from 24/7 to an on-call service at nights and weekends, which clearly reduces the attractiveness of the CMU as no-one can predict the hour of a baby’s arrival; condemns the board’s petulant response to the recommendations of the Independent Scrutiny Panel, and calls on the board to deliver the undertakings that it gave in August 2008 in full and drop its proposals to convert the CMU at Inverclyde Royal Hospital to a 9 am to 5 pm service.
