*S2M-5096.1 Helen Eadie: Future of Remploy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5096) in the name of Bruce Crawford, leave out from "with concern" to end and insert "that the funding to Remploy has risen in recent years from £96 million to £119 million, with subsidies per supported worker ranging from £18,000 to £48,000; further notes that Her Majesty’s Government is committed to the future of Remploy and that, in a statement to the House of Commons on 19 July 2006, Anne McGuire MP, the UK Minister for Disabled People, announced that she will provide additional funding in this financial year to meet short-term pressures; welcomes the fact that a five-year funding envelope of £555 million will be made available to enable the company to plan for the future, setting a new aspiration of helping a significantly greater number of disabled people into work and developing modernisation plans in consultation with trade unions and all stakeholders, with a commitment to protect Remploy’s disabled employees from compulsory redundancy, and asks that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and the Scottish Executive review their procurement procedures to ensure compliance with Article 19 of the EU Directive on public sector procurement which provides particular protection in the procurement process for all sheltered workshops."
