*S2M-909# Elaine Smith: Financial Management of Further Education Colleges-That the Parliament notes the substantial growth in funding and participation rates in the Scottish further education sector in recent years; recognises the measures initiated by the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Further Education Funding Council aimed at improving the financial health of the sector; notes with concern, however, that the deadline imposed on all colleges to achieve financial security by July 2006 puts significant pressure on those colleges who have suffered as a result of mismanagement and/or underfunding in recent decades, and stresses that such financial strategies should not work to compel colleges to cut back on courses or services and should not have a detrimental impact upon current students.
