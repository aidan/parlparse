*S2M-5757 Pauline McNeill: Supporting Scotland’s Only Subway—That the Parliament welcomes plans by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) to expand the Glasgow underground network, which would enhance public transport for many parts of Glasgow that are currently not served by the underground; notes that the system was last modernised 30 years ago; further notes that the underground is a popular mode of transport for Glaswegians and visitors to Glasgow, and believes that Scotland’s only underground system is an integral part of the transport system and that its expansion to the east of Glasgow would enhance both Glasgow’s and the wider Scottish economy by providing an efficient and convenient way of joining up journeys.
