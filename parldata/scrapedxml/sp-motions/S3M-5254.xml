 *S3M-5254 David Stewart: New Zurich to Inverness Air Service—That the Parliament welcomes the new Falcontravel/M-Travel Switzerland (MTCH AG) charter flight service linking the Highlands and Islands with Switzerland, which commences next year for the next three years; notes that Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd have provided funding for the Zurich to Inverness service, which, for 2010, will run between 15 May and 18 September; believes that this new service will bring up to 2,000 tourists to the Highlands and Islands area per year, which will assist with the ongoing economic growth of the region, and hopes that, by introducing this service, better links can be forged between Switzerland and the Highlands and Islands.
