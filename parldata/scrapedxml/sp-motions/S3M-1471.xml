*S3M-1471 Robin Harper: Oil and Gas Exploration in Scotland’s Seas—That the Parliament notes the commitments made by Scottish ministers to protecting Scotland’s marine environment; recognises the international significance of the bottlenose dolphin population that lives in and around the Moray Firth, given that they are a European protected species; further notes the decision by UK ministers to open up almost the whole of Scotland’s nearshore waters for oil and gas exploration and understands the concerns that marine conservation organisations have about this plan; further recognises the significant level of public support, as shown in the 7,000 letters already sent to UK ministers opposing plans for exploration in the protected habitat of the Moray Firth, and urges Scottish ministers, when in discussion with the UK Government, to make clear their opposition to the indiscriminate opening up of our seas to oil exploration and to work to protect some of Scotland’s most famous natural assets.
