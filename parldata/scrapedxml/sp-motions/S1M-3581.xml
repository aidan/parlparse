*S1M-3581# Bill Butler: Schooling of Children of Asylum Seekers-That the Parliament notes with concern the requirement contained within the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, which stipulates that the children of asylum seekers be schooled outwith the mainstream local authority education system in purpose-built accommodation centres; fears that such a condition, which requires separate educational provision for the children of asylum seekers, will in effect lead to segregation rather than integration; acknowledges that the present arrangement, as evidenced by a recent survey conducted in Glasgow, is both inclusive and successful, and considers that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the Home Secretary, the purpose of which would be to arrive at an agreement whereby the current distinctive approach pertaining to the schooling of asylum seeker children in Scotland is allowed to continue.
