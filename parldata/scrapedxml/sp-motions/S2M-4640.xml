*S2M-4640 Shiona Baird: The Future is Renewable—That the Parliament welcomes the news that Ocean Power Delivery (OPD) has secured £13 million of funding from a consortium of private investors; believes that offshore renewables, including wave power, have the potential to make an enormous contribution to Scotland’s future economy; notes the findings of Delivering the New Generation of Energy: A Route Map to Scotland’s Renewable Future, a study by the Scottish Renewables Forum showing that renewables can supply the majority of Scotland’s annual electricity needs; welcomes recent reports indicating that the First Minister favours an expansion of the Scottish renewables industry in preference to new nuclear power, and calls on the Scottish Executive not only to embrace the full economic, social and environmental potential of Scotland’s renewable resource as part of a truly sustainable energy policy but also to provide the practical support which the industry requires to achieve that potential.
