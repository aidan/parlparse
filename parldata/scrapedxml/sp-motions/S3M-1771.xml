*S3M-1771 Kenneth Gibson: Stop the Rip-off—That the Parliament notes with concern the increasing number of people who fall victim to multimillion pound text messaging scams by international spammers; is aware that gangs outwith the European Union exploit loopholes in mobile company contracts under which consumers agree to send and receive texts and agree to pay the bill; is aware that the agreement of mobile phone users to pay for texts received is often something that they are completely unaware of; believes that mobile phone users should only be charged for calls actually made rather than received; considers that it is a nonsense that when Ofcom adjudicates on cases and mobile companies have to refund customers only individual customers who specifically complain are refunded, minimising any deterrent effect, and is of the view that the Scottish Government should liaise with Ofcom, Westminster and the European Union to stop this problem and ensure that mobile phone users pay only for texts sent rather than those received.
