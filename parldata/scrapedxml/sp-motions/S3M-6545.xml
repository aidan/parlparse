*S3M-6545 Kenneth Gibson: Citizens Advice Scotland—That the Parliament commends the ongoing and vital work carried out by Citizens Advice Scotland, which has provided impartial and expert advice on a variety of subject matters for over 70 years; considers that the work of the Citizens Advice Bureau is perhaps more important than ever before as a large number of people seek information and help regarding financial matters including handling debts, tax returns, benefit claims and repossessions during this time of economic difficulty; acknowledges that approximately 80% of Citizens Advice staff are volunteers who would cost over £6 million every year if they were to receive a wage, and recognises that clients and members of the public view the Citizens Advice Bureau as an excellent service, with 98% saying that they trusted the service and 97% praising the service for helping people get fair treatment. Supported by: John Wilson*, Alasdair Allan*, Willie Coffey*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Liam McArthur*, Sandra White*, Rob Gibson*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Mike Pringle*, Anne McLaughlin*, Jackie Baillie*, Aileen Campbell*, Robin Harper*, Alison McInnes*, Maureen Watt*, Mary Scanlon*
