*S2M-1831.1 Mr Mark Ruskell: Scotland’s International Image—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1831) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, leave out from "shares" to end and insert "believes that the Scottish Executive should aspire to build relationships across national and regional boundaries to deliver social, economic and environmentally sustainable development; notes that the First Minister’s forthcoming visit to China and next year’s hosting of the G8 summit offer ideal platforms for Scotland to improve its international image by showing leadership on issues of justice and sustainable development; further notes that these events offer the opportunity to take forward the First Minister’s statements at the World Summit on Sustainable Development that "We cannot continue to plunder the world’s resources without giving something back and wealthy countries must help poorer nations to plan for their future too" and that "some will feel that the only contribution the developed world can make to this summit is to hang our heads in shame", and calls on the Executive urgently to address Scotland’s lack of consistent action on sustainable development since the world summit in 2002."
