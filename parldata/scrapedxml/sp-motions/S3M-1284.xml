*S3M-1284 Claire Baker: An End to the Prospect of Ship-to-Ship Transfers in the Firth of Forth—That the Parliament warmly welcomes Forth Ports plc’s decision not to proceed with plans for ship-to-ship oil transfers in the Firth of Forth; congratulates the people, communities, and local groups in Fife and the Lothians who worked hard to secure this outcome; highlights the hard work of representatives across parties in both the Holyrood and Westminster parliaments on the issue of ship-to-ship oil transfers, and welcomes the protection that this decision will offer to the wildlife and environmentally sensitive sites throughout the Firth of Forth.
