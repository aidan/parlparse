*S3M-3411# Jamie McGrigor: Songbird Survival—That the Parliament is aware of the concerns of many bird lovers throughout the United Kingdom about the decline of the songbird population; notes research that suggests that over the last 40 years many species of songbird have seen a reduction in numbers of 50% or more with some species declining by over 90%; recognises that a number of factors have led to these declines and that these should be considered by policymakers, and commends individual birdwatchers and bird groups in the Highlands and Islands and elsewhere in Scotland for their role in recording species’ numbers and the work of organisations such as Songbird Survival that campaign to raise awareness of the threat to our songbird species and ensure the creation of a balanced biodiversity.
