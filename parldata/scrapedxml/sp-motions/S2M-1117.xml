*S2M-1117 David McLetchie: The Failure of the BBC to Hand Over Tapes to the Fraser Inquiry-That the Parliament agrees that the Holyrood Project has a significant contribution to make to the built environment in Scotland and should provide important lessons for future public procurement policy; notes that the report of the Holyrood Inquiry being conducted by The Rt Hon The Lord Fraser of Carmyllie QC, when presented to the Parliament, will be submitted to an appropriate Parliamentary committee for additional scrutiny and may thereafter be the subject of a full debate or debates in the Parliament; believes that consideration of the Holyrood Inquiry report and the public policy issues arising therefrom which are the general responsibility of the Scottish Executive would be enhanced if members had available to them recordings or transcripts of interviews given by the late Donald Dewar and Snr Enric Miralles to the production company, Wark Clements, in the making of the programme entitled "The Gathering Place", which documents are in the custody or under the control of the British Broadcasting Corporation having its principal place of business in Scotland at Broadcasting House, Queen Margaret Drive, Glasgow G12 8DG, and accordingly requires the British Broadcasting Corporation in terms of section 23 of the Scotland Act 1998 to deliver such documents to the Clerk of the Parliament in accordance with instructions to be given by him in terms of section 24 of said Act.
