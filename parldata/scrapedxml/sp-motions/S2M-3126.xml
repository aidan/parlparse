*S2M-3126 Chris Ballance: UK Use of Depleted Uranium—That the Parliament is concerned that the Secretary of State for Defence admits that approximately 1.9 tonnes of depleted uranium were used in munitions deployed by UK tanks during the 2003 Iraq conflict; recognises that depleted uranium presents a hazard to the personal health of Iraq’s children and non-combatant adults; notes with alarm that this quantity was twice as much depleted uranium as was used during the 1990-91 Gulf War, and urges the UK Government to implement a policy of searching for, gathering and safely disposing of all remnants of depleted uranium in Iraq and Afghanistan and ceasing to use depleted uranium in munitions in the future.
