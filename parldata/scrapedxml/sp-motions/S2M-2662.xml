 * S2M-2662 Mike Rumbles: Nurse Staffing Levelsâ€”That the Parliament notes the recent Royal College of Nursing Scotland survey of its members which found that 70% believed that appropriate staffing levels, including nurse:patient ratios, would help them to improve patient care by guaranteeing that there is always the right number and mix of staff on duty; further notes the international evidence supporting the case for higher nurse staffing levels producing better patient outcomes, including lower infection rates, fewer patient falls, reduced hospital stays and lower patient mortality rates, and believes that both the Scottish public and NHS staff expect every potential means of improving healthcare provision to be explored and that this issue should therefore be subject to further widespread public and political debate.
