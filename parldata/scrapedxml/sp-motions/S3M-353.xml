*S3M-353 Kenneth Gibson: Closure of the Hyster Forklift Plant in Irvineâ€”That the Parliament notes with deep concern the decision of the NACCO Materials Handling Group to begin a phased closure of its Hyster forklift plant in Irvine, with the loss of 220 jobs; is aware that this heavy blow to Scottish manufacturing from a company with a 50-year presence in Irvine follows on from the recent loss of over 400 jobs earlier in the year at the Simclar plants in Irvine and Kilwinning; commends ministers for immediately opening dialogue with NACCO and the workforce and ensuring that Scottish Development International and Scottish Enterprise Ayrshire follow suit; believes that concerted action has to be taken by the Scottish Government and agencies responsible to it, in conjunction with Westminster and North Ayrshire Council, not only to assist the workforce in finding alternative employment, but also in turning around the wider Ayrshire economy; considers the loss of over 14,200 manufacturing jobs, 47% of the total, in Ayrshire since 1997 to have contributed substantially to depopulation, currently predicted to reach 45,000 aged under 50 by 2024, and the economic decline of the county, with GDP per head having fallen from 75% to 67% of the Scottish average over that period, and agrees that, to ensure substantial improvement in the competitiveness of the Ayrshire economy in coming decades, substantial investment in infrastructure, together with reduced business burdens and taxation, a refocusing of the business support network, greater emphasis on education, skills and re-training, enhanced research and development, regeneration and improvement of the public realm are all absolutely essential.
