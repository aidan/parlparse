*S2M-765# Tommy Sheridan: Organ Donation Opt-out System-That the Parliament believes that it is time to introduce an organ donation opt-out system for Scotland to try to address the ongoing shortage of organs donated within our country, a shortage that leads to over 50 preventable deaths per year and undermines the quality of life for hundreds of others as they undergo medical treatment in the absence of available and healthy organs for transplants, and believes that such an organ donation opt-out system should be introduced with maximum safeguards to ensure maximum choice and information to all in Scotland who may wish, for whatever reason, to opt out of organ donation but at the same time believe that it is important to encourage organ donation as a life-saving and enhancing act of humanity.
