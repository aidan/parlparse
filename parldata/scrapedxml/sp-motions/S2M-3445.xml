S2M-3445 Chris Ballance: The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention and Iraq—That the Parliament notes that the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention binds signatories not to transfer to any nation any agents, toxins, weapons and equipment of biological and toxin warfare and provides that any nation finding another signatory in breach of this undertaking may lodge a complaint to the UN Security Council; notes that the Riegle Report to the US Senate has published evidence that the United States of America (USA) sold bacillus anthracis, clostridium botulinum, histoplasma capsulatum, brucella, melitensis and clostridium perfringens to agencies of the Iraqi Government pursuant to export licences issued by the US Department of Commerce, at a time when the USA was fully aware of the Iraqi biological warfare programme and that these exports have been fully documented; notes, in particular, that the US sales included Vollum strain anthrax, found by the Iraq Survey Group to be the strain of anthrax used in the Iraqi biological weapons programme and which, as reported in The Times on 9 August 2005, originated from a dead cow in Oxfordshire; calls on the UK Government to report these sales to the Security Council, in light of its commitment in the April 2002 Green Paper, Strengthening the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, that those at every level responsible for any breach of international law relating to the use of such weapons will be held personally accountable, and urges the Prime Minister either to lodge the necessary complaint with the Security Council or change the United Kingdom’s stated policy after an appropriate public announcement and discussion.
