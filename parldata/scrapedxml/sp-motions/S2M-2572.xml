*S2M-2572# Mark Ballard: Supermarkets Causing the Demise of Family Grocer Businesses—That the Parliament notes with concern the results of a survey published in The Grocer this week revealing alarming predictions of the ongoing demise of small local shops, where nearly 60% of shopkeepers said they would dissuade their children from following them into business; notes that the New Economics Foundation’s report, Ghost Town Britain, states that "the decline of both small shops and wholesalers is closely linked to the ever-tightening stranglehold exercised by a handful of supermarket chains over the country’s food retailing"; regrets the detrimental effect on local economies, producers and communities of the big four supermarkets’ control of 75% of food retail in the UK, and urges the Scottish Executive to take all and any steps within its powers to stop the loss of local butchers, bakers, grocers and other small-scale retailers vital to the life of our communities.
