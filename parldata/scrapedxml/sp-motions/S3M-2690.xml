*S3M-2690 Bob Doris: Welcome for Progress in Reducing Healthcare Associated Infections—That the Parliament welcomes the progress being made in reducing healthcare associated infections (HAI); notes the latest figures published by Health Protection Scotland for April to June 2008, which show Clostridium difficile cases falling by 7% and MRSA cases by 6%; recognises this as part of a trend of reduced infection rates over the last year; believes that it will build much needed confidence and trust among patients and their families; further welcomes the 22% increase in hand washing compliance to 90% in hospitals; believes that the record £54 million to tackle HAI, including a national MRSA screening programme and new robust bi-monthly progress reports from Health Protection Scotland from early 2009, will further improve the situation, and further believes that the new Glasgow Southern General Hospital, where all patients will have individual rooms, will lead to a further step-change in how Scotland’s NHS tackles HAI and ensure that tragic cases of deaths from HAI become a thing of the past.
