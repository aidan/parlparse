*S3M-3076 Christine Grahame: To Bling or Not to Bling—That the Parliament notes the warnings of the Electrical Safety Council regarding the use of Christmas lights over the festive period both inside and outside the home, in particular that some lighting is left on for extensive periods when the house is unattended and even overnight and, while appreciating that, in moderation, festive lighting cheers up Scottish winter days and nights, welcomes the council’s safety campaign for safe usage to ensure that the only thing that lights up is the glaur.
