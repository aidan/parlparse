*S3M-8006 Christine Grahame: Swim Team Borders—That the Parliament congratulates Swim Team Borders on its recent successes at district and national levels and the dedication of the coach, young swimmers and their families, some of whom attend nine training sessions per week; considers that proposals to close pools in the Borders would have a detrimental effect on Swim Team Borders’ progress; acknowledges the benefits to mental and physical health that come from the activity of swimming; further considers that closing pools would have a detrimental effect on the wider community, and backs Borders GPs who have voiced their strenuous opposition to any proposed closures, warning that the bill stored up for future generations in healthcare costs if exercise opportunities dwindle will dwarf current financial difficulties in the NHS and beyond.
