*S2M-417# Bristow Muldoon: Royal Mail Withdrawal from Use of Rail-That the Parliament notes with deep regret that the movement of mail by rail is due to end in Scotland on 30 September 2003; condemns the decision by Royal Mail earlier this year that brought this situation, which threatens the future of 500 jobs across the United Kingdom, about; recognises that the decision undermines the policy of the Scottish Executive which seeks to promote the increased use of freight on rail; notes with dismay that increased congestion and pollution will result from the extra lorry miles on the road network, and considers that the Executive should make further representations to Her Majesty's Government with a view to persuading Royal Mail to reverse its decision. Supported by: Mr Mark Ruskell*
