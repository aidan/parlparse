*S2M-5104.2 Tricia Marwick: Housing Stock Transfer—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5104) in the name of Colin Fox, leave out from first "calls on" to end and insert "recognises the failure of the Scottish Executive to adequately fund Scottish housing and its refusal to consider any other funding options than large-scale voluntary transfer; deplores the lack of real choice offered to Scottish tenants; condemns the Executive’s failure to deliver the promise of second-stage transfer to the tenants of Glasgow Housing Association, and calls on the Minister for Communities to make immediate representations to the UK Treasury for the write-off of local authorities’ capital housing debt without preconditions."
