 *S1M-2768 Shona Robison: Local Income Tax—That the Parliament notes that the Dundee Conservative Councillor, Neil Powrie, an avowed Thatcherite, has slated his own party’s attitude to the Council Tax; further notes that he has congratulated the self-styled Marxist, Tommy Sheridan of the Scottish Socialist Party, for bringing forward an alternative to the Council Tax; wonders whether this is a sign of the new politics that Scotland was promised following the establishment of the Scottish Parliament, and pledges support for the idea of a Local Income Tax based on the ability to pay.
