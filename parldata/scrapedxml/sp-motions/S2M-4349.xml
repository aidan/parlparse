*S2M-4349# Helen Eadie: NHS Fife - UK Example of Best Practice in Rheumatic Diseases—That the Parliament notes that inflammatory arthritis covers a number of chronic and debilitating diseases of which rheumatoid arthritis is the most common and that these conditions turn everyday activities into painful and almost insurmountable challenges; welcomes the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society’s "Everyday Everests" campaign in Scotland which raises awareness of the issues faced by rheumatoid arthritis patients; recognises that over 52,000 people in Scotland are living with the condition; is encouraged by the development of innovative new medicines which can transform the lives of patients and their families; congratulates NHS Fife, which has been highlighted as having a rheumatology disease unit which is an example of best practice within the United Kingdom as the rheumatology unit has organised its staffing resources well by employing physiotherapists, podiatrists, occupational nurses, specialist nurses and psychologists, providing easy access and sharing of offices with consultants so that patient case conferences are simplified; is gratified that the UK National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society has highlighted the Fife Rheumatology Disease Unit as an example of best practice in the UK, and hopes that the Scottish Executive will take action to ensure that this best practice is shared with other NHS boards and that all patients in Scotland can benefit from the best and most up-to-date treatments.
