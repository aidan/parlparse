*S3M-8218 Kenneth Gibson: Labour’s Legacy of Economic Disparity—That the Parliament condemns the legacy of the Labour Party’s 1997 to 2010 UK administration for increasing economic disparity in Britain; considers that Labour government to have hugely increased the gap between the UK’s richest and poorest regions and nations; recognises that UK GDP per person of poorest and richest regions is spanned by a greater discrepancy than that in France, Germany, Italy and the United States, as explained in the 12 March 2011 issue of The Economist; is appalled that the GDP per head in central London is over nine times that in parts of Wales; considers that the social mobility report by the former Labour Secretary of State for Health, Alan Milburn, shows that Labour failed to provide social and educational equality while it was in power, and believes that discrepancies in productivity, education, income and financial independence across the UK strengthen the argument for an independent Scotland with control over its own resources and economy.
