 *S2M-4418 Maureen Macmillan: Electric Shock Collars—That the Parliament condemns the use and sale of electric shock collars to train and control dogs; notes that a wide range of animal welfare organisations, veterinary surgeons, respected dog trainers and behaviour experts call for the sale and use of electric shock collars to be prohibited in Scotland; further notes that the use of electric collars for both police and military dogs is already subject to a voluntary ban; considers the use of such devices to be cruel and unnecessary; understands that alternative positive training methods produce dogs which are trained more quickly and reliably with no potential for abuse or cruelty, and calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce a complete ban on the sale and use of electric shock collars in Scotland under the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Bill.
