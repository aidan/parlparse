*S3M-3443♦ Cathy Peattie: Advanced Driving—That the Parliament notes that most road accidents are caused by driver error and therefore are potentially avoidable; further notes that significant improvements in driver safety can be achieved through advanced driving courses, especially in respect of observation and hazard awareness skills; recognises that a better driving technique can reduce fuel consumption and vehicle maintenance and insurance costs, benefiting both the driver and the environment; commends the work of the Institute of Advanced Motorists and in particular the Forth Valley (Stirling) Group that, with sponsorship from Ineos, are offering an advanced driving course targeted at young drivers, which is more comprehensive and considerably cheaper than the Pass Plus course, and believes that there is enormous potential in advanced driving courses with benefits that far outweigh the costs, that the extension and wider availability of such schemes should be supported and that young and inexperienced drivers should be encouraged to participate.
