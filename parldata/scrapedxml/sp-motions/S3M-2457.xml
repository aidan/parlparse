*S3M-2457 Mr Frank McAveety: Tackling Slum Housing in Govanhill—That the Parliament welcomes the £2 million additional funding to be provided by Glasgow City Council to tackle poor quality housing in Govanhill; wishes the new task force, headed by Environmental Services Director, Robert Booth, all the best in dealing with such an important problem; notes the desire of all residents in Govanhill to ensure that their area can be improved; calls on all agencies in the area to work with local residents to deal with persistent problems such as street litter, antisocial behaviour and poor housing; further notes the need to deal with slum landlords, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with the city council to develop a coherent strategy on reducing the negative impact of such landlords and to find new money to invest in removing below tolerable standard housing once and for all in Govanhill.
