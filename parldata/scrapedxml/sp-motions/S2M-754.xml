*S2M-754# Donald Gorrie: National Celebrations on St Andrew’s Day—That the Parliament believes that many aspects of Scottish life would benefit from the adoption of St Andrew’s Day as a holiday and day of national celebration; recognises the value that similar national days, such as Thanksgiving Day in the United States of America, bring to other countries, and considers that the Parliament and the Scottish Executive should work with all relevant bodies to make St Andrew’s Day a forum for educational, cultural and sporting activity, family reunions, community events, the promotion of tourism and Scottish products abroad and for developing existing celebrations of Scottish life held abroad.
