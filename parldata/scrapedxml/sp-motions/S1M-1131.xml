*S1M-1131 Tommy Sheridan: Lewis Offshore-That the Parliament believes that the proposed public auction on 14 September 2000 of vital oil fabrication equipment belonging to Lewis Offshore at their Arnish yard in the Western Isles amounts to asset-stripping at the expense of the workers employed at the yard and represents a major blow to the economy of the Western Isles; further believes that the proposed sale of these assets makes a nonsense of grants previously awarded to the industry by Highlands and Islands Enterprise and of the £100,000 provided for the retraining of staff since the closure of the yard; calls upon the Receivers to cancel the auction, and, pending negotiation of a settlement by public funding, calls for Lewis Offshore to be retained as a public asset for such time in the future when the oil fabrication industry picks up again.
