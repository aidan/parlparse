 *S2M-3782# Christine Grahame: Borders Carers Crisis—That the Parliament recognises the essential and unsung role of many young people who act as carers, young people who require our support; notes that there are currently 180 such young people supported by the Borders Young Carers Project in Galashiels, although 300 young carers have been identified; further notes that their age ranges from 6 to 18 and that they are among the most vulnerable young people with 42% of referrals from social work, 20% from health and 10% from education services; recognises that the Princess Royal Trust for Carers has recently estimated that there are approximately 2,000 young carers in the Scottish Borders alone; is alarmed that the current shortfall for generic work is some £64,000 and some £28,000 for drug and alcohol work, and believes that the Scottish Executive should liaise with the appropriate agencies in the Scottish Borders to provide adequate and secure funding for this essential service.
