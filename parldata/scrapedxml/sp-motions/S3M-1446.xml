*S3M-1446 Elaine Smith: General Education Department at Coatbridge College—That the Parliament notes the proposal to close the General Education Department at Coatbridge College; believes that this would be a retrograde step in the provision of further education to the communities served by the college, many of whom suffer from high levels of deprivation; further notes that redundancy packages have been offered to the staff despite assurances that a consultation period was underway, and believes that the whole proposal should be shelved immediately to allow proper consultation and debate, reflecting on the long-term impact of removing these crucial learning opportunities from the communities that the college serves.
