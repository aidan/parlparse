 *S2M-5085 Tommy Sheridan: White Poppies for Peace in the Parliament—That the Parliament asks the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to reconsider authorising only one charity, the Earl Haig Fund Scotland (Scottish Poppy Appeal), to distribute red poppies in the Parliament and to allow the Peace Pledge Union fund to distribute white poppies as well; notes that the white poppies for peace first appeared 73 years ago on Armistice Day 1933, calling for conflicts to be resolved without violence and with justice; further notes that, since the end of the Great War, there have been over 300 wars and that the white poppy is a painful reminder of the world’s failure to prevent war, and acknowledges that, while the Earl Haig Fund Scotland was founded in 1921 with the aim of providing practical help in time of need to all who served in the armed forces and their dependents, there is still a place for the white poppy as a symbol of remembrance and disarmament, working for peace without violence. Supported by: Campbell Martin*, Marlyn Glen*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Patrick Harvie*, Eleanor Scott*, Christine Grahame*
