 *S2M-964 Patrick Harvie: Maryhill Citizens Advice Bureau's Initiative for Asylum Seekers-That the Parliament applauds a radical new initiative to integrate asylum seekers into a deprived area of Glasgow by Maryhill Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB); welcomes the news that Maryhill CAB is poised to embark upon an 18-month drive to recruit refugees as volunteer CAB advisers; notes that up to 80% of the refugees the Bureau sees are professionals such as doctors, teachers, accountants and bankers; offers its congratulations to this project, which is backed by the European Social Fund and is the culmination of almost two years work by Citizens Advice Scotland, Maryhill CAB and other Glasgow bureaux; calls upon the Executive to encourage similar projects throughout Scotland, and believes that such attempts to bring the energy and skills of asylum seekers into Scottish life are a welcome change from the authoritarian treatment that asylum seekers receive. Supported by: Eleanor Scott*, Nicola Sturgeon*, Chris Ballance*, Frances Curran*, Carolyn Leckie*, Mr Stewart Maxwell*
