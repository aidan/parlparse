*S2M-3974# Mike Rumbles: Neurosurgery Services in North-East Scotland—That the Parliament notes with concern proposals outlined by the Minister for Health and Community Care to concentrate neurosurgery services on "a single prime site"; considers that such a move would be detrimental to patients and their families who currently access neurosurgery services at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI); notes the consistently excellent treatment given at ARI, and believes that the Scottish Executive should reconsider its proposals and retain all neurosurgery services currently provided at ARI.
