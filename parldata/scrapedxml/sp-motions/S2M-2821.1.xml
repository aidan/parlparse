 * S2M-2821.1 Jeremy Purvis: Identity Cards Bill—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2821) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from “outlined” to end and insert “only noted and did not oppose the previous Identity Cards Bill and was so vague that Miss Annabel Goldie MSP could say: “Although Conservatives support the principle of ID cards, we have a great deal of sympathy with the Green party motion”; notes the consistent opposition to these proposals by Liberal Democrats in the House of Commons on the grounds that they will be ineffective in their stated aim of reducing terrorism; believes that there is an excessive cost to the individual and the taxpayer in introducing identity cards; believes that they will lead to increased discrimination and harassment; is concerned for the protection of civil liberties with the lack of definition of how the cards will be used; further believes that the UK Government should explore more effective anti identity and benefits fraud, illegal immigration and illegal working measures; is further concerned with the UK Government’s intention that by 2013 it will be compulsory for UK citizens to possess an ID card and to produce it when accessing designated public services, and welcomes the commitment by the Scottish Executive that identity cards will not be necessary for accessing devolved services.” Supported by: Robert Brown*
