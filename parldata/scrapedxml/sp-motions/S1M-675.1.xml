*S1M-675.1 Alex Johnstone: Genetic Modification Science—As an amendment to motion (S1M-675) in the name of Susan Deacon, leave out from "commends" to end and insert "and, while recognising the excellence of the Scottish biotechnology industry and the benefits that GM technology has the potential to provide, calls upon the Scottish Executive to delay the recently announced farm scale trials until evidence from previous scientific tests, proving beyond any reasonable doubt that such trials pose no threat to the environment or public health, has been thoroughly evaluated by a range of independent assessors and placed in the public domain."
