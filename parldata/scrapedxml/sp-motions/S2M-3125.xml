 *S2M-3125 Chris Ballance: Refugee Status and Leave to Remain in the UK—That the Parliament is concerned at the proposal in the UK Government’s five-year strategy for asylum and immigration to end the practice of granting indefinite leave to remain in the United Kingdom to people who are given refugee status and to replace this with up to five years’ temporary leave to remain in the country; believes that, while this may not be legally incompatible with the provisions of the 1951 Geneva Convention, it is a retrograde step as it reverses the policy of granting indefinite leave introduced by the Government in 1998 without any evidence that problems have arisen as a result of the current policy or that other countries which grant only temporary leave benefit as a result; is further concerned that the uncertain position this will put refugees in is totally inconsistent with other Government policies to assist the integration of refugees in the UK; believes that this will inevitably lead to inhumane decisions when refugee families with children are threatened with removal after living in the UK for several years and establishing family life, leading in turn to further pressure on the immigration appeals system and the caseload of MSPs, and urges the Government to abandon this unnecessary change.
