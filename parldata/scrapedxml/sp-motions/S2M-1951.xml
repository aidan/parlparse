 *S2M-1951 Pauline McNeill: Teenage Kicks - A Tribute to John Peel for Children in Need—That the Parliament mourns the passing of John Peel, widely regarded as singularly the most important DJ in radio history; notes that, since the 1960s, his show has been listened to by generations of music fans and musicians and that it was the one place independent music could be heard irrespective of marketing power or hype; believes that Peel was a taste-maker and trend-setter, championing punk, techno and introducing his audience to music that challenged artistic and commercial values; applauds the open door Peel provided for a flood of new talent, offering sessions to many Scottish artists as diverse as Belle and Sebastian, Degrassi, Primal Scream, Ivor Cutler, the Delgados, AC Acoustics, Bis, Mogwai, Travis, Boards of Canada, Aereogramme, Arab Strap, the Aphrodisiacs, the Jesus and Mary Chain and was instrumental in their gaining artistic or commercial success; notes that, more significantly, John Peel made bands feel important, loved new music and had the independent strength of character to resist being told what to put on his play-list; believes that his warmth and compassion will be truly missed and were such that, on occasion, he would even invite young, struggling bands to his home and cook for them; further believes that John Peel was the true spirit of free, independent radio, that he played what he loved, irrespective of commercial considerations, and that it would be tragic if this legacy of freedom was not handed down by the BBC to another presenter, and considers that MSPs should support the efforts of New Music In Scotland (NEMIS) and bands and supporters from all over Scotland to put together John Peel tribute gigs in the days running up to 19 November 2004 for Children in Need. Supported by: Donald Gorrie*
