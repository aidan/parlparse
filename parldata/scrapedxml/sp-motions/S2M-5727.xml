 *S2M-5727 Shiona Baird: Micropower and SPP6—That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Executive is currently finalising Scottish Planning Policy 6 (SPP 6) on renewable energy; believes that small-scale renewables have considerable potential to reduce carbon emissions from buildings and therefore should be given the Executive’s full support; further notes that more than 80 councils in England have successfully required the installation of small-scale renewables in new developments and have helped reduce climate change emissions from new buildings as a result; also believes that the Executive should set bold and ambitious targets for reduction in CO2 emissions from new buildings, and therefore calls on the Executive to require that all new buildings, regardless of size, reduce their predicted CO2 emissions by at least 20% over building regulations standards, while supporting local authorities who set more ambitious targets.
