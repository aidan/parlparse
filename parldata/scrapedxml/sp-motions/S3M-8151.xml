*S3M-8151 Helen Eadie: Parliament Questions Behaviour of Minister—That the Parliament expresses its disappointment that the Minister for Housing and Communities has made an announcement about funding the Coalfields Regeneration Trust (CRT) for one year only at the current level of expenditure; understands that the minister has called on the CRT to provide three business plans with two predicated on what it considers severe cuts in funding; is concerned to learn of allegations that the minister phoned and berated a worker of a voluntary organisation in the coalmining communities; believes that such behaviour would be inappropriate, and considers that no parliamentarian of any rank should resort to it.
