*S2M-2476 Frances Curran: Freedom for Sandra Bakutzâ€”That the Parliament deplores the arrest and imprisonment of the Austrian human rights activist, Sandra Bakutz, by the Turkish authorities when she visited the country to observe an ongoing trial there; notes that the authorities in Turkey continue to carry out human rights abuses including torture and imprisonment of political opponents despite claiming to have taken "giant steps towards democratisation" as part of the process of EU membership; declares that solidarity, internationalism and defending the rights of oppressed people are not crimes; further notes that Sandra Bakutz is due to appear in court in Turkey on 24 February 2005, and calls for her immediate release.
