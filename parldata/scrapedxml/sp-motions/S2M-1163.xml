*S2M-1163 Rosie Kane: Environmental Audit-That the Parliament notes the report of Her Majesty's Government's Sustainable Development Commission into the government's environmental policy and condemns outright the fact that Her Majesty's Government has failed to agree a 60% reduction in road and air emissions, has continued in its environmentally-damaging road building policy which if unchecked will result in a 25% increase in the volume of traffic in the next seven years, has failed to introduce European directives on waste with the result that waste production has increased faster than recycling, has failed to tackle poverty with more than 3.5 million children still living in poverty, has failed to promote good health with both obesity and asthma levels increasing and has failed to tackle the growing housing shortage with most housing unaffordable for young people.
