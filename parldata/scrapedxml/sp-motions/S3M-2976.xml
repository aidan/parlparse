*S3M-2976 Robert Brown: Age of Criminal Responsibility in Scotland—That the Parliament notes the comments made by the Lord Advocate to the Justice Committee, at its meeting on 25 November 2008, on the age of criminal responsibility in Scotland; believes that prosecuting children as young as eight in the adult courts is highly inappropriate and that such cases should always be dealt with by the children’s hearing system, which can put in place appropriate arrangements to tackle the root causes of offending and criminality in children, including detention in secure accommodation in the most serious cases where such a decision is in the public interest; notes that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has called for the age of criminal responsibility in Scotland to be raised; notes that this age is 15 in Scandinavian countries and ranges from 13 to 18 in most other European countries, and urges the Scottish Government to consult as soon as possible on the implications of raising the age of criminal responsibility in Scotland and otherwise complying with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
