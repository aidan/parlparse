*S2M-2613 Rosie Kane: Stop the M74—That the Parliament reaffirms the principles of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; notes and recognises the primacy of Article 3, the right to life; acknowledges that clean water, clean air and adequate nourishment are essential for human life; further acknowledges that any individual or organisation that prevents the access of another individual to clean water, clean air or adequate nourishment is clearly in breach of that person’s human rights; accepts that the M74 extension will prevent access to clean air for the communities affected by the road and thus that the Scottish Executive is breaching the human rights of its own citizens, and therefore calls on the Executive to stop its plans for this road extension immediately.
