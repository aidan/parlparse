 *S2M-78 Pauline McNeill: Official Visit by Delegates from the Palestinian Authority, 26-28 June 2003—That the Parliament welcomes the official visit to the Scottish Parliament by a delegation from the Palestinian Authority from 26 to 28 June 2003, organised by the British Council; notes that the Palestinian Authority is the official legislative body of the Palestinian people; recognises that the development of democracy and administrative organisation in the Palestinian Authority can benefit greatly from co-operation of the Scottish Parliament and hopes that this visit will represent only the beginning of a positive and practical relationship with the Palestinian Authority; further recognises the extremely difficult circumstances in which the Palestinian Authority must operate, particularly the on-going occupation by the Israeli Defence Force; aspires to a settled peace in the Middle East for both the Palestinian and Israeli peoples; considers that the Road Map for Peace represents an opportunity to establish an independent Palestinian state within three years; insists that the Road Map for Peace process must be a genuine attempt to meet the aspirations of the Palestinian people, including those currently with no right of return to their homeland, and calls on the Government of Israel to halt the building of illegal settlements and withdraw from the occupied territories immediately.
