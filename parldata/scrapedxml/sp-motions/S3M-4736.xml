 *S3M-4736 Ms Wendy Alexander: Lance Armstrong Cycles into Paisley—That the Parliament notes the recent visit of seven-times winner of the Tour de France, Lance Armstrong, to Paisley and his invitation to local cyclists to join him; further notes that he issued the invitation via his Twitter page which led to between 200 and 300 riders, including cycling star Graeme Obree, joining this Renfrewshire cycle; welcomes the very positive publicity for Paisley brought about by this impromptu visit, and hopes that it will encourage others to visit local attractions like Paisley Abbey, Weaver’s Cottage in Kilbarchan and the Lochwinnoch RSPB reserve.
