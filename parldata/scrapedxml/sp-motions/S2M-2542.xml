 *S2M-2542 Pauline McNeill: 21 April 2005 - Anniversary of Mordechai Vanunu’s Release from Prison—That the Parliament welcomes the broad support in Scotland for the human rights of Mordechai Vanunu, who was imprisoned by the Israeli government for 18 years for exposing Israel’s nuclear weapons programme and is currently under house arrest and denied access to foreign media; notes that, since his election as Rector of the University of Glasgow, many more people have become aware of his case; congratulates Vanunu for his sustained opposition to weapons of mass destruction and his support for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state; further notes that the Israeli Supreme Court will review the restrictions placed on Vanunu on 21 April 2005, the anniversary of his release from prison, and firmly believes that, having served 18 years in prison, Vanunu should be released from all restrictions and be given the freedom to serve as the Rector of the University of Glasgow.
