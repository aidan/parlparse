*S2M-3278.2 Mr Adam Ingram: Quality Teachers for the 21st Century—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3278) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from "the significant" to end and insert "that Scottish teachers are the key drivers for excellence in our education system; further recognises that there will be a continuing need for significant investment in teacher recruitment and induction, initial teacher education and continuous professional development; notes the challenging nature of the Scottish Executive’s pledge to increase teacher numbers to 53,000 by 2007, given that 40% of Scottish teachers are due to retire in the next 10 years; is concerned that the recruitment of mathematics teachers is falling behind targets, threatening promised class-size reductions; commends the work of the General Teaching Council for Scotland in developing quality teaching, and calls on the Executive to fully fund the initial part of the chartered teacher programme for all Scottish teachers".
