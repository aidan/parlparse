*S3M-6852Sandra White:Footprints for Peaceâ€”That the Parliament notes the International Peace Walk Towards a Nuclear Free Future from 31 July to 29 August 2010, which plans to follow the routes of the nuclear warhead convoys in Scotland; supports the calls for an inquiry into the transportation of nuclear weapons across communities, given the danger that it is believed that these convoys pose to the people and environment; notes that the Ministry of Defence has a policy of neither confirming nor denying (NCD) the presence or absence of nuclear weapons and considers that this NCD policy impacts on the ability of the emergency services to respond to any emergency; further notes that the peace walkers aim to complete the final phase of their 330 mile walk on Saturday 28 August when they will set off from Portobello Town Hall at 8.00 am to reach Edinburgh City Chambers by 10.30 am, and encourages all those opposed to nuclear weapons and their transportation across and stationing on Scottish soil to show their support by attending the last leg of the journey.
