*S2M-3775 Jackie Baillie: Scotland’s Enterprising Spirit—That the Parliament welcomes the renewed joint commitment between the Scottish Executive and the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) to promote the Scotch whisky industry; commends the launch of the Scotland’s Enterprising Spirit partnership which sets out the economic importance of Scotch whisky and identifies areas of Executive and industry co-operation including growing exports, ensuring a fair tax and regulatory burden and encouraging tourism and sustainable development; notes that this initiative builds on the positive news earlier in the year that Scotch whisky exports have risen to over £1,000 million in the first six months of 2005, the highest level since 1997; welcomes this increased growth in key markets such as China, India and Russia, underlining the world-wide importance of the industry; further welcomes the Memorandum of Understanding between the SWA and HM Revenue and Customs, a landmark agreement to tackle spirits fraud; acknowledges the instrumental role in securing such an agreement played by the Westminster All-Party Parliamentary Scotch Whisky and Spirits Group, led by John McFall MP, and strongly believes that the interests of the Scotch whisky industry have been well served by the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty’s Government and, not least, by Her Majesty’s Treasury, which has frozen spirit duty since 1997.
