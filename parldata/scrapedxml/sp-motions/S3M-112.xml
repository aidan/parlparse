*S3M-112# Liam McArthur: European Marine Energy Centre - Stromness—That the Parliament recognises the significant international role played by the European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in the advancement of tidal and wave energy technologies, offering developers the opportunity to test prototype devices in unrivalled wave and tidal conditions; notes that EMEC is the first centre of its kind to be created anywhere in the world and achieved a world first when Pelamis generated energy for the National Grid from EMEC’s wave test site; further notes the growing cluster of renewable energy companies setting up in Orkney and the plans for the world’s largest commercial wave energy farm off Orkney, which together demonstrate the commercial opportunities that EMEC provides; believes that 100% of Scotland’s electricity should come from renewable sources by 2050 and that wave and tidal power can make a considerable contribution towards this goal while also offering major business opportunities for Scotland, and believes that generous and sustained support to EMEC in Orkney is necessary to ensure that Scotland meets its marine energy potential and maintains its world lead in marine renewable energy.
