*S2M-3749 Cathie Craigie: Breaking the Sound Barrier—That the Parliament supports RNID’s "Breaking the Sound Barrier" campaign; notes with concern figures quoted in the campaign which highlight that one-in-seven people in Scotland currently have some form of hearing loss; welcomes the aims and objectives of the campaign of challenging myths that loss of hearing is only associated with infirmity and age and of encouraging more people to have their hearing tested; supports the campaign’s efforts to tackle denial of hearing loss by creating opportunities for simple self-assessment, such as the hearing test line, and welcomes television adverts persuading family, friends, employers and colleagues to encourage and support those who could benefit.
