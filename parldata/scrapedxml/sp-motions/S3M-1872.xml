*S3M-1872 Cathy Peattie: Edinburgh Scots Music Group—That the Parliament is extremely disappointed that the Scottish Arts Council has withdrawn funding from the award-winning Edinburgh Scots Music Group (SMG); notes that the group was formed in 1990 out of Edinburgh Adult Learning Project’s education and community development process and that the SMG has taught traditional music song and dance to literally thousands of adults over almost two decades, making a vital contribution to bringing the tradition back into the heart of community and cultural life in Scotland; further notes that SMG was voted Community Project of the Year at the BBC Radio Scotland Traditional Music Awards in November 2007; believes that the Scottish Arts Council should fund the maintenance of traditional forms, continuing successful and popular initiatives and voluntary organisations that are delivering all this and creating and maintaining participative traditional arts in communities, and further believes that the Scottish Government should ensure that Scottish cultural policy explicitly states the importance of such funding.
