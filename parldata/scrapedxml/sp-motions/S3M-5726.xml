*S3M-5726 Jim Hume: Improved Dumfries and Galloway Social Enterprise—That the Parliament welcomes the improved links between businesses and social enterprises in the Dumfries area; further welcomes the recent Community of Business Exhibition in Dumfries, which was organised by Dumfries and Galloway Chamber of Commerce, Dumfries and Galloway Social Enterprise Network and the Scottish Social Enterprise Coalition; recognises that this was an opportunity for local businesses to find out more about social enterprise, which is now estimated to add around £2 billion to the Scottish economy every year, and commends all parties for looking to develop the social enterprise sector in the South of Scotland.
