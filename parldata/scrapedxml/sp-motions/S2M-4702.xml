*S2M-4702 Christine Grahame: Selkirk’s Silver Arrow Returns—That the Parliament welcomes the return of Selkirk’s Silver Arrow to its name place on 29 August 2006, where it will be handed over to the current sheriff, Sheriff Drummond; notes that this is highly appropriate given that this 350-year-old arrow was delivered in 1818 by the then sheriff of Selkirk, Sir Walter Scott, into the hands of the Royal Company of Archers, and congratulates all who have contributed to its return.
