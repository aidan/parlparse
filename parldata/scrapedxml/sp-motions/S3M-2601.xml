*S3M-2601 Sarah Boyack: Edinburgh’s Citizens Advice Bureaux—That the Parliament notes with deep concern the decision of Citizens Advice Edinburgh (CAE) to close four CAB offices across the city, specifically in Pilton, Leith, Fountainbridge and Portobello; appreciates that CAE both regrets this decision and considers it to be a direct consequence of inadequate funding from the City of Edinburgh Council; understands that the funding settlement has always been tight and believes that relevant constituency and regional MSPs have always supported CAE and the invaluable services that it offers to communities across Edinburgh; is deeply concerned about the impact of centralising these services for individuals who have mobility or financial difficulties believing that an expansion of online facilities automatically excludes a significant proportion of users who are neither computer literate nor have ready access to computer facilities; further believes that this development is an unacceptable alternative to frontline advice services, and resolves to work together to reverse this shocking cut to vital local services.
