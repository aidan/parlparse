*S2M-5800 Ms Sandra White: Fears Over Retention of DNA from Innocent People—That the Parliament believes that the permanent retention of DNA from innocent people is something which was debated and rejected through proper parliamentary procedures and that such parliamentary decisions should be respected; expresses regret that Scottish Labour’s election manifesto will call for this measure to be introduced even though there is no evidence that the retention of innocent people’s DNA is effective in solving crime, and calls on the Scottish Executive to uphold the wishes of the Parliament while looking at more effective means of tackling crime.
