*S1M-790.1 Kay Ullrich: Services for Elderly and Disabled People—As an amendment to motion (S1M-790) in the name of David Mundell, leave out from first "that many" to end and insert "the failure of successive Conservative and New Labour Governments in Westminster and of the Scottish Executive in Holyrood to provide adequately for elderly and disabled citizens in Scotland; condemns the cuts in grants to Scottish local authorities which have undermined much of the good work being carried out throughout Scotland at a local level; supports greater guidance being given to local authorities to ensure that money intended for the provision of community care and other services for the elderly and disabled is channelled into those areas and not diverted into other sectors of local authority spending; urges real joint working and partnership between central and local agencies, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to implement in full those aspects of the Royal Commission into Long Term Care of the Elderly which fall within the scope of the Parliament." Supported by: Mr Duncan Hamilton*, Shona Robison*, Dorothy-Grace Elder*
