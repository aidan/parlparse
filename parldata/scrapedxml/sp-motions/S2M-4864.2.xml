*S2M-4864.2 Carolyn Leckie: Trident—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4864) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, insert at end "believes that the policy of nuclear deterrence is a failed policy; acknowledges that some countries believe that the only way they can protect themselves against British and American aggression is to acquire nuclear weaponry; believes that Scotland and other European countries will not be shielded from the effects of a limited nuclear war even if the US mainland is; is gravely concerned that the people of Scotland are forced, against their will, to live with a devastatingly destructive nuclear arsenal at Faslane, only 30 minutes’ drive from the centre of Glasgow; is further concerned that this nuclear base makes Scotland a target for a direct nuclear or terrorist strike; is opposed to the presence of nuclear warheads on Scottish soil; congratulates organisations such as Scottish CND and Trident Ploughshares on their campaigning for immediate, unilateral nuclear disarmament, and calls for the existing weapons of mass destruction located in Scotland to be scrapped immediately."
