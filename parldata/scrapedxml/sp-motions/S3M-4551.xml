 S3M-4551 Bill Wilson: Israel Must Release Kidnapped Human Rights Observers—That the Parliament notes reports of Israel’s threats towards and subsequent interception of the Spirit of Humanity, an unarmed boat carrying aid to Gaza, and of its apparent kidnapping of the human rights observers aboard, among whom was the Scot, Theresa McDermott; calls on Israel to release all of the detained people immediately, compensate them and allow the aid into Gaza; applauds all of those attempting to break the siege of Gaza in order to deliver such much-needed aid to the people trapped there; condemns Israel’s apparent disregard for human rights and international law; believes that Israel’s ongoing flouting of international norms in this and other ways does nothing to make that country safer, and calls on the international community to take concerted action to put pressure on Israel to conduct itself according to such norms, which conduct it believes would be in the interests of its own people as well as those of Palestinians. Supported by: Hugh O’Donnell, Bill Kidd, Mike Pringle*
