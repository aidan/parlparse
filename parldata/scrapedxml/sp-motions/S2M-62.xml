*S2M-62 Rosie Kane: Stereotyping of Young Peopleâ€”That the Parliament rejects the use of the word "ned" in relation to young people as a degrading and hurtful term; is aware that ned means "non-educated delinquent" and is therefore very inappropriate language which should always be avoided particularly by elected representatives, and further notes that negative language of this sort, were it used in relation to any other section of society, would be considered an "ism" and would be condemned.
