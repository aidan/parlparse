*S3M-7547 Fiona Hyslop: Scotland Bill—That the Parliament welcomes the introduction of the Scotland Bill in the House of Commons on 30 November 2010; notes that it is based on the recommendations of the Commission on Scottish Devolution, which were presented to the Parliament in June 2009, and supports the general principles of the Bill in conferring more powers and responsibilities on the Parliament; further notes that proposals in the Bill and the United Kingdom Government’s Command Paper, Strengthening Scotland’s Future, are intended to contribute to the implementation of these principles; recognises the significant nature of the proposals and the proposed new system of funding devolved government in Scotland and the need for the Scottish Parliament to scrutinise fully the Legislative Consent Memorandum, the Bill and accompanying documents, and looks forward to the report by the Scotland Bill Committee so that the Scottish Parliament can come to a decision on these proposals after ensuring they are in the interests of Scotland.
