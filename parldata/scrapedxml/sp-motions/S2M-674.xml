*S2M-674# Cathy Peattie: 7:84 Theatre Company-That the Parliament congratulates the 7:84 Theatre Company (Scotland) on the many ground-breaking achievements in the first 30 years of its operation; commends its philosophy of bringing touring productions and participatory outreach work to areas of geographic and social isolation; notes, however, that the company will struggle to survive if it loses its Scottish Arts Council funding from March 2005, and believes that the Scottish Executive should investigate the situation affecting 7:84 and other similar theatre companies.
