*S2M-223 Rosie Kane: Student Support of Democracy in Iran-That the Parliament expresses its support to students currently demonstrating on behalf of democracy in Iran and applauds the brave stance that they are taking; notes the commemoration of the students in Iran who died or were injured whilst demonstrating four years ago; believes strongly that these students should be welcomed into this country and given a safe and secure home for so long as they wish to stay, and calls for proper resources and aid to be made available to groups aiding asylum seekers.
