 *S3M-3343 Jackie Baillie: Save Our Libraries—That the Parliament is deeply concerned with the proposals by Argyll and Bute Council to close all outlying libraries in Helensburgh and Lomond as part of a budget cut; notes that Cardross, Cove, Rosneath, Tarbet and Garelochhead libraries are all well used by local residents; believes that libraries are central to our communities and provide a range of educational opportunities; acknowledges their significant role in promoting literacy; supports the Save Our Libraries campaign, and believes that Argyll and Bute Council should withdraw these proposals.
