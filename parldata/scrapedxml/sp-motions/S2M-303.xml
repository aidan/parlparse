 *S2M-303# Sarah Boyack: Scottish Natural Heritage—That the Parliament supports the Scottish Executive's policy on the relocation of public sector jobs as announced by the then First Minister on 15 September 1999 and notes in particular that the policy states that decisions on location should promote efficiency and effectiveness, that organisations should be close to the communities they serve and that decisions should take into account costs, operational effectiveness and the position of staff concerned; notes that widespread concerns have been raised regarding the decision to relocate Scottish Natural Heritage (SNH) headquarters from Edinburgh to Inverness; further notes with dismay the issue of two ministerial directions in relation to this move; considers therefore that the Executive should work with the SNH Board and relevant trade unions to avoid the imposition of compulsory redundancies and ensure that the requirement in the ministerial directions for a continued SNH base in Edinburgh meets the operational requirements of SNH and enables SNH to continue to meet its core function of protecting Scotland’s natural heritage, and considers that the issue requires an independent inquiry so that future lessons can be learnt.
