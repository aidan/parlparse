*S3M-5629 Ken Macintosh: Holocaust Memorial Day 2010—That the Parliament notes 27 January 2010 as Holocaust Memorial Day and urges all Scots to unite in remembering the victims and survivors of the Holocaust; recognises that the lessons learned from the tragedy of the Holocaust are of fundamental importance for successive generations; believes that continued vigilance and opposition to discrimination, persecution and racism is vital if such terrible events are to be prevented from ever happening again; also wishes, however, to celebrate the legacy of hope provided by those who survived and those who helped others survive; particularly wishes to remember the Rev Ernest Levy from Giffnock, a survivor of Auschwitz Birkenau and Bergen-Belsen who died last year; notes that, despite enduring appalling suffering during the Holocaust, the Rev Levy never lost his warmth or humanity and devoted himself to educating others, and believes that the best way to remember and pay tribute to Holocaust survivors like Ernest Levy is to ensure that their inspiring stories continues to be told to future generations.
