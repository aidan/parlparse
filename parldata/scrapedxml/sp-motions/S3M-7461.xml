*S3M-7461♦ Elaine Murray: Keep the Post Public—That the Parliament supports the campaign organised by the Keep The Post Public Coalition opposing the part-privatisation of the Royal Mail; believes that the UK Government’s plans threaten the continuation of the universal service obligation and will lead to reduced services and discriminatory charges in rural areas; believes that privatisation will also result in the closure of post offices throughout Scotland; congratulates the Communications Workers Union for proposing an alternative business model, which it considers would allow the Royal Mail to remain in the public sector; notes the widespread public opposition to the privatisation of the Royal Mail including that of the Conservative and Liberal Democrat-led Dumfries and Galloway Council, which voted to keep the post public at its meeting of 18 November 2010, and would welcome further votes against these plans across Scotland. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
