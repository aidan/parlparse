 *S3M-7595 Sandra White: Cut the VAT on Building Repairs—That the Parliament supports calls from the Federation of Master Builders Scotland for the UK Government to reduce the rate of value added tax (VAT) to 5% on construction repair and improvement work to existing buildings; believes that reducing VAT on repairs and maintenance would bring a number of benefits to hard-pressed Scottish homeowners; further believes that such a reduction would encourage people to make homes more energy efficient, helping Scotland meet its Energy Efficiency Action Plan targets and, in turn, its climate change targets, and considers that a reduction in VAT would boost the Scottish construction industry and create up to 2,235 new Scottish building jobs during the first 12 months of the reduction.
