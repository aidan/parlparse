*S2M-2134# Carolyn Leckie: Freedom of Expression for Politics, Posters and Art—That the Parliament regrets the decision of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB), without consultation, to ban political posters and other expressive materials from the walls and windows of MSPs’ offices; believes in itself as a parliament, not an ornament, and that without expression of politics in various forms the Parliament has no business calling itself a parliament; further believes that the diversity of the politics of the parties represented in the Parliament is of interest to visitors and adds vitality to Scotland’s limited democratic autonomy; believes, in terms of the ethos and principles that were enshrined in the establishment of the Parliament, which include a commitment to be more open, more democratic, more diverse, more pluralistic and of the people, for the people and by the people, that the SPCB has no right to censor the political expression of legitimately elected representatives; recognises that no damage has been, or will be, caused to the fabric of the building by posters; considers that Sr Miralles would have agreed that an artwork should not be stagnant and preserved in formaldehyde, especially the parliament building as an art form, which is supposed to have grown from Scotland’s earth and Scotland’s people, and that Scotland and its people should not stand still within a sedentary edifice; believes that any suppression of such expression is surely regressive in a parliament and an art work that claims to be progressive, and therefore considers that the SPCB should reverse its recent decision and withdraw the edict.
