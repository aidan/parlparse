*S3M-4988.2 Margaret Smith: School Buildings—As an amendment to motion (S3M-4988) in the name of Rhona Brankin, insert at end "; deeply regrets the ongoing ambiguity over the future allocation of resources under the school building programme and the absolute failure of the Scottish Futures Trust (SFT); considers that the Scottish Government’s centralisation and poor handling of the school building strategy has caused serious uncertainty for local authorities and has undermined the autonomy of councils to determine their local priorities, and calls for the SFT to be scrapped immediately."
