 *S3M-3238 Jamie Hepburn: Bush Administration Admits Torture in Guantánamo Bay—That the Parliament notes the admission for the first time by an official of the Bush administration in the United States of America, as reported in The Guardian on 15 January 2009, that interrogation techniques used in Guantánamo Bay amounted to torture in the case of Mohammed al-Qahtani, who was accused of involvement in planning the attacks of 11 September 2001; expresses disappointment that the fears and accusations of many other governments and human rights organisation about abuses in the detention centre have been proved correct; calls on the Bush administration to publish full details of the interrogation techniques used on all detainees at the centre; believes it would be wrong for President Bush to grant pardons to anyone associated with authorising or conducting torture in the centre, and looks forward to President-elect Obama making good his pledge to close the centre.
