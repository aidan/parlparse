 *S3M-3555.1 Patrick Harvie: Fred Goodwin’s Pension—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3555) in the name of Hugh Henry, insert at end "considers however that successive UK and Scottish governments have enthusiastically supported financial deregulation, demutualisation, free-market dominance, the development of an obscene culture of vast salaries, bonuses and pensions in the corporate world and the creation of megabanks where once traditional financial institutions stood, and believes that politicians who have been part of this disgraceful fetishisation of finance should resign in shame rather than feign anger at the inevitable results of their own actions".
