*S2M-4745 Frances Curran: School Meals - Free and Healthy—That the Parliament welcomes the comments of Westminster education secretary Alan Johnson, reported in the breakfast news on 4 September 2006, when he highlighted the success of Hull City Council in promoting and increasing the uptake of healthy meals in schools; agrees that Hull City Council’s initiative has indeed been a huge success but notes the failure of the education secretary to mention that the crucial factor in this success was the introduction of free healthy school meals for all primary children across the city, and believes that the only way to achieve healthy eating in schools is to provide free healthy school meals for all pupils and that the statistics coming from Hull prove that this works.
