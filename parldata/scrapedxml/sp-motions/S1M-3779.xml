 *S1M-3779 Roseanna Cunningham: Reported Comments by the Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service—That the Parliament notes the recent statement of the Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service as reported in The Herald on 16 January 2003 threatening to move HM Prison Perth to Dundee in response to Perth and Kinross Council’s development control committee’s legitimately expressed concerns regarding the demolition of C Hall at the prison and saying that Dundee "would love (a prison) because a lot of prisoners come from Dundee"; believes that such comments would be deliberately confrontational and, regrettably, all too typical of the Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service’s management style, unnecessarily unsettling for the staff at HM Prison Perth and their families and outrageously disparaging of the residents of Dundee; believes that there should be an apology, and calls on the Deputy First Minister and Minister for Justice to make it clear that he would not support the closure of HM Prison Perth.
