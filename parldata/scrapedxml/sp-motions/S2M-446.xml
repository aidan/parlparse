 *S2M-446 Tommy Sheridan: Deaths of Young Servicemen and Women at Deepcut Barracks-That the Parliament notes that more than 1748 members of Her Majesty's armed forces have lost their lives through non-natural and non-combat causes since 1990, that almost 200 deaths have been caused by discharge of firearms and that some 200 of the deaths are described as self-inflicted; further notes the courage and determination of the friends and families of Sean Benton, James Collinson, Geoff Gray and Cheryl James who died at Deepcut Barracks in Surrey and the friends and families of Paul Cochrane, Ross Collins, Richard Donkin, Tony Green, Dale Little, Aled Martin Jones, Alfie Manship, Gary Riches, Richard Robertson, Alan Sharples, David Shipley and Christopher Young who have subsequently come forward to make public their own grievances and frustrations at the hands of the military authorities; believes that the Ministry of Defence response to these deaths is inadequate and distressing to the bereaved; further believes that the army has a duty of care and protection towards all personnel, particularly young soldiers, that the culture of secrecy surrounding the varied causes of these deaths must give way to greater transparency and that the environment in which these deaths continue to occur and the absence of a system for prompt, effective and independent investigation of deaths has led to a breakdown in public confidence that can only be restored through a full and independent public inquiry, and therefore resolves to urge Her Majesty's Government to establish a tribunal of inquiry without delay.
