 *S2M-1733.1 Michael Matheson: A Sporting Scotland is a Successful Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1733) in the name of Mr Frank McAveety, leave out from "the significant" to end and insert "the important contribution of sport in schools, homes, workplaces and communities across Scotland; celebrates the continuing success of Scotland’s sportsmen and women, particularly the medallists at the recent Olympics and those competing for medals at the Paralympics currently under way in Athens, of Andrew Murray at the US Open and most recently of Colin Montgomerie as part of the successful European team in the Ryder Cup, and acknowledges the economic importance of sport to the Scottish economy and calls on the Scottish Executive to demonstrate its ambition to hold major sporting events here in Scotland by supporting the call for a solo Scottish bid for the European Football Championships in 2012."
