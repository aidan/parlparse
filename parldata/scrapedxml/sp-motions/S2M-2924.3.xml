 * S2M-2924.3 Margo MacDonald: G8—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2924) in the name of Mr Tom McCabe, leave out from “showcase” to end and insert “create an opportunity to suggest practical solutions to poverty and preventable disease in Africa, will showcase Scotland to an international audience and examine and develop Scotland’s role in international development; further acknowledges the sense of pride that Scotland is hosting such a prestigious event; extends a warm welcome to all peaceful visitors who come to Scotland, and fully supports the police, the UK Government and other key partners in making the summit safe and productive.” Supported by: John Swinburne*
