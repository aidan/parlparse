 *S3M-2366 Shirley-Anne Somerville: East Africa Food Crisis Appealâ€”That the Parliament has grave concerns about the situation in East Africa where millions of people, in northern Kenya, Ethiopia, Somalia and Eritrea, are facing a serious humanitarian crisis due to widespread drought, conflict, chronic poverty and rising global food prices; notes that as a result of the crisis there is a threat to the livelihoods of landless and internally displaced communities within the region, as well as a huge risk of disease, especially in drought-affected areas with poor hygiene and sanitation; recognises the urgency for humanitarian relief but also for long-term solutions, including governments tackling the root causes of chronic poverty in the region; welcomes the work being done by aid agencies in Scotland to help people affected by this crisis, such as Oxfam through its East Africa Food Appeal, and calls on all Scots to support the appeal.
