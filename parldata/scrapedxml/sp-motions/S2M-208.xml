*S2M-208 John Swinburne: Holyrood Consensus Dayâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern some of the findings of the recently published Scottish Elections Research May-June 2003, commissioned by the Electoral Commission, and, in particular, the cynicism and apathy expressed by a large percentage of the Scottish electorate towards the Parliament and agrees, in response to the opinions expressed, to set aside a "Consensus Day" each year for the Parliament to hold debates on subjects, chosen in the usual manner, during which all MSPs will be freed from the shackles of party constraints and able to vote on issues according to their consciences.
