*S2M-2362 Tommy Sheridan: No Extradition of the NatWest Three—That the Parliament believes it is a fundamental right of any citizen to be presumed innocent until properly and legally found guilty of any crime; notes that three men, David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew, also known as the NatWest Three, have been accused of crimes of fraud within the United States of America (USA) in connection with incidents, or apparent incidents, which allegedly took place in Britain; believes that it is therefore essential that any criminal trial against these three men takes place in Britain and that the UK Government resists any attempt to extradite these men to a country where a fair trial is much less likely to take place, and therefore calls on the Home Office to refuse to extradite David Bermingham, Giles Darby and Gary Mulgrew to the USA and to ensure that any criminal prosecution is heard in a British court, consistent with the comment of Caroline Flint MP on 23 June 2003 when she said "the trial should take place in the country where the crime is alleged to have been committed".
