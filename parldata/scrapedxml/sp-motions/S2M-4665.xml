*S2M-4665 Brian Adam: £5 Charge to Park at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary—That the Parliament condemns NHS Grampian for introducing a £5 parking charge at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary for those parking longer than five hours and believes that this is a revenue-raising ruse which punishes the sick and their families, rather than an attempt to halt abuses by a small minority of individuals who are taking advantage of the facilities.
