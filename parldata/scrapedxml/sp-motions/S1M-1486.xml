*S1M-1486 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Prison Doctor Crisis-That the Parliament agrees that it and the Scottish Executive should make an immediate intervention before the recess to investigate and alleviate the crisis in the Scottish prison doctor service, whereby six doctors have resigned since the service was privatised in November and others are threatening to resign and where some prisons could face a possibly life-threatening situation over the holiday season if locums without experience of prisons or of the risk of suicide at this time of year are used to replace experienced prison doctors; further notes that prison doctors claim that some of them are being asked to service distant prisons more than half an hour away from their own prison which would make it impossible to arrive in time for emergencies and that the crisis has been caused by contractual conditions which many doctors believe are deplorable and which the private company Medacs, operating from Yorkshire, is proposing for Scottish prison doctors; believes that the shortage of recruits is worsening while experienced prison doctors leave in anger and that overall conditions for doctors, prisoners and staff, have worsened since the service was privatised, and accordingly considers that the Parliament and the Scottish Executive should act straight away.
