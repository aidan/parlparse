*S2M-556.2 Shiona Baird: Common Agricultural Policy Reform-As an amendment to motion (S2M-556) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "recognises that the CAP Reform Agreement of June 2003 represents a good deal for Scotland only if the right decisions are made by ministers to make full use of the opportunities the agreement offers to achieve good agricultural and environmental conditions and support rural development; notes the objectives of the Scottish Executive's document Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture, but recognises that this does not in itself represent a comprehensive approach to CAP reform.
