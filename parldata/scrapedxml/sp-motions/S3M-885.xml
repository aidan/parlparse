 *S3M-885 Tavish Scott: Congratulations to CATS Shetland—That the Parliament welcomes the news that the CT scanner recently installed in the Gilbert Bain Hospital in Lerwick is now operational; notes that this will allow over 500 Shetland patients who need CT scans every year to receive their scans in Shetland, allowing patients with serious conditions to be diagnosed locally, speeding up proceedings and reducing the trauma caused by a 400-mile round trip to Aberdeen; further notes that this was only made possible by the sheer hard work of CATS Shetland (Community Action for Trauma Support) which raised the £1 million needed to purchase and install the scanner in the Gilbert Bain Hospital in under a year, and congratulates CATS chairman, Peter Malcolmson, and all of his team for the magnificient success of their massive fund-raising efforts covering far too wide a range of events to fit into a parliamentary motion.
