 *S2M-1348# Frances Curran: Public Inquiry for the Davies Family-That the Parliament believes that there are many unanswered questions in relation to the death of Mrs Annie Davies, 84, who was found dead at the bottom of her stairs with her front door open having sustained terrible injuries; notes that, whilst the police have concluded that her death was a tragic accident, the Procurator Fiscal viewed Annie's death as highly suspicious; further notes that the Davies family have been trying to establish the truth surrounding their mother's death and the subsequent police investigation for over six years and to date have been given no satisfactory explanation; considers that, despite there being named suspects, the police have failed to act, and therefore supports the need for a public inquiry to establish whether there could have been a failure in the criminal justice system and, if so, what the reasons were for such a failure.
