*S3M-7903 Kenneth Gibson: Persecution of Afghan Christians—That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Karzai regime in Afghanistan for imprisoning and allegedly torturing and threatening to hang disabled Red Cross aid worker and physiotherapist Said Musa for converting from Islam to Christianity; is concerned at what it sees as the increasing intolerance toward and ill treatment of Christians in Afghanistan and the regime’s lethal approach to apostasy, and believes it shameful that the Afghan regime appears to rely on Christian troops from western nations to preserve its security while persecuting its own Christian citizens. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Rob Gibson* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
