 *S2M-1303 Trish Godman: Erskine Hospital-That the Parliament commends the dedicated service given by all members of staff at Erskine Hospital to the veterans who reside at the hospital, some of whom were actively engaged in the victorious campaign against fascism some 60 years ago; believes that we all owe a debt of honour to these former members of the armed services, and readily acknowledges that, at the "Erskine", they are as well looked after as their international compatriots in the very best veterans' villages elsewhere in the Commonwealth.
