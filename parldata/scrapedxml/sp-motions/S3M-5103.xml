 *S3M-5103 Stewart Maxwell: Celebrating Charles Darwin’s On the Origin of Species—That the Parliament joins in the celebrations of the 150th anniversary of the publication of naturalist Charles Darwin’s most famous work, On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection, or the Preservation of Favoured Races in the Struggle for Life, first published on 24 November 1859; considers that it has made an unsurpassed contribution to the understanding of evolution, natural selection and consequently the tracing of man’s primitive beginnings; recognises the strength of the theory of evolution and considers that it has stood the test of time, despite many attempts to disprove it, for over 150 years since its publication, and notes that Darwin’s path to prominence started as a medical student at the University of Edinburgh.
