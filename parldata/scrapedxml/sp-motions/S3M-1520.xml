*S3M-1520 Elaine Smith: Cuba—That the Parliament notes the recent decision by Fidel Castro not to seek re-election to the National Assembly of Cuba and wishes him all the best in his future role; sees this as another opportunity to embrace the ideas of positive engagement between the people of Scotland and Cuba; notes that Fidel remains an inspiration to the majority of Cuban people and to all those seeking to challenge injustice and inequality around the world; commends his heroic contribution to the fight against poverty and oppression; congratulates Cuba on an unrivalled legacy of internationalism and humanitarian aid throughout the developing world with one million poor patients treated with eye surgery under Operation Miracle; notes that Cuba is the only country with permanent emergency medical corps on standby to respond to natural emergencies and, further, has 30,000 free medical scholarships for doctors from developing countries, with plans for a further 200,000 in the next ten years; believes that Cuba’s sovereign institutions should be respected by the US Government; calls for an end to the illegal blockade of Cuba, and congratulates Raul Castro on his appointment as head of state and wishes him every success for the future of a socialist Cuba.
