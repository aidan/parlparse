*S3M-913 Bill Wilson: Social Enterprises: Saving Money, Saving the Planet—That the Parliament notes the recent report from the Scottish Social Enterprise Coalition, Saving Money, Saving the Planet, which shows how social enterprises can profit from pursuing environmentally friendly business practice, recognises that 79.4% of social enterprises reduce CO2 emissions by using local suppliers to source their products and are 50% more likely to use recycling schemes than conventional businesses; acknowledges that the profitability of social enterprises, while not threatened by such environmental practice, is inhibited by limited numbers of local recycling facilities, and calls on the Scottish Government to evaluate schemes aimed toward improving recycling opportunities and providing forums for communication between social enterprises and the wider business sector.
