 *S2M-297 Nora Radcliffe: Darwin Mounds—That the Parliament welcomes the protection given to the Darwin Mounds; notes that this unique collection of cold water coral reefs was only discovered in 1998 but has significantly advanced global knowledge of coral formations; further notes that the coral, located 1,000 metres below the surface of the ocean, provides food and shelter to a wide range of marine species, and welcomes the commitment to protecting and sustaining the marine environment upon which our fishing industry depends.
