*S3M-7332 Bill Wilson: UN Vote on Depleted Uranium—That the Parliament notes various reports of recent increases in the incidence of childhood leukaemia and other cancers, stillbirths and birth defects in Iraq, which also suggest that these are linked to the deployment of depleted uranium weaponry; supports the recent UN resolution calling on countries using depleted uranium weapons to release quantitative and geographical data relating to the use of these weapons to the governments of affected states; notes that the UK Government did not support the resolution at an earlier stage, and expresses the hope that, when the resolution goes forward to the United Nations General Assembly for a second vote at the end of November 2010, it will at least not veto it. Supported by: Joe FitzPatrick*, Brian Adam*, Rob Gibson*, Bob Doris*, Christina McKelvie*, Christine Grahame*, Kenneth Gibson*
