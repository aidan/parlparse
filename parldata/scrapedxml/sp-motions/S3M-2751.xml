*S3M-2751 Roseanna Cunningham: Bank Bonuses—That the Parliament notes with dismay that both Northern Rock and Lloyds TSB have indicated that they will pay out senior staff bonuses this year; regards this to be an unacceptable practice after being in receipt of billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to ensure that they could continue trading; is of the view that no bank that has received such public money should even contemplate the paying of bonuses to senior staff; believes that to do so will be viewed as a calculated insult to the millions of people now facing a recession with the potential loss of their homes and jobs, and would expect that the bank chiefs will reconsider their position on this as a matter of urgency.
