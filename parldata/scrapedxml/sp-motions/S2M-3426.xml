 *S2M-3426 Bill Butler: Bert Mullen - Credit Union Pioneer—That the Parliament wishes to pay tribute to the work of Bert Mullen (1920-1986), who was instrumental in the establishment of Western Credit Union, based in the Drumchapel area and widely acknowledged as Scotland’s first credit union, which has now grown into Drumchapel Community Credit Union, with over 2,500 senior and 500 junior members; acknowledges the role which Mr Mullen played as the first Scottish Director of the Credit Union League of Great Britain in the development of the movement nationally; notes that Nobel Peace Prize Winner, John Hume, will give the inaugural Bert Mullen Lecture on 20 October 2005, International Credit Union Day, and salutes the dedication and effort of those who, like Mr Mullen, pioneered the use of the unique credit union model to provide a source of affordable credit and encourage regular savings in their local communities.
