*S1M-1303 Roseanna Cunningham: Drugs Courts—That the Parliament recognises the complex nature of the drugs problem in Scotland; accepts that addressing the problem requires effective law enforcement working in partnership with well resourced rehabilitation and treatment strategies; acknowledges the role that a system of specialist drugs courts could play in dealing with drug-related crime; notes that the Scottish Drugs Forum and CoSLA support the establishment of drugs courts, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to develop an appropriate pilot scheme with a view to moving towards the establishment of drugs courts in areas of Scotland where adequate rehabilitation and treatment resources exist, as proposed in the Scottish National Party’s 1999 Election Manifesto. Supported by: Christine Grahame*, Ms Sandra White*, Ms Margo MacDonald*, Tricia Marwick*, Brian Adam*
