*S3M-3667 Jackson Carlaw: A Special Representative for St Margaret of Scotland Hospice—That the Parliament notes the decision of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to defer until 2012 the transfer of 30 continuing care beds from St Margaret of Scotland Hospice to Blawarthill Hospital; believes that this decision can be tentatively welcomed in the sense that it ends the immediate threat to St Margaret’s; further believes that the three years between now and 2012 must not be wasted but should instead be used as an opportunity to find a sustainable and workable solution to the long-running dispute between St Margaret’s and the NHS board, and, to this end, calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to ensure the appointment of a special representative who enjoys the confidence and goodwill of both parties to act as a broker in the search for such a solution so that agreement is reached in advance of 2012.
