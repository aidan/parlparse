*S3M-4156 Bill Kidd: Scotland’s Pictures—That the Parliament notes that, as at 7 April 2009, there were some 2,227 paintings in the National Galleries of Scotland’s collection not on public display; further notes that, of those paintings on display, there were only some nine paintings out on loan in the west of Scotland, and calls for a permanent display of paintings in Glasgow, as Scotland’s largest city, to benefit the west of Scotland with a fairer share and to benefit the whole of Scotland and visitors to Scotland by allowing a fuller public display of Scotland’s collection of paintings.
