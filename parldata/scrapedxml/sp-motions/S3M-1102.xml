*S3M-1102 Stuart McMillan: NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde—That the Parliament expresses its concern about the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde decision to press ahead with plans to scrap the community maternity units in Inverclyde Royal Hospital and the Vale of Leven Hospital despite one of the recommendations by the Independent Scrutiny Panel, established by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, that the units remain open for three years alongside a community education programme; further notes the strong local opposition to this decision and expresses concern about the distances that expectant mothers will have to travel to give birth, and expresses further concern about the added pressure placed on the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, which will be the destination for the expectant mothers. Supported by: Bill Kidd*
