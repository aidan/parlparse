 *S1M-3175 Richard Lochhead: The Parliament in Aberdeen—That the Parliament extends its appreciation to all involved in the smooth running of its visit to Aberdeen from 28 to 30 May 2002, particularly to all at the University of Aberdeen and Aberdeen City Council and to parliamentary staff who were involved in the planning and execution of parliamentary business and associated events throughout the week, and notes that the success of the visit and warm welcome from the north-east community suggests that the parliament should explore the possibilities of repeating the exercise in Aberdeen and elsewhere in Scotland in coming years.
