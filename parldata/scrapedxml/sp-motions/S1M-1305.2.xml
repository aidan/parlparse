 *S1M-1305.2 Mr Brian Monteith: National Cultural Strategy-As an amendment to motion (S1M-1305) in the name of Mr Sam Galbraith, leave out from "public support" to end and insert "culture in Scotland is the product of our nation's artistic, political and economic history and the spontaneous and independent interactions of individuals and organisations and that ownership of Scottish culture lies with Scotland's people; believes that cultural excellence will best develop in an open and free society and that the role of the Scottish Executive should be to preserve and promote our historical record and artistic achievement and to foster an open society where new contributions can be made without requiring endorsement by politicians or producer groups, and further considers that the Executive's Cultural Strategy document represents a missed opportunity to clarify the limitations of government in Scotland's culture.
