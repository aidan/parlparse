 *S2M-1641# Rhona Brankin: 21st Birthday of Taggart—That the Parliament notes that the SMG TV Productions drama series, Taggart, was first broadcast on 6 September 1983; further notes that it is British television’s longest running police drama; recognises that the series, at ITV’s peak, has achieved viewing figures of up to 18.3 million and remains one of ITV1’s most popular dramas to this day; acknowledges Taggart’s role as one of the UK’s top television exports, bringing Scotland to prominence in more than 80 countries around the globe; applauds the important contribution that it has made, and continues to make, to the Scottish film and TV industry, which employs 5,500 people in 165 businesses; welcomes the fact that the programme brings nearly £7 million into the Scottish economy each year; commends the employment provided by Taggart to hundreds of actors and highly skilled technicians over the last two decades, allowing the training and retention of talent for the benefit of the Scottish theatre and film sectors; congratulates SMG TV Productions, the cast and crew, past and present, for their consistently high standards over the past 21 years, and hopes that this Scottish institution will continue to go from strength to strength in the years ahead.
