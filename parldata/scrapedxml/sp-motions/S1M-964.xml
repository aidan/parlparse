 *S1M-964# Bruce Crawford: Gulf War Related Illnesses-That the Parliament notes the findings in the British Medical Journal that there may be a strong and identifiable link between the multiple vaccines given to Gulf War troops and the enigmatic and devastating illnesses known as Gulf War Related Illnesses; further notes that this study reinforces several American and Canadian studies which have found a link between service in the Gulf and this illness; believes that, in the light of these recent findings, based on the cases of 900 soldiers, now is an appropriate time to proceed with parliamentary action; acknowledges the disproportionate number of Scottish troops and units who fought in the Gulf War and the resulting disproportionate toll of Gulf War Related Illnesses on Scottish veterans and, in the light of this, urges the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government to explore all available avenues to alleviate veterans' ill health and poverty.
