*S3M-7759 Jackson Carlaw: Proposed Waste Incineration Plant at Loganswell—That the Parliament expresses its concern in respect of the proposal to establish a waste incineration plant at Loganswell near Newton Mearns in Eastwood covering some 29 hectares and which is anticipated to burn some 1.5 million tonnes of raw waste a year, a proposal which would arguably turn Eastwood into the ashtray of the west of Scotland; further notes the evidence of Duncan McLaren of Friends of the Earth Scotland who advised the Transport Infrastructure and Climate Change Committee on 23 November 2010 that it "would be insane to build Europe’s largest incinerator in East Renfrewshire"; believes that an urgent rethink of this project is essential, and urges the Scottish Government to demonstrate its support for the wider local community, which it considers is resolutely opposed to this proposed development.
