 *S3M-1490.1 Pauline McNeill: Scottish Law Commission’s Report on Rape and Sexual Offences—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1490) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, insert at end "recognises that the proposals from the commission are complex and that it is important for the Parliament to be given every opportunity to interrogate the bill when it is published, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to aim at an agreement with the Justice Committee on a timetable which gives adequate time to properly scrutinise the bill."
