 *S3M-1895.1 Sarah Boyack: Removing the Barriers to Microgeneration—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1895) in the name of Shirley-Anne Somerville, insert at end "further believes one of the biggest steps which can be taken to encourage greater uptake of microgeneration technology would be for the Scottish Government to reverse its opposition to council tax discounts for households which implement certified energy efficiency or microgeneration measures as recommended by the Energy Savings Trust and for which similar measures are now available in every other constituent country of the United Kingdom; notes that these measures are among those put forward in the proposed Energy Efficiency and Microgeneration (Scotland) Bill, a member’s bill proposal supported by members from every party group in the Parliament, and therefore believes that this measure should now be supported in full by the Scottish Government."
