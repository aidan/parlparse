*S1M-2248 Nicola Sturgeon: Care Development Group-That the Parliament notes the publication of the report of the Care Development Group and welcomes the opportunity for a full parliamentary debate on the detail of the recommendations contained in the report; further welcomes the Scottish Executive's pledge to make personal care free for all elderly people from April 2002 whilst noting that aspects of the detail of this commitment require further clarification; notes in particular that the Â£125 million set aside by the Scottish Executive will not be sufficient to fund the recommendations of the Care Development Group unless Her Majesty's Government agrees to allow those currently eligible for Attendance Allowance to retain this benefit, notwithstanding their entitlement to free personal care; believes that, as a matter of principle, any such shortfall should not be met from within existing Scottish Executive resources, and calls on Her Majesty's Government to make the necessary amendments to the social security regulations or, alternatively, to transfer the resources that will be saved as a result of the withdrawal of Attendance Allowance to the Scottish Executive.
