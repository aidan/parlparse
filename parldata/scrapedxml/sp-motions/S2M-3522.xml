*S2M-3522 Christine Grahame: Book of Remembrance for the Victims of the Lancastriaâ€”That the Parliament notes the Lancastria exhibition which will take place in the garden lobby of the Parliament on Thursday 10 November 2005, the eve of Armistice Day; notes that the exhibition will commemorate the worst ever maritime disaster in British history and also the worst single loss of life for British forces in the whole of World War Two when the troopship, Lancastria, was attacked by enemy aircraft on 17 June 1940 off the French coastal town of St Nazaire; notes that the 16,242 ton Clyde-built liner took just 20 minutes to sink, claiming more than 4,000 lives, twice the number of victims in the Titanic and Lusitania disasters combined, yet has remained virtually unheard-of for more than 65 years, and encourages members to sign a book of condolence which acknowledges this considerable human sacrifice at the exhibition which will later be placed in the Scottish National War Memorial at Edinburgh Castle.
