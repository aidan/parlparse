*S3M-6666 John Park: Meeting the Low-carbon Skills Challenge—That the Parliament welcomes the response by the Alliance of Sector Skills Councils (ASSC) in Scotland to the Scottish Government’s Towards a Low Carbon Economy for Scotland: Discussion Paper; further welcomes the work done by the ASSC toward meeting the low-carbon skills challenge and in developing qualifications that meet the requirements of employers in low-carbon industries; considers that more must be done to raise private sector awareness of the opportunities, both domestic and international, afforded by a move to a low-carbon world economy, and hopes that the specific challenges highlighted by the ASSC in Scotland will be considered by the Scottish Government as the consultation process goes forward.
