 *S3M-2327 Kenneth Gibson: Selling Tobacco Products to Developing Countries—That the Parliament notes with concern the marketing strategies of British American Tobacco (BAT) and other tobacco companies in promoting their products in the developing world where health concerns are already acute, health resources are overstretched and where there are far fewer restrictions on the marketing, promotion and selling of tobacco products; is aware that smoking rates in Africa, Asia and Latin America are rapidly increasing with all the appalling consequences one might anticipate; acknowledges the World Health Organization’s research that recognises that more deaths will occur globally as a result of smoking-related diseases than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined, and believes that British companies selling tobacco products overseas should market their products responsibly and avoid targeting young people unscrupulously, as they have often been accused.
