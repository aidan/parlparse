*S3M-2121.1.1 Stewart Stevenson: Bus Transportâ€”As an amendment to amendment (S3M-2121.1) in the name of Alex Johnstone, insert at end "notes that increasing fuel costs presents a significant opportunity for bus transport to demonstrate that it is an efficient and effective alternative for many car journeys, and condemns the failure of the Westminster government to respond to the sudden increases in the price of crude oil which are bringing uncertainty to a wide range of businesses and domestic users of oil and putting at risk the positive developments in the bus industry in recent years."
