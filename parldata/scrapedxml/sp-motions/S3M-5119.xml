*S3M-5119 Richard Lochhead: Autumn Fisheries Negotiations—That the Parliament notes the Scottish Government’s commitment to secure a fair deal at the forthcoming EU fisheries negotiations and to continue seeking radical and urgent changes to EU regulations to help cut discards and improve fisheries conservation and the industry’s profitability; calls for Scotland’s fishermen’s growing reputation for innovative fisheries conservation to be given due recognition, and notes the European Commission Green Paper on the Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy, which recognises the failures of the Common Fisheries Policy.
