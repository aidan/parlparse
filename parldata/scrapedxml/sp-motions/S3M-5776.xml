 * S3M-5776 Trish Godman: The Privatisation of the United Kingdom’s Search and Rescue Operations—That the Parliament regrets and deplores the decision of the Ministry of Defence to privatise its search and rescue operations in Scotland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom; is well aware of the gallantry displayed on so many rescue operations by the highly professional naval and air force crews that have saved the lives of so many professional and amateur seafarers in Scottish waters and more distant seas, and is of the firm view that emergency services of this kind should remain in the public sector and not be transferred to private companies with their perceived overriding concern for the interests and expectations of their shareholders.
