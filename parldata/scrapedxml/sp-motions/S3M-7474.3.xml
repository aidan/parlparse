*S3M-7474.3 John Swinney: A Budget for Scotland’s People—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7474) in the name of Johann Lamont, leave out from first "Scottish Government" to end and insert "Scottish Parliament is always asked to approve a budget for one financial year; acknowledges that £3.3 billion of cuts in Scotland’s budget imposed by the UK Government in the Comprehensive Spending Review, with the largest cuts due to fall in 2011-12, means that radical reform of public services will be needed; welcomes the Scottish Government’s work in setting out clear priorities for long-term success in the Scottish economy and the announcement of a £2.5 billion programme of infrastructure investment to be delivered through the non-profit distributing model; further notes the work of the Christie Commission that will inform public service delivery in the years to come, and calls for the Parliament to be given the opportunity to fully consider those proposals before setting further detailed spending plans."
