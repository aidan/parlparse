 *S3M-2620 Christina McKelvie: Aleke Banda—That the Parliament notes the decision of Aleke Banda to retire from frontline politics in Malawi at the next election; recognises the role that he played in the campaign for independence for Malawi, helping to build a new country, and his 55 years in active politics; congratulates him on his achievements during his career, and wishes him well in his retirement, hoping that he will, in his own words, "find the time to read some bedtime stories, to learn to kick a football or fly a kite".
