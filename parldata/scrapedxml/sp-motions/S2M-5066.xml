*S2M-5066 Christine Grahame: Scottish Arctic Convoy Medal—That the Parliament recognises the heroism of the men and women of the arctic convoys during the Second World War, from 1941 to 1945, in maintaining convoys of merchant and Navy ships delivering vital supplies to their Russian allies following the German invasion; notes that, despite the loss of almost 3,000 sailors and merchant seamen, Her Majesty’s Government is still to give them the proper recognition they deserve by commissioning a wartime medal in honour of their sacrifice and determination; notes the anger of many arctic convoy veterans, such as Keith Dyble of Penicuik, who feel that the awarding of a small arctic badge in place of a medal is an insult to the memory of those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defending freedom and democracy in this country, and believes that the Scottish government should commission an official medal and posthumously award such a medal to the surviving relatives of the many who perished in those icy seas.
