*S3M-767 Bill Kidd: Changes to Housing Benefitsâ€”That the Parliament notes with great concern the changes pending in housing benefit in that thousands of tenants in the private-rented sector will have their benefit set at an average within an area, such as Glasgow, and that this will leave many with insufficient funds to meet their rent and notes, with further concern, that the Department for Work and Pensions has plans to extend the scheme to the social-rented sector.
