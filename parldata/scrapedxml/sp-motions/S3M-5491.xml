*S3M-5491 Sarah Boyack: Scotland Needs Boiler Scrappage Scheme—That the Parliament notes the launch of the Boiler Scrappage Scheme by the UK Government, a scheme that will offer a £400 incentive to encourage households to update inefficient boilers; further notes that the scheme will benefit up to 125,000 households in England and Wales, helping to reduce CO2 emissions while at the same time reducing fuel bills, and help to secure 250,000 jobs at small and medium companies that make, sell and install boilers; urges the Scottish Government to implement a similar scheme across Scotland, given the reported estimates of £11.5 million in Barnett consequentials being available, and considers that this decision would be of significant benefit to 12,000 homes in Scotland that would be eligible for such a scheme and would create jobs in the Scottish plumbing industry.
