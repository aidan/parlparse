 * S2M-2966# Maureen Macmillan: Arjo Wiggins’ Corpach Paper Mill—That the Parliament notes with grave concern the announcement of the 90-day consultation period on the future of the Arjo Wiggins’ Corpach paper mill; believes that management should do all that it can to diversify into another paper product; further believes that it is essential to keep this industrial capacity in Lochaber, both in terms of the site and the skilled and hard-working workforce, and considers that the Scottish Executive should do all it can to attract another operator for the mill should Arjo Wiggins cease production.
