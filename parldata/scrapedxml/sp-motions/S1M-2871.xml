*S1M-2871 Tommy Sheridan: ScotRail—That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to bring ScotRail into public ownership and pay railway staff a decent wage comparable to train drivers in England; notes that ScotRail is to receive a further subsidy of £34 million a year, and believes that this public subsidy should be reflected in public ownership and control.
