*S3M-6757 Bill Kidd: Carers Strategy—That the Parliament welcomes the £5 million commitment from the Scottish Government for a 10-point carers strategy to support a new deal for the voluntary sector in supporting respite for carers of all ages; notes that there will be an adult strategy, Caring Together, and a separate strategy for young carers, Getting it Right for Young Carers; considers that carers make a huge contribution to their families and society, and believes that this extra commitment, through a strategy compiled with the help of carers themselves, will therefore be a valuable contribution to help with the everyday lives of carers and cared-for people across Scotland.
