* S3M-5790 Bob Doris: Another Victory for Wyndford—That the Parliament is delighted at the news that Getgo Glasgow has won the UK final of the Sustain Our Nation competition in London on 17 February 2010, following on from the earlier success of its Green Gorillaz proposal at regional level in January; notes that both stages secured prize money of £10,000, and looks forward to seeing how this hard won pot of £20,000 will be spent to the benefit of the Wyndford community.
