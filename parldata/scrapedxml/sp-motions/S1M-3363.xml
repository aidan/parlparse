*S1M-3363# Ms Sandra White: Industrial Relations at Central College of Commerce, Glasgow-That the Parliament notes with concern the poor industrial relations situation at the Central College of Commerce, Glasgow, and, in particular, the sacking of Mr Jim O'Donovan, a lecturer at the college, for alleged gross misconduct; further notes the deep concerns relating to Mr O'Donovan's dismissal with many believing that the charges brought against him were incompetent, and believes that Mr O' Donovan should be reinstated immediately and that the Scottish Executive should undertake an investigation into the situation at the college.
