 * S2M-2339 Colin Fox:Proposed New Powers for Home Secretary—That the Parliament views with grave concern proposals from the UK Home Secretary in relation to further extension of anti-terrorism legislation; views legislation that would enable the Home Secretary to order individuals to surrender their passport, the imposition of curfews, electronic tagging, reporting regularly to police, limits on use of the telephone and the internet and house arrest without being placed on trial as being totally unacceptable and a further extension of the already draconian powers available to the Home Secretary; notes that the number of people from Asian backgrounds stopped and searched by police has increased by 300% since the Terrorism Act 2000 came into force and further notes the comments of Guy Mansfield QC, chairman of the Bar Council, who said that “Disproportionate measures risk radicalising the community from which a detainee comes. That may make this country less rather than more safe”; notes that already there is press speculation that the new powers may also be used to target individuals such as animal right activists; notes that anti-terrorism legislation was used routinely during the policing of peace demonstrations at RAF Fairford, Gloucestershire, and believes that it opens the door for the Home Secretary to target those taking legitimate and peaceful protest action with the proposed new powers.
