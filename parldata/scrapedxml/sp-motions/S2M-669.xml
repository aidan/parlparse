 *S2M-669 John Swinburne: Help the Aged SeniorLine-That the Parliament notes with concern that Help the Aged has decided to close their office in Scotland which runs SeniorLine, the free telephone advice service for older people, in December; recognises that experienced trained welfare rights advisers have answered thousands of queries from people in Scotland, particularly following the very effective campaign with the Daily Record to promote the uptake of the new pension credit; is concerned that if future calls from Scotland are answered by advisers in the London office with no experience or training in Scots law and unaware of policy differences between Scotland and the rest of the UK, such as free personal care, the recent positive developments to remove the barriers to the take-up of entitlements by senior citizens in Scotland will be damaged and undermined, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government to ensure the future security of Help the Aged, a partner organisation in the take-up campaign, and particularly to reconsider the closure of the Scottish office of SeniorLine.
