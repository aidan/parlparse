*S1M-3914 Ross Finnie: Fisheries-That the Parliament welcomes the Executive's commitment of up to £50 million in aid to assist fishermen, on-shore fisheries businesses and fishing communities throughout Scotland as a very substantial response to the outcome of the EU Fisheries Council in December 2002; welcomes the result of quota negotiations in the nephrops fishery and the progress made in reforms to the Common Fisheries Policy at that Council; endorses the need for sustainable economic development of Scotland's fishing industry and communities; recognises this can best be achieved through healthier fish stocks; acknowledges this implies further restructuring of the white fish sector; welcomes the provision of up to £40 million for further decommissioning; welcomes the provision of up to £10 million in transitional support to facilitate rational economic planning and adjustment by those who wish to remain in the sector; notes that such transitional support will be conditional upon, for example, non-diversification into other valuable fisheries, such as the west coast and North Sea nephrops fisheries, and supports the Executive in its negotiations to secure a more economically realistic EU legal framework initially through amendment to the current interim EU regulation and thereafter through a successor regime.
