 *S3M-2703 Robin Harper: British Medical Association Get Scotland Moving—That the Parliament welcomes BMA Scotland’s publication Get Scotland Moving, which highlights the health and social benefits of an active lifestyle among Scotland’s children; notes that one in four Scots are at risk of dying early from diseases related to inactivity and that the number of children travelling to school by car has doubled over the last 20 years, thus doubling the traffic problems for those few children who still walk to school; recognises that one of the main barriers to increasing physical activity of children is the built environment where parents have concerns about issues such as traffic levels and also about unsafe environments for their children; notes that October is Walk to School month and encourages everyone to get their children into the habit of walking to school, and urges the Scottish Government to take assertive action to improve communities and make them clean, safe and healthy so that we can get Scotland’s children moving.
