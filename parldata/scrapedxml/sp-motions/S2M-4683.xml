*S2M-4683 Christine Grahame: Paying the Price—That the Parliament notes Citizen’s Advice Scotland’s latest report, Paying the Price: The Real Costs of Illness and Disability, which is based on a detailed survey of clients claiming incapacity benefit or disability living allowance; notes further that more than two-thirds of claimants had a monthly household income of less that £800, that 62% had incomes consisting only of benefits or augmented by tax credits and that 48% reported that they had reduced their heating, lighting or cooking because of the cost of fuel; is concerned that, as a result, more than two-thirds said that their health was fluctuating or worsening, with nearly half also having been out of work for more than five years; considers that, even within the restrictions of devolution, the Scottish government could improve matters by making available additional support for those who incur additional costs through illness and disability in areas such as prescription charging, travel costs, hospital car parking charges and energy costs, and calls on the Scottish government to address these issues now.
