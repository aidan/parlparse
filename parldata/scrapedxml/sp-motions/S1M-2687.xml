*S1M-2687# Alex Neil: Untenable Position of Independent Assessors-That the Parliament notes with concern the untenable position of the 12 new Independent Assessors appointed on 29 January 2002; believes that none of the 12 can command public confidence and that these appointments should be annulled, and considers that it should investigate this shoddy process and, in particular, should examine (a) why half the Independent Assessors appointed were active Labour Party members and (b) why only 27 people applied for these vacancies.
