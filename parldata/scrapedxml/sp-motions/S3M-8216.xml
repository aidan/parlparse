*S3M-8216 Patrick Harvie: Funding for Rape Support Service in Glasgow—That the Parliament calls on Strathclyde Police to reconsider its intention to cut the funding provided by the force to the rape support service, Archway Glasgow; urges NHS Lanarkshire, NHS Ayrshire and Arran and NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to work together to provide, in 2011-12, at least the current level of funding to what is considered to be this vital service; commends Archway Glasgow for what it sees as the excellent service provided by it to victims of rape and sexual assault; further considers that, especially in light of recent high-profile sexual assaults in Glasgow’s city centre and west end, rape support services are absolutely vital and must not become a victim of the rush to slash budgets across the public sector; considers that Strathclyde Police is being forced to consider difficult funding decisions because of the political choices made by the UK Government, and calls on the Scottish Government to urgently seek ways to ensure that services for victims of sexual violence are protected in Scotland.
