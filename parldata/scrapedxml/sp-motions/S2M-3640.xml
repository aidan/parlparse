*S2M-3640 Frances Curran: Humanitarian Crisis in Pakistan—That the Parliament notes that seven weeks after the earthquake in Pakistan the people living in the affected area, particularly Kashmir, are facing a humanitarian crisis; further notes that 3.3 million people are homeless and without proper shelter as winter snows loom and 67,000 people are wounded and in desperate need of medical treatment; is concerned that, while the Pakistan Government has called for $500 million in aid, current pledges from the United Nations and governments fall well short of that, while in 2003 Pakistan paid $2.5 billion in debt repayments, including $500 million to the World Bank and $600 million to the International Monetary Fund; believes that these institutions and the rich banks of the west could easily free the resources to rebuild Kashmir and the affected areas if they cancelled one year’s debt repayments, and supports the immediate cancellation of Pakistan’s public foreign debt and calls for the money to be directed to the millions of people now facing a humanitarian crisis.
