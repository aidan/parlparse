*S3M-1139 George Foulkes: Hands Off the Sick Kids—That the Parliament supports the campaign to save the sick kids hospital in Edinburgh; believes that the hospital provides vital healthcare and great comfort to families across Edinburgh, the Lothians, Fife and further afield; unites behind nurses, doctors, health professionals, parents and children and encourages everyone to sign the Edinburgh Evening News "Hands Off the Sick Kids" petition; agrees that, if this service was closed, local parents and children already dealing with difficult and challenging circumstances would endure significant stress and additional suffering as a result, and insists that the presumption against centralising hospital services like this is one manifesto commitment the SNP government must keep. Supported by: Robin Harper*, Patricia Ferguson*, Margaret Smith*, Elaine Smith*, Sarah Boyack*, Mary Mulligan*, Trish Godman*, John Park*, Jackie Baillie*, Jamie Stone*
