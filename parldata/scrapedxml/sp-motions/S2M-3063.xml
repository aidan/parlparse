 S2M-3063 Mr Alasdair Morrison: Guga Hunters of Ness—That the Parliament wishes the guga-hunting team from the district of Ness on the Isle of Lewis the very best as they prepare for this year’s trip to Sula Sgeir; recognises that the guga is enjoyed by many within the Western Isles and indeed the Hebridean diaspora throughout the world; notes the view of Scottish Natural Heritage that this important annual harvest has no adverse effect on the population of the gannet colony, and looks forward to the continued success of this age-old tradition which provides a delicacy that will continue to delight the palate of islanders at home and abroad for generations to come.
