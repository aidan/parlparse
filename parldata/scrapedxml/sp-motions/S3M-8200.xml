*S3M-8200 Mary Scanlon: Without Frontiers—That the Parliament commends the Without Frontiers exhibition and the display of images from this exhibition that were recently shown at Kiltarlity Village Hall; congratulates the organisers on securing grants for the project from CashBack for Communities and the Heritage Lottery Fund; notes that the project works with Northern Constabulary, Grampian Police and Strathclyde Police and that the exhibition, which has been three years in the making, shows how the natural world connects people and is to be one of the central features of the 2011 science festival in Glasgow; considers that the Without Frontiers programme provides a powerful and effective route through which to raise awareness and understanding of the environment among the general public in an attractive way, combining the arts and science with a connecting link of photography, and giving audiences the opportunity to interface directly with people in the field, and wishes the exhibition every success in the future.
