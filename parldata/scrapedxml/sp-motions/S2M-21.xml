*S2M-21 Donald Gorrie: Cancellation of Iraq's Debt—That the Parliament notes that under Saddam Hussein’s regime Iraq accumulated almost $400 billion of debt and reparation claims; welcomes the Jubilee Iraq organisation’s call for cancellation of these financial obligations so that the new democratic government promised in Iraq, and the Iraqi people, are not made to pay the bill for the wars and oppression they suffered under Saddam Hussein’s government; believes that the next government of Iraq should in reciprocation cancel debts owed to Iraq by highly indebted poor countries, and encourages the United Nations and the governments of the United States of America and United Kingdom to use their influence with creditors and their authority to achieve this objective.
