 *S1M-2951 Mr Brian Monteith: Eigg's Ferry Terminal and Pier—That the Parliament notes with concern that the cost of the ferry terminal and pier at Kildonnan in Eigg, approved by the First Minister, will be £260,000 of public money for each of the 30 residents’ cars on Eigg; further notes that only the cars of Eigg residents may use the car ferry due to the traffic order that prevents non-residents taking cars to Eigg, and believes that mainland taxpayers, who have contributed so generously to the ferry terminal and pier, should be granted the use of it and that the traffic order which prevents them driving their own vehicles in Eigg should be withdrawn.
