*S2M-4704 Margaret Mitchell: Police Community Clubs of Great Britain—That the Parliament commends the excellent work carried out by Police Community Clubs of Great Britain (PCCGB), an organisation whose membership comprises of retired and serving police officers committed to helping young people and whose education and citizenship initiatives, and promotion of sports and leisure activities, demonstrate how essential values can be learned and put into practice; congratulates PCCGB on the launch of its campaign to combat bullying and vandalism; welcomes the involvement of both the community police and the local authority in the recent successful pilot in Renfrewshire which used the booklet Barney and Echo – A Friendship Made!, together with games to promote good citizenship, to help children aged between 7 and 11 discuss their own experiences and to highlight the dangers of bullying and emphasise the anti-bullying message; notes that bullying has resulted in the suicide of approximately 20 young people each year; recognises that many young people have cause to be grateful for the organisation’s work, and encourages individuals, local authorities and business in Scotland to support the campaign.
