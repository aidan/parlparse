*S3M-7473 Dr Richard Simpson: Ban on Caffeinated Alcohol—That the Parliament notes that the United States Food and Drug Administration has banned pre-mixed caffeinated alcohol drinks; notes that this moves beyond the recent voluntary withdrawal of these by a number of major suppliers and the banning of such drinks in at least four states, and believes that it is now in the interests of public safety that pre-mixed caffeinated alcoholic drinks be withdrawn from sale in Scotland.
