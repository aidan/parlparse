*S2M-3813 Ms Rosemary Byrne: MilkLink Job Lossesâ€”That the Parliament notes with regret the decision of Tesco to move UHT milk production abroad, jeopardising jobs at the Kirkcudbright factory; supports and applauds the hard work and dedication of workers and unions at MilkLink in fighting to save jobs; notes that the decision of Tesco is a direct result of the current free market economic policy in world food production, which is based on profit rather than promoting locally grown produce, and calls on the Scottish Executive to promote Scottish farming in an environmentally, economically and socially just manner to produce healthy Scottish produce and protect and promote jobs.
