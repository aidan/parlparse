*S2M-4950 Frances Curran: UK Residents Detained in Guantanamo Bayâ€”That the Parliament condemns the continuing refusal of the UK Government to demand the release of Omar Deghayes, Jamil el-Banna and Bisher al-Rawi, who have been detained in Guantanamo Bay since 2002; notes that Mr el-Banna and Mr Deghayes have previously been accepted into the United Kingdom as refugees at risk of persecution or torture in their home countries; believes that this country owes a duty of care to those it has provided with refuge, and urges the UK Government to act to uphold the human rights of all those detained in Guantanamo Bay and, in particular, those whose normal place of residence is the United Kingdom.
