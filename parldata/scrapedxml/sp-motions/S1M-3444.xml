*S1M-3444 David Mundell: Integrated NHS in Dumfries and Galloway—That the Parliament recognises that there is not a "one size fits all" model for the organisation of the NHS in Scotland; welcomes the decision by the Minister for Health and Community Care to approve the plans by Dumfries and Galloway NHS Board for the integration of the three health organisations in Dumfries and Galloway which have received widespread staff and public support, and looks forward to a smooth transition to the new single organisation, which has many challenges to meet in delivering the best possible health services to people living throughout the many communities in Dumfries and Galloway, not least the retention and recruitment of staff.Supported by: Alex Fergusson*
