*S3M-7215 Cathy Jamieson: Proposal to Abolish Consumer Focus—That the Parliament expresses concern that, in the wake of the publication of the Postal Services Bill proposing what are considered significant changes to the postal market and post office network, the UK Government is proposing to abolish Consumer Focus, the statutory champion for postal customers in Scotland; acknowledges the key role of Scotland’s post office network in both urban and rural communities and considers that the decision to remove the postal service watchdog will remove a strong voice in consumer representation, and calls on the Scottish Government to make representations to the UK Government on behalf of postal service users.
