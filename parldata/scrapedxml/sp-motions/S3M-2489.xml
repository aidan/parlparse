*S3M-2489 Dr Richard Simpson: Congratulations to Forth Valley Practitioners—That the Parliament congratulates general practitioners in Forth Valley on achieving an 86% take-up of the new General Medical Services contract, extending the hours during which appointments are available to patients, but notes that, while there is an average take-up of around 51% across Scotland, there is a huge variation between NHS boards, even between those boards with similar demographics and geography; therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to take all necessary steps, working with territorial NHS boards, to ensure equity of access for all patients in Scotland, and further calls on the Executive to monitor the way in which these extra hours are being utilised.
