*S2M-1117.2 Fergus Ewing: The Failure of the BBC to Hand Over Tapes to the Fraser Inquiry-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1117) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "believes that, whilst it is wholly inappropriate for any parliament to issue orders to the press and media requiring them to hand over material, the BBC should cooperate with the Holyrood Inquiry by providing to it the tape recordings of the interviews with the late Donald Dewar and Enric Miralles, which have been filmed for the proposed programme, "The Gathering Place", because they may include material of relevance to the remit of the Holyrood Inquiry; further believes that the Holyrood Inquiry should have had conferred upon it at the outset the powers to compel the appearance of witnesses and production of documents set out in the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act 1921; considers that the First Minister and the Presiding Officer should now explore whether such powers can yet be conferred upon the Holyrood Inquiry; believes that the leaders of all political parties in Scotland should immediately agree to write jointly to the BBC calling upon it to cooperate with the Inquiry, and considers that the First Minister should seek to appear before the Inquiry as a witness in order to answer questions about his role as Minister for Finance."
