 *S3M-897.2 Jackie Baillie: Darling Must Resign—As an amendment to motion (S3M-897) in the name of Sandra White, leave out from "serious concern" to end and insert "its concern at hearing of the serious breach of procedure at HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) leading to loss of personal data from the child benefit database; notes the immediate changes that have been put in place to the way in which such customer data is handled and welcomes the decision by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to ask Kieran Poynter, the Chair of Price Waterhouse Coopers, to investigate HMRC’s security processes and procedures for handling data to ensure that every effort is made to ensure that such a loss can never happen again; further notes that a police investigation is under way and there is currently no evidence that the information is in anyone else’s possession; endorses the action taken by the UK Payments Association (APACS) to ensure that appropriate safeguards are put in place and that individual banks and other financial institutions, including building societies and post offices, are taking steps to monitor payments and notes that HMRC is writing to every customer affected to advise him or her on further precautionary steps that they can take personally, and believes that every lesson possible should be learned from the situation at HMRC to ensure that data handling procedures are as robust as possible at every tier of administration."
