*S1M-783# Margaret Jamieson: Meares-Irlen Syndrome—That the Parliament notes that research shows that up to 30% of children may be suffering from Meares-Irelen syndrome, which often results in reading difficulties affecting their education but which can be alleviated for many by the simple and cost effective use of appropriate coloured overlays, and calls upon education authorities and health boards to work in partnership to provide a comprehensive screening programme in order to ensure that all children can take full advantage of the education provided and go on to achieve their full potential in society.
