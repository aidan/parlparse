 *S2M-2515.1 Tommy Sheridan: Profits of Royal Bank of Scotland Group and HBOS plc—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2515) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from "management and staff" to end and insert "the improved performance and profit generation of these two banks is due to the dedication and commitment of employees to deliver a service to the public, despite damaging cutbacks in employee numbers and conditions, and believes that these banks and the financial industry as a whole should be publicly-owned and democratically-controlled so that surpluses generated can be ethically invested at home and overseas, pension funds can be used productively and guarantee proper returns to provide security for all pensioners and society can benefit from social and health investment instead of the tiny minority who currently receive the majority of the profits through dividend payments and obscene salaries, bonuses and pensions."
