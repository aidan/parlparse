 *S1M-3908.1 Tommy Sheridan: Not In Our Name-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3908) in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from "role" to end and insert "rule of international law in dealing with this crisis; shares the contempt felt by the people of Scotland towards the murderous Iraqi regime but recognises the overwhelming view of the people that the rush to war must be halted in the name of peace and world security; further notes the need for a world forum to represent and articulate the views of the nations throughout the world, but believes that the United Nations (UN) in its current form does not adequately perform the role because of the ability of the Government of the United States of America (USA) to bribe and coerce the UN to secure its will or to proceed unilaterally if it is unable to do so, and believes that the 191 countries of the UN should be allowed democratic votes from across the world rather than be dominated by the USA, which represents only 5% of the world's population, because the evidence currently shows that bombing Iraq is unjust and immoral, regardless of UN resolutions."
