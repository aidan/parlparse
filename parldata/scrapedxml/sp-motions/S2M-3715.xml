*S2M-3715# Mike Rumbles: Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Hill of Brathens, Banchory—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by the Natural Environment Research Council to close the Centre for Ecology and Hydrology (CEH) at Hill of Brathens, Banchory; notes that the research carried out at the facility is consistently of the highest quality; considers that, at a time when climate change is of huge concern in Scotland, research operations such as CEH should be expanded rather than rationalised, and further considers that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the Natural Environment Research Council opposing the proposal. Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone*, Brian Adam*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*
