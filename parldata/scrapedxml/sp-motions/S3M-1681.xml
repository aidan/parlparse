 *S3M-1681 Liam McArthur: HITRANS Supports Equal Treatment for All Island Ferries—That the Parliament notes that the Chairman of HITRANS, Duncan Macintyre, when interviewed by BBC Radio Orkney, stated that HITRANS was keen to see all islands benefiting from the reduced ferry fares which are currently to be granted exclusively to the Western Isles, Coll and Tiree under the two-and-a-half-year pilot of the Road Equivalent Tariff (RET) charging regime; further notes that Mr Macintyre stated that HITRANS’s preference was for a straight 40% reduction in ferry fares for all islanders to follow the example of the successful Air Discount Scheme, introduced by the previous administration, which cuts the cost of island residents’ air travel on all lifeline routes to the islands; believes that the excessive length of the RET pilot scheme seriously discriminates against Orkney, Shetland, the Argyll islands and all other islands excluded from the pilot, and calls on the Scottish Government to reconsider its plans for the RET pilot and to replace it with an equitable distribution of any funding available to cut ferry fares across all island routes.
