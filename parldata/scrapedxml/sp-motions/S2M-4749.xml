*S2M-4749 Rosie Kane: Thomson’s Closure of Glasgow Call Centre—That the Parliament notes the announced closure of its Glasgow call centre by Thomson Holidays, owned by German multi-national TUI; condemns the devastating impact which this has on the lives and livelihoods of 450 workers and their families; condemns the total lack of consultation by the company with the workforce or trade unions, a reminder of the appalling lack of legal protection for Scottish workers, making them among the easiest sacked in Europe; considers this to be an outrageous theft of taxpayers’ money, including £1.4 million in Regional Selective Assistance funding from the Scottish Executive, and condemns it accordingly; offers full solidarity to the Thomson workers in any action they take against closure; demands that Thomson’s assets be confiscated, including the return of the full £1.4 million in public funding for their private profiteering, and supports calls for legislation that would defend the rights of workers against such instant dismissal without the right of full prior negotiations with elected trade union representatives. Supported by: Carolyn Leckie*, Tommy Sheridan*
