 * S2M-2639# Fiona Hyslop: Generation Squalor—That the Parliament notes with concern the publication by Shelter of Generation Squalor, Shelter’s national investigation into the housing crisis, and in particular the findings that temporary accommodation constantly disrupts children’s education, that last year 26,584 children in Scotland lived in households that applied as homeless, which is one child for every classroom, and that homeless children living in temporary accommodation on average miss out on a quarter of their schooling; notes with concern that there are many issues facing families in short-term accommodation where, in the 21st century, they have no cooker and no bed and where babies suffer physiological damage from being kept in buggies too long because of housing conditions; further notes that, although the Homelessness etc. (Scotland) Act 2003 seeks to give everyone the right to a home by 2012, it will not be enough on its own to solve the housing crisis, and believes that the increased provision of affordable rented accommodation is an essential part of the solution to these problems which shame this country.
