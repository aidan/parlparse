*S3M-1347 John Park: Violence Against Betting Shop Workers—That the Parliament notes with concern the increase in physical and verbal abuse and intimidation faced by betting shop workers and the parallel rise in violent betting shop robberies; recognises that many workers do not receive adequate support from their employers following such traumatic incidents; regrets that the prevalence of workplace violence leads to a culture among employees, many of whom are lone female workers, of viewing such abuse as part of the job; acknowledges the work carried out by the trade union, Community, in challenging the problems of violence faced by its members in betting shops across Scotland, and welcomes the safety poster launch on 21 February 2008 in the Parliament to further raise awareness of Community’s campaign to stop violence against betting shop workers.
