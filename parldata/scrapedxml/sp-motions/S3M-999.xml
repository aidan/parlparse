*S3M-999 Karen Gillon: Fit for the Future—That the Parliament welcomes the report published by the Scottish Consumer Council, Fit for the Future? Young People’s Participation in Physical Activity in Scottish Secondary Schools, which highlights that the vast majority of S1 to S4 pupils are receiving two periods of exercise a week and have a generally positive attitude towards sport; recognises that more has to be done to encourage S5 and S6 pupils as well as all female pupils to partake in optional school-based sport activities, and calls on the Scottish Government to investigate the potential to offer young people an entitlement of five hours per week of physical activity combining both in-class and out-of-class time.
