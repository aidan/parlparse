*S1M-1544 Mr Duncan Hamilton: CalMac Tender Process—That the Parliament notes with concern the recent disclosure from the maritime industry’s union NUMAST that, despite the assurances of the Scottish Executive to the contrary, the current tender process for Caledonian MacBrayne services was initiated by the Scottish Executive and not the European Commission; further notes the Commission’s view that it was unlikely ever to have become involved had no contact been made by the Executive; condemns the inaction of previous administrations in not applying for a derogation to protect ferry services such as that negotiated by Greece; recognises the potential to reverse this neglect when current guidelines are revised in 2002, and urges the Scottish Executive to work towards a settlement which will secure West Coast ferry services in a single network under public ownership.
