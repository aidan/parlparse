 *S1M-3022.3 Mary Scanlon: Modernising Primary Care in NHS Scotland to Improve Health-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3022) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "applauds" to end and insert "notes that in order to improve primary care Local Health Care Co-operatives should be free to purchase care from the most appropriate provider, be it public, private or voluntary, and the incentives gained by the purchasing of such services should be used to underpin patient choice; further urges the Scottish Executive to continue to use private providers where they can supplement the capacity of the NHS and provide value for money, and asks the Scottish Executive to make available to patients information on alternative providers and on waiting lists and times to allow patients to exercise real choice."
