 *S3M-3037 Pauline McNeill: Herald and Times Group Redundancies—That the Parliament views as extremely serious the announcement that the Herald and Times Group will make redundant all of its 250 journalists and invite them to reapply for their jobs; believes that this is a draconian employment practice, especially in light of significant profits recorded last year; acknowledges the importance of the Herald and Times Group to the newspaper industry and that The Herald, being one of the oldest newspapers in the United Kingdom, and The Evening Times have played a significant role in reporting on the daily life of Glasgow and Scotland, and calls on the Herald and Times Group’s management to meet with the National Union of Journalists with a view to withdrawing this plan. Supported by: Aileen Campbell*, Marlyn Glen*, Patrick Harvie*, Peter Peacock*, Paul Martin*, John Park*, Lewis Macdonald*, Margaret Curran*, Bob Doris*, Jackie Baillie*, Cathie Craigie*, Bill Kidd*, Bill Butler*, Mr Frank McAveety*, James Kelly*, Christine Grahame*, Des McNulty*, Sarah Boyack*, Andy Kerr*, Helen Eadie*, Stuart McMillan*, Patricia Ferguson*, Ken Macintosh*, Cathy Peattie*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Kenneth Gibson*, David Whitton*, Mary Mulligan*, Ross Finnie*, Hugh Henry*, Sandra White*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Marilyn Livingstone*, Malcolm Chisholm*
