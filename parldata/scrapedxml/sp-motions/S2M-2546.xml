*S2M-2546 Mr Stewart Maxwell: More Funding for Smoking Cessation Services—That the Parliament recognises the importance of National No Smoking Day in helping to motivate smokers to give up smoking; recognises that if they are to be successful in stopping smoking altogether then many smokers require the assistance of smoking cessation services; congratulates all those who work in the cessation services on helping smokers end their addiction to tobacco; believes that funding for these services remains inadequate in the face of the tobacco industries’ efforts to hold on to their current customers and recruit new smokers, and calls on the Scottish Executive to increase the funding to smoking cessation services as part of the preparation to ban smoking in public places in 2006.
