*S2M-4124 Murdo Fraser: Tourette Syndrome—That the Parliament commends the work carried out by Tourette Scotland, Scotland’s national organisation that provides advice and support for children and adults with Tourette Syndrome (TS) and for everyone involved in their lives; congratulates Tourette Scotland for organising a series of "Activity Days" for people with TS and their families so they can learn more about the disorder in a friendly and understanding environment; believes that the majority of people throughout Scotland do not fully understand TS, including the general public, health professionals and teachers; notes that many children who suffer from TS or associated disorders are not diagnosed at an early stage and that this can lead to the child being victimised and excluded from school as their disorder is mistaken for misbehaving; further notes that services for diagnosis and treatment for people with TS vary significantly across Scotland, and believes that the Scottish Executive should do more to ensure that people with TS get the appropriate level of care required and that health professionals and teachers are given the correct training to recognise TS and associated disorders.
