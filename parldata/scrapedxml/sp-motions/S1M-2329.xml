 *S1M-2329 Ms Margo MacDonald: Afghanistan-That the Parliament notes the UN warning of a humanitarian crisis of 'stunning proportions' unfolding in Afghanistan which will leave over five million people, the vast majority women and children, with a 'fragile grip on survival' this winter; believes that the grief and suffering of innocent victims in the United States of America cannot be answered by the bombing and starvation of equally innocent victims in Afghanistan; recognises that the bombing of Afghanistan has resulted in tens of thousands more people leaving their homes, has handed a daily propaganda victory to terrorists and has caused substantial civilian deaths and injuries; agrees with Mary Robinson, the UN Human Rights Commissioner, that 'it is very hard to get convoys of food in when there is a military campaign,' and calls on Her Majesty's Government to halt the bombing and urge the United States to do likewise.
