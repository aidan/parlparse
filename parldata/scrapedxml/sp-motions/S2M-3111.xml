*S2M-3111 Margaret Mitchell: Falls Prevention Awareness—That the Parliament welcomes the launch by Help the Aged of the first National Falls Awareness Day on 19 July 2005; commends this year’s theme of "Be strong, Be steady", which is about helping older people to keep their independence; recognises the importance of such a day, with its aim of highlighting preventative measures to reduce the chances of falling in later life, and applauds the local initiatives throughout Scotland to promote this aim, including the event at Bonkle Day Care Centre in Lanarkshire organised by the falls team from Wishaw General Hospital. Supported by: Alex Johnstone*, John Swinburne*, Mr Ted Brocklebank*
