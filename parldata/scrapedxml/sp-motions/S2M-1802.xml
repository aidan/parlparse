 *S2M-1802 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Smoking to be Banned at SRU Rugby Matches at Murrayfield—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Rugby Union (SRU) on its decision to ban smoking in all seated areas at all rugby matches played at Murrayfield Stadium and under its jurisdiction; applauds its decision to hand out free advice packs on smoking to fans arriving at two big rugby matches in November; agrees that these actions send out a positive message to all who appreciate the dangers inherent in both smoking and passive smoking; believes that sport should be doing all it can to distance itself from unhealthy practices such as smoking, and hopes that this message sent by the SRU will now be copied by other sporting bodies such as the Scottish Football Association and the Scottish Football League, thereby allowing all spectators at all sporting events to enjoy watching their team without having to inhale other people’s smoke whilst doing so.
