 *S3M-5014 Sarah Boyack: Rugby 7s Up for the Olympics—That the Parliament welcomes the decision taken by the International Olympic Committee in session in Copenhagen to admit rugby sevens to the Olympic movement with effect from the 2016 games in Rio de Janeiro; notes that this decision follows on from the successful inclusion of the sport as part of the Commonwealth Games programme; further notes Scottish Rugby’s belief that the decision will be a major boost to the sport across the globe; recognises that the seven-a-side version of the game was pioneered in Scotland by Melrose butcher Ned Haig and that the code’s world cup trophy, the Melrose Cup, bears the name of its town of origin; wishes the Scotland team every success in next year’s Commonwealth Games, and looks forward to supporting a Great Britain rugby sevens team in 2016.
