*S2M-3215 Christine Grahame: Goats, A Pair of Oxen and a Ploughâ€”That the Parliament, particularly in the year of the Make Poverty History campaign, recognises the important contribution made by Veterinary Assistance and International Development (VETAID), a member of VSF Europa (Veterinaries Sans Frontiers), located at Pentlands Science Park, Penicuik, and a not-for-profit charitable organisation whose remit is working for a reduction in poverty and an increase in food security of people dependent on livestock; commends projects such as the Machakos Project in Kenya, which works with a group of widows who support 40 child or grandparent-led households by providing in some instances two or three goats, a small breeding flock of chickens and training in livestock-keeping and notes that locally-based organisations will receive a pair of oxen and a plough; notes that this typifies the small-scale modestly resourced project which develops self-reliance, and therefore commends VETAID for its simple, direct and effective interventions in making poverty history for some.
