*S3M-4651 Mary Scanlon: Rag Tag ‘n’ Textile, Social Enterprise—That the Parliament congratulates the work of Rag Tag ‘n’ Textile, based in Balmacara near Kyle of Lochalsh and Broadford, Isle of Skye, as a social enterprise teaching traditional textile skills to people with mental health issues; notes that Rag Tag produces and makes a wide range of items that are designed in-house and created in their workshops using donated fabric and wool; further notes that all fabrics used are recycled, saving waste and looking after the environment, and welcomes the fact that the enterprise allows for a significant number of people with a disability or other disadvantage to work alongside non-disabled people and that it offers equal work opportunities, employment rights and obligations to all employees.
