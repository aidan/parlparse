*S3M-2135 Sandra White: Poverty Challenge—That the Parliament notes the failure of the UK Government’s flagship policy of halving child poverty by 2010 and eliminating it by 2020 as figures released by the Office for National Statistics show that almost 4,000,000 children and 2,500,000 pensioners are living in poverty and that the numbers have risen for the second year in a row; notes that one of the reasons identified as being a contributory factor to the rise is the burden of council tax on pensioners which would be removed under the Scottish Government’s proposals to replace the council tax with a fairer form of local taxation, and believes that, given the huge scale of the problem, the inability of the UK Government to tackle this problem, and the pledge by all political parties in the Parliament to do everything that they can to end poverty, support for the Scottish Government’s policies aimed at tackling poverty should be given mature consideration, including the policy for an independent Scotland empowered to tackle these problems head on. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Christina McKelvie*, Alex Neil*, Brian Adam*, Bill Wilson*, Stuart McMillan*, Bob Doris*, Jamie Hepburn*, Willie Coffey*, Kenneth Gibson*
