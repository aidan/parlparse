*S2M-3131 Roseanna Cunningham: National Parks and Poets Laureate—That the Parliament notes the competition being run by the Peak District National Park in England to run a literary competition with the intention of appointing its own poet laureate; recognises that there has long been an inspirational connection between the land and the literary arts and that the lands bounded by Scotland’s national parks have already inspired some of our best-known poetry and song; believes that a post of poet laureate, makar, bard or writer-in-residence would be a positive development for Scotland’s new national parks, and urges the boards of the Cairngorms National Park Authority and Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority to actively consider such a move.
