 *S1M-2314# Dorothy-Grace Elder: Prevention of the Sell Off of Glasgow Council Housing—That the Parliament deplores the fact that Glasgow’s council house tenants have never been offered any costed alternative to a sell-off of their homes to a scheme dependent on private financiers; regrets that all the propaganda from Glasgow City Council has concentrated on only one proposal; demands that the council presents full and truthful projections for the alternative, namely housing redevelopment remaining with the public authority, with all the financial benefits plus protection for tenants and of council jobs, and questions many aspects of the information being presented to councillors and the public, including the production of two documents which, within days of each other, appeared to remove major problems, including funding and job security, which are still outstanding in the housing stock transfer proposal.
