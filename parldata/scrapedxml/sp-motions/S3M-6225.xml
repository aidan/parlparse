*S3M-6225 Rhona Brankin: Scottish Midland Co-operative Society—That the Parliament notes the annual results of the Scottish Midland Co-operative Society Ltd (Scotmid), Scotland’s biggest independent co-operative, including an 18% increase in annual operating profits in challenging economic circumstances; believes that such a financial performance demonstrates that the co-operative model is as relevant and enduring today as when the business was founded over 150 years ago; commends Scotmid’s contribution to the Scottish economy as an employer of over 4,000 people; welcomes the firm’s strong commitment to fair trade and its support for the Think 25 policy, and wishes Scotmid every success in the future as a community business owned and democratically controlled by its members.
