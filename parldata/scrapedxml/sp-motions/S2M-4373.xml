 *S2M-4373 Pauline McNeill: Local Sports Facilities and Reform of the Law of Trusts—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Executive for its commitment to and investment in both elite and community sports facilities but notes with concern the threat to Dowanhill Lawn Tennis Club in the west end of Glasgow which was set up by way of a public trust to the benefit of the people of Dowanhill; condemns the actions of the club committee, many members of which do not live locally, in refusing membership to local families in order to ease the sale to a developer for the creation of flats; calls on the Executive to consider expanding the powers of the Lord Advocate, or other appropriate body, to protect the beneficiaries of a public trust; notes the current lack of remedies available to beneficiaries who, as in the case of small community groups, are not able to draw on considerable financial resources; calls on the Scottish Law Commission to review the law of trust and ensure that there is an affordable mechanism to challenge breach of trust, and finally requests that Tennis Scotland and sportscotland lend their support to the Dowanhill Tennis Action Group’s campaign to ensure that the Dowanhill site is preserved for the recreational use for which it was originally bequeathed and not exploited for the financial benefit of the few. Supported by: Fergus Ewing*, Robin Harper*, Jackie Baillie*, Frances Curran*
