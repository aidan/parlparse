*S3M-1025 Robin Harper: Healthy and Sustainable Food for the 2014 Commonwealth Games—That the Parliament notes the new report, Feeding the Olympics, jointly published by the Soil Association, Sustain and the New Economics Foundation, which calls on London to deliver the promise to be the greenest and healthiest games in terms of the food that it provides and sets out how this can be done; recognises that food plays a vital role in climate change, since a sizeable contribution to Scotland’s greenhouse gas emissions is made by unsustainable systems of food production and distribution; believes that these emissions can be significantly reduced if we shift towards eating organic, local, fresh, and seasonal food and less meat and dairy products, moves which would also help to ensure a healthy future for the young people across Scotland who grow up inspired by the games; further believes that the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Scotland provide an excellent opportunity to promote healthy and sustainable food, and calls on the Scottish Government, therefore, to ensure that the Soil Association’s food for life targets of 75% unprocessed, 50% local and 30% organic food should be set as a minimum standard for catering contracts at the games, alongside the promotion of sustainable fish consumption and a guarantee that any imported food at the games meets fairtrade standards.
