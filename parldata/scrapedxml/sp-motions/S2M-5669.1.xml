*S2M-5669.1 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Dealing with Illegal Money Lenders—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5669) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the significant debt problem in Scotland, a problem that is more serious than in the rest of the United Kingdom; recognises that a main cause of Scotland’s debt crisis is the irresponsible actions of legal money lenders; believes that the causes as well as the consequences of unmanageable debt must be addressed; regrets that current consumer legislation at Westminster is inadequate in protecting vulnerable groups from predatory lending; calls for the Parliament to have appropriate powers to deal with Scotland’s distinct debt problem, and further calls for the removal of dwelling homes from the land attachment method of debt recovery, thereby ending the draconian situation of a person’s home being at risk over a small amount of debt."
