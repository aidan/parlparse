*S2M-5575 Dr Sylvia Jackson: Growing Up with Loch Leven—That the Parliament welcomes pupils from P7 of Fossoway Primary School and S5 and S6 of Kinross High School to the Parliament to tell MSPs about the Wild Words project at a reception on 14 February 2007; notes that the event will highlight the Growing Up With Loch Leven initiative that involves RSPB Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and Perth and Kinross Council to bring school pupils into closer contact with the natural world and the value and beauty of Loch Leven; recognises that the initiative is innovative and cross-curricular and has a huge number of benefits for the pupils of all ages who are involved, and notes that it is not just about token days outside but about providing exciting, challenging and varied experiences throughout children’s time at school and that this demonstrates the benefits that Real World Learning could bring to the Scottish curriculum.
