*S3M-2461 Sarah Boyack: Fuel Poverty and the SWIFT Warm Winter Challenge—That the Parliament commends the efforts of Renewable Devices SWIFT Turbines Ltd to combat fuel poverty in Scotland through its SWIFT Warm Winter Challenge whereby it has offered to donate its annual profits this year to alleviate fuel poverty in a joint initiative with Energy Action Scotland; encourages the business community to take up the challenge and fund the installation of 250 SWIFT wind turbines in fuel-poor homes in Scotland; recognises the value in the installation of the SWIFT Rooftop Wind Energy System, which will have a long-term cost saving for households in fuel poverty as well as providing a green source of energy and reducing our carbon footprint, and notes that, in the wake of the announcement of the closure of the Vestas wind turbine factory in Scotland, this challenge not only supports our fuel poor, but will also demonstrate Scotland’s ongoing commitment to renewable energy.
