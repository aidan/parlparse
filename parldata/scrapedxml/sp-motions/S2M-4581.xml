*S2M-4581 Frances Curran: North Sea Oil Safety—That the Parliament notes the shocking revelations contained in BBC Scotland’s Frontline programme on 14 June 2006 with regard to safety practices in the UK North Sea oil industry sector; notes in particular that considerations of profit were allowed to supersede those of safety, not just on one-off occasions but continually, and that the concerns of workers, expressed via the Oil Industry Liaison Committee, the offshore workers’ union, were ignored by both the industry and the UK Government; commends Bill Campbell, former Shell International Group Auditor, on his bravery and integrity in blowing the whistle on the company for whom he had worked for 24 years and for exposing the dangerous malpractice that was allowed to flourish under the company’s stewardship, and believes that the Parliament should examine the role of the Health and Safety Executive in this matter and consider why it apparently failed to act effectively. Supported by: Carolyn Leckie*, Alex Neil*
