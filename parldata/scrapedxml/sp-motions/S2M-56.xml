*S2M-56# Shona Robison: Location of Scottish Water Customer Management Centre—That the Parliament expresses its concern about the plans by Scottish Water to locate the new customer management centre in Glasgow or Edinburgh with the resulting loss of 75 civil service jobs in Dundee; believes that there should be a full economic impact assessment that takes account of the impact of this move on the local economy in Dundee before the proposal is approved by the Scottish Executive; questions whether the proposal is consistent with the previously stated aim of dispersing civil service jobs, and considers that the Parliament should ensure that any decision on the siting of the customer management centre is subject to public and parliamentary scrutiny.
