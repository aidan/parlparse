 *S3M-8192 Elaine Smith: Women’s Health and Hygiene—That the Parliament recognises the importance of supporting women’s health and wellbeing; is concerned that the purchase of sanitary products is having an increasing financial strain on women earning low incomes and young girls with no personal income; considers that these products are a necessity that are fundamental to the sustainment of good health and hygiene; commends the UNISON Women’s Conference 2010, which saw 200 votes in favour of providing free feminine hygiene products for women on low incomes; recognises that a lack of access to suitable sanitary provision can hinder young girls’ enthusiasm, concentration and general wellbeing in school; considers that schools should ensure that a sanitary product vending machine is readily available in school toilets; considers that access to sanitary products is a developmental issue that has a direct link to a young girl’s health, education and general welfare both in Scotland and across the world, and consequently believes that these items should not be considered to be a consumer luxury but should be available at no charge in healthcare facilities. Supported by: Patricia Ferguson*, Marlyn Glen*, Bill Butler*, Trish Godman* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
