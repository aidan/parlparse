*S3M-5942u Christina McKelvie: Tackling Youth Crime on the Streetâ€”That the Parliament commends the Street, an innovative immersive drama project funded through Regen:fx Youth Trust in Hamilton, which confronts young people with the consequences of destructive and violent behaviour; notes that the Street combines hard-hitting theatre performance with youth work and education to challenge harmful behaviour by young people, highlight the consequences of their actions, and how that impacts on others, and encourage them to question their life choices; further notes that the project not only works with targeted groups of young people who have been identified as being at particular risk of becoming involved in crime but also that the drama is performed by young people who have themselves previously participated in the project; believes that such peer-to-peer discussion about violence, crime and their consequences, backed up by strong professional support, is an effective model for enabling at-risk young people to explore their attitudes and feelings and the choices available to them; further believes that this model has the potential to reduce offending by young people in communities across Scotland, and hopes that funding is found to allow Regen:fx Youth Trust to continue this important project.
