*S2M-46# Dr Elaine Murray: Appeals Against Convictions for Serious Crime—That the Parliament is greatly concerned that the period of time permitted to lodge an appeal against conviction for a serious crime can be incrementally extended over an undefined period; believes that this subjects the victims of these crimes to protracted suffering, and believes that the appeal system should be reviewed.
