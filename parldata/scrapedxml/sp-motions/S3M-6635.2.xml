*S3M-6635.2 Lewis Macdonald: Tourism—As an amendment to motion (S3M-6635) in the name of Iain Smith, insert at end "; regrets that the combination of increased business rates and increased VAT will put Scotland’s tourism industry at a competitive disadvantage, and believes therefore that there is even greater need for the Scottish Government to adopt an approach based on greater transparency and accountability, learning the lessons of the Auditor General’s report on the Gathering as well as other recent events, and to give renewed emphasis to training and skills".
