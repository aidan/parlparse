*S1M-2041 Mr Jim Wallace: Serious Violent and Sexual Offenders—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Executive’s White Paper on serious violent and sexual offenders, fulfilling the Programme for Government commitment to "review the law by 2001 in relation to sexual and violent offenders, including harassment and in particular stalking"; agrees that the public deserves to be protected from the highest risk offenders, and commends the Executive’s proposals for a new sentencing, management and treatment regime for this small group of offenders as an important step in building a Scotland where people are safer and feel safer.
