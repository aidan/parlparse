*S2M-1502 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Ayrshire Cattle Society-That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed relocation of the Ayrshire Cattle Society to England; acknowledges that currently only one-third of its membership is located in Scotland and also notes that technological advances in communications enable the headquarters to be situated anywhere; further notes, however, that, given the huge agricultural benefits and goodwill that the society generates, the relocation of the society out of Scotland would be an irreparable loss to Ayrshire and the entire Scottish farming community, and urges the society to reconsider its relocation proposals.
