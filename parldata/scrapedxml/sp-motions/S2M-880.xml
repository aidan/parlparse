*S2M-880 Christine Grahame: Miss X: Chief Inspector of Social Work Report—That the Parliament notes with concern that following the conviction of James Mercer, Alexander Maben and Ross Douglas in July 2002 of serious assaults on Miss X, there have been three reports into Scottish Borders Council Social Work Department’s handling of the case, the Stallard Report, published in October 2002, the Black Report, published in June 2003 and the Bates Report, published in September 2003 and that thereafter the Minister for Education and Young People announced an inspection of the case by the Chief Inspector of Social Work on 13 June 2003; further notes that the final report with recommendations was sent to Scottish Borders Council on 21 November 2003 and according to the council returned to the inspectorate in December 2003; notes that since December 2003 several senior managers in the council’s Social Work Department with involvement in the case have negotiated early retirement packages which would see them leave their positions by March/April 2004 and therefore, in all the above circumstances, calls on the Scottish Executive to inquire of the Chief Inspector of Social Work the reasons for the delay in publication, with a view to securing publication now.
