*S3M-8010 Bill Kidd: Work Capability Assessment is a Complete Mess—That the Parliament expresses concern following the reported news in the Guardian that Professor Paul Gregg, an architect of employment and support allowance (ESA) is of the opinion that the work capability assessment (WCA) test for ESA "is badly malfunctioning. The current assessment is a complete mess" and calls on the UK Government to further review, reform and fully test the WCA to make it much more sensitive to what sick and vulnerable people can and cannot do before rolling it out nationally to people currently on incapacity benefit.
