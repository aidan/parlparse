*S2M-3353# Rob Gibson: Celebrating the Féisean Movement in the Highlands and Islands—That the Parliament welcomes the findings of a report commissioned by Highlands and Islands Enterprise and the Scottish Arts Council on the Féisean Movement, which was founded on the Isle of Barra in 1981, showing the important contribution of the movement to the tangible economic and demographic benefits associated with our traditional heritage that can build on the renewed sense of pride and of vibrancy amongst young people in the Highlands and Islands and help to strengthen bonds between the people growing up in the area and their sense of place; congratulates all those who have participated in the various Féisean and especially those who helped start off Féisean throughout the Highlands and Islands, and considers that the Scottish Executive should recognise these findings by securing further and greater funding for the movement to safeguard its future for many years to come.
