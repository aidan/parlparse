 *S3M-344 Hugh O’Donnell: North Lanarkshire Schools Pipe Band—That the Parliament congratulates the North Lanarkshire Schools Pipe Band which won the European juvenile championship in Inverness at the end of July 2007; recognises that this is a great accolade for a band that is less than two years old and has been placed in the top three at many events in 2007 alone and that this European award is the band’s highest award to date and recognises the extensive talent that exists within the band, and wishes it the best of luck when it participates in the World Pipe Band Championships at Glasgow Green on 11 August 2007.
