*S1M-3060# Marilyn Livingstone: National Strategy for Survivors of Childhood Sexual Abuse—That the Parliament welcomes the work of the Cross-Party group on survivors of childhood sexual abuse on co-ordinating and developing an outline national strategy for children and adults who have experienced sexual abuse during childhood and, in the light of recommendations made by the recent independent inquiry commissioned by Fife Council following the conviction of David Logan Murphy, believes that the Scottish Executive should actively develop a national strategy, based on the work of the cross-party group, that considers the wide social, health, mental and legal implications of sexual abuse and its impact on survivors and society as a whole.
