*S1M-736 Andrew Wilson: Financing Public Services—That the Parliament expresses its concern at the level of resources allocated to Scotland by Westminster which takes no account of the requirements of Scottish public services, the level of revenues raised in Scotland or of the priorities of the Scottish people; notes in particular that health expenditure is rising faster in the rest of the UK than in Scotland despite the fact that there is no evidence of relative improvement in health standards in Scotland; observes that the latest polling evidence suggests that more than two thirds of Scots want greater powers for the Parliament, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to bring forward proposals for a fairer, more fiscally responsible and more democratically accountable system of funding Scottish public services that allows the Scottish people, through the Scottish Parliament, to make the key choices about the share of the nation’s wealth that should be allocated to public services.
