 *S3M-5241 Robert Brown: Dance School of Scotland—That the Parliament is greatly concerned at the proposal to close Dalrymple Hall, the residential accommodation of the Glasgow-based Dance School of Scotland, the country’s only fully funded centre of excellence for vocational dance and musical theatre, threatening both the viability of the school and the futures of up to 90 promising dancers and performers a year in Scotland who, without accommodation, would be unable to attend the school; calls on the Scottish Government and Glasgow City Council to work together with the University of Glasgow to ensure that the future of this valuable asset to Scotland is secured, and believes that, in the year of Homecoming, which aims to celebrate the rich culture and heritage of Scotland, everything possible should be done to maintain the school’s national and international reputation. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Bill Butler*
