*S3M-3369 Bill Wilson: Guantánamo Bay and Diego Garcia—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by President Obama to close the Guantánamo Bay detention facility; considers that, while this goes some way to restoring the reputation of the United States of America for upholding justice and human rights, the US Government should also close Camp Justice on Diego Garcia and, together with the UK Government, assist the repatriation of those who were forcibly displaced by the latter, should they wish to return, and further calls on both governments to offer the former inhabitants of Diego Garcia and their descendants meaningful compensation for their suffering.
