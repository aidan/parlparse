 *S2M-5306 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Quality of Life for MS sufferers—That the Parliament is concerned that the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) has decided not to recommend the drug Tysabri as a treatment for multiple sclerosis, despite it being highly effective for certain patients, leading to a 60% to 70% reduction in relapses; notes that Tysabri is a licensed drug approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) and SMC only provides advice to NHS boards and their area drug and therapeutics committees across Scotland; notes also that health professionals are expected to take due account of this recommendation when exercising their clinical judgement but that this recommendation does not, however, override the individual responsibility of health professionals to make appropriate decisions in the circumstances of the individual patient, and calls on all NHS boards to acknowledge that clinicians must be able to prescribe this treatment where they believe there is a clinical need, regardless of SMC advice to them.
