*S3M-342 Hugh O’Donnell: New North Lanarkshire Schools—That the Parliament welcomes and looks forward to the opening of the new schools in North Lanarkshire of St Patrick’s Primary in Kilsyth, St Ignatius and Wishaw Academy Primary Joint Campus and Cambusnethan Primary in Wishaw, bringing fantastic facilities and benefits to more than 1,000 pupils across North Lanarkshire; recognises that, when the schools open their doors for the first time, this will bring the total number of schools opened under the first phase of Education 2010 to fifteen in the North Lanarkshire area; recognises that work on all the remaining projects is now underway and that this is a major milestone for Education 2010, and, as planning for phase 2 of Education 2010 progresses, welcomes the commitment of North Lanarkshire Council to improving the school estate throughout North Lanarkshire and providing our pupils, staff and communities with major community assets that can be enjoyed by all.
