*S2M-1899.3 Eleanor Scott: Making the Most of Scotland’s Forests—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1899) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, leave out from first "forestry" to end and insert "forests currently make to the economy and the environment; welcomes the creation and restoration of more than 8,600 hectares of native woodland in the last two years as a start; notes, however, that only 4% of our land is now covered with indigenous trees, and calls on the Scottish Executive to increase funding for forestry grants with a view to extending the national forest with an emphasis on native species and to supporting schemes which maximise the benefits from our forests in addition to reducing our global "forest footprint", such as using Scottish timber for building and waste lumber for biomass for heating, securing better access for the enjoyment of our woodlands, increasing community ownership and management of woodlands and promoting the creation of forest crofts."
