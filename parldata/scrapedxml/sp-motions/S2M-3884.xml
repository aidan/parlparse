*S2M-3884 Shiona Baird: Marine Renewables - Power and Opportunity—That the Parliament congratulates the Carbon Trust on the publication of Future Marine Energy, a report on the potential for wave and tidal power in the United Kingdom; welcomes the conclusions of the report that these emerging renewable energy technologies have the potential to become cost-competitive and could meet up to 20% of current UK electricity demand; notes with interest that this is a similar proportion to that currently supplied by nuclear power; strongly supports the development of offshore renewable technologies and believes that these, combined with energy efficiency measures, will play an important part in Scotland’s and the UK’s energy future, and calls on the Scottish Executive to use its existing powers to support the development of Scotland’s marine renewable industry, enabling this country to fulfil its potential to lead the world in wave and tidal power.
