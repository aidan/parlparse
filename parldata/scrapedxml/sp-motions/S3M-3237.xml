*S3M-3237 Ian McKee: Democracy in Belarus—That the Parliament welcomes the European Parliament’s resolution on the EU strategy towards Belarus, aimed at achieving greater democratisation in the country often branded Europe’s last dictatorship and which sets out the conditions that Belarus is required to meet in order to end the country’s self-imposed isolation from the rest of Europe, urging the Belarusian Government to respect human rights, including guaranteeing freedom for political prisoners, freedom of expression for the media and political parties, and the legal establishment of non-governmental organisations (NGOs); condemns the Belarusian Government for continuing to deny its people the basic right of freedom of speech, and urges the European Union not to renew the period of six months during which travel restrictions imposed on certain Belarusian Government officials have been lifted, unless positive steps towards greater democratisation are clearly visible.
