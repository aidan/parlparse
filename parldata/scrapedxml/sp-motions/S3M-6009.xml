*S3M-6009 Karen Gillon: Travis Trek 6—That the Parliament congratulates Larkhall man Scott Cunningham and his guide dog, Travis, for their fundraising efforts on behalf of the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association, who have raised £85,000 since 2003; notes that on Sunday 28 March 2010 Scott and Travis will begin a seven-day trek along the West Highland Way, their sixth and final long-distance trek in aid of the charity, during which they hope to raise at least a further £15,000 thus breaking a total of £100,000; further notes that Travis is the holder of the title of Scottish Guide Dog of the Year 2009 in recognition of his outstanding efforts with Scott, and wishes both Scott and Travis every success in meeting their target and completing this trek.
