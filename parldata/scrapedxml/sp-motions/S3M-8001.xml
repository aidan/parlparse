*S3M-8001 Patrick Harvie: Ending The SPCB’s Contract with Vodafone—That the Parliament believes that public contracts should not be awarded to companies that deprive the public sector of vital funds by using substantial tax avoidance schemes; supports the campaign by UK Uncut to highlight tax avoidance and set out alternatives to the cuts agenda; notes reports that Vodafone’s recent deal with HM Revenue and Customs reduced its tax liability by almost £6 billion, and urges the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to terminate the Parliament’s contract with Vodafone until the company can demonstrate that it pays the equivalent of the full rate of corporation tax on its profits. Supported by: Bill Wilson*
