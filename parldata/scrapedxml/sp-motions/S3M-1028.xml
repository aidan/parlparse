*S3M-1028 Trish Godman: Scottish Wheelchair Users and their Human Rights—That the Parliament commends The Herald for alerting the public to the ofttimes severe distress and denial of human rights inflicted upon Scottish wheelchair users by the insensitive, penny-pinching and uncaring approach by those in authority to their legitimate expectations and requirements anent the design of wheelchairs and their manufacture, adaptability to individual needs and maintenance programmes; notes that the charity, Quarriers, has stated that, of 105 wheelchair users recently interviewed, over 50 said that their wheelchairs were unfit for purpose and is firmly of the view that this state of affairs is unacceptable in modern Scotland; believes that our wheelchair users should be provided with wheelchairs that equal the best provided elsewhere in Europe; calls on NHS Scotland, supported by the Scottish Executive, to implement forthwith the recommendations contained in the document Moving Forward: Review of NHS Wheelchair and Seating Services in Scotland, and reminds all such strategic decision-makers involved in these matters that the goal should be to offer the best services attainable so that Scottish wheelchair users can lead tolerable lives in their communities.
