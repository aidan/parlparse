*S3M-6637 Claire Baker: Concerns over City of Glasgow College Merger—That the Parliament notes the concern among students and staff regarding the planned merger between Glasgow College of Nautical Studies, Glasgow Metropolitan College and Central College Glasgow to create a new City of Glasgow College; notes that among the issues that are causing the greatest anxiety are the implications of the merger for jobs, terms and conditions for staff, student places, educational provision and the effect on other colleges, such as Stow College; calls on the Scottish Government not to agree to the merger unless these issues can be satisfactorily resolved, and urges the relevant stakeholders and Scottish ministers to redouble their efforts to resolve these issues and put an end to the continuing uncertainty that this proposal has created.
