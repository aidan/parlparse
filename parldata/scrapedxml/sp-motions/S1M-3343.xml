*S1M-3343 Elaine Smith: Abolition of the Record of Needs System-That the Parliament notes the genuine fears of parents and organisations over the proposed abolition of the Record of Needs system for children with special educational needs; expresses concern that the alternative proposal of a "Co-ordinated Support Plan" has not been clearly defined; believes that the "Co-ordinated Support Plan" will result in a reduction of legal rights for children and their parents; further expresses concern that local authorities are not required to carry out a fully comprehensive series of assessments and that "Co-ordinated Support Plans" can only be reviewed every three years, and proposes that consideration be given instead to retaining and improving the current Record of Needs System.
