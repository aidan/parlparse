*S1M-1825.1 Mr Kenneth Gibson: Structural Fundsâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-1825) in the name of Angus MacKay, leave out from "the steps" to end and insert "steps being taken by the Scottish Executive to develop a broader strategy in relation to European funding issues in preparation for enlargement of the European Union, but notes the failure of the Scottish Office to secure the retention of Objective One status for any area of Scotland by re-drawing the regional map as was successfully done for their own regions by the Welsh Office, Ireland, Sweden and Finland, thus depriving the Executive of vital resources needed to develop its Structural Funds Programmes and reducing the scope, impact and likely success of the outcomes sought by both it and the Parliament."
