*S2M-2187# Ms Sandra White: Poverty Task Force for Glasgowâ€”That the Parliament notes the report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), Strategies against Poverty, published on 13 December 2004, which highlights Glasgow as having the worst levels of deprivation in the United Kingdom; expresses concern that the levels of poverty in Glasgow do not seem to be tackled by the current measures being undertaken by both Glasgow City Council and the Scottish Executive; believes that a special task force for Glasgow should be established to ensure that resources are far more effectively channelled into dealing with poverty in the city, and recognises that eradicating poverty will also help communities in Glasgow remove other related problems such as drug cultures, crime and family breakdown.
