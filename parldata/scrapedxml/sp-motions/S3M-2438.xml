 *S3M-2438 Pauline McNeill: An Ethical Census in 2011—That the Parliament expresses its concern over the awarding of a Scottish Census 2011 contract to CACI UK for census printing and data capture services; notes the criticisms that have been expressed by Scottish human rights campaigners and anti-war activists and, particularly, among members of the Muslim community in Scotland about the CACI parent company, headquartered in Arlington, Virginia, United States of America, which has close links to the US Government and has been the subject of legal action in America over alleged involvement in the torture of prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad, Iraq, and calls on Scottish ministers to publicly clarify their position and ensure that the Scottish people can have confidence in the ethical probity of the 2011 Census.
