*S3M-4708 Liam McArthur: Congratulations to Thorfinn FC—That the Parliament congratulates Orkney’s Thorfinn FC on winning the Highland Amateur Cup, defeating Black Isle side, Avoch, the 2006 and 2007 winners, on penalties in a dramatic final at Harmsworth Park, Wick on 8 August 2009; notes that this is the first time since Kirkwall Rovers won the title in 1997 that a side from Orkney has lifted the prestigious trophy; believes that the achievement is all the more remarkable given the comparatively young age of the Thorfinn team, which bodes well for future success, and acknowledges that the closeness of many of the matches in this season’s competition demonstrates the strength and depth of football talent across the Highlands and Islands.
