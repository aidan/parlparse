*S1M-461.3 Tommy Sheridan: Executive's Proposals as set out in the Framework Document on Wider Access to Further and Higher Education—As an amendment to motion (S1M-461.3) in the name of Henry McLeish, leave out from "endorses" to end and insert "regrets the failure of the Scottish Executive’s proposals to deal effectively with the depth of student poverty highlighted in the Cubie Report and believes that only a free higher education system, funded by progressive income tax with no tuition fees either open or hidden, can address this problem, that student grants should be restored to the level recommended by the Cubie Report to reflect the cost of higher education of £6,000 a year and that students should be entitled to housing benefit and income support during vacations."
