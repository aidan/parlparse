 * S2M-2843 Mr Mark Ruskell: Scottish Biodiversity Week, 21 to 29 May 2005—That the Parliament welcomes the huge range of activities scheduled for Scottish Biodiversity Week 2005; congratulates the numerous individuals and organisations participating, predominantly on a voluntary basis, on their enthusiasm; notes that the Scottish Executive’s 2004 Biodiversity Action Grants scheme was oversubscribed by over seven times and that in the last 50 years over 300,000 species globally have become extinct, while one-in-four mammal species and one-in-eight bird species face a high risk of extinction in the near future, and calls on the Executive to take the strongest possible lead to protect and promote biodiversity, both for its intrinsic merit, and for its inextricable link with quality of life, including economic development.
