*S3M-6705♦ Jackie Baillie: See Me Campaign—That the Parliament considers the significant contribution that the see me campaign has made in tackling the stigma and discrimination associated with mental health problems; further notes that it is estimated that as many as one in four Scots will experience some form of mental health problem and that more than half of those with such conditions have experienced stigma or discrimination; recognises that the stigma associated with mental health problems can be more distressing and damaging than the symptoms of the condition itself; believes that it will take a generation to effect lasting change in society, and would welcome continued support for the see me campaign in Dumbarton and across the rest of Scotland.
