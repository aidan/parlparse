*S3M-7068 Jim Hume: 2010 Business Rates, Revaluation, Dumfries and Galloway—That the Parliament recognises the concerns of the Dumfries and Galloway Chamber of Commerce following this year’s business rates revaluation; considers that the rates set on 1 April 2008 failed to take into account the impact of the recession; further notes that the Scottish Government has removed transitional relief, which has resulted in rates increases of up to 200% for some businesses; understands that transitional relief has been retained in England and that Northern Ireland has abandoned the 2010 revaluation altogether; acknowledges the views of the chamber of commerce that the reintroduction of transitional relief is necessary to support businesses; calls on the Scottish Government to conduct an urgent review of the rating appeals process to ensure that businesses have the means to appeal unrealistic rating valuations, and further calls on the Scottish Government to do all that it can to support businesses in Dumfries and Galloway that have been unfairly affected by the revaluation.
