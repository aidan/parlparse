*S2M-1841 Carolyn Leckie: Justice for People Infected by Contaminated Blood Products—That the Parliament condemns the statement by Rt Hon John Reid MP referring to haemophiliacs who may be infected with variant CJD as posing a possible risk to public health; considers that this is an unacceptable further stigmatisation of people with haemophilia and their families who have, for 20 years, been subject to fear, stigmatisation and isolation because of cases where people were infected with HIV/HCV, hepatitis C and now variant CJD through contaminated blood products used in transfusions, and considers that the Scottish Executive’s Health Department should commission an urgent and long-overdue public inquiry into this tragic issue.
