*S3M-194 Bill Wilson: Iraq: Right to Strike—That the Parliament notes with grave concern the death threats against members of the Iraqi Federation of Oil Unions who were recently protesting against the proposed oil law which would effectively cede control of Iraq’s oilfields to multinational companies; further notes that the right to strike is protected by the core conventions of the International Labour Organisation, to which the Iraq Government is a signatory, and accordingly expresses its support for calls for the threat of violence against the oil workers to be withdrawn and for their legitimate right to strike to be recognised should they choose to exercise it.
