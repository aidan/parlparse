*S3M-3856 Mr Frank McAveety: Glasgow Central Mosque Terrorist Threat—That the Parliament condemns any threat to personal liberty or a person’s place of worship; recognises that it is a duty of the free press and media in Scotland to be even-handed when reporting issues of terrorism and threats; expresses disappointment that recent threats to Glasgow Central Mosque and threats to behead one Muslim a week have been under-reported, and calls for the media to ensure that abhorrent acts of terrorism are covered regardless of the perpetrators.
