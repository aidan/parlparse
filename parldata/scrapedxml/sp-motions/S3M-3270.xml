*S3M-3270 Keith Brown: Borrowing Powers for the Scottish Parliament—That the Parliament recognises that one of the major aims of any government is to facilitate sustainable economic growth; acknowledges that the current lack of fiscal powers limits the Scottish Government’s ability to react to changing conditions in a way that is attuned to Scotland’s distinct circumstances; notes that the Northern Ireland Assembly can borrow up to £2 billion, and calls on the UK Government to listen and respond to the growing demands from both inside the Scottish Parliament and beyond for borrowing powers and to take any action necessary to put those powers into place so that Scotland can emerge from the current economic downturn in a strong, competitive position.
