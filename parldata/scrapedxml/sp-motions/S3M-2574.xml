*S3M-2574 Sarah Boyack: Meningitis Research Foundation’s Awareness Week—That the Parliament welcomes the Meningitis Research Foundation’s Awareness Week between 15 and 21 September 2008; notes that meningitis is a disease that infects 12 people every fortnight in Scotland, of whom one will die and two more will suffer life-altering after-effects, such as brain damage, deafness and multiple amputations; further notes that babies and children are most at risk and that more young lives can be saved through raising awareness among clinical practitioners and the public of the early warning signs; encourages continued support for the Scottish meningitis working group to improve awareness of the disease; also notes that continued efforts are needed to improve the uptake of primary vaccinations against invasive diseases, particularly pneumococcal disease, and urges continued support for aftercare, as well as continued support for further research to eradicate meningitis and septicaemia.
