 *S3M-2596 Jamie Stone: Treating Patients who have ME—That the Parliament notes the serious impact on the lives of those who suffer from myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) and chronic fatigue syndrome and the impact on their families and carers; notes that there is a serious shortage of nurses who specialise in treating patients with ME and encourages NHS boards across Scotland to recruit nurses and doctors who are better versed in treating ME to actively combat the disease, and further urges the Scottish Government to dedicate resources to the research and treatment of this debilitating illness.
