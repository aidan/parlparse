*S3M-3214.4 Jeremy Purvis: Forth Crossing—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3214) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from "and welcomes" to end and insert "; condemns the actions of the Scottish Government in bringing before the Parliament a proposal for the Forth Replacement Crossing (FRC) that has no agreed funding package; notes that under the Scottish Government’s plans "a significant number of other very deserving capital projects will have to be displaced to make room for the FRC", and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to bring before the Parliament immediately a prioritised list of capital projects between 2009 and 2016."
