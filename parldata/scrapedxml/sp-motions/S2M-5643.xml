 *S2M-5643 Mr Charlie Gordon: Sale of Weir Pumps—That the Parliament deplores the surprise announcement by Weir Group plc to end over 130 years of world-class engineering by selling its pumps division to Sulzer AG, despite the division’s profitability and full order book, with the ultimate loss of 450 jobs but with no consultation with unions, Scottish Enterprise or local parliamentarians; notes that Weir Group plc has now reversed its previous commitment to relocate its pumps division to a new factory in the Glasgow area, thus rejecting assistance from Glasgow City Council and Scottish Enterprise; further notes Weir Group plc’s rejection in 2004 of an offer of £2.5 million of Regional Selective Assistance to modernise its Cathcart plant; notes that Scottish Development International and Glasgow City Council have assisted Weir Group plc to access new markets in Russia; further notes that Weir Group plc’s secretiveness in this matter meant that other options with the potential to retain jobs, such as Clyde Blowers Ltd’s expressed interest in acquiring Weir Pumps, were not properly considered, and believes that Weir Group plc’s conduct in this matter falls well short of acceptable standards of corporate social responsibility. Supported by: Mr Frank McAveety*, Jackie Baillie*, Trish Godman*, Mrs Mary Mulligan*
