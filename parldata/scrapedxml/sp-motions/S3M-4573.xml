 *S3M-4573 Bill Kidd: US-Russia Nuclear Agreement Confirms the Need to Scrap Trident—That the Parliament welcomes the expressed determination of US President Barack Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to cut back on their nations’ stockpiles of nuclear weapons; considers this diplomatic breakthrough, between two powers that were previously engaged in a massive conventional and nuclear arms race with one another, to be a constructive step towards realising a world free of nuclear weapons, and believes this to be an excellent opportunity for the UK Government to affirm its own commitment toward nuclear disarmament, in compliance with its obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, by ditching the wasteful and ill-advised plans to renew the Trident weapons programme.
