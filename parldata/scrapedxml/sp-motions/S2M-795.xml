*S2M-795# John Swinburne: Council Tax Arrears-That the Parliament notes with concern that Scotland's council tax arrears have now topped £0.5 billion, proving how inefficient local authorities are in collecting the tax; further notes with disbelief the Minister for Finance and Public Services' view that the figures are "encouraging"; considers that the level of arrears is the reason why some council tax payers will have to pay their council tax one month earlier, starting in April this year instead of May; believes that council tax payers, particularly senior citizens, should not be disadvantaged in this manner just because councils have failed to collect their tax timeously, which will result in council tax payments in the month of April where there were none before to come out of some pensioners' meagre budgets, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should allocate the extra £48 million given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the UK pre-budget speech in December 2003, which was ring-fenced for council tax, to alleviate this situation.
