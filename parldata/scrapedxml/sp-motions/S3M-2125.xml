*S3M-2125 Rob Gibson: GM Crops Do Not Prevent World Hunger—That the Parliament congratulates the International Assessment of Agricultural Science and Technology for Development (IAASTD), the agricultural equivalent of the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, for concluding that data on a range of genetically modified crops indicate highly variable yields, greater in some places and less in others; notes the reluctance of the IAASTD to rule out GM crops in future, but that it rightly concludes that if the multi-million pound investment by corporations in transgenic research and development had been applied to improving conventional methods of local food production and distribution then the current world food crisis would have been more successfully addressed; applauds the overwhelming conclusion of IAASTD that small-scale farming and ecological methods provide the way forward to avert the current world food crisis, and therefore welcomes the UK Government’s approval of the IAASTD reports without reservation as confirmed in a written Commons statement by Douglas Alexander MP and encourages the Scottish and UK governments to mainstream the thrust of the IAASTD report in agricultural policy development.
