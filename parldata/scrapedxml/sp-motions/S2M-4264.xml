*S2M-4264 Rosie Kane: Hazizi Family Released—That the Parliament is delighted that the Hazizi family have been released from Yarlswood Detention Centre in Bedfordshire; deeply regrets that they were subjected to a brutal dawn raid on 18 April 2006; agrees that this release once again shows that there was never any need to smash this family’s door in, drag them from their beds, keep them from school and university, drive them from Glasgow to Bedfordshire in a Home Office van and place them into detention; hopes that the Hazizi family recovers soon from its ordeal, and demands that the Scottish Executive recognises that many asylum seekers are taken into detention and removed, despite the fact that their case has not reached an end and that they cannot therefore be labelled as "failed asylum seekers", which is a term that allows politicians to wash their hands of the plight of innocent, vulnerable and frightened individuals and families. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
