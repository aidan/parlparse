 *S2M-4370.4 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Drugs and Hidden Harmâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-4370) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "recognises the complexities of the issues surrounding drug addiction and child safety; believes that it is important to treat parental drug addiction whilst at the same time ensuring that children are protected and their needs met; further believes that negative stereotyping of drug-using parents is counterproductive to the treatment of drug users and thus to the safety of children; acknowledges the positive role of the extended family in providing care and support to children and their parents in drug-using households; calls on the Scottish Executive to recognise and support this by formalising the role played by grandparents and other family members, which is a role currently carried out with no financial assistance, and further calls on the Executive to fully fund and implement a range of integrated services to be offered to drug users within seven days of requesting such assistance to address the needs of children and their drug-using parents."
