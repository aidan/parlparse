 *S3M-3551 Jamie Hepburn: Stop the Part-privatisation of Royal Mail—That the Parliament condemns the proposals by the UK Government to part-privatise the Royal Mail; supports the vision of a wholly publicly owned and integrated Royal Mail Group; believes that the current universal service obligation offered by Royal Mail, including six days a week delivery, must be protected and that the UK Government’s proposals risk fracturing one of the most important public services in the country; notes that over 150 MPs have indicated their opposition to these plans by supporting an early day motion; further believes that the Post Office and Royal Mail have suffered enough from a commercial and profiteering approach to what is, in reality, a vital piece of national infrastructure, and calls on the UK Government to abandon its plans for selling any part of the Royal Mail Group into private hands. Supported by: Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Christopher Harvie*, Rob Gibson*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Alasdair Allan*, Michael Matheson*, Christina McKelvie*, Stuart McMillan*, Sandra White*, Mike Pringle*, Bill Kidd*, Brian Adam*, Willie Coffey*
