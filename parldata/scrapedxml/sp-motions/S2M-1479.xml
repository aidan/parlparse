*S2M-1479 Mary Scanlon: NHS Quality Improvement Scotland Local Report, June 2004, NHS Highland Schizophrenia Standards-That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland's phase 2 peer review of Highland Primary Care NHS Trust's schizophrenia care standards; notes that, of 29 essential criteria, only three were fully met, and of seven desirable criteria, only one was fully met; further notes with particular concern the report's findings that the trust does not record the number of people who have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or for whom one is being considered and that there is not a standard guideline for use consistently across the trust, detailing the procedure to be followed to ensure that an appropriate needs and risk assessment is undertaken at diagnosis and to document the initial plan of care; recognises that schizophrenia is a serious and common medical illness and that many people who have the illness will continue to experience symptoms of varying degrees for many years and will require help and support from a number of different services, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that NHS Highland Primary Care Trust will fulfil its duty of meeting all the care standards.
