 *S3M-1155 Murdo Fraser: Sponsorship of Music Festivals and Events—That the Parliament welcomes the contribution that T in the Park and other music festivals and venues make to Scotland’s music industry and the Scottish economy; believes that T in the Park is essential to Scotland’s music scene and recognises that the festival is the highlight of many music fans’ calendars; welcomes T in the Park’s work in pushing forward the need for eco-friendly events and becoming a "carbon neutral" festival; notes its economic importance to Scotland, bringing in an estimated £7.5 million to the local economy in Perth and Kinross and another £10.5 million to the rest of Scotland; understands the importance of corporate sponsorship to make these festivals a success; believes that more must be done to encourage Scotland’s music festivals and venues and that unnecessary restrictions that could threaten them should not be imposed; further believes that such sponsorship has helped and encouraged Scotland’s music industry, and rejects moves to end the sponsorship of music events by drinks companies which could threaten the future success of events such as T in the Park.
