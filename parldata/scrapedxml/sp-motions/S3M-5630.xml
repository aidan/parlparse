*S3M-5630♦ Sandra White: Threat to Glasgow Jobs—That the Parliament expresses its concern over the announcement by the Student Loans Company to cut 150 jobs in Glasgow and Hillington alongside the transfer of a further 45 jobs to its base in Darlington; believes that, at this time of economic uncertainty, everything that can be done to retain these jobs should be done; fully supports the Public and Commercial Services Union campaign against these cuts, and hopes that in the course of the consultation process wiser counsel will prevail.
