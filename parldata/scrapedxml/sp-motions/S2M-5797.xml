*S2M-5797 Campbell Martin: Laighdykes Playing Fields, Saltcoats—That the Parliament recognises the substantial loss of public open space that has occurred as a result of North Ayrshire Council building a school on Laighdykes playing fields, the only playing fields serving the two towns of Saltcoats and Ardrossan; recognises that the actions of the Labour-controlled council in this matter were very much against the wishes of local people; further recognises that objections were not to a new school but rather to the fact that the Labour councillors chose to build it on public open space and football pitches, despite several other locations being available; commends the actions of Laighdykes Residents Group in co-ordinating opposition to the Labour councillors who implemented these plans, and wishes success at the forthcoming North Ayrshire Council Elections to Laighdykes Residents Group members, Ronnie McNichol and John Hunter, who will be contesting the elections as independent candidates and in the interests of local people.
