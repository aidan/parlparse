*S3M-749 Patricia Ferguson: The Men of Lyon Street—That the Parliament recognises, as Armistice Day approaches, the debt owed to the men of Lyon Street in Cowcaddens; notes that from this small street 211 men were recruited to Her Majesty’s forces in the First World War, 45 of whom lost their lives; accepts that this is thought to be the largest number of fatalities from any street in the United Kingdom; further notes the sterling efforts that are being made to find the original plaque erected in their honour, and, in particular, commends the work of the pupils, teachers and parents of St Joseph’s Primary School who have caused a new plaque to be erected in the school which commemorates the sacrifice made by the families of Lyon Street and marks the location of the original street.
