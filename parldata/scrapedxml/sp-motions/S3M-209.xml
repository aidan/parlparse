 *S3M-209 Bob Doris: Strathclyde Police: Operation Reclaim—That the Parliament welcomes the success of Operation Reclaim, a Strathclyde Police initiative designed to reclaim public areas from gangs involved in antisocial behaviour; notes that it provided a range of coached activities including rugby league, football, golf and cricket centred initially at Red Road playing fields in Springburn with two dedicated, high-visibility police officers in attendance; further notes that the initiative was a success with upwards of 150 young people from all sectors of the community attending on a nightly basis and that there was a 37% reduction in overall crime for the targeted area; observes that the success of the initiative has resulted in increased funding, allowing it to roll out the programme in Royston, Sighthill, Barmulloch and Chirnsyde, and hopes that, while the new Operation Reclaim 5 Star will allow local communities to reclaim their public areas by tackling the problems of antisocial behaviour and social exclusion as well as reducing crime rates, it will also improve youth integration and provide sporting opportunities across the north of Glasgow.
