 *S3M-7290 Aileen Campbell: Biggar Little Festivalâ€”That the Parliament celebrates what is considered another successful Biggar Little Festival; notes that the festival is now in its eighth year and continues to attract a wide range of cultural acts from comedy to music; considers that the festival committee and all the volunteers made a tremendous effort and put on a diverse two-week programme of events, and believes that the success of the Biggar Little Festival is a reflection of the hard work and pride of the people of Biggar and the surrounding areas.
