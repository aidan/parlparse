 *S1M-2865 Robin Harper: Appeal for Colombian Green Presidential Candidate Ingrid Betancourt—That the Parliament notes with concern the recent abduction and kidnapping in Colombia of Ingrid Betancourt, Presidential candidate and Leader of the Colombian Green Party (Partido Verde Oxigeno), together with her campaign manager Clara Rojas; recognises that, despite threats to her life, Ingrid Betancourt has been a brave champion of peace and democracy in her troubled country; expresses concern that the two women remain in captivity and that fears for their safety are growing, and requests that Her Majesty’s Government make the strongest possible representations to the Colombian Government that they do everything in their power to secure the safe release of the two women as a matter of urgency. Supported by: Ms Sandra White*, Dorothy-Grace Elder*, Mr Lloyd Quinan*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*
