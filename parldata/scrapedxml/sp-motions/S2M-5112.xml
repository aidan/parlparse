*S2M-5112 Shona Robison: World COPD Day 2006—That the Parliament regrets that there are an estimated 2.1 million people in the United Kingdom who have chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but remain undiagnosed, 95,000 of whom live in Scotland; welcomes the British Lung Foundation’s campaign for World COPD Day 2006 which aims to find these "missing millions" so that they can be diagnosed early and treated to halt the progression of their disease; regrets that Scotland is the only country in the UK which has not yet taken steps to develop specific policies to improve care for patients with respiratory disease, and supports calls by the British Lung Foundation Scotland for NHS Quality Improvement Scotland to develop clinical standards for COPD to ensure that people living with the condition have access to the best quality care, regardless of where in the country they live.
