*S3M-7073 David Stewart: Sensible Driving, Always Arriving—That the Parliament supports the website initiative being run in Wales called Deadly Mates, which is aimed at encouraging safer driving among young people; believes that, following several fatal road collisions involving young people in the Highlands, urgent action needs to be taken to reduce the deaths of young people on all of Scotland’s roads; supports the calls to introduce measures to ensure that young people drive more safely, including a mandatory display of a P-plate for 90 days after successful completion of a driving test, limiting the size of a car’s engine to be driven by people under 25 and introducing a graduated licence scheme that incorporates night driving, motorway driving and driving observation, and urges the Scottish Executive and the Department for Transport to work together to consider implementing these measures to ensure that no more young people are needlessly killed or seriously injured on Scotland’s roads.
