*S3M-787 Bill Wilson: Cuba’s Sustainable Development—That the Parliament, while encouraging Cuba to become a more democratic and open society, nonetheless congratulates that country on achieving, as reported in the WWF’s Living Planet Report 2006, both a global ecological footprint of less than 1.8 hectares per person and a rating of over 0.8 on the United Nations Development Programme’s Human Development Index, thus being the only country in the world to meet minimum criteria for sustainability; further notes that this has been achieved despite an ongoing boycott by the United States of America, a country with a global ecological footprint of over 9 hectares per person; expresses its condemnation of this boycott and of the USA’s continued operation of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and flouting of the Geneva conventions, and calls on all the governments of the world to learn from Cuba how to improve standards of health, welfare and education for their citizens with minimal environmental impact.
