*S3M-4502 Jackie Baillie: Kibble Palace—That the Parliament acknowledges the Argyll and Bute origins of the Kibble Palace in Glasgow’s Botanic Gardens; notes that the unique glasshouse was first built in Coulport on the shores of Loch Long by wealthy Glasgow merchant John Kibble; further notes that the glasshouse was dismantled in 1872 and floated up the Clyde on a barge before being reassembled and enlarged to become the Kibble Palace; considers that Coulport, a waterfront location for many wealthy Glaswegian businessmen in the 19th century, is an important part of the history of one of the most important and unique structures in Glasgow architecture, and encourages anyone who has not visited the Kibble Palace to go along to the Botanic Gardens this summer.
