 *S1M-3640.1 Tommy Sheridan: Finance Committee, Public Private Partnerships-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3640) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from "and commends" to end and insert "but regrets that the report does not reject outright the principle of public private partnerships in recognition that this method of financing public capital projects represents poor value for the Scottish taxpayer, a fact which is accepted by the Scottish Trade Union Council and UNISON representing public sector workers who state that the consequences of public private partnerships, reduced levels of service, poorer quality systems and buildings and the fragmenting of any public service staff team, have meant that team working, joined-up service delivery and better public services have not been delivered; accepts the findings of a MORI poll taken across Scotland by UNISON in May 2001, where 91% of the public said that they did not want their public services delivered by private firms; believes that, given the underspend of the Scottish Executive to date of Â£1.8 billion, the use of public private partnerships is not necessary; condemns Her Majesty's Government for its failure to implement the revised Acquired Rights Directive (TUPE) four years after it was passed by the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, and calls on the European Commission to fine Her Majesty's Government for its failure to implement the directive."
