*S3M-3091 Des McNulty: Pending Decision of the Office of Rail Regulation—That the Parliament notes the pending decision of the Office of Rail Regulation (ORR) on the planned expansion of rail services on the east coast main line between London and Scotland; recognises that there are competing applications for scarce track capacity on sections of the east coast route; understands that new services that publicly-franchised inter city east coast service operator National Express East Coast has offered to run from December 2009 include additional services to Scotland, that the additional services will deliver much-needed extra capacity of thousands of extra seats per day and create around 50 new jobs, a number of which are likely to be in Scotland, and that the proposed new timetable will significantly reduce average journey times between London and Scotland, and therefore calls on the Scotland Office and Scottish Government ministers to ensure that Scotland’s interests are effectively communicated to ORR and taken into account by them in allocating any available capacity.
