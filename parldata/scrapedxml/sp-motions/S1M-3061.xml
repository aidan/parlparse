*S1M-3061# Marilyn Livingstone: ME and Loss of Education—That the Parliament notes ME Awareness Week, beginning on 12 May 2002; commends research conducted in England by Dr Betty Dowsett and Jane Colby which suggests that more than 50% of pupils’ long-term school sickness absence results from ME; recognises that a considerable percentage of such pupils miss many years of education and social development, and believes that the Scottish Executive should take the necessary steps to identify the extent of the problem in Scotland and to address actively the problem of ensuring that young Scots who lose out on education and social development as a result of ME are not handicapped for life by such loss.
