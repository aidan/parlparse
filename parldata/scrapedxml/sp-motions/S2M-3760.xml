*S2M-3760 Rob Gibson: Buy Local for the Best Food—That the Parliament agrees with Rick Stein’s Christmas message that to source the best food, families should buy local produce, praising the heroism of those who persist in growing and making quality traditional food that is gaining increased recognition for its tasty, healthy qualities but as yet is unavailable in quantities that supermarkets deal in; notes the prolonged battle to win government support for a favourable rate of carriage for small quantities of product to reach markets, seeks simplification of regulations and deplores the lack of production facilities such as local abattoirs in an agricultural system in Scotland that is largely geared to quantity production dictated by supermarket specifications rather than taste, and calls on all MSPs to champion the Food Heroes Christmas Message.
