 *S2M-63# Ms Sandra White: Social Inclusion Partnershipsâ€”That the Parliament recognises that the current system of social inclusion partnerships has been the subject of much criticism and controversy, including allegations of fraud and cronyism, and has failed in its objective of reducing poverty; notes that a report for the Scottish Executive by Cambridge Economic Associates Ltd highlights serious weaknesses in the operation of social inclusion partnerships, and therefore considers that the Executive should urgently review its anti-poverty and social inclusion strategies and take immediate steps to replace social inclusion partnerships with a system that is open, transparent and publicly accountable and that will focus resources directly to local communities in order that poverty is effectively tackled.
