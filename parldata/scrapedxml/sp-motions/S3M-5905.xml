 * S3M-5905 Stuart McMillan: Recommendation to Keep Princes Gate in East Dunbartonshireâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the Local Government Boundary Commission (LGBC) for Scotland to adopt its revised recommendations, without change, as its final recommendations to Scottish Ministers and therefore to keep Princes Gate development and an adjacent potential affordable housing site within the East Dunbartonshire local authority area; notes that the commission stated that it had sufficient information to make a final recommendation and that neither a local inquiry nor further public consultation was necessary; acknowledges the concerted campaign orchestrated by local residents, alongside local councillors, to fight to keep Princes Gate in East Dunbartonshire, and congratulates them all on their victory.
