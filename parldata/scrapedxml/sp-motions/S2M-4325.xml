 *S2M-4325 Carolyn Leckie: Condemnation of Attacks by Egyptian Police on Pro-Justice Reform Protesters—That the Parliament notes with concern events in Egypt where, following protests in support of the independence of the judiciary between 24 and 27 April 2006, campaigners for justice reform were attacked by riot police and around fifty were arrested; notes that, according to the New York Times, up to 10,000 riot police were deployed in central Cairo on 27 April, beating judges and their supporters who had come to express solidarity with judges, Hisham Bastawisi and Mahmoud Mekki, at their disciplinary hearing at the Ministry of Justice, the two judges having exposed fraud in the recent parliamentary elections; further notes that journalists covering the protests were attacked and threatened by police and, in a separate incident, the chief of the Al Jazeera TV bureau was also arrested; condemns the actions of the Egyptian police in attacking the protesters as well as their further detention under a 15-day extension on charges of disturbing public peace and order; calls on the Egyptian authorities to show respect for human rights and the independence of the Egyptian judiciary by releasing the detainees without delay, and opposes this attempt to silence voices in the judiciary and the media who have exposed electoral fraud, state violence and corruption.
