*S1M-835# Michael Russell: Irvine Pensioners' Petition Against Sheltered Housing Cuts-That the Parliament commends the pensioners of Irvine for their vigorous campaign against cuts to the provision of warden services to sheltered housing complexes in North Ayrshire; supports the aims of their 700 signature petition, lodged with the Parliament's Public Petitions Committee, which highlights the dangers which elderly people will face if the warden service is removed at weekends and which rejects the council's argument that community alarms are a substitute, particularly given that the alarms, which were previously free for many pensioners, are now to cost over £100 a year and urges the Scottish Executive to undertake an enquiry into the provision of warden services nationally and, pending this, expects North Ayrshire Council to take heed of the strength of feeling in the local community and suspend plans to cut back the service.
