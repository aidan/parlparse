 *S3M-5576 Jackie Baillie: Hands off Parklands Special School—That the Parliament notes with concern that Argyll and Bute Council is reviewing the role of Parklands Special School, which provides quality education for profoundly and multiply-disabled children and young people; understands that this review has come about because of the declining school roll; recognises that there is a presumption to include pupils with additional support needs in mainstream education; considers that mainstream education is not always the best solution for pupils with multiple and complex needs; acknowledges the quality and value of the work undertaken by the staff at Parklands Special School; believes that any proposal that involves closing or substantially altering the school would mean a great loss to the community of Helensburgh and Lomond, and therefore calls on Argyll and Bute Council to continue support for the school in its current role. Supported by: Des McNulty*, Rhona Brankin*, Pauline McNeill*, Marilyn Livingstone*, Robin Harper*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Mr Frank McAveety*, James Kelly*
