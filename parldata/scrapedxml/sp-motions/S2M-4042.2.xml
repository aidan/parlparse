*S2M-4042.2 Michael Matheson: Architecture—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4042) in the name of Patricia Ferguson, leave out from "its vital role" to end and insert "that our buildings have a critical role to play in maintaining and enhancing the quality of Scotland’s urban and rural communities; notes the progress made to date on the Scottish Executive’s policy on architecture, and calls on the Executive to ensure that future national architectural policy places greater emphasis on local authorities developing their own local architectural policy."
