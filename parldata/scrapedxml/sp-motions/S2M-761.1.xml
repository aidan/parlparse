*S2M-761.1 Mary Scanlon: Improving Scotland's Homes-As an amendment to motion (S2M-761) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the report of the Housing Improvement Task Force; recognises that housing stock transfer to community-based housing associations gives tenants far more say in the way their housing is run, giving tenants greater rights and responsibilities, and therefore believes that, to improve the standard of housing for everyone in Scotland, it is necessary to step up the process of devolving control of housing from local authorities to community-based housing associations, housing co-operatives or a range of other providers to give tenants a real choice of landlord and a real say in the management of their homes."
