*S3M-1642 Keith Brown: United Nations World Autism Awareness Day—That the Parliament recognises the first UN World Autism Awareness Day on 2 April 2008; encourages the UK Government to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities; supports fully the Convention’s commitments to combating prejudice and raising awareness of the capabilities and contributions of disabled people, including those with autism; further recognises that there is a lack of widespread awareness that autism affects one in 100 people in the United Kingdom; believes that all public, private and voluntary sector organisations should strive to serve the needs of people with autism; calls for greater understanding so that people with autism can enjoy the same rights and freedoms as everyone in society, and signals its firm commitment to supporting those with this complex, lifelong and often very serious condition by supporting the ratification of the UN Convention. Supported by: Ken Macintosh*, Kenneth Gibson*, Robin Harper*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Alasdair Allan*, Bill Kidd*, Robert Brown*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Trish Godman*, Stuart McMillan*, Aileen Campbell*, Bashir Ahmad*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Jamie Hepburn*, Christina McKelvie*, Andrew Welsh*, Alex Neil*, Elaine Smith*, Christine Grahame*
