*S3M-1924 Sandra White: Glasgow’s Rich Architectural Heritage—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that, after almost two decades of wrangling over ownership, the Egyptian Halls in Union Street, Glasgow, widely regarded as one of Alexander "Greek" Thomson’s greatest commercial masterpieces, will, after years of neglect, see restoration work begin early in 2009, which in turn will serve to support the ongoing rejuvenation of Union Street and to highlight Glasgow’s unrivalled eclectic architectural mix, and hopes that this positive outcome will serve as a catalyst to resolve other long-running disputes which threaten some of Glasgow’s most iconic buildings, such as the Lion Chambers, an A-listed building in Hope Street famed for its dramatic "Scottish Skyscraper" style which was once the hub for the artisan community in Glasgow and which to this day still attracts international acclaim and interest.
