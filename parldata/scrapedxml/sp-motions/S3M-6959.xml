*S3M-6959 Bob Doris: The Nation Remembers Scottish Football Legend Jock Stein—That the Parliament commends the Scottish Football Association for deciding to hold a minute’s applause before the Scotland versus Lichtenstein match at Hampden Park on Tuesday 7 September 2010 in honour of the Scottish football legend Jock Stein; notes that Jock Stein died suddenly in Cardiff 25 years ago on 10 September 1985, shortly after a Scotland versus Wales World Cup qualifying match that saw the team win its group; acknowledges the fantastic response from the Tartan Army during the minute’s applause; recognises this as a tribute both to big Jock’s memory and to the thousands of fans who joined together irrespective of club loyalties to support their country and remember a true Scottish football legend, and further welcomes plans for a similar tribute at Celtic Park on Saturday 11 September 2010. Supported by: Hugh O’Donnell*, Stuart McMillan*, Stewart Maxwell*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Jim Hume*, Gil Paterson*, Jamie Hepburn*, Robin Harper*, Bill Butler*, Liam McArthur*, Brian Adam*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Aileen Campbell*, Cathy Jamieson*, Elaine Smith*, Trish Godman*
