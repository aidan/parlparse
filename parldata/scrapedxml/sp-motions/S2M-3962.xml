*S2M-3962 Richard Lochhead: Shetland Box—That the Parliament welcomes the resolution of the European Parliament of 14 February 2006 relating to the Shetland Box which received the overwhelming backing of all political groups; notes that the resolution recognises the socio-economic importance of the Shetland Box area to communities in the north of Scotland; further notes that the European Parliament agrees with the view of the European Commission’s Scientific, Technical and Economic Committee for Fisheries (STECF) that the Shetland Box is possibly more important now than it was at the time of the Box’s establishment; further notes that the European Parliament resolution highlights the fact that the STECF suggested that eliminating the Shetland Box might result in an increase in fishing effort in the area and that any such increase should be avoided; welcomes the European Parliament’s call that the Shetland Box be kept in place should the commission’s proposed further evaluations of the Box take longer than the three-year period currently anticipated, and calls on the Scottish Executive to endorse the views of the European Parliament and to work to ensure that any decisions taken in the EU Council on the matter are in line with the European Parliament’s resolution.
