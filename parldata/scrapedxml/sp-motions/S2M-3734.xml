*S2M-3734 Mr Jamie McGrigor: Central Heating—That the Parliament notes that the coming winter is predicted to be one of the coldest in recent years; further notes that many pensioners and people on low incomes in Scotland have already had their central heating systems upgraded, paid for and installed as part of the Warm Deal and the central heating programme but is concerned that a significant number of people are having to wait many months for inspections, surveys or work relating to the schemes to be carried out; believes that at least some of the delays are due to work only being able to be carried out by companies approved and contracted to Eaga Partnership Ltd and further believes that more work could be carried out by local contractors, thus reducing some of the waiting times, and calls on the Scottish Executive to look at the possibility of local companies playing a larger role in installations and also in the delivery of the scheme in general to ensure that those entitled elderly or vulnerable people in Scotland get the heating system they desperately need.
