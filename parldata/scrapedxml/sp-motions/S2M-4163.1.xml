*S2M-4163.1 Murdo Fraser: Growing a Knowledge Economyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-4163) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the valuable contribution made by the further and higher education sectors to the Scottish economy, particularly their success in attracting overseas students; notes, however, the poor levels of knowledge transfer in the economy and that, although Scotland secured 17% of all UK patents, only 1.5% of GDP was invested in research and development and only 0.59% of this was successfully commercialised, and believes that a more competitive economic environment would encourage higher levels of commercial activity and help secure additional external funding for the sector."
