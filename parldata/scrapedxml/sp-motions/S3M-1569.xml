*S3M-1569 Hugh Henry: Parliamentary Scrutiny of Local Income Tax—That the Parliament regrets the non-publication of the modelling used to calculate the Scottish Government’s local income tax plans; believes that such information is vital to allow the Parliament to hold ministers to account; further believes that this non-publication undermines the democratic process, and calls on Scottish Ministers as a matter of urgency to provide the information requested to be placed in the Scottish Parliament Information Centre.
