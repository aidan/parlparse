*S2M-3788 Margaret Mitchell: Lanarkshire Health Accident and Emergency Consultation—That the Parliament  is disappointed at the decision taken by the board of NHS Lanarkshire to omit from A Picture of Health, its accident and emergency care public consultation document, the option to keep all three accident and emergency departments within Lanarkshire open; believes that it is essential that the consultation process should include the proper scrutiny and appraisal of the possibility of retaining all three accident and emergency departments; further believes that, if NHS Lanarkshire has a strong and overwhelming case for the retention of only two accident and emergency departments, then it should have no difficulty in convincing the public that this is the way forward, and therefore calls on the board to ensure that it is included as an option for the reconfiguration of services in Lanarkshire in order to give patients an influential voice in the future of the health service and their own care.
