*S1M-1778# Ms Sandra White: River Clyde Improvement—That the Parliament commends the work of the Glasgow Humane Society’s river rescue service, in particular the society’s George Parsonage who has worked with dedication on the Clyde for many years; notes however with concern that despite recent improvements in water quality the Clyde still suffers from pollution caused by sewage and rubbish, hindering the work of the society; notes that much of the riverside is neglected, decaying and overgrown, and therefore believes that consideration should be given to the introduction of greater sanctions on individuals and companies dumping rubbish and sewage in the river and to the setting up of a national river authority consisting of representatives from the relevant local authorities to ensure that the Clyde and its banks are properly managed and maintained.
