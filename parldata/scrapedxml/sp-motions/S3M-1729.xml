 *S3M-1729 Aileen Campbell: The Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme—That the Parliament notes with concern the effect of changes to the Seasonal Agricultural Workers Scheme that have effectively cut the labour supply for Scotland’s fruit farms, which usually employ up to 10,000 people a year; supports the call by the National Farmers Union to allow at least a further 5,000 workers to enter the UK for seasonal agricultural work, and believes that such situations can best be remedied by powers over immigration and asylum being returned to the Scottish Parliament. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Stuart McMillan*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Brian Adam*, Sandra White*, Christine Grahame*, Patrick Harvie*, Jamie Hepburn*, Rob Gibson*, Alex Neil*, Gil Paterson*
