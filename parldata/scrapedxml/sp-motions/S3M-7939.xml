 *S3M-7939 Patrick Harvie: Reduction in Animal Testing—That the Parliament notes with concern the reported use of 494,584 animals in experiments in Scotland in 2009; is encouraged by what it sees as the significant decrease of over 50,000 animals from 2008 to 2009 but considers this number to still be too high; believes that the views of the Scottish public should be taken into account when the UK Government makes decisions on animal experimentation, and would support a year-on-year reduction strategy to minimise animal suffering in Scotland.
