 *S1M-3527# Ms Sandra White: Community Police—That the Parliament recognises the extremely effective role played by community police officers in combating crime, particularly youth crime; notes that such officers are often the most visible and recognisable police presence in their communities and recognises the crucial role that they play in providing high quality policing and fostering links with the communities they serve; regrets that these officers are often removed from their vital community role to perform other police duties, and believes that the Scottish Executive should encourage community policing and provide the necessary resources to ensure the provision of adequate numbers of community police officers.
