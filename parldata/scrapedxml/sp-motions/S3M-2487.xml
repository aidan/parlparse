*S3M-2487 Murdo Fraser: Black Watch Heritage Appeal—That the Parliament supports the campaign launched by the Black Watch Heritage Appeal to raise £3.2 million to secure the future of Balhousie Castle in Perth, the historic headquarters and museum of the Black Watch; notes that the funds are required to purchase Balhousie Castle, which is owned by the Ministry of Defence, and to carry out improvements to the building such as new spaces for exhibitions and to host visiting school and tourist groups; believes that Balhousie Castle is central to the Black Watch and Scotland’s military heritage and that the headquarters must be preserved for the Black Watch, one of the most distinguished and finest fighting regiments in history, and wishes the campaign success.
