*S1M-3783# Christine Grahame: Litter Louts—That the Parliament notes the concerns of many people regarding the blight of litter in towns, the countryside and on the seashore, illustrated in the correspondence from pupils at Chirnside Primary School, Duns, which highlighted the increased risk of accidents to children, pets and livestock as a consequence of, for example, broken glass and discarded polythene bags; notes that traffic accidents can arise if drivers take avoidance measures when confronted with debris on our roadways and motorways and that the effect on tourism and its consequences to the local and national economy can only be deleterious; further notes that the pupils drew attention to the lack of litter bins, the impact of fast food outlets, the cut in refuse collections and the culture of disregard for the environment and that it may even be regarded by some as "cool" to throw away litter, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should consider the following measures: (a) providing education from an early age with accompanying publicity to bring about a culture change of regard for our environment and bring us into line with our European neighbours, (b) endorsing stiffer fines and penalties for litter louts, including community service in clearing litter, (c) being more committed to recycling and providing more assistance to local authorities who have a track record in recycling provision, (d) considering measures, including legislation, to make it mandatory that fast food outlets clear litter from their environs and (e) commissioning a questionnaire for tourists to ascertain their views on the cleanliness or otherwise of our towns, countryside and seashore.
