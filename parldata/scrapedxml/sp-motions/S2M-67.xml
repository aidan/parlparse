*S2M-67# Dennis Canavan: Scottish Premier League's Treatment of Falkirk Football Club—That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Scottish Premier League (SPL) to reject the application from Falkirk Football Club, as champions of the Scottish Football League's First Division, to join the SPL, despite the fact that the SPL stadium criteria would be met both by the club's new stadium, under construction at Westfield, and by the Excelsior Stadium at Airdrie, of which Falkirk Football Club would have guaranteed use for all SPL home fixtures for the 2003-04 season, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make it a condition of any future public funding of SPL members that the criteria for admission to the SPL do not infringe any principles of natural justice and that any application for admission is assessed in an open and accountable manner.
