 *S3M-7430 Bill Kidd: UKBA Contract Impact on Supported Employment—That the Parliament expresses serious concern regarding what it sees as the knock-on effect of the UK Border Agency’s (UKBA) decision to cancel its accommodation contract with Glasgow City Council and, in particular, the impact on the Blindcraft workshop that manufactures furniture used in asylum seekers’ accommodation and the part of its warehouse that is used as a store by social work services for personal possessions of asylum seekers; considers that, as a result of the UKBA’s decision, jobs at the workshop are threatened, with many of the workers being disabled people who will have difficulty securing work elsewhere, and calls on the UK Government to reverse its decision. Supported by: Kenneth Gibson*, Patrick Harvie*, Sandra White*, Bill Wilson*
