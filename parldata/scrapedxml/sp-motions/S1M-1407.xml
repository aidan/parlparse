 *S1M-1407 Fergus Ewing: Balnain House-That the Parliament is gravely concerned that the closure of Balnain House in Inverness would be a damaging blow to traditional music not only in the Highlands but in Scotland as a whole; notes that since 1993 Balnain House has hosted over 500 concerts, has provided an intensive education programme of 15 different classes which run throughout 36 weeks of the year, has been used as an education outreach centre for 12 local schools, has developed as a meeting point, and has generally come to be regarded as a unique centre of Highland and Scottish culture; notes that Balnain House has received little financial support from the Scottish Arts Council (SAC), and urges both the SAC and the Scottish Executive to give immediate consideration to finding a means to ensure that Balnain House can continue as a cultural centre of excellence.
