*S1M-3239 Brian Adam: Aberdeen Council Housing Stock—That the Parliament notes that over the last four years more than £3 million of public money and tenants’ rents has been spent by Aberdeen City Council in investigating stock transfer; further notes that after only a few months the tenants’ representatives on the Council Housing Options Working Group (CHOWG) rejected wholesale stock transfer and repeated that rejection in the recent survey, and calls on Aberdeen City Council to endorse the views of the tenants without any further cost to the rents such as an expensive ballot.
