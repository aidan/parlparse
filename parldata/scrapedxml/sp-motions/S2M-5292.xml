S2M-5292 Rosie Kane: Need for Integrated Free Public Transport in Scotland—That the Parliament believes that global warming is currently the greatest threat posed to the future of humanity and the planet; considers that grave threats need radical solutions, yet Scotland is unlikely to achieve the ambitious targets set by the Scottish Executive while it continues to pursue car-friendly road-building policies, and therefore agrees to support the phasing-in of an integrated free public transport system throughout Scotland which would reduce greenhouse gas emissions, putting Scotland at the forefront of efforts to save the planet, reduce congestion, thus saving hundreds of millions of pounds for Scottish businesses, and provide a huge boost to the Scottish economy through increasing the disposable income of low-paid households who are the most likely to use public transport.
