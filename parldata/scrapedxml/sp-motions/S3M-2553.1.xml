 *S3M-2553.1 John Scott: Hill Farms and Less Favoured Areas—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2553) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end "notes the burden of increased costs for hill farmers and crofters, notably fertilisers, fuel and transport, coupled with the ongoing challenges of farming on some of the most disadvantaged land in Europe, and therefore agrees with the Royal Society of Edinburgh’s report in condemning the UK Government’s policy of ending direct support for Scottish producers after 2013."
