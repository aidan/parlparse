*S3M-5758 Kenneth Gibson: Alcohol Pricing—That the Parliament believes that the implementation of policy establishing minimum pricing requirements for a unit of alcohol would correlate with the alleviation of alcohol-related problems and the promotion of a healthier nation; considers that overwhelming evidence from academic and first-hand sources, most recently from Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems, confirms that there is a strong linkage between the price of alcohol and consumption; further considers that controls on the price and availability of alcohol are recognised as two of the most effective methods for limiting alcohol-related problems, and further believes that failure to execute changes, by, for example, kicking the issue into touch by way of an alcohol commission, signifies a refusal to acknowledge that alcohol is one of Scotland’s big three killers and that an estimated £2.25 billion is lost annually from the Scottish economy due to alcohol.
