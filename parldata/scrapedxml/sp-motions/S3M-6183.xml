*S3M-6183 Cathy Peattie: Remember the Dead, Fight for the Living—That the Parliament supports International Workers’ Memorial Day on 28 April 2010, which this year has the theme, unions make work safer; notes that this is the first year that the day has been officially recognised by the United Kingdom; believes that formal recognition will reinforce the significance of the day and raise awareness of the millions of workers who are injured or die from accidents and diseases at work, and the 160 million who fall ill each year due to unsafe, unhealthy or unsustainable work and workplaces; notes that such deaths greatly exceed the number of deaths caused by war and that many would be preventable by improved health and safety; notes that events will be held throughout Scotland, including a wreath-laying ceremony at noon on 24 April in Falkirk Municipal Buildings; calls for the day to be widely observed in Scotland through action to improve safety and provide a healthier working environment, and congratulates the trade union movement on its perseverance and dedication to making workplaces safer.
