 *S2M-3137 Shiona Baird: Fair Milk Prices for Farmers—That the Parliament shares the anger of NFU Scotland over continuing exploitation of dairy farmers by the big four supermarkets, Tesco, Asda, Morrisons and Sainsbury’s, and milk processors; notes new research by the Milk Development Council which reveals that, despite supermarkets increasing the price of a litre of milk by 3.5 pence, virtually none of that increase has been seen by the farmers; remains concerned that farmers are paid less than the costs of producing milk, and calls again for an independent supermarket regulator and a stronger code of conduct to control the trading practices of the big four supermarket chains.
