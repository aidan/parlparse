*S3M-921 Jim Hume: Nitrate Vulnerable Zones—That the Parliament notes with concern the Scottish Government’s flawed proposals on nitrate vulnerable zones; further notes with regret Scottish Government advice that the already long-awaited Scottish Rural Development Programme cannot be approved until the NVZ Action Programme has been formally set out; recognises the potential cost to farmers of having to increase farm slurry storage capacity as a result; notes in particular that the proposals, if implemented, will increase the closed period from the current four weeks to up to 26 weeks which will place intolerable pressure on pig, poultry and cattle farmers, and calls on the Scottish Government to review the proposals urgently and take into account the views of those in the industry and the scientific evidence that indicates that the closed period should be significantly shorter than what is proposed.
