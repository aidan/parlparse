*S2M-3631 Shona Robison: Point of Delivery—That the Parliament notes the recent Macmillan Cancer Relief report, Free at the Point of Delivery?, which highlights the financial burden that travelling to and from hospital for regular treatment places on cancer patients; is concerned that there is no record of the percentage of cancer patients in Scotland who are currently eligible for reimbursement of their travel costs under the Hospital Travel Costs Scheme, possibly leaving many cancer patients on low incomes without much-needed financial support; considers that action is needed to increase the number of eligible patients who are claiming reimbursement under the scheme, through improved awareness and advice, and urges the Scottish Executive to look at extending the scheme to cancer patients not receiving benefits, as is done in the non-means-tested Highlands and Islands scheme.
