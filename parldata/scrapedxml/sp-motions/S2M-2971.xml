 * S2M-2971 Mr Adam Ingram: Tartan Army Supporting the Children of Belarus—That the Parliament congratulates the Tartan Army on its generosity in supporting child cancer victims of the Chernobyl disaster on the occasion of Scotland’s recent World Cup tie against Belarus; notes that an appeal by the Chernobyl Children’s Lifeline charity to the 1,500 travelling fans produced a response on a scale never before seen by the Children’s Cancer Hospital in Minsk, providing every child in the hospital with gifts of toiletries, toys, drawing books, jotters and pencils and sweets with much stock for future use; thanks the fans, especially those who participated in an organised visit to the hospital, for being such outstanding ambassadors for their country, drawing widespread praise from the Belarussian media; regrets the lack of coverage in the Scottish media for the goodwill and charitable endeavours of the Tartan Army, and condemns those sections of the media that seek to belittle or scorn its friendly participation on the international stage.
