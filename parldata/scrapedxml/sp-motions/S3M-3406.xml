*S3M-3406 Claire Baker: No Place for Chauvinism in 21st Century Scotland—That the Parliament calls for Dr Louise Richardson, the new principal of St Andrews University, to be offered honorary membership of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews as were her male predecessors; believes that discrimination on the basis of gender has no place in 21st century Scotland; considers that the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews is the home of golf and sets an example for the game to millions of players across the world and millions of visitors to Scotland; believes that the Year of Homecoming 2009 provides an opportunity for the club to drop such an outdated and discriminatory policy, and calls on politicians from across the political spectrum, starting with the First Minister, to support calls for the principal to be offered membership regardless of gender and for the club to drop its policy against allowing women members.
