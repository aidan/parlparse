*S3M-7016 Bill Kidd: Imminent Trident Decision Still Pendingâ€”That the Parliament expresses concern that, although it has been reported that the main gate decision on replacing the Trident system will be put back beyond the next UK general election, from 2014 to 2015, another decision, the initial gate, is due to be made by the end of 2010; notes that this decision could authorise the spending of billions of pounds over the next four to five years, and considers that such a decision would effectively cut billions of spending from public services and the non-nuclear defence sector.
