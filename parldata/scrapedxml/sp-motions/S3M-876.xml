 *S3M-876# Sandra White: Democratic Deficit—That the Parliament expresses serious concern for the rights of democratically elected members of Glasgow City Council and the residents they represent as a result of Glasgow City Council’s ruling Labour administration preventing open and democratic debate of important issues to Glasgow at the special Glasgow City Council meeting on 15 November 2007, called to discuss business that was curtailed at the previous meeting, by voting to end the meeting before the first motion had even been debated in the face of opposition from SNP, Green and Conservative councillors and before important issues concerning services for young people, the impact of the 2012 Olympics on lottery funding and housing for asylum seekers and refugees could be debated; notes that such actions do nothing to foster political co-operation to the detriment of both the council and, more importantly, the people of Glasgow, and believes that, as a means to creating an effective working environment in which the interests of the people of Glasgow are put first, such petty and juvenile actions should be seriously reviewed before more valuable time is used up without real debate being able to take place. Supported by: Christina McKelvie*, Ian McKee*, Bill Kidd*, Bashir Ahmad*, Stuart McMillan*, Keith Brown*, Brian Adam*, Kenneth Gibson*
