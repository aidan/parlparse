 S3M-4688 Kenneth Gibson: Launch of Lifelong Carers Serviceâ€”That the Parliament warmly commends ENABLE Scotland on the successful launch of its Lifelong Carers service for south-west Scotland; notes that this service, covering North Ayrshire, South Ayrshire and Dumfries and Galloway, is supported by the Big Lottery Fund and will support family carers who are over 50 and care for adult relatives with learning disabilities; is aware that there are 465 people in North Ayrshire alone with learning disabilities, almost half of whom live at home; recognises that many people who have cared for their loved ones, often their children, are understandably anxious about their future, and acknowledges that the Lifelong Carers service will help older carers and the people they care for create an emergency plan for any eventuality, ensuring that they have the right information to make decisions for the future.
