*S3M-5341 Murdo Fraser: Protest at Celtic Parkâ€”That the Parliament is shocked and appalled by the actions of the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) in calling on Celtic supporters attending the match against Hapoel Tel Aviv at Celtic Park on 2 December 2009 to wave Palestinian flags; welcomes the comments of Celtic Football Club that the safety of supporters may be compromised and that "a crowded football match is not the place for a public demonstration"; condemns the STUC for attempting to politicise a sporting event in this way, which is likely to fuel division, sectarianism and, potentially, violence, and calls on the STUC to issue an apology to Celtic Football Club and Hapoel Tel Aviv for its disgraceful behaviour.
