*S2M-1113# Trish Godman: Amnesty International's Campaign to Stop Violence Against Women-That the Parliament commends the recent decision of Amnesty International to conduct a sustained campaign to stop violence against women; agrees with Amnesty International that violence against women is deeply embedded in all nations, including our own and that it is found in all social classes, irrespective of income, education or religion; notes with serious concern the prevailing incidence of domestic violence and other forms of violence against women in Scotland; reminds the Scottish Executive, local authorities and the police forces of their legal and moral obligations to protect women from violence, and considers that the Executive should do all in its power to eliminate this vile abuse of human rights in Scotland and to assist, where it can, the international campaign to stop violence against women.
