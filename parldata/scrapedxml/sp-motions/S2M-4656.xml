*S2M-4656 Brian Adam: Abandon ID Card Scheme—That the Parliament notes that civil servants have serious doubts about whether the national identity card scheme can be delivered and that the Home Office has put back indefinitely plans to go to tender; furthermore believes that the billions of pounds required to establish the scheme would be better spent on more policing for our communities, and calls on Her Majesty’s Government to abandon its proposals to introduce national identity cards.
