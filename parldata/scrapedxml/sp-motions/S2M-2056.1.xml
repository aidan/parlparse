 *S2M-2056.1 Richard Lochhead: Supermarkets and the Scottish Food Chain—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2056) in the name of Shiona Baird, insert at end "recognises that the behaviour of supermarkets can be influenced by pressure from informed consumers as well as the government; calls for a Scottish Executive investigation into each sector’s share of the profits between the plough and plate and particularly the farmer’s share of every pound spent on groceries; further calls on the Scottish Executive to convene a supermarkets’ summit to discuss ongoing concerns; recognises that the more local produce on supermarket shelves and less "food miles" the better it is for the environment and costs; supports a public procurement policy that ensures where possible food is sourced locally; notes that the beef sector’s profitability can be increased by scrapping the Over Thirty Months scheme in accordance with Food Standards Agency advice, and calls for this to happen."
