*S3M-4846 Sarah Boyack: People’s Postcode Lottery Raises Over £3.2 Million for Good Causes—That the Parliament congratulates People’s Postcode Lottery on raising over £3.2 million for its charity partners since its launch in January 2008; notes that the five charity partners, which include Children 1st, Maggie’s, Missing People (in Scotland), Scottish Wildlife Trust and the recently created People’s Postcode Trust, have all benefited from substantial financial support, which, in many cases, has allowed them to consolidate and build on their existing services; looks forward to the further development of the People’s Postcode Trust, which has already begun to provide financial support to a number of grassroots projects across Scotland, and fully supports the continued investment in good causes by People’s Postcode Lottery across Scotland.
