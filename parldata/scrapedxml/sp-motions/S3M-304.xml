*S3M-304 Bob Doris: Glasgow Deprivation and Free School Meals—That the Parliament notes with concern the report by the Medical Research Council (MRC) which dramatically highlights the major health and deprivation inequalities that face Glasgow in particular and the west of Scotland in general; accepts that, following the FSB Scotland Index of Success 2007 report, this once more brings starkly into focus the specific and entrenched problems that face Glasgow; further acknowledges that while tackling such poverty and deprivation must be a key priority for the Scottish Executive, the MRC report also highlights the need for lifestyle changes across Glasgow’s population irrespective of income, and views the delivery of universal free school meals to all primary 1, 2 and 3 classes in the city from October 2007 as an important first step in achieving such lifestyle changes.
