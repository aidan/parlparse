*S3M-606 John Scott: Agri-Environment Agreements—That the Parliament notes that the agri-environment agreements of over 1,000 farmers and crofters have ended or will end this year; notes that the earliest that the new rural development contracts could be open to applicants is the end of the year and that they could be significantly delayed beyond that; further notes that these land managers do not have the option of receiving payments to continue beneficial environmental work this year despite the fact that their single farm payments are modulated; recognises the damage that this may cause to habitats established by these farmers and crofters over the last five to 10 years or longer; acknowledges that this could result in the decline of key species and in reduction of water quality and could create problems in reaching Scotland’s biodiversity and water framework directive commitments; believes that this could affect land managers’ confidence in the new scheme; notes that elsewhere in Europe governments are making payments at their own risk to "tide over" farmers until rural development programmes are approved, and asks the Scottish Government to do all that is legally possible within the EU and UK payment structure to make interim payments to farmers or to open rural development contracts early.
