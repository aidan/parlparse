 *S3M-2429 Stuart McMillan: GB’s Own Goal—That the Parliament notes the Prime Minister’s comments about a British football team competing in the 2012 Olympics and considers that Gordon Brown MP continues to prove his incompetence by ignoring the will of Scottish football supporters as well as of the Scottish Football Association, which states that it is opposed to such a team; further acknowledges the failure of Gordon Brown to listen to the majority of UK football associations, which are opposed to a British football team, and calls on Gordon Brown to finally take notice of people in Scotland and stop calling for a British football team for future Olympic Games, which would threaten the individual identity of each national team.
