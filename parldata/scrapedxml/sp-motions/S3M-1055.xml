*S3M-1055 Bashir Ahmad: Stop and Search Powers Used by the British Transport Police at Scottish Transport Links—That the Parliament recognises the importance of striking a balance between protecting our country and its people from the threat of terrorism and upholding basic civil liberties for its citizens; further recognises the importance of community-based policing in detecting and preventing potential terrorist related activities; expresses its grave concern, therefore, that the British Transport Police (BTP) has stopped and searched 9,563 individuals and 4,371 vehicles between July 2007 and 11 December 2007; notes that 12% of those searched have been ethnic minorities, a disproportionate number given the size of the ethnic minority community in Scotland; further notes that the number of stop and searches carried out by BTP dwarfs the number carried out by Scottish police forces, which have searched 84 individuals and 51 vehicles in the whole of 2007, and calls on the Scottish Government to meet BTP as soon as possible to express its concern at these figures and seek assurances that these intrusive stop and search powers will not be used to needlessly harass Scottish citizens of any background, ethnicity or religion.
