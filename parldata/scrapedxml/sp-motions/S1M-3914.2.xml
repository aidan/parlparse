*S1M-3914.2 Mr Jamie McGrigor: Fisheries-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3914) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from first "welcomes" to end and insert "recognises that the results of the EU Fisheries Council in December were disastrous for Scotland; notes the severity of the crisis now facing the Scottish fishing industry; believes that the effects of the conservation measures already taken by Scottish fishermen have not been taken into full consideration; further notes the Scottish Executive's Â£50 million aid package but questions the balance of allocation between decommissioning and transitional funding, and notes that the Common Fisheries Policy of collective management has been disastrous for the Scottish fishing industry and must be replaced and that only a move to national and local control will bring sustainability to the Scottish fishing industry in the future."
