 *S3M-5914 Bill Kidd: Congratulations to Easterhouse (Phoenix) Development—That the Parliament congratulates Easterhouse (Phoenix) Development Ltd on its successful concert, which featured internationally renowned flautist Karin Leitner from Vienna, virtuoso harpist Duccio Lombardi from Florence and international baritone Richard Morrison from Glasgow, alongside St Benedict’s Primary School Choir and solo pianist Cheryl Ramsay from Lochend Community High School; considers that this was all made possible by the unstinting dedication and hard work of Richard McShane on behalf of the people of Easterhouse, and shares Richard McShane’s vision of using culture, sporting participation, education and aspiration to give those young people from housing schemes who may face the dangers of being drawn into a cycle of drink, drugs and violence a better future.
