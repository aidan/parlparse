*S3M-4435 Cathy Peattie: UN Framework Convention on Climate Change—That the Parliament notes the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change’s (UNFCCC) publication of the Copenhagen Protocol ahead of the forthcoming climate change talks in Copenhagen; further notes its recognition that reducing emissions will require a transition towards an economy based on more sustainable production, consumption and the promotion of sustainable lifestyles; welcomes the recognition that this should be underpinned by a just transition of the workforce, which is central to achieving an agreement on climate change and includes the active participation of all stakeholders; believes that the mistakes of previous economic restructuring when entire industries and communities were neglected cannot be repeated, and calls on the UK negotiators at the forthcoming climate talks to reflect widespread support among trade unions and other civil society organisations in the United Kingdom for this just transition clause to be included in the final UNFCCC agreement.
