*S2M-4570 Patrick Harvie: Growing Community Assets—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Big Lottery Fund’s Growing Community Assets investment area on 2 May 2006; notes that its key aim is to help communities obtain assets such as buildings and land that will help them become stronger and more sustainable; further notes that the fund is designed so that people lead the regeneration of their own area using assets that help create more local income and employment; believes that this community-led regeneration will help build social capital, enable people to become more involved in decisions about how their local area is developed, and lead to more sustainable development at the local level, and urges all MSPs to help to spread the word about Growing Community Assets so that communities across Scotland can benefit from the £50 million available, the biggest ever investment in community ownership of assets in the United Kingdom.
