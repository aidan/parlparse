*S2M-3518 Carolyn Leckie: Haemophilia Blood Product Disaster—That the Parliament recognises the continuing flow of new information pointing to complacency, neglect and culpability at the root of the haemophilia blood product disaster, including the recent film by Kelly Duda, Factor 8: The Arkansas Prison Blood Scandal; believes that this film is essential viewing for the mainstream media in Scotland, not least for the information it provides to haemophiliacs, especially since the Government has admitted that it has destroyed significant and relevant documents, and further believes that nothing less than a full independent public inquiry is necessary to get to the truth of the circumstances that have caused horrendous levels of infection from blood products in the haemophiliac population and that final settlement in relation to compensation should only be expected to occur when the full, truthful information is in the public domain.
