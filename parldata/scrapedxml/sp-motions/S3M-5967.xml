S3M-5967 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Success for Pelamis Wave Power of Leith—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that Leith-based Pelamis Wave Power has secured a lease option from the Crown Estate for waters off the coast of Sutherland at Armadale; notes that the company previously developed the world’s first commercial-scale machine to generate electricity to the grid from offshore wave energy; looks forward to the development of a Pelamis wave farm at Armadale with a potential capacity of up to 50 megawatts, sufficient to provide electricity for around 25,000 homes, and congratulates the company on this latest achievement and its continued contribution to meeting Scotland’s ambitious climate change targets.
