 *S3M-1885 Ken Macintosh: Widening Access to TV for Young Deaf People—That the Parliament congratulates the BBC on subtitling 100% of programmes on its main television channels in the United Kingdom, including BBC 1 Scotland and BBC 2 Scotland, and supports the National Deaf Children’s Society and the Royal National Institute for the Deaf in calling for other broadcasters to follow suit; notes that subtitling is an essential service for millions of deaf and hard of hearing adults and children who rely on it to access and enjoy television; further notes that many deaf adults and children who use sign language would also benefit from more signed programming, and calls on broadcasters to ensure that deaf and hard of hearing people and children are portrayed in a wide variety of roles on television.
