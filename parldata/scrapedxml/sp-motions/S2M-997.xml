 *S2M-997# Trish Godman: Proposed Closure of AA at Erskine-That the Parliament views with serious concern the decision taken by the Automobile Association (AA) to close its renowned Scottish headquarters in Erskine, Renfrewshire; believes that the AA's loyal and hard working employees deserved much better than this from an employer for whom they have given such fine service, and considers that the Scottish Executive should use its good offices in order to persuade the AA to stay in Renfrewshire.
