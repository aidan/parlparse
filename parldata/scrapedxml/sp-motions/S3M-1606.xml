 *S3M-1606 Robin Harper: Sparrowhawk Relocation—That the Parliament is aware that the Scottish Government is in the process of considering whether to issue a licence to the Scottish Homing Union for a trial project to translocate sparrowhawks at 15 racing pigeon lofts in central Scotland, ostensibly to test whether this measure protects racing pigeons from predation; expresses concern that the trial itself may not be lawful and that, regardless of this, any resulting licensed removal or killing of sparrowhawks may not be legal under Scottish legislation, including under the Nature Conservation (Scotland) Act 2004; notes recent research which shows that sparrowhawks take less than 1% of released racing pigeons annually and considers that, although this predation may be very distressing when witnessed, it is a negligible threat to the interests of pigeon fanciers; further notes research which shows that most racing pigeons that go missing are not killed by sparrowhawks and other birds of prey but stray off course or are lost to bad weather; believes, therefore, that there is no scientific justification for suggesting that the killing or removal of sparrowhawks is an appropriate or proportionate response to this issue and, while sympathising with those whose pigeons may have been affected by sparrowhawks, calls on the Scottish Government to recognise that this interest should be safeguarded by loft-based protective measures only and should not be given priority ahead of the United Kingdom’s international responsibility to protect its raptor populations.
