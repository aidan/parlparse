*S3M-428 Kenneth Gibson: Electric Training Devices—That the Parliament condemns the sale and use of electric training devices to train and control dogs, with the exception of electric fences which operate on a different principle; considers the use of such devices to be cruel and unnecessary; understands that positive training methods train dogs more quickly and reliably; recognises that, because dogs have a strong bond with humans, their natural instincts can be utilised to train them easily, and believes that the Scottish Government should consider the introduction of a complete ban on the sale and use of electric training devices at the earliest possible opportunity.
