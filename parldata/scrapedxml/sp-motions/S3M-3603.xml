*S3M-3603♦ Willie Coffey: Survey of Scottish Manufactured Exports 2007/08—That the Parliament welcomes the publication by the Scottish Council for Development and Industry (SCDI) of its Survey of Scottish Manufactured Exports 2007/08; notes with concern the finding reported in the survey that Scotland’s manufacturing exports continue to lag behind their peak of almost £20 billion in 1999; welcomes the signs of increased diversity of exports, with a rise of over 8% in non-electronics exports in 2007 and with food products and beverages performing particularly strongly at a 12% increase compared with a decline in total exports of 2.4%; notes that the current economic downturn is having an adverse impact on companies engaged in manufacturing, including Vesuvius, Mahle, and Diageo, which all operate in the Kilmarnock and Loudoun constituency; commends the SCDI for its commitment to assisting Scottish manufacturing, including its support for the recently launched BusinessClub Scotland, and welcomes the First Minister’s undertaking to have the Council of Economic Advisers examine how best Scotland’s manufacturing companies can be supported through and beyond the current recession.
