 *S3M-313 Hugh O’Donnell: Kilsyth Health Centre—That the Parliament believes that there must be no delay in building the new health centre in Kilsyth, particularly in light of the recently publicised problems at the existing Airdrie Health Centre where staff and patients have to endure cramped and unsuitable conditions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that any review of NHS Lanarkshire’s document, A Picture of Health, retains the previous commitment to build the new health centre in Kilsyth.
