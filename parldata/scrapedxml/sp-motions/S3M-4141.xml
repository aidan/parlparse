*S3M-4141 Kenneth Gibson: The Immigration System and its Impact on the Parliament—That the Parliament disagrees with the new points-based system for immigration that effectively prevents non-EU interns from coming to work for the Parliament; recognises that, instead of making it difficult to stay here illegally, the UK Government has made it difficult to get here legally, which is counter to the well established needs of Scotland; is aware that Brigham Young University in the United States of America has sent qualified interns to various political parties for years, though is no longer able to do so in spite of continued student and MSP interest; further recognises that the successful countries of the future will be those that have a well developed international outlook firmly embedded as a core value; aims to position Scotland as a world leader in international education in order to equip our people to live responsibly in a global society, compete effectively in a global economy and develop relationships that increase our influence; notes that our talented international interns enrich our culture and challenge us to think in new ways, especially applicable to MSPs who seek to foster international cooperation in tackling the many global challenges; sees that these benefits are reduced when Westminster delivers an immigration system unfit for Scottish purpose; suggests that Westminster pass this key responsibility to Holyrood where Scotland’s unique population and immigration needs will be met, and hopes that the UK Government will come to appreciate the wide-ranging benefits from immigration, which seemingly, as experienced so often under Labour, have been disregarded.
