* S3M-6200♦ Margaret Mitchell: SAVI East Kilbride—That the Parliament congratulates the Sexual Assault Victims Initiative (SAVI), based in East Kilbride, on its official launch last month and the launch of its 2010 There for Them campaign, which aims to raise funds to help establish a 24-hour phone line and to cover the organisational costs of the charity; recognises the work of the charity, which aims to help victims of sexual assault by providing one-to-one support for victims and their families, acts as a source of legal, medical and psychological information to help victims and families through the prosecution process and offers relaxation and coping techniques to victims of sexual abuse; commends the efforts of the volunteers who work for the charity, and notes the particular effort of one volunteer, Dougie, who will have run over 1,287 miles by the end of this year as he runs three times a week through East Kilbride with his There for Them flag as part of the fund-raising efforts and to raise awareness of the campaign.
