*S3M-2891 Jack McConnell: Congratulations to JK Rowling and Children’s High Level Group—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of The Tales of Beedle the Bard by JK Rowling on 4 December 2008; notes that the net proceeds from the sale of the book will be used to support the work of the Children’s High Level Group (CHLG); congratulates CHLG on its work so far in helping around 250,000 children in eastern Europe who are growing up in unacceptable conditions, and hopes that fans around the world will enjoy The Tales of Beedle the Bard while helping to benefit institutionalised children in desperate need of a voice.
