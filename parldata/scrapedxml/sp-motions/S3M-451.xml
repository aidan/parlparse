*S3M-451♦ Helen Eadie: Local Authority Planners Housing Development on Land Known To Be Subject to Coastal Erosion—That the Parliament expresses its grave concern that local authority planning officials across Scotland appear to be ignoring the measures put in place under the national planning policy framework to stop developers building on land identified as being subject to coastal erosion; compliments Fife Council on having had the foresight to develop a coastal management plan in 1999; notes that across Scotland the public purse is having to fund coastal protection schemes costing many millions of pounds to the taxpayer, following developers leaving the public to inherit a financial responsibility stemming from their appetite to maximise profit, and hopes that the cabinet secretary with responsibility for coastal protection will bring forward legislation as a matter of urgency and call a moratorium on all planning approvals for home building across Scotland where there is the slightest question of coastal erosion having been identified, in light of the ensuing potential for costs to the public purse as well as the major issue for those left to confront the human misery when homes are damaged as a consequence of coastal erosion.
