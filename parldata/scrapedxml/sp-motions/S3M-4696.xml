*S3M-4696♦ Sandra White: Concerns over Children’s Beauty Salon—That the Parliament notes with concern the opening in Glasgow of Scotland’s first beauty salon targeted at children, Tantrums and Tiaras, which caters for tots to 16-year-olds, offering pamper parties accompanied with glasses of alcohol-free bubbly served up in champagne glasses; believes that the further erosion of childhood innocence and the continuing sexualisation of children pressurises children into acting and behaving in ways that are detrimental to their natural healthy development, leading to possible problems in the future such as emotional distress, anxiety, low self-esteem, eating disorders and depression; notes the findings of The Good Childhood Inquiry, which was commissioned by The Children’s Society with the aim of renewing society’s understanding of modern childhood and which, alongside its other recommendations, believes that the premature sexualisation of children should be discouraged, and hopes that this inquiry and other work done in this field will help inform and shape policy toward providing children with the best possible childhood.
