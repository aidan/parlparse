*S3M-7505♦ Nanette Milne: Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation—That the Parliament supports the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) in its campaign to increase awareness and understanding of type 1 diabetes; notes that Scotland has the third highest incidence of type 1 diabetes in Europe; understands that only 2% of people in Scotland with type 1 diabetes have access to an insulin pump in comparison with an average of 20% in the rest of Europe; acknowledges that insulin pumps can reduce the incidence of disabling hypoglycaemia and the risk of developing diabetic complications; would welcome progress on increasing access to insulin pumps for all people with type 1 diabetes who would benefit from using one, and recognises the importance of research funded by JDRF, such as recent work at the University of Aberdeen on the role that stem cell technology might play in finding the cure for type 1 diabetes. Supported by: Jamie McGrigor*, John Lamont*, Elizabeth Smith*, Murdo Fraser*, Mary Scanlon*
