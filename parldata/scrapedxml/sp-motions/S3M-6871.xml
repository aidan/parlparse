 *S3M-6871 Des McNulty: International Literacy Day 2010â€”That the Parliament welcomes International Literacy Day 2010, which is scheduled to take place on Wednesday 8 September 2010; notes that it forms part of the UNESCO Literacy Decade 2003-13,which has the aim of raising awareness of the importance of literacy across the globe; further notes that the Scottish Survey of Adult Literacies (SSAL) 2009 showed that 73.3% of the Scottish working age population have a level of skills recognised internationally as appropriate for a contemporary society while 26.7% may face occasional challenges and constrained opportunities due to their literacy skills and that, within that group, 3.6% face serious challenges in their literacy practices; considers that this means the literacy level of a sizeable minority of people acts as a barrier that prevents them from making the most of their opportunities and believes that there are still far too many people who are excluded from full participation in activities as a result of the literacy challenges that they face; agrees with the Literacy Commission report published in December 2009 that Scotland should have a zero tolerance approach to illiteracy, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that the forthcoming Literacy Action Plan takes forward all the main recommendations of the Literacy Commission.
