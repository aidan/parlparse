*S1M-1161# Mr Kenneth Gibson: Trafficking of Women-That the Parliament expresses its deep concern at the trafficking of an estimated 300,000 young women into Central Europe and the European Union (EU) each year; is alarmed that hundreds of these women are murdered and thousands are coerced into debt bondage and prostitution; notes that false promises of legitimate employment and a better life are used by smuggling gangs to lure women from communities submerged in desperate poverty; calls for a common penalty for trafficking to be adopted across the EU; recognises the need to provide additional resources for the United Nations body The International Organisation for Migration for its campaign to educate women and girls on the risks of trafficking and to provide medical and psychiatric help, witness protection and safe houses for those fleeing pimps, and acknowledges that the problem of trafficking can only be solved by addressing the disproportionate impact of poverty on women in the former Soviet Union which feeds the supply of this traffic in human misery.
