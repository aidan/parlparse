*S3M-2616 Robin Harper: National Deaf Children’s Society Scotland’s Pick a Number Campaign—That the Parliament commends the National Deaf Children’s Society (NDCS) Scotland’s campaign report, Pick a Number, which highlights gaps in data collection on deaf children in Scotland; notes with concern that the number of deaf children in Scotland is currently unknown; acknowledges that this information, broken down by local authority area, would make it easier for partners in health, education and social care to plan effective interventions in a deaf child’s life; is further concerned that, in the absence of this data, it is also difficult for the Scottish Government to monitor accurately the progress of deaf pupils in Scotland’s schools; is disappointed that no national information has been collected on the number of children in Scotland diagnosed with a hearing loss at birth since the introduction of Universal Newborn Hearing Screening tests in 2005; further notes that the annual Scottish pupil census, Pupils in Scotland, collects data only on those deaf children who have a statutory support plan in place, where hearing impairment has been stated as a reason for additional support; acknowledges the NDCS’s concern that parents of deaf children in Scotland are having difficulties in accessing such statutory support plans for their deaf children; notes that while Pupils in Scotland, 2007 records 905 deaf pupils in Scottish schools, the NDCS estimates that there are at least 1,800 school-aged children in Scotland with a severe to profound hearing loss, with many more who have mild to moderate losses, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to improve data collection mechanisms on deaf children from NHS and education sources to form the basis of a nationally agreed register of deaf children in Scotland.
