*S2M-173# David McLetchie: Ending Alcohol Ban at Sports Grounds-That the Parliament notes the ban on the sale of alcohol at Murrayfield Stadium and at football grounds as a result of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980; recognises that this ban was a necessary response to disorderly behaviour at football grounds at that time; further recognises, however, that, as behaviour has improved as a result of the introduction of seated stadia and improved crowd control, this ban has served its purpose and is now having a detrimental effect on the finances of football clubs and Scottish rugby, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should lift the ban at Murrayfield and all fully-seated football grounds as part of a liberalisation of licensing law.
