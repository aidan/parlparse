*S3M-1693 John Wilson: Apprehension of Gang Membersâ€”That the Parliament notes recent media reports and congratulates Strathclyde Police force in apprehending 17 youths in a strike against gang violence; notes that the raids on the gang members were low-key and were an attempt to use the parents as a way of helping the police; is disturbed that some of the weapons seized consisted of hockey sticks, golf clubs, bicycle chains and metal bars, and considers that gang violence in Scotland is a serious problem which needs to be dealt with by the police and communities working together.
