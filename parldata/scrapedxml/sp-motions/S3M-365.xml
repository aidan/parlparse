*S3M-365 Robert Brown: High Speed Rail Links—That the Parliament notes the current protest in London against the UK Government’s proposal to develop a third runway at Heathrow Airport; believes that the development of high-speed rail links which will slash rail journey times between London, the north of England and Scotland in particular provides an attractive and sustainable alternative to many short-haul air flights within the United Kingdom, which may obviate the necessity for a third runway at Heathrow, and urges the government to develop and support proposals for such a high-speed rail link from London to Scotland as a matter of urgency.
