*S3M-3525 Stuart McMillan: Don’t Silence the Pipers—That the Parliament notes with concern that the future of Strathclyde Police Pipe Band is in jeopardy; acknowledges that the band has its origins in 1883, was set up by public request and was endorsed by an act of Parliament; further notes that the band has been a regular feature at the five major events of the pipe band calendar, the Scottish, British, European and World Championships, as well as the Cowal Highland Gathering, but that this will be cut to playing at only two in 2009; congratulates the Strathclyde Police Pipe Band for continued success in the prize list at these major competitions and for being outstanding ambassadors around the world for Strathclyde Police, Scotland and piping; notes the record attendance for the band’s performance at this year’s Celtic Connections; welcomes the increasing investment in other Scottish police force pipe bands, and calls on the chief constable to consider carefully the move to silence the Strathclyde Police Pipe Band.
