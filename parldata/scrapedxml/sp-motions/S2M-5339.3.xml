*S2M-5339.3 Fiona Hyslop: Schools (Health Promotion and Nutrition) (Scotland) Billâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-5339) in the name of Hugh Henry, insert at end "but, in so doing, regrets that provision for the piloting of free and nutritious school meals on a universal basis in public sector nurseries and the early years of primary school has not been included in the Bill, nor the flexibility to introduce this at a later date, as a key element in tackling health and nutrition of children and improving the uptake of school meals in the longer term."
