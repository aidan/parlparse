*S1M-2264# Roseanna Cunningham: No Confidence in the Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service—That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) is reporting a £17 million underspend at a time when the Victorian practice of slopping out continues and five out of its prisons are overcrowded; further notes the recent resignations from senior management positions; recognises that morale among SPS staff is at rock bottom as a result of (a) the deterioration of industrial relations, (b) the continued threat of further privatisation within the SPS and (c) the culture of secrecy within the service; expresses no confidence in the Chief Executive of the Scottish Prison Service, and believes that the Minister for Justice should intervene in and resolve an apparently rapidly deteriorating situation.
