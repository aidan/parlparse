*S3M-1981 Jamie Hepburn: Arrest of Bahá’ís in Iran—That the Parliament notes with concern the news of the arrest of six prominent Bahá’ís in Iran on 14 May 2008; notes that Mrs Fariba Kamalabadi, Mr Jamaloddin Khanjai, Mr Afif Naeimi, Mr Saeid Rezaie, Mr Behrouz Tavakkoli, and Mr Vahid Tizfah are members of the informal group known as the Friends in Iran that co-ordinates the activities of the Bahá’í community in Iran; further notes that another member of the Friends in Iran, Mrs Mahvash Sabet, has been held in custody since 5 March 2008; registers deepest concern at the mounting threats and persecution of the Iranian Bahá’í community; believes that all countries should practice religious tolerance and freedom; further believes that the international community should seek from the Iranian Government guarantees for the safety of these individuals, and calls for their immediate unconditional release.
