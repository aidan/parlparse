*S3M-1754 Bob Doris: Save the Rutherglen Royal Burgh House Café—That the Parliament congratulates the committed and passionate local campaigners who are fighting to save the community café at South Lanarkshire Council’s Royal Burgh House in Rutherglen; notes that the café provides an important community facility, a friendly meeting place with reasonably priced food for many workers, locals and visitors to Rutherglen, including council employees, staff at the local police station and an elderly forum; further notes that the campaigners have collected over 700 signatures to date in opposition to the café’s closure; praises the role played by the local newspaper, The Rutherglen Reformer, in helping bring the situation to the public’s attention; welcomes the review recently announced by South Lanarkshire Council in relation to its previous decision to close the café, and calls on South Lanarkshire Council to ensure that any review is more than a delaying exercise, that it recognises the important community role provided by the café and that it brings forward a strategy designed to ensure that the café has a long-term future.
