 *S2M-1480# Mrs Nanette Milne: Aberdeen Alcohol Support-That the Parliament commends the dedicated work of Albyn House, the Alcohol Advisory and Counselling Service and Bon Accord Befrienders in Aberdeen for providing help, advice and support to people with alcohol-related problems; recognises that alcohol abuse is a serious social problem that blights the lives of a steadily increasing number of people in Scotland; notes that these three organisations will be joining efforts to create Alcohol Support this summer; recognises the social, health and economic benefits that a secure stream of funding to alcohol support groups such as Alcohol Support would have for Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive should commend the new service as an exemplar in its field.
