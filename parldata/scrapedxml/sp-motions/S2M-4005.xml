 *S2M-4005 Mr Mark Ruskell: UN Global Moratorium on GM "Terminator" Seed Technology—That the Parliament notes with concern the actions of the pro-GM governments of Australia, New Zealand and Canada in seeking to undermine the current global moratorium on GM "terminator" technologies or Genetic Use and Restriction Technologies (GURTS) at the Brazil meeting of the Conference of the Parties (COP8) of the UN Convention on Biodiversity (CBD) from 20 to 31 March 2006; further notes and condemns the announcement by Monsanto that the company has reneged on its 1999 public commitment not to commercialise patents held on "terminator" technology; considers that no scientific data yet exist that can justify field testing or commercial use of GURTS; consequently believes that the precautionary principle must continue to be applied and should be extended to include consideration of socio-economic, biodiversity, and cultural concerns; calls on the UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs and the Secretary of State for International Development to defend robustly an EU policy which demands that no open-air growing of GM "terminator" crops should be permitted until research on socio-economic, biodiversity, and cultural impacts has been published and evaluated, and therefore rejects any move at the COP8 meeting of the UN CBD towards a "case by case" assessment of GURTS.
