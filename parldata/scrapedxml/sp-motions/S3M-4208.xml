*S3M-4208 Bob Doris: Low-carbon Communities, Building a Brighter Futureâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the announcement from the Scottish Government on 20 May 2009 that names 11 low-carbon communities of the future, in accordance with the objectives of the Scottish Sustainable Communities Initiative; notes that the developments at Maryhill Locks and Speirs Locks in the north of Glasgow represent an opportunity to bring the best in Scottish design innovation to economically deprived communities in a way that will impact positively on quality of life, with buildings that are made to last and cost less to heat; notes that high-tech building solutions can contribute enormously in both the fight against fuel poverty and in meeting carbon emission reduction targets, and believes that these projects have the potential to pave the way for a new generation of social housing in Scotland with decent affordable homes fit for purpose and fit for the future.
