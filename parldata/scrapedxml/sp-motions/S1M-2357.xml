*S1M-2357 Mr Brian Monteith: Scottish National Theatre Company-That the Parliament notes the support for the establishment of a Scottish National Theatre Company by the Education, Culture and Sport Committee and the subsequent announcement of funding of an initial £2 million by the Scottish Executive; believes that such a commissioning company as proposed by the Federation of Scottish Theatres, supported by the Scottish Arts Council and developed by its working group, would provide a great opportunity to present the best drama from Scotland, stimulating audiences at home and abroad and attracting tourists to this country; recognises that the Scottish Arts Council has applied for an additional increase in funding of existing theatres of £1.2 million per annum, and urges that any such increase should not be at the expense of the budget earmarked for the National Theatre Company. Supported by: Mr Keith Harding*, Murdo Fraser*, Alex Johnstone*, Mr Jamie McGrigor*, Bill Aitken*
