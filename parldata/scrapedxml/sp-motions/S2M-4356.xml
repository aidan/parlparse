 *S2M-4356 Frances Curran: World Lupus Day 2006â€”That the Parliament notes that World Lupus Day will take place on 10 May 2006; recognises that around 50,000 people in the United Kingdom and over five million people worldwide, of whom around 90% are female, have lupus and that it is, therefore, likely that every MSP has a number of constituents who may be affected by this condition; further recognises that while lupus can be mild it can also be disabling and sometimes fatal, has no known cure and causes many different symptoms including joint and muscle pain, fatigue, depression and kidney, heart, lung and brain involvement as well as miscarriages; acknowledges that there is an urgent need to increase awareness in Scotland, the United Kingdom and worldwide of the debilitating impact of lupus and the difficulty that can arise in gaining a diagnosis given that it mimics a number of other diseases; supports Lupus UK and other lupus organisations across the world in calling for increases in funding for medical research on lupus, targeted education programmes for health professionals and public and worldwide recognition of lupus as a significant health issue, and welcomes the progress made by the Cross-Party Group on Lupus in the Parliament in developing partnerships between MSPs, patients, health professionals and support groups.
