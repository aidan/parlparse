*S2M-3045 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Help Scotland Make Poverty History—That the Parliament urges the Scottish Executive to meet the UN target of spending 0.7% of gross domestic product on international aid; recognises that the current settlement between Holyrood and Westminster does not give the Parliament the powers to make this decision for itself; agrees that Scotland should aspire to meet the UN target within the lifetime of one parliamentary session, and calls on the Executive to insist that Westminster devolves power over international aid to Holyrood, thus allowing Scotland to take its rightful place alongside other nations of the world in making poverty history. Supported by: Mr John Swinney*, Christine Grahame*, Stewart Stevenson*
