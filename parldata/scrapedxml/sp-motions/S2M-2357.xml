*S2M-2357# Mr Alasdair Morrison: Responses to Extreme Weather Conditions in the Western Isles—That the Parliament recognises the ferocious storms which caused tragic loss of life in the Western Isles in January 2005; expresses its gratitude to those who took part in the recovery operations; notes that extensive damage was done to the infrastructure which links the islands; further notes that many homes and businesses have been seriously affected and that Comhairle nan Eilean Siar is leading a multi-agency group to establish the extent and value of the damage caused, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider whether further assistance can be made available to communities in the Western Isles to cope with these exceptional circumstances, while also initiating an assessment of future infrastructural implications of changing weather patterns for the Western Isles.
