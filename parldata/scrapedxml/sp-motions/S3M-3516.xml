 *S3M-3516 Richard Baker: Firefighter Deaths in the Line of Duty—That the Parliament notes with concern the tragic loss of three firefighters while carrying out their duties in Scotland in 2007-08, the highest death toll in over 30 years; calls on the Scottish Government to take note of the concerns highlighted in the Fire Brigades Union report, In the Line of Duty; notes the concern expressed in the report that records are not kept systematically and may not accurately reflect the actual number of deaths and at the absence of a common definition of reportable deaths; calls on the Scottish Government to consider the need for a properly resourced central body with responsibility for recording and investigating firefighter deaths and other serious incidents and for the development of safety-critical operational guidance arising from those investigations, and calls on the Scottish Government to work constructively with other devolved administrations and UK Government departments on these issues.
