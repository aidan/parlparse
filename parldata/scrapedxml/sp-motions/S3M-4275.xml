*S3M-4275 Stuart McMillan: SFA Steadfast in Opposition to Team GB—That the Parliament welcomes the news that the Scottish Football Association, along with its Welsh and Northern Irish counterparts, has agreed that it would have no involvement at all in a team GB in the Olympics; notes the steadfast opposition from the outset by the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish football associations and the opposition from the tartan army who feel that such a team would jeopardise the independence of the footballing nations, and considers that this project has been orchestrated and campaigned by the Westminster government against the will of supporters’ associations in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Stewart Maxwell*
