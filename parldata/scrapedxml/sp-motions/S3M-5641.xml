*S3M-5641 Claire Baker: NUS Scotland’s Parent Trap Campaign—That the Parliament supports efforts to encourage student parents to access college and university education in Scotland; congratulates the National Union of Students (NUS) Scotland Parent Trap campaign on its work in making the case for greater levels of support for childcare for student parents; believes there to have been significant problems with childcare funding over the last two years, including a number of institutions running out of funds entirely; welcomes the Scottish Government’s announcement of £2 million additional funding for childcare and a review of the current system and considers that pressure from opposition parties and the NUS played an important role in making the case for such a decision, and calls on the Scottish Government to look at ways to end the postcode lottery in the provision of help with childcare across further and higher education.
