* S3M-6319 Margaret Curran: Swinton Primary School Earns UNICEF Rights Respecting School Award—That the Parliament congratulates the teachers and pupils at Swinton Primary School in Baillieston, Glasgow, on their success in gaining a United Nations International Children’s Fund (UNICEF) Rights Respecting School Award (RRSA); notes that the RRSA scheme was started in 2004 and is now running in more than 1,000 primary and secondary schools in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland; further notes that Swinton Primary school is the first school in Glasgow to receive the RRSA; acknowledges that the UNICEF UK’s RRSA initiative enables schools to use the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child as an important value framework in developing school leadership and citizenship amongst pupils and teachers as well as highlighting the need for young people to develop an awareness to act for global justice; recognises that the RRSA scheme can be of great benefit to the school community, including in areas such as enhanced moral development among pupils, improved behaviour in classrooms and greater job satisfaction for teachers, and wishes Swinton Primary School continued success as a newly appointed Rights Respecting School in which strong community values and a clear focus on the rights and responsibilities of the child play a central role in the running of the school.
