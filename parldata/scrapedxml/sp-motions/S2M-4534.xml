*S2M-4534 Shona Robison: Fifth National Men’s Health Week—That the Parliament welcomes the fifth National Men’s Health Week, which takes place between 12 and 18 June 2006; notes that this year’s theme is men and mental well-being; remains concerned that suicide is the most common cause of death in young men under 35, that studies suggest depression occurs as often in men as in women but that men are less likely to be diagnosed and that one unemployed man in seven will develop depression within six months of losing his job; congratulates National Men’s Health Week for seeking to raise awareness about these and other issues and for encouraging the adoption of positive and proactive methods to deal with mental health problems; further notes the importance of Wellman clinics in Scotland which specifically target men to encourage them to use the clinics and which are designed to make them feel comfortable as a way to get men to think about the importance of their health, and calls upon MSPs to help promote this campaign in their constituencies.
