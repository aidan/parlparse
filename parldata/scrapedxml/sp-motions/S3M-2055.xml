 *S3M-2055 Aileen Campbell: Great British Weekend is Not a Great Idea—That the Parliament notes proposals from UK Government Immigration Minister, Liam Byrne MP, to designate the August Bank Holiday weekend as a "Great British weekend"; notes that the August bank holiday is observed on different days in Scotland and in England and Wales; further notes that the United Kingdom has fewer statutory public holidays than many other European countries and none at all between summer and Christmas, save for the St Andrew’s Day bank holiday in Scotland; believes that forcing people to celebrate a weekend of "Britishness", which may not be part of their identity, is not a good use of a bank holiday weekend, and further believes that the St Andrew’s Day bank holiday already serves as a celebration of culture in Scotland and that employers across the country should respect the Parliament’s decision to observe the day as a bank holiday.
