*S2M-3538 Ms Rosemary Byrne: History Teaching in Secondary Schools—That the Parliament believes that far too little Scottish history is currently taught in Scottish schools and that this leaves young Scots with little or no appreciation of their heritage; further believes that this will pose grave difficulties for a future multi-cultural Scotland because a society which is not in touch with its own culture is unlikely to be able to accommodate the cultures of others, and therefore views with grave concern the Minister for Education and Young People’s stated view that history need no longer be taught as a separate subject in the first two years of secondary schooling.
