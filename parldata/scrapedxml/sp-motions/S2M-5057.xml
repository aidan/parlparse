 *S2M-5057 Donald Gorrie: The Cost of Repairs Following Police Drugs Operations—That the Parliament welcomes the active efforts of the police, such as Operation Triplicate, to target and arrest drug dealers but suggests that it is unjust in such operations that the council tenants in the local area should have to meet the approximately £400 per door replacement cost which, in a recent case, fell on Inverclyde Council’s housing revenue account and that, instead, the whole body of council tax payers should meet the cost through the Strathclyde Joint Police Board.
