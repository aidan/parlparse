*S3M-80♦ Christine Grahame: Can’t Afford to Foster—That the Parliament recognises the valuable contribution made by Scotland’s foster carers; notes with concern that there is a shortage of 1,700 fostering households in Scotland, including in the Scottish Borders; further notes that, at a time when more children, many of whom display challenging behaviour, are living with foster carers than at any other time, 37% of foster carers receive no payment at all while two-thirds of those who are paid receive less than the minimum wage, and accordingly considers that the fostering network should be supported as a matter of priority.
