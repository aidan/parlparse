*S3M-5363 Gil Paterson: Nuclear Waste at Dounreay, Now You See It, Now You Don’t—That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Environment Protection Agency, the nuclear regulator, to fully investigate the circumstances surrounding the reappearance of part of the 170kg of enriched uranium that was first reported as being lost and then reported as an accountancy error in that the material was not missing but never existed in the first place; further calls for those in authority who are responsible for public announcements on decommissioning at Dounreay to stop spinning stories after the fact that infer that highly enriched uranium, which is not accounted for nor can be found, is in any event safe, and expects them to clean up not only nuclear waste but also their public announcements. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
