*S3M-5900 Robin Harper: School Playgrounds—That the Parliament considers the importance of school playgrounds in enriching childhood through getting children active, giving them regular experiences of nature, developing their social skills and helping them to learn and develop citizenship and pride of place; is concerned that many of Scotland’s school playgrounds are in poor shape and that only a minority of local authorities have any proactive programme in place to develop them, and urges the Scottish Government to give local authorities a clear responsibility to provide school playgrounds in which children can play, enjoy nature, learn and thrive.
