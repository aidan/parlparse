 *S3M-7202 Dr Richard Simpson: Death of Eileen Crofton—That the Parliament mourns the death of Dr Eileen Crofton, who it considers, along with her late husband, Dr John Crofton, was a tireless campaigner for tobacco control and for smoke-free public places long before it became legislation; understands that both Eileen and John played a key role in founding ASH Scotland in 1973, with Eileen becoming the first director, and that she remained an active supporter and kept in regular contact; notes that, in 2009, the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland, in partnership with ASH Scotland, presented the inaugural Crofton Award in recognition of the achievement of young people in reducing tobacco and smoking-related harm in Scotland and in honour of Sir John and Lady Eileen Crofton’s work over the decades in tobacco control;notes that Eileen Crofton was also very involved in how tobacco impacted on the health of women, set up the ASH women’s committee in 1984 and remained its convenor until 1990; further notes that this later developed into the International Network of Women Against Tobacco, and considers that there has been a substantial cultural change in Scotland’s attitude to tobacco over the past 40 years and that this is not least due to the efforts of these two notable Scots.
