*S3M-4775 Ian McKee: Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland—That the Parliament congratulates the Long Term Conditions Alliance Scotland (LTCAS) on recruiting its 100th member, Cancer Support Scotland (Tak Tent); considers that, with two million people already living with at least one long-term condition, this milestone highlights the need for Scotland to rise to the social and economic challenges that such conditions present; recognises that, alongside the NHS and social care services, the voluntary sector plays a vital role, with voluntary organisations providing high-quality services, peer support, advice and information; also considers that for many people this makes the difference between their opportunities being severely limited and being able to manage their conditions and enjoy a high-quality, productive life; recognises the invaluable role of LTCAS in providing a focal point for these organisations, and acknowledges LTCAS as a key strategic partner that brings the voice of people living with long-term conditions to the heart of policy making.
