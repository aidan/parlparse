 *S2M-4681 Ms Sandra White: Use of Prestwick Airport as a Staging Post for Transporting American Bombing Support for Israelâ€”That the Parliament views with extreme concern allegations that Prestwick Airport is being used as a staging post for major shipments of GBU-28 laser-guided bombs from the United States of America to Israel; considers these 5,000 pound so-called "smart bombs" to be a danger to any potential peace settlement in the current volatile situation and a very potent danger to ordinary Lebanese people, as recent TV and press reports have shown that such weapons pose a major threat to the general public in southern Lebanon; calls for an end to the supply of such weapons to Israel, and deplores any use of Scottish airports to facilitate the transport of such weapons from the US to the Middle East.
