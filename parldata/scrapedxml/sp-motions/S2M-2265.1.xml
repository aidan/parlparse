 *S2M-2265.1 Bill Aitken: Closing the Opportunity Gap—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2265) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "progress" to end and insert "everyday reality of poverty for many people living in our communities; is shocked that eight of the 10 UK local authorities with the lowest male life expectancy are in Scotland, which is wholly unacceptable in the 21st century; further acknowledges that those living in poverty suffer disproportionately from inadequate public services; therefore regrets that the Scottish Executive’s own policies on health, education and crime are serving to entrench the opportunity gap rather than reduce it; believes that concrete policy decisions rather than "objectives and targets" are required to eliminate poverty, and calls on the Executive to give every person in Scotland, regardless of income, the right to choose the school or hospital of their choice and so end the present two-tier system which deprives those in our poorest communities of quality education and health care."
