*S3M-1995 Ken Macintosh: The Bahá’i Community—That the Parliament shares the concern of the Scottish Bahá’i community at the persecution of followers of the faith in Iran; notes that any formal Bahá’i organisation is outlawed in Iran but that activities have been coordinated by seven prominent members known as the Friends; expresses alarm that six of these seven Friends have been arrested and held in Tehran’s Evin prison; notes that an estimated 200 Bahá’is have been executed in Iran since 1978, that hundreds have been imprisoned and tortured and thousands more deprived of jobs, pensions, businesses and educational opportunities, and calls on the Iranian authorities to show tolerance towards this non-violent faith community.
