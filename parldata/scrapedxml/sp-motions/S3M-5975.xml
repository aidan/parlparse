 S3M-5975 Angela Constance: Congratulations to Lewis MacDonald—That the Parliament recognises the recent achievements of Lewis MacDonald and his fellow members of the Generation Green group, from Williamston Primary School in the Livingston constituency, which recently visited Westminster and presented its manifesto for a greener, more sustainable environment; applauds the initiative taken by the Generation Green group on behalf of over four million schoolchildren to promote sustainable practices such as recycling in communities such as West Lothian; strongly encourages youngsters to participate in projects such as Generation Green that promote critical thinking and proactive interest in the wellbeing of communities, and eagerly awaits hearing suggested plans for energy conservation and waste reduction from future leaders such as Lewis MacDonald during Generation Green’s anticipated visit to the Parliament.
