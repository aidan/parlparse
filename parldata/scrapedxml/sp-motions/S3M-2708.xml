*S3M-2708 Rob Gibson: Julie Fowlis - First Gaelic Ambassador—That the Parliament congratulates Julie Fowlis, traditional Gaelic singer and multi-instrumentalist, for gaining the accolade of first Gaelic Ambassador for Scotland; welcomes the Scottish Government’s sponsorship of this new award announced at the national Mod 2008, in Falkirk; recalls that the First Minister, in opening the Mod, described Gaelic as a unique vehicle for passing Scottish understanding from one generation to the next; believes that the celebration of Gaelic raises the self-esteem of our national culture; encourages all Scots to celebrate the contribution of Gaelic to our national fabric, and praises the part that Julie’s warm personality and well-deserved public profile can play as a popular role model for all young singers and musicians.
