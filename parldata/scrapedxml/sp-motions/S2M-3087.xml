 * S2M-3087 Mr Jamie McGrigor: Well Done to Londonâ€”That the Parliament congratulates London on winning the right to host the 2012 Olympic Games; notes the hard work and dedication of all those involved in the successful bid, in particular of bid-leader Lord Coe whose determination and tenacity has been so important in winning crucial votes; further notes that Scotland could provide ideal venues for a number of sports, such as Fort William where the World Mountain Biking Championships are to be held, and hopes that Scotland will have the opportunity to play its part in welcoming the world to the United Kingdom and the Games of the XXX Olympiad.
