*S3M-6851Bill Kidd:International Day Against Nuclear Tests, 29 August 2010—That the Parliament notes that the first International Day against Nuclear Tests, unanimously adopted last August by the United Nations General Assembly, will take place on 29 August 2010; expresses solidarity with the aims of the day, which include the establishment of a comprehensive nuclear test ban, a reduction in spending on nuclear weapons and ultimately a nuclear free world; echoes the sentiments of the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, that "we must stop passing this problem to succeeding generations; we must each do our part to build a safer, more secure world today"; further notes that in April 2009 the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), established in 1889 and comprising of over 150 member parliaments including the UK, adopted a resolution calling on parliaments and parliamentarians to ensure universal ratification of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty and also to promote the UN Secretary-General’s five-point plan for nuclear disarmament, and hopes that on this day the Scottish Parliament and its parliamentarians will also pledge their support to a world free from nuclear weapons.
