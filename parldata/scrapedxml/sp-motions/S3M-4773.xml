*S3M-4773 Robin Harper: Sir Arthur Conan Doyle Collection—That the Parliament notes that the Sir Arthur Conan Doyle collection of 40,000 items, including photographs, personal papers, first editions and many other items of considerable interest, bequeathed by the late Richard Lancelyn Green to the city of Portsmouth in 2005, remains to be fully catalogued, with most of the collection languishing in storage, just two unpaid volunteers working part time on the project and no sign of any building or display facility despite a commitment by the local authority to have the cataloguing complete by 2007; further notes that Mr Lancelyn Green’s preference, if Portsmouth was unable to display the collection, was for it to come to Edinburgh; regrets that this unfortunate situation has arisen, and calls on the Scottish Government to do what it can to help negotiate the possible transfer of the collection to National Museums Scotland, which has the expertise and personnel to catalogue, conserve, archive, house and display this unique collection as intended for the benefit of the public and in accordance with the wishes of the late Mr Lancelyn Green.
