*S3M-5506 Marilyn Livingstone: Severe Weather Conditions in Scotland—That the Parliament notes with concern the difficulties experienced by a number of local authorities during the recent severe weather conditions in Scotland; acknowledges that the extreme and prolonged adverse weather, thought to be the worst conditions for 20, has led to an increase in demand for all of Scotland’s salt suppliers, meaning that Fife Council and other local authorities have received less salt than expected; expresses concern that many local authorities were reported to have run out of supplies to treat residential routes and footways, endangering public safety, and urges the Scottish Government to have in place an effective support system for local authorities experiencing difficulties in responding to severe weather conditions for the safety of all.
