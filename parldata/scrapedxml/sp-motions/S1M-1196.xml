*S1M-1196 Susan Deacon: Public Health—That the Parliament notes the challenges and progress described in the Chief Medical Officer’s report 1999: Health in Scotland; welcomes the fact that the Scottish Executive is now leading and supporting the biggest ever drive to improve health and tackle health inequalities, and values the contribution of local authorities, voluntary and community organisations and others working in partnership with health professionals and the NHS to improve the health of the people of Scotland.
