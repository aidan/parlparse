*S2M-489 Frances Curran: Layla Zanaâ€”That the Parliament notes the continued detention of Kurdish MP Layla Zana in a Turkish prison; further notes that Layla and her colleagues Hatip Dicle, Orhan Dogan and Selim Sadak were arrested immediately after they took their oath in Kurdish and have been imprisoned since 1994; calls for the release of these MPs and condemns the continued abuse of human rights of Kurds within Turkey; further calls on the Turkish Government to respond positively to the Kurdistan Freedom and Democracy Congress proposal Road Map for Peace, and recognises that peace will only be achieved when the legitimate rights of the Kurds are recognised by the Turkish state.
