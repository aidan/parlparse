*S3M-3655 Helen Eadie: Cemetery Memorabilia—That the Parliament is concerned that Fife Council leaders and officials have enforced strict regulations relating to the size and area that can be used for cemetery memorabilia with little consultation with the community and with great insensitivity towards the feelings of the bereaved; is particularly appalled that these leaders and officials refused to represent or hear the concerns of the community at two public meetings; notes that this is an issue of concern, not just in Fife, but in other areas also; regrets that this enforcement of regulations is based on financial motivations, has no regard for care or compassion and is seen by any reasonable person as wholly heartless; is particularly aghast that one family, whose children are buried in Fife, feels so aggrieved at these regulations that it is seriously considering exhuming the bodies of its loved ones and relocating them to its own property, and calls on the Scottish Government to intervene urgently to stop these callous activities by Fife Council and to ensure that all councils across Scotland are given guidance so that they can be caring and listening councils. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
