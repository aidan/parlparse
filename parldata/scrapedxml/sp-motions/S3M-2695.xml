*S3M-2695 Elaine Smith: Plight of Wives of Miami Five—That the Parliament welcomes the visit by Olga Salanueva and Adriana Pérez, the wives of two Cuban nationals, René González and Gerardo Hernández, who are here as part of a UK-wide trip to highlight their own and their husbands’ plight; recognises that their husbands, members of a group of men known as the Miami Five, are currently serving long prison sentences in the United States of America since being arrested while trying to gather information on Miami-based groups allegedly responsible for terrorist attacks against the Cuban people; is concerned that the wives have been denied US visas, meaning that they cannot visit their husbands and have not seen them for over eight years; agrees with Amnesty International that this action is "contrary to standards for humane treatment of prisoners and to states’ obligations to protect family life"; further considers that it is inhumane, unjust and cruel, and believes that the US authorities should grant visas to enable the women to visit their husbands. Supported by: Bill Butler*, Sandra White*, Michael Matheson*, Marlyn Glen*, Hugh Henry*, Trish Godman*, Cathy Peattie*, John Wilson*, Alex Neil*, David Stewart*, Bill Kidd*, Willie Coffey*, James Kelly*, Malcolm Chisholm*, Sarah Boyack*, Gil Paterson*, Pauline McNeill*, Margaret Curran*, Cathy Jamieson*, Charlie Gordon*, Mary Mulligan*, Rhoda Grant*, Jim Hume*, Mike Pringle*, Tricia Marwick*, Margaret Smith*, Alison McInnes*, Brian Adam*, Jamie Stone*, Bill Wilson*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Elaine Murray*, Keith Brown*
