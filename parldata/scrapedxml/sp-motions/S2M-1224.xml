*S2M-1224 Frances Curran: Imprisonment of Kurdish MPs in Turkey-That the Parliament condemns the decision taken on 21 April 2004 to confirm the 15-year prison sentence handed down to the Kurdish MPs Leyla Zana, Hatip Dicle, Selim Sadak and Orhan Dogan by a state security court in Turkey for speaking Kurdish in the Turkish Parliament in 1994; notes that this verdict gives rise to serious concern in light of the European Union's political criteria and casts a negative shadow on the implementation of political reforms in Turkey; considers that this verdict is an insult to the European Union and the European Court of Human Rights which had ordered a retrial; further notes that Leyla Zana is a recipient of the European Parliament's Sakharov prize for freedom and that the four are considered "prisoners of conscience" by Amnesty International and have been referred to as political prisoners by the European Commission, and calls on the Turkish Government to release these prisoners immediately and halt the persecution of Kurdish representatives for trying to uphold their Kurdish identity.
