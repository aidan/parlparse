 *S2M-894# Sarah Boyack: Bus Services for Holyrood and the New Scottish Parliament-That the Parliament notes with dismay the removal of Lothian Buses Service 64 running between Holyrood and Princes Street; further notes that the only remaining service, Lothian Buses Service 35 serving the Holyrood and Abbeyhill areas, is a temporary service which does not operate into the evenings; understands that local residents, along with staff from a range of companies including Scotsman Publications, are adversely affected; welcomes plans for the high frequency Lothian Buses Service 100 to be extended from the current service from Waverley Station; notes with regret that due to the lack of an agreed route with the Traffic Commissioner there will be no extension of the Lothian Buses Service 100 until autumn 2004 at the earliest; notes with concern the fact that there is now no direct bus route between the city centre and the new Parliament at Holyrood, and considers that the relevant authorities, including the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body, the City of Edinburgh Council and Lothian Buses, should resolve this problem urgently.
