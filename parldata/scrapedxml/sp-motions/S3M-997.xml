*S3M-997 Helen Eadie: Failure to Announce Decision on New Forth Crossing—That the Parliament notes that in a series of parliamentary questions and answers beginning on 21 June 2007 the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change promised an early decision on the important project of a new Forth crossing; further notes that on 17 July 2007, in response to Des McNulty MSP, the minister promised that a decision would be made on a new Forth crossing in the autumn but that this has now passed; further notes that the minister later stated that the Scottish Government has not made any investigation into the use of European structural funds, nor have there been any ministerial or official-led meetings or discussions with HM Treasury about any aspect of financing a new Forth crossing; finally notes that an announcement about a new crossing has not yet been made despite all of the above commitments from the minister, and, in the knowledge that only three weeks of 2007 remain, asks whether the minister will keep his promise to make an announcement by the end of this year in recognition of the fact that further delays by the Scottish Government will intensify risks for bridge users and expresses concern that yet another set of promises has not yet been kept.
