*S2M-4595 Cathy Peattie: Timebanks—That the Parliament welcomes the growth of "timebanks" which enable people to help each other by exchanging time rather than money; notes that there are now active timebanks in Clackmannanshire and Castlemilk, with others under development in Argyll and Bute, Glasgow, Johnstone and Livingston; notes that timebanks bring together people from diverse backgrounds, sharing their experiences and skills within mutual support networks, and that they can be used to help tackle health inequalities, facilitate education, regenerate communities and build social capital in communities across Scotland and the UK; believes that timebanking complements the Scottish Executive’s volunteering strategy, and considers that the Executive should promote awareness of the potential of timebanks and develop a strategy to support the extension of timebanking.
