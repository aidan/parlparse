*S2M-3231# Irene Oldfather: World Alzheimer’s Day - 21 September 2005—That the Parliament is aware that 21 September 2005 is World Alzheimer’s Day; recognises that, on this date each year, Alzheimer’s organisations across the globe concentrate their efforts on raising awareness about dementia; acknowledges that there are 18 million people worldwide who suffer from dementia and that there are an estimated 62,000 people in Scotland alone who have been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease; notes with concern Alzheimer’s Disease International’s prediction that the number of people with dementia is set to double over the next 20 years; further notes that the theme for this year’s campaign is "We Can Make a Difference" and that organisers are encouraging as many people as possible affected by the disease throughout the world to come forward to demonstrate solidarity, share experiences and tackle the stigma that surrounds dementia for the benefit of sufferers and their carers; considers that measures to improve existing services, such as the recent introduction of a specialist Alzheimer’s nurse to the Royal Alexandria Hospital in Paisley to provide support and advocacy for people with Alzheimer’s disease who are admitted to hospital with other complaints, are an important part of breaking down barriers and should be developed further, and believes that as many people and health care organisations as possible should be encouraged to participate in World Alzheimer’s Day on 21 September.
