 *S2M-5440 Fiona Hyslop: Harthill Medical Practice—That the Parliament notes the deep concern of patients of Harthill Medical Practice about NHS Lanarkshire’s proposals to tender for a new contract to replace the current practice which is being dissolved, as expressed unanimously at a packed public meeting on the evening of Wednesday 17 January 2007, at which those present were required to select patients to sit on the panel to assess the tenders, in the following motion: "That this hall is unhappy with the whole end-to-end tendering, selection and representation process and all patients here present are acting under duress as there were no alternative options", and calls for an urgent review of NHS Lanarkshire’s interpretation of the law in this tendering process to determine whether or not there is a need for legal change to prevent similar action being taken by any other NHS board in Scotland in future.
