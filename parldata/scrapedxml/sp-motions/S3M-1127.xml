*S3M-1127 Bob Doris: Disappointment at Royal Mail’s Stamps Refusal—That the Parliament expresses its disappointment that the Royal Mail has decided not to issue short notice commemorative stamps to celebrate the achievement of Glasgow winning the bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games; believes that this would have been a fitting tribute to all those involved in the successful bid; asks the Royal Mail to reconsider its decision; notes that the Royal Mail considers special stamps for 2014, the year of the Commonwealth Games itself, as potentially interesting and that this has been included on the 2014 advance list with a decision to be taken in late 2012, and urges the Royal Mail to ensure that special stamps are issued for Glasgow’s 2014 Commonwealth Games.
