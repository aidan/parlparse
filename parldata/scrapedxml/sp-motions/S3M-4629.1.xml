 *S3M-4629.1 Christina McKelvie: Concern at UCU Report on Education Cuts—As an amendment to motion (S3M-4629) in the name of Elaine Smith, leave out from "is concerned" to end and insert "notes however that UCU has welcomed the 3.6% cash increase and 2.1% real-terms increase in funding for higher education in the Scottish Government’s draft budget for 2010-11; further notes that universities’ share of Scottish Government spend will remain higher under the present administration, at 3.87% compared with 3.73% under the previous administration; while recognising that Scottish universities are autonomous institutions with the freedom to allocate budgets as they choose, believes that this increase in funding will help to assuage fears of job losses in the higher education sector; welcomes UCU’s support for the Scottish Government’s continuing policy of free education, and agrees with UCU’s view that investment in higher education is essential during a recession."
