*S2M-2056.2 Alex Fergusson: Supermarkets and the Scottish Food Chain—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2056) in the name of Shiona Baird, leave out from "negative" to end and insert "impact that the dominance of supermarkets can have on Scottish farmers, producers and communities; notes the Office of Fair Trading’s report that fear among suppliers of being delisted by the major supermarkets is preventing them from complaining under the current Supermarket Code of Practice; calls for an independent overseer of the code of practice who will proactively ensure that it is enforced and who will protect complainants from reprisals, and further calls for the code of practice to apply to the whole food supply chain in order to ensure fair trade for all, with particular emphasis on ensuring that the primary producer receives a fair reward for his or her product."
