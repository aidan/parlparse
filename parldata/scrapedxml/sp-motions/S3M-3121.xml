 *S3M-3121 Stuart McMillan: Will of the Scottish People Ignored over Team GB—That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement that FIFA is set to formally approve a Great Britain football team for the London 2012 Olympics; believes that taking the decision to have a Team GB completely goes against overwhelming public opinion in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland; further considers that this decision may harm the independence of Scotland’s national team, and hopes that, with former Scotland coach Craig Brown fronting the "No to Team GB" campaign, those making the decisions will listen to the will of the people and not sanction such a team.
