*S3M-176 Stuart McMillan: Car Parking Charges Review—That the Parliament notes the outcome of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde’s review of car parking charges and that one of the reasons for the introduction of charges is to ensure that commuters no longer take advantage of free hospital spaces; expresses concern that the NHS board has not considered the geographical location of the Inverclyde Royal Hospital (IRH); notes that the IRH it not a convenient site to be used by commuters, and urges the board not to implement the car parking charges at the IRH.
