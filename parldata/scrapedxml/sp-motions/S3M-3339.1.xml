 *S3M-3339.1 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Stop SNP/Lib Dem School Budget Cuts—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3339) in the name of George Foulkes, leave out from "believes" to end and insert "; regrets that the Labour party has chosen to engage in unfounded scaremongering and notes that no proposal to cut the school budget has been brought forward by SNP and Lib Dem councillors and that no decision has been taken on the council budget; further regrets that Edinburgh City Council is still unable to set its budget for schools next year as a result of the irresponsible actions of Labour, Liberal Democrat and Green MSPs who chose to vote against the Scottish Government’s budget, creating instability and job insecurity at a time of economic recession, and recognises that Lothians MSPs who voted down the budget voted against £3.5 million in funding for Edinburgh as the capital city, in addition to Edinburgh’s share of an extra £1.8 billion, which would have been made available for school budgets as well as increasing funding for the NHS, the voluntary sector, new affordable homes in the city, cutting business rates for small businesses, more police officers and a freeze in the council tax to help all families struggling during Labour’s recession."
