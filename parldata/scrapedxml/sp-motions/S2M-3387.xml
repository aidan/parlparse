*S2M-3387 Mr Adam Ingram: Treatment for Mild Depression—That the Parliament notes that spending on anti-depressant prescribing is 40% higher in Scotland than in England; recognises that the recent English National Institute for Clinical Excellence guideline on depression found non-pharmacological treatments to be at least as effective as anti-depressants in the treatment of mild depression, and supports the proposal from Depression Alliance Scotland that a SIGN guideline on the non-pharmacological treatment of mild to moderate depression in adults in primary care should be developed for Scotland as a matter of urgency.
