 *S1M-3047# Johann Lamont: Youth Disorder and Support to Communities—That the Parliament congratulates local people in Cardonald, throughout the Glasgow Pollok constituency, across Glasgow and Scotland-wide for their commitment to maintaining communities which are safe and secure places to live; acknowledges that the problems of youth disorder must be given a high priority if the right to peace and security at home and in the community is to be protected; believes that the rights of the victims of community disorder must be at the centre of any initiatives on legislation to tackle the problem; recognises the importance of ensuring that the children's panel and justice systems are sufficiently robust to show young people and their parents that there are real consequences to such behaviour, and considers that the Scottish Executive and the appropriate committees of the Parliament, working with local government, the police, youth services and other relevant organisations, should develop action to support communities.
