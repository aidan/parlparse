*S2M-4229 Shona Robison: World Health Dayâ€”That the Parliament is pleased to celebrate World Health Day, which is this year devoted to health workers and to highlighting the global health worker shortage; believes that we should celebrate the work of health workers in Scotland and across the world for all the hard work that they do; recognises that the World Health Organisation blames the current chronic shortage on under-investment in education, training, salaries, working environment and management which leads to career switching and national and international migration; understands that Africa is badly affected by this shortage when combined with having to deal with the HIV/AIDS pandemic; recognises that the Parliament unfortunately cannot deal with international issues and, until it can, believes that the Scottish Executive should exert pressure at Westminster to do all it can to cancel third world debt as a way to allow countries to have disposable money to invest in health care.
