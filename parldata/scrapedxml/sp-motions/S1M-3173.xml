 *S1M-3173# Trish Godman: Loan Sharks—That the Parliament commends the excellent initiative of the Daily Record to name and shame the "loan sharks" who prey on vulnerable people living in poverty throughout Scotland; agrees with the newspaper that Scotland must not be a country where it is a crime to be poor and where loan sharks obtain huge profits out of other people's precarious financial circumstances, and is of the firm view that the Parliament, in close partnership with the UK Parliament, the police and other appropriate public agencies, must take decisive action to drive these predators out of their sordid "business" in the interests of their victims and victims’ families.
