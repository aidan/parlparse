 *S1M-1656.2 Mr Brian Monteith: Future of Scottish Education—As an amendment to motion (S1M-1656) in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from "looks" to end and insert "the acknowledgement by the Prime Minister that a "one size fits all" comprehensive system of education is failing Britain’s children; believes that choice through diversity and competition, together with the involvement of parents and the professional commitment of headteachers and teachers are the crucial factors in raising educational standards for all children; recognises that specialisation in subjects, selection and streaming are a necessary requirement for such diversity, and reaffirms that league tables provide a valuable source of information to parents to assess their local schools."
