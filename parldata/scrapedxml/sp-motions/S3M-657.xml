 *S3M-657 Alasdair Morgan: Surcharges for Cheque Paymentsâ€”That the Parliament notes that it is the practice of many telecommunications providers to charge a monthly surcharge for customers who wish to pay their bills by cheque; considers that this crosses the line between incentives for certain methods of payment and penalties for others, and considers it to be an unjustifiable penalty on those customers who, for whatever reason, do not wish to pay by direct debit and who may well live on low incomes.
