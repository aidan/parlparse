 *S1M-2545 Roseanna Cunningham: Scottish Prison Service—That the Parliament notes the Executive’s failure to bring forward a strategy to address the increasing overcrowding within Scottish prisons and further notes that morale amongst Scottish Prison Service staff is at rock bottom as the result of (a) the deterioration of industrial relations, (b) the continued threat of further privatisation within the Scottish Prison Service, (c) the culture of secrecy within the service and (d) the continued and unacceptable delay in the publication of the Estates Review.
