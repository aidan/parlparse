 * S2M-2280 Dr Jean Turner:Drug Rehabilitation versus Damage Limitationâ€”That the Parliament commends the work of organisations like the New Horizons project, which offers drug users treatment and rehabilitation and links to training and employment, steering them to steady jobs away from addiction, and the Maxie Richards Foundation for its work with drug addicts in getting them away from a life of drug-taking and crime, providing residential care and supporting drug addicts to give up the habit forever; believes that methadone can become a substitute of one drug for another if used inappropriately; calls on the Scottish Executive to tackle drug addiction strongly by exploring all avenues of treatment and rehabilitation, especially detox, residential approaches and particularly by encouraging abstinence rather than damage limitation; notes the increased use of cocaine and crack cocaine in younger age groups and also the spread of drug misuse outwith the cities, and believes that the focus should be on the prevention of the spread of drugs within all our communities.
