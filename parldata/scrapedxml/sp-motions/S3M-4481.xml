 *S3M-4481 Bill Wilson: Suspected Ongoing Genocide in Sri Lanka—That the Parliament expresses grave concern about the conditions suffered by Tamil civilians detained in camps in Sri Lanka; notes reports of human rights abuses suffered by the detainees, such as murder, rape, torture and deliberate denial of access to food, water and medicine; condemns Sri Lanka’s refusal to allow independent observers and journalists to inspect the camps, noting its recent expulsion of Canadian MP Bob Rae and refusal of a visa to Swedish foreign minister Carl Bildt, and believes that if the international community is denied access it should conclude that the government of Sri Lanka is perpetrating genocide and take appropriate action.
