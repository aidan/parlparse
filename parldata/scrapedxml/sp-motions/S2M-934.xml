*S2M-934 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Methadone Prescribing-That the Parliament expresses its condolences to the family of Craig Winstone who tragically died after taking a combination of methadone and valium; notes that during the Fatal Accident Inquiry the general practitioner concerned stated that she prescribed methadone to Craig without carrying out a urine test; is concerned that methadone prescribing practice varies widely across Scotland with no consistent approach between different NHS boards; calls on the Scottish Executive to help those working with patients with drug problems by ensuring that there are strong national guidelines in place for the prescribing of methadone, and further calls on the Executive to enforce minimum standards based on best practice across Scotland in order to avoid the possibility of differing standards resulting in avoidable deaths.
