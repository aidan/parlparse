 *S1M-1652# Christine Grahame: Water Safety and Swimming Lessons—That the Parliament notes that, while Scotland represents 10% of the UK population, it has 15% of the drownings and that although the incidence of drownings is falling elsewhere in the UK it is on the increase in Scotland; further notes that according to data for 1999, there was a 50% increase on the previous year in the number of children aged 14 and under who drowned and that, while the majority occurred in rivers and streams, there was an increase in drownings in garden ponds, water features and containers holding water; is aware that England has a Water Safety Officer whose function is to increase awareness of the dangers of waterways, while Scotland has no such post and that while in England every child is expected to be taught to swim 25 metres by the age of 11, in Scotland 14 out of the 32 local authorities do not provide swimming lessons for all pupils; further notes that in answer to question S1W-10389 by Mr Sam Galbraith on 30 October 2000, the former Minister for Children and Education refused to make it a duty of his office to collect centrally information regarding swimming instruction for primary schools and therefore urges the Scottish Executive, with the assistance of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents and in particular their Water and Leisure Department, to (a) determine what the current level of provision of swimming instruction for primary school children is in each local authority area, with a view to providing adequate funding for a national programme, (b) undertake to collate data on the incidence of drownings with a view to establishing appropriate educational, information and preventative measures and (c) appoint a Water Safety Officer for Scotland to co-ordinate all of the above.
