*S3M-1849.3 Robert Brown: Effective Public Services—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1849) in the name of Bruce Crawford, leave out from "opportunity" to end and insert "commitment from successive Scottish administrations to reduce waste, bureaucracy and duplication in Scotland’s public sector; notes with concern the current administration’s superficial approach, which appears to be driven by numerical and financial targets alone rather than principles of good governance, and the failure of the Scottish Government to consult properly with the interests affected by key decisions, and regrets that these decisions were taken without parliamentary approval."
