 *S3M-7604.3 Jeremy Purvis: Winter Resilience—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7604) in the name of Andy Kerr, insert at end "; regrets the damaging economic and reputational impact of the severe disruption to Scotland’s roads, rail services and airports and the Scottish Government’s poor handling of the exceptional weather conditions; recognises that difficulties are ongoing; believes that there are several practical steps that could be taken to help avoid such disruption in the future, including for Transport Scotland to carry out more comprehensive scenario planning, for rail operators to review the preparedness of the network and their communication with passengers and for the Scottish Government to facilitate closer co-operation between trunk road operators, the police service and local authorities in their efforts to keep essential routes open and the public advised, and believes that the Scottish Government should outline the measures that it is taking to rebuild confidence in Scotland’s ability to remain open for business under adverse weather conditions."
