*S3M-5229 Dr Richard Simpson: The Future of Beechwood House and Albyn House—That the Parliament welcomes the report, Managing the Needs of Drunk and Incapable People in Scotland: a Literature Review and Needs Assessment; notes that the only existing designated places under the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 1980 where drunk people can sober up safely are Beechwood House in Inverness and Albyn House in Aberdeen; understands that these institutions are under significant financial pressure, and calls on the Scottish Government, local authorities and NHS boards in Highland and Grampian to ensure that, at least until the Scottish Government considers its response nationally to this important review, Beechwood and Albyn houses are kept open.
