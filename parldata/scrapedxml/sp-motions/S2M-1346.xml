*S2M-1346 Pauline McNeill: Support for Stop the Occupation Appeal Concert-That the Parliament supports the appeal for the music world to organise a global concert for Palestine; notes that this appeal has been launched by Gazzella, an Italian NGO that helps rehabilitate Palestinian children wounded in Israeli ground and air attacks on Palestinian cities and villages, and believes that a large international music concert would help bring the humanitarian crisis to the attention of young people throughout the world, building on the successes of the Concert for Bangladesh in 1972, Live Aid in 1985, Mandela Freedom at 70 Concert in 1988 and the Freedom for Tibet Concert in 1997.
