*S2M-4836 Michael Matheson: Avon Gorge Road—That the Parliament welcomes the increased use of the Grangemouth rail freight terminal by Tesco; recognises that this will have environmental benefits for the people of Scotland but believes that some of the benefits will be offset by over 200 lorries passing through the Braes villages on a road that is not suitable for such an increase in heavy traffic, particularly at the notorious Avon Gorge, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work closely with Falkirk Council, West Lothian Council and the communities on both sides of the Avon Gorge to make sure that the main Falkirk to Bathgate road is fit for purpose, with the building of a bridge at the Avon Gorge which will accommodate the expected increase in lorry traffic.
