*S2M-3474 Mr Andrew Arbuckle: Scotland’s Coastline—That the Parliament recognises that Scotland has some of the most beautiful coastline in the world; further recognises that the Scottish Executive has made efforts to clean up our coasts and seas, particularly through the Scottish Coastal Forum; recognises that our huge tourism industry depends on Scotland having clean beaches and seas; understands that there is much work still to be done and some of our coastline is still littered with rubbish and other pollution, and calls on the Executive and other relevant public agencies to redouble their efforts in cleaning up our coastline and seas for our own quality of life, for tourism, for wildlife and for future generations.
