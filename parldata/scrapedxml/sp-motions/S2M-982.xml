*S2M-982 Colin Fox: Twentieth Anniversary of the Miners' Strike-That the Parliament recalls the historic events of the 1984-85 miners' strike which began 20 years ago this month; believes that, looking back, it was not only the most bitter political division in post-war Britain but also a turning point in politics, and believes that the defeat of the National Union of Mineworkers, after a brave and heroic struggle, ushered in two decades of unremitting attack on the rights of working people, their trade unions, their employment rights and their communities and had far-reaching political consequences across the world.
