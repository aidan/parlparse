 *S2M-68 John Swinburne: Airdrieonians FC—That the Parliament recognises that it is time that the great Lanarkshire football club of Airdrieonians FC, which was formed in 1878, has its title returned to its rightful place in the community to supersede the temporary title, Airdrie United; further recognises that had the proud Airdrieonians not been forced into liquidation last season, Falkirk FC would have been relegated and would only now be returning to the First Division, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to intercede on behalf of the Airdrie community and demand the return of the proud title "Airdrieonians FC" from the administrators, KPMG.
