*S2M-2934 Shiona Baird: Raw Sewage Discharges—That the Parliament deplores plans by Scottish Water to discharge minimally screened sewage directly into the North Sea at Haugh’s Bay as part of a new £3.5 million waste water system for the Mearns coastal villages of Johnshaven, Gourdon, Inverbervie and St. Cyrus; expresses concern that the proposed preliminary treatment scheme, which involves screening for only non-biodegradable solids as opposed to primary or secondary treatment, falls far short of acceptable standards and will not meet stringent new European guidelines which are due to take effect from December 2005; believes that a comprehensive environmental impact assessment, hydrodynamic survey and a comprehensive marine scientific survey should be conducted in respect of the project, which should proceed only if a more effective screening and treatment process is put in place so that public health, wellbeing, the fishing industry, the local economy and the unique environment and enviable amenities are not compromised; calls on the Scottish Executive to redesignate these coastal waters as shellfish waters or apply equally stringent water classifications as a matter of priority, and supports local residents in their campaign to secure upgraded sewage treatment facilities which represent best value and are fit for purpose in 21st century Scotland.
