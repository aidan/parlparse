 *S3M-882 Hugh O’Donnell: North Lanarkshire Young People’s Panel—That the Parliament commends the work of the North Lanarkshire Young People’s Panel, whose 12 active members have met continually over the past 18 months to assess applications made to the Big Lottery Fund’s young people’s projects in Scotland and who have helped to gain approximately £736,000 in funding for youngsters across North Lanarkshire over that period; congratulates both the panel members and the Volunteer Centre North Lanarkshire, which organised and supported the panel for the North Lanarkshire area, on its achievement, and believes that such success should encourage the Big Lottery Fund to continue and develop the scheme after the end of January 2008 when it is currently due to end.
