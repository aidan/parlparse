*S1M-2492.3 Mr Kenneth Gibson: Social Justiceâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-2492) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from "the progress" to end and insert "the slow progress in addressing social inequality and believes that the Parliament could best succeed in driving forward the social justice agenda if it had the powers of an independent sovereign state."
