*S3M-8111 Bob Doris: Recognising Maryhill’s International Women—That the Parliament commends the contribution that women across the world make to their communities on a daily basis; believes that International Women’s Day is an opportunity for such contributions to be acknowledged and celebrated and believes that two such examples in Maryhill in Glasgow are Julie Love, who has been campaigning to allow the holding of fatal accident inquiries into the deaths of Scots overseas following the tragic drowning of her son, Colin, while visiting a Venezuelan island, and Julie Hyslop, who last year started what it considers a hugely successful youth club, running two evenings a week at Caldercuilt Primary School, as well as an activities programme for children from local primary schools, after Glasgow City Council was apparently unable to provide adequate provision. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Christina McKelvie*, Joe FitzPatrick*
