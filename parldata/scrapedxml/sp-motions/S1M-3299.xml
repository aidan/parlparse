 *S1M-3299 Irene Oldfather: Closure of Sanmina-SCI Irvine—That the Parliament notes the announcement made on 31 July 2002 of the owner’s intention to close the Sanmina-SCI electronics plant in Irvine, resulting in the loss of 750 jobs to the local community; recognises that the closure is a result of a severe global downturn in the electronics market and in no way reflects upon the highly skilled and well motivated workforce at the plant; further notes that unemployment is already substantially higher in the north Ayrshire area than the Scottish national average; calls on the Scottish Executive to offer all possible support to those facing redundancy as a result of this closure and urges the Executive to address the north Ayrshire unemployment situation with the utmost of urgency.
