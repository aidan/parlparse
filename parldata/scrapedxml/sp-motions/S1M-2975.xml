*S1M-2975 Tommy Sheridan: Post Office Privatisationâ€”That the Parliament supports the Communication Workers Union campaign against privatisation of the Post Office and their lobby of the Scottish Parliament planned for Thursday 25 April 2002; condemns the privatisation of the Post Office being pursued by the New Labour government resulting in thousands of post offices and depots closures and related job loss threats amounting to 40,000, and resolves to put maximum pressure on Westminster to halt the privatisation of the Post Office and to invest appropriately instead in what is potentially a hugely efficient public service, deserving of protection and promotion within the public sector.
