*S3M-3262 Gil Paterson: Call to Suspend Military Trials at Guantánamo Bay—That the Parliament recognises the significance of the President of the United States of America calling for a 120-day suspension of military court proceedings for inmates at Guantánamo Bay; welcomes his intervention so early in his presidency, and calls for all detainees who are held at Guantánamo Bay to be brought into the mainstream of the USA justice system in order that the rest of the world can be confident as to the methods used to obtain a confession and that justice is not only done but is seen to be done. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Patrick Harvie*, Stuart McMillan*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Robert Brown*, Christine Grahame*, Mike Pringle*, Sandra White*, Bill Kidd*, Alex Neil*, Rob Gibson*, Christina McKelvie*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Ian McKee*, Alasdair Allan*, Bill Wilson*
