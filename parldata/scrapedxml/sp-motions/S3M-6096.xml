 *S3M-6096♦ Sandra White: Glasgow Kelvin Hall Under Threat—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposals by Glasgow City Council for Glasgow’s historic Kelvin Hall, which include options to use Kelvin Hall as a storage facility or to close the building entirely; further notes that Glasgow City Council has in the past wished to develop the site for private housing despite strong community opposition; believes that any development of this iconic building must put the local community at its heart to strengthen and enhance its value to the community, and hopes that, in the course of considering its future, Glasgow City Council will realise its undeniable value as a great community asset.
