*S3M-2787 Bill Wilson: The Costs of Child Poverty in the UK—That the Parliament notes the report published by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation on 23 October 2008 that estimated that child poverty costs the United Kingdom at least £25 billion a year; notes the unacceptable costs of poverty, both to the UK Exchequer and to the victims of poverty; asserts that poverty, especially child poverty, is a pressing and pertinent issue in the UK and Scotland; considers that the only way to tackle poverty is to redistribute wealth; commends the Scottish Government for attempting to modernise local taxation and relate said taxation to an individual’s ability to pay; calls on the UK Government to investigate methods of redistributing wealth, and notes that these methods could include a citizens’ income and should include the raising of extra funds to fight poverty by ending loopholes that allow the very wealthy to evade taxation.
