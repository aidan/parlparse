 *S3M-4114 Jackie Baillie: Raise a Dram to Success—That the Parliament acknowledges the vital importance of Scotch whisky to the Scottish and wider UK economies; notes that Scotch whisky exports earned £97 per second for the United Kingdom last year; further notes that in 2008 the value of shipments increased by 8% to over £3 billion, according to the Scotch Whisky Association and that, for the fourth consecutive year, both bottled malt and Scotch whisky exports increased in value by £497 million and £2.43 billion respectively; therefore believes that Scotch whisky is proving to be recession resilient in the current volatile global market; appreciates that the major investment made by distillers will stand the industry in good stead during the economic downturn, and raises a dram in support of the Scotch whisky industry at home and abroad.
