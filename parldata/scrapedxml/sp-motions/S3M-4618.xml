 *S3M-4618 George Foulkes: Barred Campaign Goes Nationwide—That the Parliament congratulates the Barred campaign, led by Mark Cooper, which seeks to improve the accessibility for disabled people of licensed premises across Edinburgh and now Scotland; recognises that the campaign has been adopted by Capability Scotland; looks forward to the campaign’s development and future successes, and believes that no one should be barred from accessing a pub or club or receive a poorer standard of service because of a perceived disability.
