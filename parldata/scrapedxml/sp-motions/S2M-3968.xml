*S2M-3968 Frances Curran: Developments in Venezuela—That the Parliament recognises the progress that is being made by the democratically elected government of Venezuela in expanding the provision of education, healthcare, housing, land, food and micro-credit facilities for those people previously marginalised and excluded from economic and political opportunities in the country; notes that these important policy initiatives are an important step in reducing the searing inequalities that characterise Venezuelan society; further notes that the social policies of the Venezuelan Government enhance the country’s prospects of meeting its millennium development goals, and calls on the Westminster Government to acknowledge the benefits of the Venezuelan social development model for other developing countries, to support the democratically-elected administration of President Hugo Chavez in the face of unconstitutional and illegal threats from both internal and external opponents and to work to strengthen the ties between the United Kingdom and Venezuela.
