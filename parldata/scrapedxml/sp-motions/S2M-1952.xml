 *S2M-1952 Alasdair Morgan: Cuts in Local Benefits Services, Dumfries and Galloway—That the Parliament notes with concern the likely impact of proposed cuts by the Department of Work and Pensions on local provision of benefits advice, involving the closure of Jobcentres in Castle Douglas, Newton Stewart, Lockerbie and Sanquhar; is concerned at the possible reduction in uptake of benefits by vulnerable people; recognises that these cuts can only result in an increased workload for remaining staff; notes the request from Dumfries and Galloway Council for further consultation on these proposals, and resolves that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the Department of Work and Pensions in order to protect the interests of vulnerable people who benefit from this service in Scotland.
