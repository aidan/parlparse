 *S2M-4551 Alex Neil: Demutualisation of Standard Life - A Benefit for Charities—That the Parliament notes the demutualisation of Standard Life and that a great number of shares have as yet gone unclaimed by policy holders due them; further notes that Lloyds TSB has established a scheme whereby it donates money to charity on a regular basis, and calls on Standard Life to establish a charitable trust fund to which it will donate all the shares that go unclaimed by policy holders after allowing a suitable length of time for them to claim them so that charities across Scotland can benefit from such a fund.
