*S2M-2078# Brian Adam: Arbuthnott Formula—That the Parliament expresses grave concern that the Arbuthnott formula for health funding is exacerbating already difficult circumstances in NHS Grampian; notes that NHS Grampian’s staff continue to deliver 10% of Scotland’s health activity on 9% of the NHS budget; further notes the board’s projected deficit in excess of £13 million for the current financial year; condemns the consequential freezing of infection control nurse posts as a cost-saving measure, and believes that the Scottish Executive should urgently review the formula so that it reflects actual need rather than relying on secondary factors in the formula which skew the funding.
