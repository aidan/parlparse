*S2M-4281 Patrick Harvie: Discrimination at Brigham Young University—That the Parliament notes the value of internship programmes for MSPs, for students and for academic institutions; is concerned about a number of institutions in the United States of America, such as Brigham Young University which has been accused of undermining academic freedom and which openly discriminates against gay, lesbian and bisexual students as part of its compulsory "honour code"; notes that students are expelled from Brigham Young University on grounds of their sexual orientation and that some of these students have subsequently committed suicide; is committed to working for the prevention of discrimination and notes that the Scotland Act 1998 refers to discrimination on grounds of sex, marital status, race, disability, age, sexual orientation, language, social origin and other personal attributes, including beliefs or opinions, such as religious beliefs and political opinions; considers that members should not discriminate against potential interns on any of these grounds and should expect similar standards from the institutions which run internship programmes; regrets that Brigham Young University’s "honour code" is not compatible with equal opportunities and human rights, and urges members to offer their internship places to institutions which have a more enlightened attitude.
