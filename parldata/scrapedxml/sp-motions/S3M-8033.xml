*S3M-8033 Sarah Boyack: Celebrating Climate Week, 21 to 27 March 2011—That the Parliament welcomes the inaugural Climate Week, which will run from 21 to 27 March 2011; notes that the campaign seeks to encourage a week of events across the United Kingdom to focus attention on the challenges of climate change, to share ideas on how to tackle it and to inspire action across a range of sectors; further notes the campaign’s emphasis on encouraging change through organisations and networks that people are involved with, including workplaces, schools and community groups, to ensure maximum impact for the campaign; agrees with the campaign’s view that there is no universal solution for combating climate change and that solutions can involve changes in every area of our daily lives; further notes that the campaign has gathered support from individuals and organisations representing a broad range of sectors, including political, voluntary, education, business, cultural and sporting, religious and scientific, and encourages organisations and groups across Scotland to get involved in Climate Week and host events.
