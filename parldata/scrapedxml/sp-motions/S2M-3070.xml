 S2M-3070 John Farquhar Munro: Taynuilt Decrofting for Housing—That the Parliament recognises the importance of crofting to the economic and social life of the Highlands and Islands; believes that the future of crofting depends on the maintenance of stable crofting communities; regrets, therefore, the Crofters Commission’s agreement to the sale and decrofting of a croft at Taynuilt to permit the construction of 10 luxury houses, and believes that the Crofters Commission should only agree to the decrofting of crofts for housing development purposes where the houses to be constructed are affordable properties to meet local housing needs.
