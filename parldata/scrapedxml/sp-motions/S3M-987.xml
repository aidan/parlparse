*S3M-987 Jackie Baillie: Prepayment Penalties on the Poor—That the Parliament expresses concern that customers using prepayment meters to pay for their energy are currently paying an average of £214 per year more than those who have signed up for suppliers’ online tariffs and £137 more than those paying by direct debit; notes that one in three households have no home access to the internet while one in 11 do not have a bank account; expresses further concern that the number of prepayment meters installed for debt has risen in the last year, effectively barring those customers from switching to a cheaper supplier and payment method; further notes that smart meters have an important role in eradicating the inequalities associated with payment methods, and calls on the Scottish Government to make representations to Ofgem to undertake a comprehensive review of charges for prepayment meter customers as a first step to ensuring that large numbers of Scottish consumers no longer have to pay more for their energy simply because they have no access to a computer or bank account.
