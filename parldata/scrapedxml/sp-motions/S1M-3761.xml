*S1M-3761 Tommy Sheridan: Firefighters' Strike-That the Parliament condemns the insulting offer to the firefighters of 4% funded by the loss of 4,500 jobs and 150 fire stations; believes that this offer shows that the Parliament was correct when it rejected the Scottish Executive's attempt to amend the Fire Services Act 1947 to allow the speedy closure of fire stations, and calls on the Executive to call on Her Majesty's Government to fund fully local authorities to enable them to settle the firefighters' just claim.
