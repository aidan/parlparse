*S2M-1413# Carolyn Leckie: Assault on Lanarkshire NHS-That the Parliament is extremely concerned at the announcement by NHS Lanarkshire that it will make cuts of between 5 and 10% of its budget this year in order to address a projected deficit of £20 million; is alarmed that the Scottish Executive refused to assist in avoiding such draconian measures by insisting that the board reach financial balance this year and by rejecting the board's proposals for a two-year recovery plan; notes concern that legislation and changes to be made by the Executive to consultant contracts, the new deal for junior doctors, the new GP contract and other such initiatives have not been fully funded by the Executive's allocation to NHS boards, thereby putting the service under intolerable strain; believes that the Executive should take immediate steps to avoid cuts in NHS Lanarkshire by making adequate funding available; believes that the two PFI hospitals at Hairmyres and Wishaw have placed unacceptable pressure on the board's revenue budget to the detriment of patient care and have led directly to bed cuts, reduced staffing levels and threats to the level of services provided from the non-PFI hospital at Monklands whilst the PFI consortia rake in huge profits; condemns specifically the consortia responsible for the Hairmyres PFI who are additionally set to benefit to the tune of nearly £1 billion from a re-financing deal, and believes that PFI is a wasteful means of funding public building projects, that it only benefits banks and big business and should be abolished and that all public buildings should be financed via direct public funding and the public works loan board.
