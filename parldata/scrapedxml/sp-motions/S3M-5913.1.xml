 *S3M-5913.1 David Whitton: Cuts to Community Safety Services in East Dunbartonshire—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5913) in the name of Stuart McMillan, leave out from first "notes" to end and insert "considers that difficult budget decisions had to be taken by East Dunbartonshire Council, such as the reduction in community safety services, as a result of the SNP government’s imposition of zero percent council tax policy and the low settlement given to East Dunbartonshire Council by the SNP government to provide for vital services, and further considers that the SNP group of East Dunbartonshire Council took an irresponsible stance by refusing to participate in all-party budget discussions".
