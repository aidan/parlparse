*S3M-7059 Sarah Boyack: Edinburgh Chamber’s Business Rate Plea—That the Parliament supports the call from Edinburgh Chamber of Commerce for the reintroduction of transitional relief by the Scottish Government to soften what it considers to be the blow of this year’s rates revaluation; joins the chamber in expressing its concern that the tone date,1 April 2008, on which new rateable values are based, came at a time when the Scottish economy was at the height of a lengthy period of growth and immediately prior to what is considered to be the longest and deepest recession in recent history and that the new rateable values do not adequately take into account the effects of the recession; notes that many businesses across Scotland are facing increases of 100% to 200% in their business rates bill; further notes that, as a result of the revaluation, many small-to-medium-sized businesses in Edinburgh and across Scotland have been valued out of eligibility for the small business bonus scheme and believes that this has led to a situation where they are being doubly hit; further notes that the revaluation is also hitting public services, with NHS Lothian facing a reported £5 million hike in rates, which is equivalent to the cost of approximately 180 nurses; further notes that 3,300 businesses and organisations across the capital, including NHS Lothian, have appealed their rates bill and that that number is reported to be rising quickly, and further supports calls from the Edinburgh chamber for the Scottish Government to carry out an urgent review of the rating appeals process to ensure that businesses have the best possible opportunity to challenge unrealistic rating valuations.
