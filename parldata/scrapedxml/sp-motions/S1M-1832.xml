 *S1M-1832 Andrew Wilson: Voting Rights for 16-Year-Olds—That the Parliament recognises that young people are entitled to be treated in a fair, just and consistent manner and are entitled to have the same rights as other citizens; further recognises that adulthood begins at 16 and that young people work, pay tax and have much to contribute to society and politics; notes that the Electoral Reform Society believes that there is a strong body of opinion in favour of votes for 16-year-olds; recalls the First Minister’s opposition to such electoral reform in The Scotsman on 28 January 1998, claiming that there was no demand in the country that had been measured for such a change and that there would be no concessions on this issue; acknowledges and welcomes the support by Nigel Griffiths MP for such a move to lower the voting age to 16; also notes recommendation 167 of the Report of the McIntosh Commission on Local Government and the Scottish Parliament, which asks for particular consideration to be given to the possibility of extending the vote in community council elections to 16-year-olds, as a first step to extending the franchise in all elections to 16-year-olds, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government to promote and support any appropriate amending legislation so that in all future elections people will be able to vote from the age of 16.
