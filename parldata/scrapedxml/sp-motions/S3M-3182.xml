*S3M-3182 Angela Constance: West Lothian Breast Friends - Infant Feeding Initiative—That the Parliament commends the efforts made by West Lothian mothers to provide trained support for breastfeeding mothers within their communities; recognises the commitment and contribution of the first group of mothers who have undertaken professional training to enable them to support and advise other mothers wishing to breastfeed their babies; acknowledges that this valuable initiative rolled out in West Lothian will make a positive contribution to raising the numbers of mothers who breastfeed in an area where the current level of breastfeeding mothers stands at 25%, and applauds the plan to roll out a full programme of breastfeeding support across West Lothian in which trained, volunteer, breastfeeding peer-support workers will provide one-to-one support to breastfeeding groups.
