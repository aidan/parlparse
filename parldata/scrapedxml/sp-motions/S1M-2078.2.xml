 *S1M-2078.2 Alex Fergusson on behalf of the Rural Development Committee: Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Bill-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2078) in the name of Mike Watson, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "does not agree to the general principles of the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Bill for the reasons set out in the stage 1 report of the Rural Development Committee; and because it considers that, as an alternative, the Executive should examine the issues identified in the report, in particular paragraph 72 thereof, in order to address whether the existing law against fox baiting provides adequate protection against cruelty to wild mammals."
