*S1M-2492.2 Tommy Sheridan: Social Justice—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2492) in the name of Iain Gray, insert at end " however regrets the painfully and unacceptably slow progress being made in tackling the obscene poverty and inequality which scars Scotland and believes that the unfair council tax and water rate systems should be abolished and replaced with a fairer income related tax system which will deliver a redistribution of Scotland’s income and thereby improve the disposable income of low-paid workers, pensioners and benefit recipients across Scotland."
