*S2M-252 Jackie Baillie: Maternity Services Review by Argyll and Clyde NHS Board-That the Parliament welcomes the return of maternity services to the Vale of Leven Hospital and commends the continuing efforts and commitment of midwives in establishing a midwife-led unit that will commence service in September 2003; notwithstanding this, notes with dismay the majority decision of Argyll and Clyde NHS Board on 29 July 2003 to centralise consultant-led maternity services at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley; acknowledges that this decision will significantly diminish access for women to maternity services given the geographical constraints of the area and, in particular, the lack of direct public transport from Dumbarton, Vale of Leven and Helensburgh to Paisley; further notes that a return journey takes approximately five hours and is cost-prohibitive for low-income families; recognises that this decision is inequitable and reduces choice for women in the area; deeply regrets that the option to work with NHS Greater Glasgow and have access to a consultant-led unit serving women north of the river Clyde was rejected without substantive justification, and therefore urges the Minister for Health and Community Care to reject the decision of Argyll and Clyde NHS Board and restore choice to the women of the area.
