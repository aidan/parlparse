*S1M-1134 Christine Grahame: Pensioner Poverty in Scotland-That the Parliament notes that one-third of pensioners in Scotland are living in poverty, exactly the same figure as for 1996-97 when the Labour Government came to power, as disclosed in a recent Westminster parliamentary answer to Robert MacLennan MP, Scottish Liberal Democrat for Caithness and Sutherland; further notes that Mr MacLennan believes that Labour has "wasted valuable years in the battle against pensioner poverty", and that "the only answer is to provide pensioners with a decent increase in their depleted state pensions" as stated in a Scottish Liberal Democrats press release of 9 August 2000; further notes that, in answer to question S1W-7384 in the Parliament on 25 August regarding the meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee on Poverty held on 26 May on pensioner poverty, the outcome of the meeting was only that there should be a programme of work to encourage the take-up of benefits and services by pensioners; agrees with Elderly Fora throughout Scotland that a decent basic state pension is the way out of pensioner poverty, and calls upon the Scottish Liberal Democrat/Labour coalition to make urgent representations at Joint Ministerial level to increase the basic state pension to civilised levels now.
