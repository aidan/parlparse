 *S3M-1491 Jamie Hepburn: Injunction against Ben Griffin—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision on 28 February 2008 by the High Court to prevent Ben Griffin, a former member of the UK Special Forces (UKSF) Special Air Services (SAS), from making any further disclosures relating to the work of the SAS; notes that prior to being served with an injunction, Ben Griffin had claimed individuals detained by SAS troops in a joint UK-US special forces taskforce had ended up in interrogation centres in Iraq and Afghanistan as well as Guantánamo Bay and that he believed that non-combatants whom he personally detained were handed over to the United States of America and subsequently tortured; believes that such claims, combined with the UK Government’s announcement that flights of extraordinary rendition have occurred within British territory, means that there must now be full disclosure by the UK Government of all assurances and information it has received from the US Government about extraordinary rendition, and calls for Ben Griffin to be allowed to fully exercise his civil right to free speech. Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Bill Kidd*, Robin Harper*, Mike Pringle*
