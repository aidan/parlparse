*S3M-3729 Rob Gibson: Allow Expatriates Scottish Voting Rights—That the Parliament welcomes the recommendation by the Institute for Public Policy Research (IPPR) calling for UK expatriates to be given the right to vote in devolved elections; notes that UK citizens living abroad are able to vote in UK general and European Parliament elections but are not entitled to vote in local council or devolved parliament elections; further notes the IPPR’s findings in 2006 that around 5.5 million UK citizens lived outside Britain; agrees with the IPPR that the freedom to vote would provide Scottish migrants with a way of maintaining a positive link with Scotland and encourage their remigration in the future; hails the Homecoming Scotland 2009 events, which are making efforts to engage with the diaspora of Scots living abroad, and finally calls on the UK Government to transfer the control of Scottish Parliament elections to Scotland so that Scottish expatriates will be given the opportunity to have a say in their country’s future.
