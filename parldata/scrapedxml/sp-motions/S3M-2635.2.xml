*S3M-2635.2 Liam McArthur: Scudamore Report into Foot and Mouth Diseaseâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-2635) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end "believes that, although the devolution settlement has largely been a success for Scottish agriculture, the current position whereby Scotland decides on animal health policy but has no control over its funding is an anomaly of the Scotland Act 1998, which is detrimental to relationships between the two administrations, and calls on the Scottish Government to press the case for devolving a proportionate share of the animal health budget currently held at Westminster to Scotland, while preserving the right to access the UK Treasury reserve fund."
