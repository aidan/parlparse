 *S2M-4951 Colin Fox: Congratulations to Stirling Tenants for Rejecting Stock Transfer Plans—That the Parliament welcomes the vote by tenants of Stirling Council to reject housing stock transfer proposals; believes that the overwhelming result of 69% to 31% represents a knock-out blow for the Scottish Executive’s flagship policy of housing stock transfer, which many consider to be privatisation by the back door, following as it does the similar vote by Edinburgh tenants last year; congratulates the "no" campaign on its ability to counteract the expensive propaganda and ultimately wasted public money spent promoting privatisation, and believes that it is now incumbent on the Executive to realise that the writing is on the wall for housing stock transfer, that tenants across Scotland reject it and demand instead to see meaningful investment in publicly owned, affordable to all, social housing for rent to ensure that everyone has a home fit for the 21st century.
