*S2M-5367 Ms Sandra White: My Money is as Good as Yours—That the Parliament notes with concern the increasing number of establishments in England that are refusing to accept Scottish banknotes, viewing this form of discrimination as something which calls into question the benefits Scotland receives from being part of the United Kingdom; expresses continuing bemusement that Scottish banknotes are not legal tender in either Scotland or the rest of the UK, while the only legal tender are coins from the Royal Mint and some of these are subject to limitations, for example £1 worth of 1p coins is legal tender but £1.01 is not and £1 and £2 coins are legal tender in Scotland to an unlimited amount; notes that all money, whether printed in Glasgow or London, is subject to the same requirement to carrying a promise to pay the bearer the value of the note, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the Secretary of State for Scotland to change Schedule 5, Part II, A1 of the Scotland Act 1998, which states that the issue and circulation of money is a reserved matter and therefore that the Scottish Parliament has no powers to alter the legal position of Scottish banknotes, thus ending this queer and somewhat confusing situation.
