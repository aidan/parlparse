*S2M-5563♦ Alex Fergusson: ME Charities’ Response to DWP Guidance on ME/CFS—That the Parliament notes the statement by all the national ME representative organisations in response to version 9 of the Department of Work and Pensions’ (DWP) guidance document on ME/Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS); further notes the unanimity of the condemnation contained within the response and the disappointment that, following extensive consultation, the DWP has made only minor changes in version 9 of the guidance, despite many of the proposals contained in the draft guidance being unanimously rejected in July 2006 by all the ME organisations involved; further notes that the DWP fails to recognise that ME/CFS is classified by the World Heath Organisation as a neurological disease, and is accepted as such by the Department of Health; finally notes that the guidelines grossly understate the seriousness, chronicity and progressive nature of this organic condition, especially for the severely affected who make up 25% of the ME/CFS population, and considers that the Scottish Executive should use its influence to persuade the DWP to revise its final guidelines to ensure that ME/CFS sufferers receive the correct allocation of benefits to which they are entitled and that the views of sufferers’ representatives in Dumfries and Galloway and across Scotland are fully addressed within those guidelines.
