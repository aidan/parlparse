 *S3M-3888 Bill Wilson: Israel’s Intransigence—That the Parliament deplores Israel’s continued occupation of Palestinian territory and the declaration by its Foreign Minister that the US-sponsored Annapolis agreement "has no validity"; notes that even Tony Blair, recently awarded the $1 million Dan David Prize for leadership by the Dan David Foundation based at Tel Aviv University, has warned that the peace process is in jeopardy and that Israel must fully support the goal of living next to an independent Palestinian state; believes that Israel’s policies are largely responsible for the suffering of both Palestinians and Israelis and the brutalisation of both peoples, and calls for all parties to respect human rights and UN resolutions. Supported by: Bill Kidd*
