*S2M-3485 Mr Brian Monteith: Increase in Whisky Exports—That the Parliament notes that the Scotch Whisky Association (SWA) reports that over £1,000 million worth of Scotch whisky was shipped overseas in the first six months of 2005, the first time that the billion pound barrier has been broken since 1997; further notes that exports to the important Chinese market are up 124% to a total value of £22 million and that Scotch and green tea, a popular way of drinking Scotch whisky in China, is proving a successful combination, while demand in other key Asian markets is strong; welcomes reports that growth is also good in emerging markets such as India, where exports are up 19% to £7 million, and Russia, where exports are up 80% to £12 million, with the value of exports to South America  up 19% to £106 million, and believes that the Parliament should set an example of encouraging the use of Scotland’s national drink by asking Parliamentary reception and event organisers if they wish to offer Scotch whisky to MSPs and guests as well as wine and soft drinks.
