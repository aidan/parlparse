 *S2M-2980 Mr Mark Ruskell: Upholding Rights at G8—That the Parliament recognises the democratic right of people to express their opinion peacefully during the G8 summit at Gleneagles and the rights of local people in the area to go about their everyday lives; believes that protesters will inevitably come to voice their concerns close to the G8 summit; believes, therefore, that facilities should be provided for those coming to the area, including the provision of an authorised march as close to Gleneagles Hotel as is safely possible; further believes that neither the rights of local people in the Auchterarder area nor peaceful protesters are being well served by the proposals for a static rally in Auchterarder park or the refusal to allow a march past Gleneagles Hotel grounds, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to enter into urgent dialogue with all relevant bodies to achieve a resolution that upholds these rights. Supported by: Patrick Harvie*, Eleanor Scott*, Dr Jean Turner*, Ms Sandra White*, Robin Harper*
