 *S2M-1183# Ms Sandra White: Closure of Queen Mother's Hospital-That the Parliament notes with dismay the decision by Greater Glasgow NHS Board to close the Queen Mother's Hospital; further notes that the pioneering work undertaken at this hospital is world-renowned; agrees with many top specialists in this field that the closure of this facility will lead to the lives of new-born babies from Glasgow and around Scotland being placed in jeopardy; believes that it is the duty of the Minister for Health and Community Care to act in the public interest at all times, and considers that the best way to do this would be to reverse this devastating and unwelcome decision.
