 *S2M-329.4 Patrick Harvie: Treatment of Asylum Seekers in Scotland-As an amendment to motion (S2M-329) in the name of Mr John Swinney, insert at end "recognises that Scotland's civic society, voluntary sector and other organisations are able to provide alternative accommodation for children and families currently held in detention; believes that such arrangements would meet the requirements of UK asylum policy while being consistent with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees guidelines on alternatives to detention; calls on Her Majesty's Government to meet appropriate agencies to arrange for alternative provision of accommodation and support and to fund this provision in Scotland, and welcomes the valuable diversity which incomers, including asylum seekers and refugees, bring to Scotland and the contribution they can make to our society."
