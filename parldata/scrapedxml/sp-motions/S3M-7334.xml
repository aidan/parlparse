*S3M-7334 Robert Brown: National Dementia Strategy Should Include Care Homes—That the Parliament recognises the challenge of the increasing number of people suffering from dementia, predicted to double over the next 25 years from the current estimated 71,000; notes the publication of Scotland’s National Dementia Strategy in June 2010 and welcomes the ongoing work of the Dementia Strategy Implementation and Monitoring Group and its commitment to report annually on progress and to review the strategy by June 2013; believes, however, that the strategy places too little emphasis on the need for a supportive environment, a stable and committed workforce and the availability of stimulating activities in care homes, which accommodate about one third of dementia sufferers, particularly those with more advanced conditions; stresses the need for better information and patient pathways for dementia sufferers and their carers, and is grateful for the work done to support carers and people with dementia by organisations such as Rutherglen Community Carers.
