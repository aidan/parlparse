 *S2M-2024 Rosie Kane: The Threatened Closure of Holmlea Primary School—That the Parliament condemns the planned closure of Holmlea Primary School on the south side of Glasgow; recognises that Holmlea Primary represents a hub of the community which operates outside school hours supplying space and resources for the entire community; supports the feelings of pupils, teachers, parents and others that refurbishment of Holmlea Primary should have been explored as a solution; is concerned that, if the closure goes ahead, children will be required to use transport where they currently walk, and therefore safety will be compromised and car use will increase which will fly in the face of the "Walk to School" policy of the Scottish Executive, and recognises that if the Executive is serious about increasing the shrinking population of Scotland then it should not close or amalgamate our schools as they will be required to accommodate children when population levels improve. Supported by: Mr Stewart Maxwell*
