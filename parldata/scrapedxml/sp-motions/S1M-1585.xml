*S1M-1585 Fergus Ewing: Camanachd Association Funding—That the Parliament views with grave concern the decision by sportscotland to refuse the increase in core funding sought by the Camanachd Association for the sport of shinty; notes that although sportscotland have characterised the development plans submitted by the Camanachd Association as commendable, it has rejected any increase in funding on the grounds that the existing infrastructure of the Camanachd Association is inadequate to deliver the plan; believes that this judgement is flawed and constitutes an unjustified criticism of the Camanachd Association, and urges the Scottish Executive to use its power of direction to require sportscotland to rescind its decision to refuse the funding sought and to grant such increased funding without delay.
