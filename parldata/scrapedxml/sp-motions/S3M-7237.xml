*S3M-7237 Jackie Baillie: "Tree"mendous Effort from Conservation Trust—That the Parliament congratulates the members of Helensburgh Tree Conservation Trust on what it considers their commendable work in improving the streetscape of Helensburgh; understands that, since 2002, members of the trust have planted 800 trees across the town; further understands that the members have so far spent £40,000 buying and planting trees and that the trust requires another £10,000 to reach its target of planting a thousand trees; commends the dedication shown by all members of the trust, and looks forward to what it hopes will be the ever improving landscape of Helensburgh. *#S3M-7236 Bill Kidd: Citizens Advice Scotland and Employment and Support Allowance Constituency Profiles—That the Parliament welcomes the constituency profiles prepared by Citizens Advice Scotland on the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA); notes that last year Citizens Advice Bureaux in Scotland dealt with over 180,000 new benefit issues, over 15,000 of which were regarding ESA; further notes that in this period bureaux in Glasgow dealt with 1,221 new issues regarding ESA; further notes the finding that over 200,000 Incapacity Benefit claimants in Scotland will undergo medical assessments for ESA in the next four years, including 9,170 in Glasgow, and almost a quarter will be found fit for work; agrees with the conclusion that the current medical assessment process for ESA is unfit for purpose and has incorrectly found sick and disabled people fit for work; notes that evidence from bureaux across Scotland has found that 70% of clients who have appealed against their ESA decision and were represented by a bureau adviser have had their appeal upheld; considers that the Scottish CAB service’s use of client evidence means that it speaks with authority on relevant and pressing issues that directly affect people living in Scotland, and would welcome changes to ESA in order that benefit claimants in Glasgow and in Scotland who are unable to work are correctly assessed for the support and assistance that they need.
