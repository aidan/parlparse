 *S2M-4540 Rob Gibson: Deportation of Immigrants—That the Parliament deplores the arbitrary nature of the recent Home Office initiative to deport immigrants with a criminal record without any apparent distinction being made based on the severity and circumstances of each case prosecuted; notes heavy-handed practices of the police and immigration officials which it considers could fall foul of the European Convention on Human Rights, and urges the Scottish Executive, in light of its Fresh Talent initiative, to make the case for immigrants caught in the Home Office deportation initiative whose removal would deprive communities on the mainland and islands of Scotland of well-integrated citizens.
