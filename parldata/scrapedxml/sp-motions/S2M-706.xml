*S2M-706# Margo MacDonald: The Future of the Scottish Legal System-That the Parliament believes that, if the supreme court proposed by the Prime Minister becomes part of the Royal Courts of Justice, it cannot have jurisdiction over Scottish courts which are protected by the Treaty of Union; notes that Scottish civil cases can be appealed to the House of Lords whilst Scottish criminal appeals cannot be so appealed; considers that the Minister for Justice should engage in consultations with Scottish judges, the legal profession, organisations concerned with advising the public on legal issues and MSPs on the implications of the Prime Minister's proposals for the Scottish legal system, and believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure that the views of the Scottish Parliament, and not the United Kingdom Parliament, on the future of the Scottish legal system are paramount.
