 *S3M-2075 Keith Brown: Netting Youth Disorder—That the Parliament congratulates Central Scotland Police on its recent crackdown on antisocial behaviour through investigation of the social networking site Bebo; notes that the success of the operation included interviewing 182 young people aged between 12 and 18 about issues such as underage drinking, drug-related activities and weapon possession; recognises that this casts doubts on the effectiveness of social networking sites’ content control, and expresses unease that the readiness displayed by these young people to put photographs of their actions online, given current concerns over child protection and safeguarding vulnerable persons, undermines an otherwise excellent and extremely popular facility for young people to communicate with each other.
