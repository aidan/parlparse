*S3M-5938 Hugh Henry: School Transport in Renfrewshire—That the Parliament regrets the decision by Renfrewshire Council to remove free school transport from nearly 1,000 pupils; expresses its concern that the withdrawal will damage children’s education, with some pupils facing a six-mile walk each day, sometimes in inclement weather; expresses concern at the safety of routes being considered; believes that the council should have examined these issues before decisions were made; understands the concerns of parents to do everything possible to protect their children, and calls on Renfrewshire Council to enter into full consultation with parents to reverse the decision on free school transport.
