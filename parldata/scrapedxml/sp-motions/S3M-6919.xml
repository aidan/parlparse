*S3M-6919 Pauline McNeill: Call for an Edwin Morgan Memorial—That the Parliament supports the proposal to erect a statue of Edwin Morgan on Byres Road in Glasgow’s west end; notes his success as the author of over 50 published books; believes that his reputation is world renowned and recognises his achievements as Glasgow’s first poet laureate and as Scotland’s first Makar; further notes that Morgan studied and taught at the University of Glasgow, and considers that it would be fitting to have a memorial in this area.
