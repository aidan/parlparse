*S1M-3570.2 Ms Margaret Curran: Poverty-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3570) in the name of Mr Kenneth Gibson, leave out from "deplores" to end and insert "supports the Scottish Executive's plans to tackle poverty as set out in Closing the Opportunity Gap: Scottish Budget 2003-2006; agrees that the definition of poverty extends beyond low income to include lack of opportunity in aspects of people's lives such as jobs, health, education, transport and housing, and welcomes the progress that the Executive is making in tackling poverty in the broadest sense, in order to close the opportunity gap for the most disadvantaged people and communities, both urban and rural, across Scotland."
