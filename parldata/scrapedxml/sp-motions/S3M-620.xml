 *S3M-620 Robin Harper: Ship-to-Ship Oil Transfers—That the Parliament welcomes the ministerial powers it approved under the amended Conservation (Natural Habitats, &amp;c.) Regulations 2007; calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Rural Affairs and the Environment to use these powers at the first available opportunity to defend wildlife from ship-to-ship oil transfers in the Forth, and further calls on the Westminster Government to complement the initiative taken by the Scottish Parliament by immediately bringing forward new regulations under section 130 of the Merchant Shipping Act 1995 to give Westminster ministers new powers to directly prohibit or restrict ship-to-ship oil transfers on grounds of safety or unacceptable risk to the environment.
