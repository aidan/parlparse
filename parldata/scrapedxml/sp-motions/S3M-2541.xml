*S3M-2541 Christopher Harvie: Carlyle Conference—That the Parliament congratulates the staff of the University of Glasgow’s Crichton Campus, in particular Drs Ralph Jessop and Carol Collins, on the successful organisation of the International Thomas Carlyle Conference from 4 to 7 September 2008; notes that with this conference, attended and addressed by academics and critics from Europe, the United States of America and Australia, a notable attempt was made to discuss and publicise the remarkable career of one of Scotland’s greatest writers and thinkers, who was born in Ecclefechan in 1795 and died in Chelsea in 1881 and whose correspondents and disciples ranged from Goethe to Disraeli and Karl Marx to D. H. Lawrence; recognises that this event went far towards establishing the Crichton Campus as a centre for scholarship and teaching, serving the rich cultural landscape of Cumbria, Galloway and Ulster, and expresses hopes that it will be only the first in a series of such events.
