*S3M-4169♦ James Kelly: Social Accounting Pilot Project—That the Parliament congratulates Co-operative Development Scotland on raising awareness of the practice of social accounting following a flagship pilot project with the Social Audit Network to introduce social accounting to six co-operative and social enterprises in Scotland; commends the contribution to the project played by Highland Home Carers, Highland Wholefoods, Loch Fyne Oysters, Scotwest Credit Union, West Whitlawburn Housing Co-operative and the Wise Group, and believes that organisations that can demonstrate their wider social impact beyond financial performance will gain a competitive edge and ensure that co-operatives, social enterprises and voluntary organisations thriving in Scotland contribute to economic growth.
