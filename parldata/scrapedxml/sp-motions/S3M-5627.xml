 *S3M-5627 Robin Harper: Reductions in Modern Language Opportunities—That the Parliament notes the proposed cuts to modern language teaching at the University of Edinburgh; understands that these cuts apply to, among other languages, Russian, German, French, Swedish, Norwegian and Danish; believes that the system of research-assessed funding is detrimental to any notion of the tradition of Scottish universities as dedicated to the liberal arts as well as to science and risks providing students in some academic areas with a restricted education; further believes that there is a need for additional support funding beyond that provided by the Research Assessment Exercise system; further believes that, if universities in Scotland are to remain competitive and maintain the standards that they have set themselves, a new funding package is needed; suggests that such a package should seek to provide additional funding to the most vulnerable subjects and preserve the skills base that exists, and calls on the Scottish Government to recognise the economic and cultural significance of foreign languages to Scotland and the United Kingdom and to ensure continued funding for high quality teaching and research in the nation’s universities.
