*S3M-3092♦ Helen Eadie: Protection for Buyers of New-build Homes—That the Parliament notes that in 2007 Helen Eadie MSP submitted a proposal for a Member’s Bill, which would require a builder and a developer of a new-build home in Scotland to specify an entry date in the missives for the sale of that property and, if that entry date were missed, to enable buyers of that property to withdraw from the contract without penalty and to have returned to them any deposit or fees paid in advance together with interest and provide for compensation for delays should the purchaser wish still to continue with the contract; recognises that such delays were experienced by an individual in Kingseat who was forced to pay over £4,000 in additional costs for living expenses, shelter and storage pending completion of his home and that similar experiences of high costs have been documented throughout Scotland; regrets that the Minister for Communities and Sport has yet to agree a date for a meeting on this issue or respond to the substantive issues around housing strategy raised during Health and Wellbeing question time on 26 June 2008 (Official Report, c. 10290); hopes that the Scottish Government will clarify whether it will support a proposed legislative change and examine the Court of Appeal decision of R (Khatun) v Newham LBC [2004] EWCA Civ 55, [2005] QB 37, which held that contracts relating to land are not within the scope of Council Directive 93/13/EEC and regulations; acknowledges that while C7 of Schedule 5 to the Scotland Act 1998 reserves those matters specified in that section (consumer protection) to Westminster, in this instance the Court of Appeal decision held that contracts or missives relating to land were not within the scope of the Directive or the Regulations, and considers that legislative changes proposed by Helen Eadie MSP, which will offer protection to home purchasers who currently have, according to the Scottish Consumer Council, more protection buying a video than buying a house, are worthy of support.
