*S2M-5674 Frances Curran: Condemnation of Israeli Occupation Forces’ Actions in Nablus—That the Parliament condemns the actions of the Israeli occupation forces in occupying the West Bank town of Nablus and subjecting it to a curfew over the last three days which has resulted in an estimated 50,000 people being confined to their homes as Israeli troops invade houses and harass civilians; notes that in addition An-Najah National University and all schools have been closed and students instructed to remain in their homes, while Israeli occupation forces have also stormed hospitals preventing employees, ambulances and paramedics from accessing the hospitals, thus compromising patient care; further notes that at least four Palestinians have been killed in these raids, bringing to 5,647 the number of people killed since the start of the second Palestinian uprising in September 2000, the vast majority of these being Palestinians; views Israel’s actions as an attempt to destroy any prospects for a peaceful resolution to the current conflict by sabotaging the formation of a Palestinian national unity government, and calls on Israel to respect the sovereignty of the West Bank and Gaza and to halt all such raids.
