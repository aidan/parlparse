*S1M-2366# Helen Eadie: Consultation and Advocacy Promotion Serviceâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the Consultation and Advocacy Promotion Service on its 10th anniversary and commends the work of the service in promoting and supporting the collective involvement of mental health service users in Edinburgh, Midlothian and East Lothian; further congratulates mindscape.org.uk on the launch of its website on 18 June 2001, the aim of which is to provide a forum for debate on mental health issues, supply information for service users, their friends and families and to challenge stigma and discrimination, and believes that the Scottish Executive should continue to work towards ensuring that mental health service users have access to appropriate services and levels of support.
