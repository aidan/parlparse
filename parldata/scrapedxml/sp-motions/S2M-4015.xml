 *S2M-4015# Cathy Peattie: International Women’s Day - Shaping a Fairer Future—That the Parliament welcomes the many events being organised throughout the world to mark International Women’s Day on 8 March 2006; notes the report of the Women and Work Commission, Shaping a Fairer Future, and that, while over thirty years have elapsed since the Sex Discrimination Act was passed, the Equal Pay Act came into force and the Equal Opportunities Commission was established, the commission reports that the gender pay gap is the worst in the European Union; further notes that women remain significantly under-represented, particularly at the top of many professions, in business, in the public sector and in many areas of civic participation, including our democratic institutions; welcomes the forthcoming introduction of the public sector gender equality duty; believes that it is incumbent on all political parties to address the under-representation of women in politics, and believes that the Scottish Executive should promote flexible, family-friendly working and consider ways in which the gender equality duty can be implemented throughout Scottish society. Supported by: Marlyn Glen*, Shiona Baird*, Fiona Hyslop*, Dr Elaine Murray*, Scott Barrie*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Ms Sandra White*, Bill Butler*, Robin Harper*, Karen Whitefield*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Maureen Macmillan*, Nora Radcliffe*, Chris Ballance* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
