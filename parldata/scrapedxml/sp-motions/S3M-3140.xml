 *S3M-3140 Murdo Fraser: Return of the Lübeck Letter—That the Parliament believes that the Lübeck letter is one of the most significant historical documents in Scottish history, the last known surviving document written by William Wallace; notes that the letter was written in October 1297 following the victory of Scottish forces at the Battle of Stirling Bridge over King Edward I of England and was written to inform Scotland’s European trading partners that merchants were to have safe access to all ports in the Kingdom of Scotland; acknowledges that the document is protected in the national archives of the city of Lübeck, Germany, to where the letter was addressed and which has legal possession over it; further acknowledges that the city of Lübeck has been gracious enough in the past to lend Scotland the letter for the Parliament’s For Freedom Alone exhibition; recognises that Sir William Wallace is one of the key figures in Scotland’s history and that his pivotal role makes the Lübeck letter of great historical and cultural importance; believes that the return of this document to Scotland would benefit the nation, and hopes that Scotland will be permanently loaned the Lübeck letter.
