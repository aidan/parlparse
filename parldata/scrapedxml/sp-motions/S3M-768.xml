*S3M-768# Des McNulty: Science and the Parliament, Wednesday 28 November 2007—That the Parliament welcomes the Science and the Parliament event being held on 28 November 2007 in Our Dynamic Earth, organised once again by the Royal Society of Chemistry in association with Scotland’s leading science organisations; notes that this year’s theme is "The Science Behind the Energy Debate" in recognition of the important contribution that Scotland’s scientific community can make to the debate on this vital policy area; further notes that Scotland is a world leader in many scientific disciplines; recognises the need to foster an environment that enhances pupil and student participation in science, to invest in the science infrastructure and equipment of our educational establishments, to increase investment in research along with supporting greater industrial research and to assist in the practical application of our world-beating research, and hopes that this year’s Science and the Parliament event will play a positive part in contributing to the debate on how the Parliament and the Scottish Government address Scotland’s energy needs and obligations to tackle climate change in the years ahead.
