 *S2M-2741# Trish Godman: Merchant Ships, Maritime Skills and Shipyards—That the Parliament welcomes the dramatic increase in the size of the United Kingdom’s merchant fleet which now stands 15th in the world’s tonnage; notes that these UK-flagged vessels are, in the main, both newer and larger than hitherto; acknowledges that this resurgence in such an important industry is due to the introduction of the tonnage tax; compliments the British Chamber of Shipping and the two principal trade unions, the RMT and NUMAST, for their co-operative efforts in encouraging and increasing employment opportunities for UK seafarers; believes that those Scottish colleges engaged in maritime education and training courses have an important role to play in this respect but deeply regrets the fact that most of the new ships joining this burgeoning fleet are built in shipyards outwith the United Kingdom, and is of the view that, whilst that estimable but small number of British shipowners who build their vessels in British yards are to be complimented, much more should be done by the Scottish Executive and the UK Government to persuade British shipowners to place their orders in shipyards in Scotland and elsewhere in the United Kingdom.
