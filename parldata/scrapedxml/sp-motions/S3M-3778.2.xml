*S3M-3778.2 Nicola Sturgeon: Alcohol Strategyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-3778) in the name of Bill Aitken, leave out from "binge drinking" to end and insert "harmful drinking and under-age drinking must be workable and properly targeted so that, while the responsible, sensible majority of moderate drinkers are not unnecessarily penalised, wider issues of excess consumption contributing to huge costs to Scottish society are effectively addressed."
