*S3M-6355 John Wilson: Scottish Agricultural Wages Board Increases Agricultural Wage—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Agricultural Wages Board for its decision to increase the minimum wage rate of those working in the agricultural sector; notes that, as a result of this decision, those in their initial 26 weeks of employment would receive a 2.8% increase while those employed in agriculture for more than 26 weeks would see an increase of 3%; recognises that this is substantially greater than the proposed increase of only 2.2% in the national minimum wage for those in other areas of the economy, and considers that this greater increase will have a significant effect on those in the agricultural industry during this period of economic uncertainty.
