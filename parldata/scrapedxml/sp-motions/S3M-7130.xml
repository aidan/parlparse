*S3M-7130 Aileen Campbell: Free West Papua—That the Parliament supports the Free West Papua Campaign and its efforts to obtain self-determination for the people of West Papua; expresses its horror at the systematic abuse and torture of West Papuans, as reported by the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Dr Manfred Nowak, during his mission to Indonesia in 2008; believes the occupation by Indonesia to be illegal and that the West Papuans’ fundamental right to self-determination under international law has been denied; notes with concern the systematic suppression of human rights and freedom of expression in West Papua that was highlighted by Amnesty International, and in particular, the case of Yusak Pakage and Filep Karma, who have been jailed for 10 and 15 years respectively for, Amnesty International claimed, peacefully raising the West Papuan independence flag; welcomes the UK Government’s recognition in 2004 that hand-picked West Papuan representatives were coerced by the Indonesian state into voting for the 1969 Act of Free Choice; hopes that elected representatives from around the world will join respected figures, such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, in supporting the right of the people of West Papua to self-determination; expresses solidarity with the recent demonstrations that took place in West Papua, and recognises West Papuans’ appreciation of the support for West Papua from the Parliament during such hostile conditions.
