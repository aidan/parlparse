 *S2M-1565 Richard Lochhead: Congratulations to Peterhead Academy-That the Parliament congratulates Peterhead Academy on taking second place in the Northern Open Rock Challenge Final with its "Maid in Scotland" production and for being excellent ambassadors for Scotland while attending the final in Grimsby; notes the excellent work undertaken by the Be Your Best Foundation in organising the 2004 Rock Challenge for school students, allowing them to use and develop music, dance, drama and production skills with the aim of encouraging young people to maintain a healthy lifestyle by making a commitment not to take drugs and avoid drinking and smoking; further notes that there is only one event of this nature in Scotland at present, and calls for there to be more opportunities for other parts of Scotland to experience this event.
