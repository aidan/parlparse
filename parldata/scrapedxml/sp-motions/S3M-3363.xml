*S3M-3363 Margaret Curran: Catholic Education Week 2009—That the Parliament celebrates Catholic Education Week, intended to highlight the significance of education for young people and society as a whole; notes that Catholic Education Week may present an invaluable time for reflection on the importance of education; recognises the contribution of Catholic education in promoting values-based education in schools and setting high standards of academic excellence; considers that the achievements of Catholic education can be recognised throughout the east end of Glasgow, where the standard of education has risen as a result of the influence of Catholic education, and hopes that standards of education in the east end of Glasgow will remain a priority and continue to improve.
