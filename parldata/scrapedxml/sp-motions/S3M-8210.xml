 *S3M-8210 John Park: Scottish Amateur Cup Final—That the Parliament notes with concern proposals to abandon the tradition of the Scottish Amateur Cup final being played at Hampden Park in May; further notes that the Scottish Amateur Football Association provides opportunities for around 35,000 footballers to compete in their favourite sport; believes that the dream of playing in a cup final at Hampden, Scotland’s national stadium, should be open to all footballers regardless of their ability; considers that football across Scotland relies on the thousands of players and volunteers who give up their time for the love of the game; further believes that the Scottish Football Association should show its commitment to the development of amateur football by ensuring that Hampden Park Ltd retains the final at Hampden, and calls for the decision not to hold the 2011 final there to be reversed.
