 *S2M-1562 Richard Lochhead: Physiotherapy Week 2004-That the Parliament notes Physiotherapy Week 2004 from 5 to 9 July; believes that physiotherapy is extremely important in helping people of all ages to overcome injuries and resume their regular lives as quickly as possible; further believes that physiotherapy also plays a vital role in terms of assisting those with physical disabilities to live their lives confidently; recognises the pressures and demands placed on the service that are being exacerbated in some areas by shortages; believes that action should be taken to ensure that more people enter the profession, alleviating pressures on those physiotherapists currently practicing and ensuring that the highest standards are attained throughout Scotland, and congratulates the physiotherapists of Scotland for all their hard work in this regard.
