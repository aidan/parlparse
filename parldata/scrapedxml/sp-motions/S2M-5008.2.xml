*S2M-5008.2 Richard Lochhead: Coastal and Marine National Parks—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5008) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "supports" to end and insert "notes that coastal and marine national parks may have a role to play in the future but that at the present time there are many other more pressing priorities facing our coastal communities; further notes that, according to Scottish Environment Link, there are already over 85 Acts of Parliament that apply to Scotland’s waters and yet a further layer of bureaucracy would not be helpful or popular and would only add to the existing complexity of marine and coastal management in Scotland; calls for a review of the governance of the marine environment before additional legislation is considered; believes that the creation of coastal and marine national parks should not be considered until other priorities are addressed and there is evidence that there is sufficient demand within local communities, and calls for the Scottish Parliament to have additional powers to help protect and promote our marine environment."
