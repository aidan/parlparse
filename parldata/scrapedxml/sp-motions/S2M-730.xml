*S2M-730# Colin Fox: Algerian Arrests-That the Parliament condemns the arrest of Ghalem Belhadj, Salah Moullef, Hakim Ziem and Lasnan Lasnami, along with five Algerians from England, on terrorism charges in December 2002; notes that all charges have now been dropped against these men; believes that this case further highlights the flaws in the Terrorism Act 2000 that currently allows sweeping powers of arrest and imprisonment, often wrongly targeting individuals, particularly from the Muslim community, and considers that much greater evidence should exist before any future arrests of this nature are made.
