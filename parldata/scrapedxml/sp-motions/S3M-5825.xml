*S3M-5825 Bill Kidd: Employment and Support Allowance Isn’t Working—That the Parliament notes with concern that completed work capability assessments for employment and support allowance have resulted in 68% of applicants being deemed fit for work and only 9% being placed into the support group; shares concerns about the assessment process raised by such groups as Citizens Advice Bureau, Macmillan Cancer Support and the Parkinson’s Disease Society, and calls on the UK Government to put in place mechanisms to ensure that independent medical assessments for work capability, carried out by doctors on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions, are consistent, accurate and fair.
