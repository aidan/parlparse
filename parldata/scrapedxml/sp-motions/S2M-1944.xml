*S2M-1944 Mr Stewart Maxwell: All Councils Must Support Scottish Troops—That the Parliament applauds the decision of Glasgow City Council to award Territorial Army (TA) personnel serving in Iraq up to 50% council tax relief; deplores the fact that, while convicted criminals are given discounts, Scottish TA soldiers are denied exemptions while on active service in Iraq; demands that local authorities stop hiding behind the fact that there is no legal requirement for granting these exemptions and instead support Scottish troops rather than penalising them, and calls on all local authorities in Scotland to follow Glasgow’s lead and award council tax discounts to TA personnel serving in Iraq. Supported by: Donald Gorrie*
