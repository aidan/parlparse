*S3M-930 David Stewart: Healthy Living Centres—That the Parliament acknowledges the positive contribution of healthy living centres across Scotland, whose aim is to promote good health in its broadest sense, to reduce health inequalities and to improve the health of the most disadvantaged sections of the population; notes with concern that the five-year lottery funding for many of these individual groups is at, or will soon be coming to, an end; recognises the valuable contribution that healthy living centres make in individual communities, such as the Janny’s Hoose in Inverness and Healthways in Ross and Cromarty, and calls on local authorities and NHS boards to enter into funding negotiations with the Scottish Executive to secure a continued long-term funding solution for these very worthwhile organisations.
