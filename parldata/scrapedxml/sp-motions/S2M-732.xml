*S2M-732# Mr Bruce McFee: West of Scotland Secure Care Unit—That the Parliament recognises the need for a medium secure unit for the west of Scotland; notes the walkout of MSPs, including Hugh Henry MSP, councillors and community council representatives from the West of Scotland Forensic Steering Group’s scoring event, held on Tuesday 9 December 2003; shares the concerns of the Paisley and Barrhead Community Action Group at the catalogue of inaccuracies, omissions and incorrect and selective application of benefit criteria and weightings at different stages of the selection process, and considers that the Minister for Health and Community Care should intervene to instruct the appropriate NHS boards to set aside the whole process and restart it from the beginning in a fair, transparent and robust manner, ensuring that the public are properly consulted at all stages.
