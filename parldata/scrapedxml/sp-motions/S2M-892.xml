*S2M-892# Shona Robison: Vending Machines in Schools-That the Parliament welcomes the recent research into vending machines in schools commissioned by the Food Standards Agency and carried out by the Health Education Trust; notes that this research shows that vending machines containing water, milk and fruit juice are just as popular as those containing fizzy drinks and that they yield a similar income for school funds, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should take immediate steps to remove fizzy drinks from vending machines within our schools in favour of these healthy alternatives.
