*S2M-3817 Tommy Sheridan: Socialism Breeds Across Latin America—That the Parliament notes the overwhelming victory of Evo Morales, the Movement Towards Socialism (MAS) presidential candidate, in Bolivia last month and resolves to send a message of congratulations and solidarity to him and his new administration for their inauguration on 22 January 2006; notes that a centrepiece commitment of Evo Morales was to nationalise Bolivia’s vast natural gas holdings, the second largest in South America, and to reject the US-inspired neo-liberal economics of privatisation and inequality; welcomes the growing strength of the socialist movement across Latin and South America, indicated by the growing strength of Cuba, the rise of Hugo Chavez’s socialist Venezuela, the election of Evo Morales in Bolivia and the lead that left candidate, Ollanta Humala, currently commands in the run-up to Peru’s presidential elections in April, and recognises that new winds are blowing across Latin and South America and that these winds spell the end of imperialist neo-liberal subjugation of that sector of the world in favour of wealth redistribution, public ownership, national sovereignty and anti-poverty policies.
