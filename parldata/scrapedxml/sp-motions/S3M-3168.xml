*S3M-3168 Kenneth Gibson: Ending the Civil War in Sri Lanka—That the Parliament congratulates the Sri Lankan army and government on the capture of Kilinochchi from the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) earlier this year after heavy fighting; considers that the LTTE is a terrorist organisation that has carried out indiscriminate attacks on the Sinhalese community, Indian Tamils, Tamil Muslims and moderate Sri Lankan Tamils during the 25 years of its insurgency, a conflict that has cost over 70,000 lives; is aware that in attempting to eradicate the LTTE, which has used suicide bombings, assassinations and intimidation to further its aims, Sri Lankan forces have, regrettably, inflicted civilian casualties; acknowledges that terrorist organisations frequently hide and launch attacks from among vulnerable civilian populations, callously believing, often rightly, that when women and children are unintentionally killed by counter insurgents it will increase sympathy and support for the terrorist cause; urges the LTTE to accept that there is no violent solution to its grievances, and calls on both it and the Sri Lankan Government to end the fighting and needless loss of life with the aim of negotiating a peaceful settlement, which will inevitably require a willingness to compromise on both sides. Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Bashir Ahmad*
