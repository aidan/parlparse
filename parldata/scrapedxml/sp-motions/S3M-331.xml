 *S3M-331# Liam McArthur: Air Ambulance Service in Orkney—That the Parliament notes the continuing concerns felt in Orkney about the provision of air ambulance cover in the islands, the validity of which were demonstrated by the recent failure of the Scottish Ambulance Service helicopter to evacuate a patient from Papa Westray because of the weather conditions, with the patient only being evacuated thanks to the co-operation of the pilot of a Loganair BN Islander who was able to use his local experience of the weather to make use of a short weather window to reach the island; further notes that this would not have been possible had the evacuation been needed outside Loganair’s operational hours; believes that an independent review of the provision of air ambulance cover in Orkney is urgently needed, and further believes that the outcome of such a review would be the recognition of the need to provide a Kirkwall-based BN Islander air ambulance to provide a back up to the main Scottish Ambulance Service aircraft.
