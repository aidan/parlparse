 * S2M-2533 Carolyn Leckie:International Women’s Day - Women, Low Pay and Nursery Nurses—That the Parliament recognises International Women’s Day on 8 March 2005; celebrates the achievements of women through struggle but recognises that women still lag behind in terms of pay and rights and that they are still unequal; notes that women are more likely to be poor and in low-paid jobs and more likely to be victims of violence and abuse; recognises that it is now a year since the all-out strike action by nursery nurses and that they still have not achieved acceptable national pay, and believes that the Scottish Executive should live up to its promises and correct this injustice.
