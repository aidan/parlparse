*S2M-4492 Dr Jean Turner: The Continuing Rise of Chlamydia—That the Parliament notes with concern the continuing rise in Chlamydia, in light of recent figures showing increases in eight of the fifteen NHS board areas, with the fastest rise occurring among the 16 to 19-years age group; notes that Chlamydia is the commonest treatable sexually transmitted infection in Scotland and that the majority of those infected have no symptoms; further notes that the Healthy Respect pilot in Lothian, which uses postal testing kits for Chlamydia, is yet to be extended to the rest of Scotland; notes also that, despite £4.5 million funding given to NHS boards to help implement the national sexual health strategy, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde as the biggest health board does not plan to introduce Chlamydia postal testing kits and that this may impair the establishment of a national contract with NHS boards to provide Chlamydia postal testing kits through a Scottish Executive bulk and shared purchasing arrangement, and calls on all NHS boards to implement the Scottish Executive Health Department’s recommendation in the national sexual health strategy for postal testing kits for Chlamydia, and other sexually transmitted infections, to be introduced.
