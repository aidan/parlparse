 S3M-4675 Margo MacDonald: Tackling Healthcare Associated Infections—That the Parliament, in light of the seriousness of Professor Hugh Pennington’s assessment of the penetration of Clostridium difficile in Scotland’s hospitals and while recognising the various initiatives taken by the Scottish Government to counteract the presence and spread of Clostridium difficile and other healthcare associated infections, calls on the health spokespersons of all parties to form an ad hoc committee to review ongoing initiatives and agree a focused and effective way forward to minimise healthcare associated infections and restore patient confidence in Scotland’s hospitals.
