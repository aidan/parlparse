*S3M-436♦ Cathy Peattie: Antonine Friendship Link—That the Parliament welcomes the display of the Antonine Friendship Link Scroll; notes that the Antonine Friendship Link was set up to highlight the plight of Palestinians affected by Israel’s construction of a "separation wall" by linking Falkirk and the village of Jayyous which is in close proximity to the Israeli wall; further notes the World Bank report, published in May 2007, which concludes that economic recovery and sustainable growth will require a fundamental reassessment of closure practices and a restoration of the presumption of movement; believes that it is a travesty that the wall has split communities and families and denied people access to water supplies, land and livelihoods, and considers that the removal of the wall and the establishment of a viable Palestinian state should be actively encouraged.
