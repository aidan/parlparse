*S2M-1695.1 Murdo Fraser: Growing Scotland’s Economy - Building on Progress—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1695) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from first "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the continuing underperformance of the Scottish economy relative to the United Kingdom as a whole, despite the economic strategies of the Scottish Executive over the last five years; further notes with concern that Scotland was ranked 36th out of 60 countries in IMD World Competitiveness Yearbook 2004, some 14 places behind the United Kingdom as a whole; recognises the broad consensus of the business community in response to the Executive’s recently published framework for economic development in Scotland, that action rather than words is required from the Executive to grow the Scottish economy, and calls upon the Executive to take immediate steps to create a more business-friendly environment by reducing business rates and water charges and cutting red tape, thereby encouraging business development and boosting Scotland’s economic competitiveness."
