*S3M-2057.2 Liam McArthur: Investment in Scottish Infrastructure—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2057) in the name of John Swinney, insert at end "but notes that the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth promised the Parliament that a decision on the method of financing for the new Forth crossing would be made in Autumn 2007; is concerned that eight months later no decision has been taken; further notes that the First Minister’s preferred method of issuing "patriotic bonds" has been dismissed as illegal and the non-profit distribution model is considered inappropriate for high risk projects, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to make a statement to the Parliament setting out method of funding, management arrangements and timetable for procurement of the new Forth crossing before the summer recess."
