*S2M-4528 Janis Hughes: NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Facilities Management Contractâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the decision by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to bring its facilities management contract back in-house from December 2006, which will see 500 catering, portering, domestic and security staff return to the NHS team; congratulates UNISON Scotland and all other trade unions involved for their work on behalf of their members in this matter; notes that this will bring to an end the concept of a "two-tier" workforce in Glasgow Royal Infirmary by ensuring that all staff are entitled to NHS pay and conditions, thus entitling them to more holidays, better pay, more family-friendly workplaces and access to the NHS pension scheme, and believes that this decision will have a positive effect on patients as well as staff morale.
