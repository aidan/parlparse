*S1M-2062 Richard Lochhead: Grampian Out-of-Hours GP Co-operative—That the Parliament recognises the vital service provided to the public in Grampian by the out-of-hours GP co-operative G-DOCS; expresses concern over the projected shortfall for this financial year that places a question mark over the service’s future; recognises that many GPs may opt for early retirement should this service cease while others, particularly female GPs, may avoid out-of-hours calls given that there would be a reduction in security, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to intervene to ensure that there is sufficient funding for G-DOCS in order to maintain the service provided to patients, particularly in rural areas of Grampian.
