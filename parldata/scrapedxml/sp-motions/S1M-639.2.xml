*S1M-639.2 Mr Murray Tosh: Water Charges—As an amendment to motion (S1M-639) in the name of Bruce Crawford, delete from "believes" to end and insert "notes with concern the increasing cost of funding capital expenditure on water and sewerage from annual water charges; calls for a review of the structure and powers of Scotland’s water authorities, with a view to funding programmed capital expenditure from capital sources, and condemns the Executive for this year’s increase in water bills and council tax levels and the deep cuts forced on council services by the reduction in resources for local government from levels available under the previous Conservative Government." Supported by: Lord James Douglas-Hamilton*
