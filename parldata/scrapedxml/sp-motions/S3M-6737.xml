 *S3M-6737 Jim Hume: An Uncertain Future for the Users of Leuchie Houseâ€”That the Parliament is greatly saddened by news that the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Society intends to withdraw support from the Leuchie House respite care home in North Berwick in November 2010 following a review of its respite services; considers that Leuchie House, which hosts people with MS from all over the United Kingdom, provides a unique service and a high quality of care; expresses concern for the welfare of users of the service and that of their families and carers who will be unable to access similar respite care anywhere in Scotland after November; believes that the MS Society has a duty of care to its service users and their families to prevent a break in the service provision, and calls on the MS Society to reconsider its decision.
