*S1M-2126 Mr Brian Monteith: Scottish Ballet—That the Parliament notes with regret moves made to transform Scottish Ballet into a contemporary dance company without prior public discussion, takes account of the views of the Scottish Ballet’s artistic director and the resident dancers who all oppose the change, expresses concern that such a move would undermine Scotland’s ability to stage a full length traditional classical ballet, and calls upon Scottish Ballet to delay consideration of such a significant change to its remit until such time as there has been a full debate about the public support for dance in Scotland and confirmation that there is a market to justify such a transformation.
