*S2M-5258.2 Tommy Sheridan: Council Taxâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-5258) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from "a 50% discount" to end and insert "the unfair Tory council tax to be scrapped and replaced with a progressive and fair income-based alternative in order to tax the well-paid and wealthy more and the low-paid and pensioners less and effect a significant redistribution of income from those with most towards those with least, thereby improving social justice and economic activity across Scotland, and condemns those political parties such as the SNP and Liberal Democrats who promote opposition to the council tax publicly but who refused to support scrapping it on 1 February 2006 when they failed to vote for the Council Tax Abolition and Service Tax Introduction (Scotland) Bill."
