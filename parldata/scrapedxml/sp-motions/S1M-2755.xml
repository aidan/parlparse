 *S1M-2755# Mr Murray Tosh: Caisteal Tioram, Moidartâ€”That the Parliament notes the decision of Scottish Ministers to refuse Scheduled Monument Consent for the proposed renovation of Caisteal Tioram in Moidart; further notes the warning by the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporter, Graham Duncan, that the structure is in danger of collapse; acknowledges the central significance of Scotland's built heritage to the Scottish Executive's tourism strategy; recognises the role of the Scottish Executive and Historic Scotland in conserving Scotland's mediaeval and early modern castles and fortresses, and believes that the Scottish Executive should take an early initiative in bringing forward a project for the consolidation and conservation of both Caisteal Tioram and Mingarry Castle in Ardnamurchan. Supported by: Mr Keith Raffan*
