*S2M-3489 Christine Grahame: Pingat Jasa Malaysia Medal—That the Parliament regrets the decision by Her Majesty’s Government to refuse to allow veterans of the Malaysian emergency from 1953 to 1957, including the King’s Own Scottish Borderers, to accept the Pingat Jasa Malaysia medal; notes that other Commonwealth nations such as New Zealand and Australia have allowed their veterans to accept this recognition; further notes that this recognition will extend shortly to veterans from Fiji, Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Zimbabwe; considers that this refusal is wholly unacceptable and inexplicable, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive, on behalf of the Scottish regiments such as the King’s Own Scottish Borderers, to make immediate representations to Her Majesty’s Government to right this obvious wrong which insults both veterans and the Malaysian Government.
