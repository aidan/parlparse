*S3M-167 Jamie Hepburn: Extraordinary Rendition—That the Parliament notes that the Association of Chief Police Officers has declared that its investigation has found no evidence to suggest that extraordinary rendition flights have landed in the United Kingdom; further notes the recent media coverage that provides contrary evidence, as well as expressing the ongoing concern of organisations such as Amnesty International and Liberty, that such flights have been facilitated through UK airports; believes that there are significant grounds for a fuller investigation, and welcomes the approach of the Scottish Government which has invited human rights organisations, such as Amnesty International and Liberty, to engage in dialogue with it and present their concerns.
