*S3M-7722♦ Linda Fabiani: Hunter House Museum, East Kilbride—That the Parliament recognises the value of local history museums to Scotland’s communities; is concerned at the potential closure of museums such as the A-listed Hunter House Museum in East Kilbride, the birthplace of the famous medical pioneers, William and John Hunter, which houses interactive displays telling the story of their lives and medical discoveries; understands that the museum is one of the few places in East Kilbride where people are able to discover more about what it sees as the town’s rich history and heritage, and believes that a potential way forward for such facilities, should local authorities decide to close them, would be for them to be given over to community groups and trusts that show the commitment and ability to preserve such precious resources for community benefit.
