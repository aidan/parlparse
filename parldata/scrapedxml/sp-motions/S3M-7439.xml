*S3M-7439 Liam McArthur: FishFight Campaign—That the Parliament welcomes the FishFight campaign headed by the food campaigner, Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall, which aims to end wasteful fish discards; considers that the current quota system imposed by the EU Common Fisheries Policy forces fishermen to dump large quantities of marketable dead fish back into the sea; is not surprised that the campaign is supported by the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation given Scotland’s fishermen’s track record for developing and supporting innovative alternatives to crude quota, such as the use of selective nets and area closures; believes that, if Scotland’s seas and the fishermen who make their living from them are to have a sustainable future, fishermen, environmentalists and scientists have to work together to persuade European governments and the European Commission to move away from what are seen as bureaucratically convenient quota systems to alternatives that avoid the scandal of discards, and commends all those involved in the FishFight campaign for helping to shine a spotlight on the wasteful dumping of fish and on the damage that it does to the environment and the financial viability of Scottish fishermen.
