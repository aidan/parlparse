*S3M-46 Murdo Fraser: Roman Antonine Guard—That the Parliament commends the work carried out by the charity, The Antonine Guard, to educate people and inspire them to learn more about Scotland’s Roman history; notes that our Roman heritage has helped shape today’s Scotland; believes that more must be done to safeguard Roman remains and sites in Scotland, such as Ardoch Roman Fort in Perthshire; further believes that Scotland’s Roman history should not just be preserved but be used as an educational tool to get children interested in Scotland’s past and to learn about conservation; supports the application to see the Antonine Wall gain World Heritage status, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider the creation of a national Roman centre in an area of Scotland that has strong links to Scotland’s Roman past.
