 *S3M-3759♦ Maureen Watt: Airport Passenger Duty—That the Parliament notes with concern the announcements by BMI and Ryanair that they are to reduce the services from Aberdeen airport; recognises that air travel is vital to the economy of the north east and that economic growth in the region would be enhanced by better connections to tourist and business destinations; notes the announcement by Ryanair that higher Air Passenger Duty (APD) in the United Kingdom makes Aberdeen a less attractive option for expansion compared to other European cities, and considers that a lower APD at Scottish airports would promote economic growth.
