 *S3M-7220 Richard Baker: Security Industry Authorityâ€”That the Parliament expresses its concern at the decision by the UK Government that the work of the Security Industry Authority (SIA) should be subject to a "phased transition to new regulatory regime"; considers that the SIA has made real progress in reducing the level of criminality in the private security industry, encouraging the raising of standards in training and delivery in the industry and leading to an improvement in its public perception, and believes that moves to abolish the SIA threaten this progress; also considers that the SIA has successfully worked with partners in Scotland, including the Scottish Government, local authorities, police and other agencies; believes that the SIA has a key role at a time when regulation of the private security industry will be of crucial importance, in the run up to the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and urges the Scottish Government to engage in dialogue with the UK Government on this process and keep the Parliament informed of developments as they will affect the security industry in Scotland.
