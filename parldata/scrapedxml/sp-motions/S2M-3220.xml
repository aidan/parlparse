*S2M-3220# John Scott: The Future Provision of Emergency and Unscheduled Care Services in Ayrshire and Arranâ€”That the Parliament notes the plans by NHS Ayrshire and Arran to institute a public consultation on the future provision of emergency and unscheduled care in Ayrshire; expresses concern that this consultation only includes options to downgrade the existing accident and emergency unit at Ayr Hospital, and expects NHS Ayrshire and Arran to abide by the spirit of the report, Building a Health Service Fit for the Future, by Professor David Kerr by listening to the views of both the public and health professionals in Ayrshire and taking full account of these views before reaching a decision on the future of accident and emergency care provision in the county.
