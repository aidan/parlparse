*S3M-5908.2 Elaine Murray: Aquaculture—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5908) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from second "notes" to end and insert "; also recognises the potential of the industry to increase the availability of healthy, environmentally sustainable, locally-produced food; notes the considerable work being carried out under the auspices of A Fresh Start – the renewed Strategic Framework for Scottish Aquaculture, published on 21 May 2009, and notes the continuing commitment to dialogue on the future of the industry in Scotland; regrets, however, the late publication of Delivering Planning Reform for Aquaculture on the Scottish Government website on the day before this debate, and urges the Scottish Government, in future, to ensure that sufficient time is allowed between publication of government documents and their debate in Parliament to enable stakeholders and MSPs to adequately consider their contents."
