 *S3M-3884 Ross Finnie: Support Retention of League of Hospital Friends Café—That the Parliament notes the services provided by the charitable organisation, League of Hospital Friends, at Inverclyde Royal Hospital for 36 years, including a cafeteria service staffed by a rota of 60 voluntary workers serving tea, coffee, rolls and a variety of healthy eating options and a volunteer hospital transport system, using its profits, which amount cumulatively to over £1 million, to maintain and refurbish the cafeteria and to purchase additional medical equipment for the hospital, and condemns the decision by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde effectively to evict the charity and replace it with an Aroma-style coffee room service run by the board as not being in the best interests of patients, visitors and staff.
