*S1M-3880.2 Lewis Macdonald: Scottish Economic Growth—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3880) in the name of Andrew Wilson, leave out from "notes" to end and insert "supports the Scottish Executive’s aim of increasing sustainable economic growth over the long term; recognises that increasing Scotland’s prosperity is essential to the fulfilment of the Executive’s objectives of closing the opportunity gap, building first-class public services and ensuring sustainable development; calls for all leaders in Scottish public life to work towards a national consensus around the drive to bridge the gap between Scotland’s economic performance and economic potential, and endorses the work being undertaken by the Executive to use the powers of the Parliament to help business grow and to secure a smart, successful Scotland by developing the science and skills base, improving global connections and investing in transport and communications infrastructure."
