*S3M-84 Margo MacDonald: Parliamentary Development—That the Parliament believes that under its auspices a non-policy-making research, development and monitoring unit should be established to report on the effectiveness of the Parliament’s present powers and relationships as defined in the Scotland Act 1998 and to probe whether these need amendment in the light of changes to EU powers, to investigate areas which may benefit from changes to or extension of the powers conferred by the Scotland Act because of technological or other reasons, to report on the Memorandum of Understanding and Co-operation and the relationships with the National Assembly for Wales and the Northern Ireland Assembly, on an issue-by-issue basis, without prescription or proscription, to examine how different levels of autonomy, including sovereignty, might affect public services and, using the Parliament’s resources, to publicise the outcome of such investigation.
