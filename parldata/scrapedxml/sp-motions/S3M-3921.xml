*S3M-3921 Christine Grahame: Scottish SPCA’s Rehoming Week—That the Parliament welcomes and supports the Scottish SPCA’s Rehoming Week from 20 to 26 April 2009, which hopes to increase awareness of the variety of animals that are in care and in need of homes; recognises that the Scottish SPCA, a purely Scottish charity, is the only animal welfare charity that rescues every kind of animal in Scotland, including dogs, cats, rabbits and less common pets such as reptiles, rodents, birds and exotic animals, and notes that rehoming is predicated on suitable and responsible ownership.
