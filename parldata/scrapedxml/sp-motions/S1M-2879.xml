*S1M-2879 Michael Russell: Sportscotland Relocation to North Ayrshire-That the Parliament notes the requirement on sportscotland to consider relocating from Edinburgh; recognises the potential of North Ayrshire as a place for growth in government related jobs and the poor record to date of such job creation in the area; urges North Ayrshire Council to take positive and determined steps to attract such jobs and especially those that would be created by the move of sportscotland to the area; observes that sportscotland already has facilities in North Ayrshire, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to direct sportscotland to consider North Ayrshire as the preferred site for its relocation.
