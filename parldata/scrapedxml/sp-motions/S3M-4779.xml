*S3M-4779 Bill Kidd: Newly-released Ministry of Defence Documents Indicate Nuclear Risk at Faslane—That the Parliament notes with concern Ministry of Defence internal safety reports regarding the risk of a major nuclear accident at Faslane Naval base, newly released following a freedom of information request by the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament; considers that these reports state that plutonium from up to 48 nuclear warheads could potentially escape and cause widespread contamination and cancers if there was to be an accident while a Trident submarine was being moved by the on-base shiplift facility; further notes with particular concern that in the released reports the numbers regarding how far the contamination could potentially spread, how many cancers it might cause and how probable such an accident may be have been redacted; believes that the content of these reports reveals the gravity of the risk that Trident poses to the Scottish public, and calls on the UK Government to abandon plans to renew what is widely believed to be the irrelevant Trident weapons system and remove all nuclear submarines from Scottish waters.
