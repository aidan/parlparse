*S2M-5211 Frances Curran: Congratulations to Highland Council Tenants on Voting Against Stock Transfer—That the Parliament congratulates Highland Council tenants for voting conclusively by three to two against mass stock transfer of their homes, thus joining the tenants of Renfrewshire, Stirling and Edinburgh councils; notes that, despite the blackmail of tenants to either acquiesce to stock transfer or lose investment in their housing stock and the millions spent promoting transfer, the policy has again been rejected by council tenants, and calls on the Executive to abandon a policy that has no democratic mandate among the communities of Scotland and to instead invest in building and maintaining council stock to ensure that council rents remain affordable. Supported by: Rosie Kane*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Campbell Martin*
