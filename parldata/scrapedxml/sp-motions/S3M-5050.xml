*S3M-5050 Michael McMahon: Give All Racism in Scottish Football the Boot—That the Parliament welcomes the swift response from Show Racism the Red Card and Glasgow Rangers FC to the racial abuse allegedly suffered by Maurice Edu; notes with disappointment that the relevant incident took place during Show Racism the Red Card’s annual Fortnight of Action during which all of Scotland’s football clubs combine to deliver an anti-racist message; welcomes the demonstration of their support for the campaign through on-pitch activities in a weekend of action on 24 and 25 October 2009; agrees that racism of any kind is totally unacceptable; urges fans of all Scottish football clubs to challenge all examples of racism in football and society in general; believes that the singing of "the Famine Song" in particular has not been challenged vigorously enough, and calls on anti-racist organisations and football authorities to respond as strongly to any and all future incidents of racism in Scottish football and with the same level of condemnation and action as has been the case on this occasion.
