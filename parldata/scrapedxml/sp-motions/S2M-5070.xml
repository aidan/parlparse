*S2M-5070 Christine Grahame: Citizens Advice Direct—That the Parliament recognises the essential work of Citizens Advice Direct, now approaching its second anniversary providing a helpline of particular use to those who are unable to access their local Citizens Advice Bureaux (CABx) for a variety of reasons, such as lack of mobility, being housebound, unaffordable transport or childcare costs or because they work during traditional CAB opening hours; notes that more than 85% of client inquiries are resolved by this service in the initial contact while more complex issues are referred to the CABx or other advice services and that, to date, some 20,000 clients have had their issues resolved; further notes that Citizens Advice Direct provides advice on best practice to other organisations using helplines, and urges the Scottish government to support this service through appropriate funding.
