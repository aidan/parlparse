*S2M-3251 Mr Brian Monteith: Free Use of MECS—That the Parliament notes the decision of Stirling Council to introduce an annual charge of £52 for use of the Mobile Emergency Care System (MECS); believes that the charge is a significant cost for many vulnerable pensioners; further believes that the charge makes a mockery of the Scottish Executive’s much-vaunted claims of free personal care for the elderly, and calls on Stirling Council to remove the charge with immediate effect to ensure that this valuable service is available free to some of the Stirling community’s most vulnerable people. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
