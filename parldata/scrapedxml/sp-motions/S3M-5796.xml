*S3M-5796 Marilyn Livingstone: Free Health Check-ups in Kirkcaldy Store—That the Parliament supports the Kirkcaldy and Levenmouth Community Health Partnership in its efforts to provide community-based NHS services in Kirkcaldy; commends its latest initiative, which involves a registered nurse being posted in the Co-operative store in the Templehall area for three hours a week to offer free healthcare services and advice, including blood pressure, height and weight checks and information on healthy eating and mental health and wellbeing; recognises that the initiative allows local people the flexibility to attend without an appointment as well as to gain access to a range of services available from the health check-up nurse; congratulates the efforts of the Kirkcaldy and Levenmouth Community Health Partnership for targeting the health of those in the Templehall area, which has remained in the top 15% most deprived areas in Scotland according to the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2009, and hopes that, by making it easier for people to access high quality advice and information, local health and wellbeing will improve.
