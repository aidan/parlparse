*S3M-283 Mary Scanlon: Thomas Telford Celebrations—That the Parliament notes that 9 August 2007 marks the 250th anniversary of the birth of Thomas Telford, known as "pontifex maximus", the high priest of bridges; further notes that in the Highlands alone Thomas Telford was responsible for the building of over 1,200 miles of roads, many harbours and churches and over 1,000 bridges, one of which was the Craigellachie bridge in Moray which spans the River Spey; notes that, when completed in 1815, this 150ft bridge was regarded as one of the finest cast iron bridges in Britain as it still is; supports Moray Council in the celebrations it has organised to celebrate the life and works of an engineer whose structures are still much admired almost two centuries after their completion, and further supports the Institution of Civil Engineers for awarding the bridge International Landmark status, becoming one of only 200 buildings in the world to be awarded this prestigious status and joining the ranks of the Eiffel Tower and San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge.
