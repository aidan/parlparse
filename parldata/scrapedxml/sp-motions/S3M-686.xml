*S3M-686♦ Sandra White: Labour’s Disingenuous Position on Post Office Closures—That the Parliament expresses serious concern over the effect that the announced post office closures across Glasgow, central Scotland and Argyll will have on vulnerable members of society, many of whom rely on the essential services that these offices provide; acknowledges that in the debate in the House of Commons on 15 May 2002 opposition parties voted in favour of the motion calling for the Labour government to "set out a clear policy and timetable for heading off a potentially disastrous collapse of the rural and urban network", while Labour MPs voted against the motion in favour of an amendment that "applauds the Government’s decision to accept all 24 of the PIU recommendations in its June 2000 report Counter Revolution-Modernising the Post Office Network"; strongly condemns Ann McKechin MP and other Labour Party members in Glasgow for their disingenuousness in publicly opposing the closures while having voted in favour of recommendations for closure back in 2002, believing that these actions serve to further erode the confidence ordinary people have in their politicians, and believes that misleading constituents for political gain warrants an apology.
