 *S3M-629 Kenneth Gibson: Young Runawaysâ€”That the Parliament recognises that each year thousands of children under 16 years from all parts of Scotland and every social background, for a multitude of different reasons, run away from home; is concerned that young, vulnerable runaways are at high risk of being physically or sexually abused; welcomes the report A Scoping Study of Services for Young Runaways, funded by the Scottish Government and published by 1 in 9 - The Scottish Coalition for Young Runaways, and notes the findings of the report and the need for (a) a nationally consistent method for the collection of basic data around young runaways, (b) the establishment of inter-agency protocols throughout Scotland which describe how each agency responds to young runaways, in particular those who run away from home, as recommended by Scottish Executive Guidance, "Young Runaways" in 2003, (c) return home welfare interviews for young people who, having run away, return home, to assess need and help access support and advice if required, (d) services that provide preventative and continued support for young runaways and (e) a network of safe emergency accommodation, including refuge, to ensure the safety of young runaways and providing them and their families with ongoing support.
