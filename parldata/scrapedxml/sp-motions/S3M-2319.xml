 *S3M-2319 Sandra White: "Bring It On!"â€”That the Parliament welcomes the recent "Bring It On!" event held in Glasgow for over 500 teenagers from nine different secondary schools, aimed at educating pupils about the dangers of street violence, gang-related violence, drugs, alcohol and personal safety in a relaxed and informal setting; notes that similar initiatives, such as "Operation Reclaim" and specific behavioural change workshops, have aided in reducing the crime rate in the east end of Glasgow by up to 24% since October 2007, and hopes that these significant achievements will be welcomed by all.
