 *S1M-3462 Tommy Sheridan: Sweet Sixteen—That the Parliament congratulates the team responsible for the film Sweet Sixteen which was made and premiered in Greenock and won the best script award at the Cannes Film Festival; notes with concern the decision of the British Board of Film Classification to give the film an "18" rating meaning that many of the young actors who made the film would not be allowed to view it; believes that this is clearly absurd and that, further, the decisions on what Scots see in the cinema should be decided in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty’s Government to devolve decisions on censorship to Scotland.
