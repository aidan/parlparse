*S2M-1815 Margaret Mitchell: New Kerbside Recycling Service—That the Parliament notes with concern that the new kerbside recycling service recently adopted by East Ayrshire Council, South Lanarkshire Council and other local authorities throughout Scotland, and which is intended to encourage the necessary and worthwhile commitment to responsible waste management, is being undermined and is threatening the enthusiasm and goodwill of local communities to co-operate as a result of the unhygienic practice of only collecting household residual waste, which cannot be recycled or reused, on a fortnightly basis instead of weekly.
