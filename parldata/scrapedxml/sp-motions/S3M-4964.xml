 *S3M-4964 Pauline McNeill: MOBOs Deliver a Sell-out Show for Glasgow—That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow on the success of the 14th annual Music of Black Origin Awards (MOBOs), held in the city on 30 September 2009; notes that the event held at the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre was a sell-out, with economists predicting that it would boost Glasgow’s economy by £3.6 million; notes that this figure takes into account the success of the MTV Europe Music Awards in Edinburgh in 2003, with coverage of the MOBOs expected to reach 350 million people around the world; further notes the comments of organiser Kanya King that Glasgow, which puts on 150 live music events every week, had earned an unrivalled reputation for hosting major occasions, and calls on the organisers of events such as the BRIT and Ivor Novello Awards to consider following the example of the MOBOs, which were staged outside London for the first time, and bring these awards also to Glasgow, with its renowned status as a UNESCO City of Music.
