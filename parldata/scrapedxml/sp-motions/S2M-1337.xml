*S2M-1337 Colin Fox: Closure of Royal Mail Sorting Office in Broxburn-That the Parliament regrets the decision by Royal Mail to close its Broxburn sorting office; believes that this decision is driven by pressures of privatisation and will inevitably lead to a poorer mail delivery service for people in the Broxburn area; notes the strike action taken by staff in Broxburn, and applauds their efforts to persuade Royal Mail to maintain a local sorting office in that area.
