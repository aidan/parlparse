*S3M-5372 Trish Godman: Stop Demand, End Prostitution Now—That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow City Council and the End Prostitution Now campaign in their aim to raise awareness of the harm caused by prostitution and to put the focus firmly on the buyers of sex who create the demand and have been invisible from the public debate until now; considers that only by targeting this demand and challenging attitudes toward buying sex will a stop be put to this harmful activity that blights Scotland’s cities and towns; agrees that prostitution is an appalling form of human exploitation, and believes that an unequivocal message must be sent that buying sex will not be tolerated.
