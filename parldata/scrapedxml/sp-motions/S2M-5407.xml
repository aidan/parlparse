*S2M-5407 Carolyn Leckie: Support the SFA in Scotland Manager Crisis—That the Parliament expresses regret that, when the Scottish national football team had shown signs of improvement and potential success and had begun to restore Scotland’s pride in the national football team, Walter Smith has chosen to leave that team and a national organisation, in the form of the Scottish Football Association (SFA), with limited resources in favour of working for an "Old Firm" plc steeped in wealth that perpetuates inequality in the national game; supports the SFA in its efforts to gain appropriate compensation, and hopes that an appropriate replacement who will make a long-term commitment to the national team will be placed in post as soon as possible. Supported by: Frances Curran*, Rosie Kane*
