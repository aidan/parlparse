*S3M-2102.1 Elaine Murray: Small Business Bonus Scheme—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2102) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the introduction of the Small Business Bonus Scheme (SBBS) on 1 April 2008; recognises that business rates relief schemes play a part in government support for small business; notes also the schemes initiated by previous administrations but believes that the allocation of a further £315 million, over the period of this spending review, to the implementation of the SBBS does not by itself represent the most effective way of stimulating local economic development or national economic growth, and further believes that government funding targeted on energy efficiency, training and town centre regeneration would benefit both small businesses and their local communities."
