*S3M-3545 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Bus Services in Edinburgh—That the Parliament is concerned about the announcement from First Bus that four bus routes in Edinburgh are to be withdrawn completely and a further six reduced, including the number 140 service to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary; notes that the ongoing tram chaos has been cited as one of the primary causes for the reduction in bus routes; regrets the impact of the tram-related roadworks on levels of public transport use in the city; expresses deep concern over reports of spiralling costs and expected delays in completion of the tram project and its potential impact on the future services provided by both Lothian Buses and First Bus, and believes that the award-winning service provided by the publicly owned Lothian Buses must not be put in jeopardy by the escalating costs of the tramline.
