 *S3M-7066 Gil Paterson: The Boys are Back in Town—That the Parliament wishes to record its congratulations to all those involved in first having the vision to bring to the Kelvingrove Art Gallery the exhibition, Pioneering Painters: The Glasgow Boys 1880-1900, of the world-renowned group of artists collectively known as the Glasgow Boys; further congratulates those at every level who worked so well to make what is considered this extraordinary event a record success; expresses its thanks to all from across the world who kindly loaned many of the works of art to the gallery, which amounted to over 400 pieces of art by what are considered some of Scotland’s most inventive and talented artists, resulting in their being displayed in the city of Glasgow; wishes Kelvingrove well for the future, and encourages it in its endeavours to display more exhibitions that put Glasgow and Scotland on the world art map and which would bring great enjoyment and fulfilment to Scottish art lovers. Supported by: Mary Scanlon*, Bill Kidd*, Kenneth Gibson*, Robin Harper*, Brian Adam*, Alasdair Allan*, Aileen Campbell*, Bill Wilson*, Bob Doris*, Maureen Watt*, Sandra White*
