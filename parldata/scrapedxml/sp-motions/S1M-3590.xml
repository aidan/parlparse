*S1M-3590# Shona Robison: Delivery of Family Planning Services in Dundee-That the Parliament notes with concern the changes being proposed to the delivery of family planning services in Dundee; recognises the important work of well woman clinics like the one in Whitfield which provides a range of family planning and health screening services to women; is further concerned that any closure of that clinic will require women to travel by two buses to the other side of the city in order to access an alternative clinic, and believes that such services are best provided within local communities and that Tayside NHS board should urgently reconsider these proposals.
