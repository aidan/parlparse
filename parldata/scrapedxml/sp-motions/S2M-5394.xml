*S2M-5394 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Climate Change Kills the Poor - Legal Change Can Make a Difference—That the Parliament condemns the latest statement from Tony Blair regarding air travel and climate change; notes that since Labour came to power the United Kingdom’s carbon emissions have increased by around 5%; notes that it is the poor of the world who will suffer most as climate change increases; also notes that diseases, including malaria and diarrhoea, will increase so that 185 million people in Africa alone could die as a direct result by 2100; recognises that droughts will worsen as water supplies for one sixth of the world’s population are at risk from glaciers melting, increasing the frequency and intensity of famines; further notes that flooding as a result of the rise in sea level will threaten 300 million people within decades, creating between 150 and 200 million environmental refugees; acknowledges that rich countries are responsible for 80% of the man-made increases in CO2 ; recognises that the average UK citizen causes in two and a half days as much CO2 emissions as a Malawian does in a year, and calls on the Scottish Executive to put pressure on the Westminster Government to ensure that the proposed climate change legislation has legally binding annual targets which include all aviation emissions. Supported by: Tommy Sheridan*, Chris Ballance*, Mr Mark Ruskell*
