 *S1M-966 Iain Gray: Learning Disability Review-That the Parliament notes that that the report of the Learning Disability Review, The Same as you?, was issued on 11 May to a wide range of consultees, calls for the fullest possible debate on how its recommendations should be implemented, and looks forward to a future where all relevant agencies work together with people with learning disabilities to ensure that they can live as full lives as possible in our communities.
