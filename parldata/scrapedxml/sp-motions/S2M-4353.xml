 *S2M-4353# Alex Fergusson: Galloway Forest Park—That the Parliament notes the launch of Galloway Forest Park: A Strategy – 2006 and Beyond and congratulates Forestry Commission Scotland and its partners on promoting this initiative, the first of its kind in Scotland; believes that the declared intention on the establishment of the park in 1947 that "the charm of the scenery and the historic associations within the boundaries of the forest park may give great pleasure and satisfaction to all who visit it" is as true today as it was then; hopes that the proposed biosphere designation will be duly accorded, but believes that the main aim should be to achieve full National Park status in true recognition of the area’s unique features and as a measure that would enhance the whole of the south west of Scotland.
