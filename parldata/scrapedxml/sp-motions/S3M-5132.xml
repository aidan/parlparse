*S3M-5132 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Dr Elsie Inglis £50 Notes—That the Parliament welcomes the feature of suffragette, Dr Elsie Inglis, on the Clydesdale Bank’s new £50 note, which entered circulation on 2 November 2009; notes that Edinburgh’s own Florence Nightingale was born in India in 1864 and was brought to the city by her father where she attended the Edinburgh School of Medicine for Women; highlights that she set up the Scottish Women’s Hospitals movement in 1914 with field hospitals set up in countries including France, Belgium, Serbia and Greece; further notes that the release of the £50 notes coincides with the 100-year anniversary of the Edinburgh suffrage march, which Elsie Inglis played a significant role in organising, and wishes the Dr Elsie Inglis Scottish Women’s Hospital Trust every success in its campaign to fund a statue to Dr Inglis in Edinburgh.
