*S2M-122 Christine Grahame: Scottish H.A.R.T. (Scottish Heart at Risk Testing)—That the Parliament notes that Heart Week is from 7 to 15 June 2003; commends the work of Scottish H.A.R.T. (Heart at Risk Testing), a Borders-based national charity that researches into all heart diseases, especially cardiomyopathy, raises funds for a mobile screening unit which, with trained staff, will test the health of all young Scottish athletes and campaigns for defibrillators, including automatic external defibrillators, to be provided in all large-scale public venues such as train and bus stations, superstores, sports arenas and swimming pools; notes that the charity recently presented a defibrillator to the Royal Commonwealth Pool, Edinburgh, and that the Lochaber rescue team, through funds raised, will be presenting a defibrillator to the rescue centre at Ben Nevis on behalf of the charity, and commends the determination of Wilma and Kenneth Gunn who, from the tragic loss of their own son Cameron through cardiomyopathy, have developed this positive and growing Scottish charity.
