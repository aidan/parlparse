*S3M-5533 Bob Doris: SECC Success and Community Benefit—That the Parliament congratulates all those involved with the trading success of the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre (SECC), which has reported a 47% increase in trading profits to £627,812 for 2008-09; notes that SEC Ltd is 91% owned by Glasgow City Council and that such success can only be beneficial to both the city’s reputation as a first-class venue for events as well as to Glasgow’s finances; however, has concerns over the decision of SEC Ltd to charge £101.97 plus VAT to journalists for the use of an electric power point at the Glasgow North East by-election, which had a substantial effect on the finances of small community news providers; considers that with the 2010 UK election imminent there should be a review of charges by SEC Ltd that may prohibit local journalists being able to report on the democratic process, and believes that a more general review of the SEC Ltd pricing policy would be welcome to ensure that the SECC is accessible and affordable for use by local small businesses, charities and community organisations.
