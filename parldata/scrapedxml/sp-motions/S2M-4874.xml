 *S2M-4874 Jackie Baillie: Integrated Care at the Vale of Leven Hospital—That the Parliament is dismayed at the recent decision of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to end the Integrated Care Pilot at the Vale of Leven Hospital; believes that the staff involved, including nurses, GPs and consultants, have achieved much in developing a new model of care, lessons from which can be shared across Scotland; notes the NHS board’s view that the problem with providing a continuing emergency service lies with an apparent lack of anaesthetists; considers that alternative options can be explored with a view to retaining anaesthetics’ cover; supports the need to retain a full range of services locally, including the coronary care unit, and calls on the board to reverse its decision to allow integrated care to be further developed in the interests of patient care. Supported by: Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Mr Bruce McFee*
