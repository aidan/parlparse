*S3M-1099 Shirley-Anne Somerville: No Need for Nuclear Energy—That the Parliament notes the release of new energy generation figures for 2005 and 2006 by National Statistics and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform showing that the amount of energy generated by nuclear power in Scotland fell by 24% while energy generated by non-hydro renewable sources increased by 46%; recognises that installed capacity of renewables in Scotland already exceeds installed capacity of nuclear power and that these figures show that the Scottish Government is on course to meet the target of 50% of energy generation from renewable sources by 2020, and confirms that Scotland does not need a new generation of nuclear power stations to meet energy generation or climate change targets.
