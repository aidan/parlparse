*S1M-1968 Irene McGugan: Verdant Works—That the Parliament notes that Dundee Heritage Trust, the charity which owns Dundee’s leading tourist attractions RRS Discovery and Verdant Works, has been forced into a series of cost cutting exercises and staff redundancies because of continuing decline in the Scottish tourism market and a critical shortfall in revenue support; further notes that the Trust has warned that unless significant additional revenue support can be found it will consider the closure of Verdant Works, the last working jute mill in Scotland and the 1999 European Industrial Museum of the Year, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to provide emergency funding to secure the jobs of the 43 staff employed by Dundee Heritage Trust across three sites in the city and, in the longer term, to extend central revenue support in partnership with local authority support to avoid a huge loss, not just to the city of Dundee, but to the cultural heritage of the nation.
