*S1M-355# Mr Brian Monteith: The Education of Children with Severe Low Incidence Disabilities—That the Parliament expresses its concern that the Riddell report on the Education of Children with Severe Low Incidence Disabilities proposes that funding be decentralised to local authorities; notes that this could jeopardise the future of special educational needs schools which provide national centres of excellence, that any change from national funding could dilute specialist provision and detrimentally affect the service to children and that the schools must continue to be funded centrally for this reason, and recommends that no changes be made to the administration or funding regime of these schools for at least a year in order to provide time for the schools to ensure their financial stability for the future and to allow the Education, Culture and Sport Committee of the Parliament to consider the issues involved.
