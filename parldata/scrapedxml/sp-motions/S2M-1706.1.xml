*S2M-1706.1# Dr Sylvia Jackson: Closure of Public Telephone Boxes by BTâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-1706) in the name of Bruce Crawford, leave out from "recognises" to end and insert "takes cognisance of the current BT Scotland review of public payphones and its consultation process with local communities and customers over plans to remove little-used phone boxes; recognises that, with the huge increase in mobile phone take-up, there has been a consequent reduction in payphone usage; is concerned that the consultation process should be as robust as possible, taking into account local community views on the social need of such public telephone boxes, particularly where arguments are made for their retention and that the needs of those customers in deprived areas whose only access to a telephone is via a payphone is an important criterion in the consideration to remove a box; considers that those payphones in remote rural areas, such as parts of the Stirling constituency, where boxes may provide an emergency lifeline for groups like drivers and walkers during the winter period, or where there is poor mobile phone reception, should be given special consideration; shares concerns about communication problems over the consultation process, and believes that BT Scotland should not remove any public telephone box where there is a social need or safety aspect in doing so."
