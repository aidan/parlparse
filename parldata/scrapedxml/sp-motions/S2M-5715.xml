*S2M-5715# Mike Pringle: The Lack of Park-and-Ride in South Edinburgh—That the Parliament welcomes key public transport improvements being delivered by SEStran including bus priority measures, a bus tracker system and cycleway improvements, but is concerned that key schemes for three park-and-ride sites in south Edinburgh at Straiton, Sherrifhall and Lothianburn have yet to open and that the lack of park-and-ride sites in the south of the city is leading to increased commuter parking in residential streets, where residents’ parking is already made difficult by the extension of the controlled parking scheme.
