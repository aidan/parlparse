*S2M-4147 Chris Ballance: Decentralising UK Energy—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of Decentralising UK Energy by the World Alliance for Decentralised Energy (WADE); notes that the report, which compares models of two possible future scenarios: centralised generation using nuclear power and a decentralised system in which energy is predominantly produced close to its point of use using renewables and combined heat and power, concludes that the United Kingdom can meet its targets for cuts in CO2 emissions without resorting to nuclear power and that overall the decentralised solution is far superior, being cleaner as CO2 emissions are 17% lower than in the nuclear scenario and cheaper as overall costs are over £1 billion lower than in the nuclear scenario, even before the cost of managing nuclear waste is factored in, and believes that the Scottish Executive should give urgent consideration to how best to support and encourage the development of a sustainable energy policy based on renewable and micro-renewable technologies.
