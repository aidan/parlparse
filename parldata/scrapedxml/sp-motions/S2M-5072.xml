*S2M-5072 Tommy Sheridan: Wear the White Poppy for a Culture of Peace—That the Parliament commends the Peace Pledge Union and its project to encourage people to wear white poppies this Remembrance Day to support a culture of peace without violence; notes that over 100 million people have been killed in wars since the Great War, the "war to end all wars"; notes that hundreds of millions have been maimed and displaced, and notes that in the history of warfare the 20th century stands out as the bloodiest and most brutal, with three times more people being killed in wars in the last 90 years than the previous 500 years, and that the white poppy symbolises the belief that there are better ways to resolve conflicts than killing strangers. Supported by: Christine Grahame*, Colin Fox*, Campbell Martin*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Mark Ballard*, Eleanor Scott*
