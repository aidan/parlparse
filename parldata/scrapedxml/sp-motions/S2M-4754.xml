 *S2M-4754 Carolyn Leckie: Solidarity—That the Parliament expresses concern with reference to the remarks made by Jack McConnell MSP about relocation of public sector jobs from Edinburgh; agrees with Eddie Reilly, Scottish Secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS), when he states that the relocation cannot work if it is based on reducing the complement of civil and public servants; believes that co-operation on relocation will not be achieved by redundancies and undermining job security; further believes that workers in one area of Scotland should not suffer because of the policy of establishing new jobs in another area; considers that the Scottish Executive should commit to trying to achieve job relocation only with the agreement of the workforce and unions and without redundancies, and offers full support and solidarity to the workers and the PCS.
