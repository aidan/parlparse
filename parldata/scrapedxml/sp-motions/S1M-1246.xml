*S1M-1246 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Lord Advocate's Reference in Trident Case-That the Parliament notes the decision of Sheriff Gimblett in October 1999 in the case of the "Trident Women", who were acquitted of causing malicious damage relating to the Trident Missile Programme on the basis that the women's actions could be regarded as crime prevention through the disarmament of illegal and criminal weapons of mass destruction; further notes that a Lord Advocate's Reference is being heard on related issues; expresses deep concern that in a case of such substantial public interest, proceedings will not be officially recorded; regrets that, as a consequence, there will be no official transcript available to the public or to the respondents; recognises that this may infringe European human rights law; notes further that the respondents will not be allowed audio recording to assist their own record-keeping in the light of the absence of an official record; questions the use of £100,000 of public money for the Lord Advocate's Reference hearing, and calls for the official recording of the proceedings to take place.
