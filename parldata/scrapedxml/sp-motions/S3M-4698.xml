*S3M-4698 Robert Brown: Britain’s Oldest Man—That the Parliament regrets the passing of Robert Taggart, Scotland and Britain’s oldest man, and pays tribute to his long life and experiences; sends its condolences to his daughters and wider family; notes that he was born and bred and lived his life in the Royal Burgh of Rutherglen, itself fittingly Scotland’s oldest Royal Burgh; recalls his long association and achievements over 70 years with Overtoun Park Bowling Club, formerly Rutherglen Public Bowling Club, latterly as a life member, and mourns the passing of a generation who gave so much to Scotland and Britain.
