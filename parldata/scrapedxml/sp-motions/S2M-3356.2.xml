 *S2M-3356.2 Mr Tom McCabe: St Andrew’s Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Bill—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3356) in the name of Dennis Canavan, leave out from "agrees" to end, and insert "notes that the Enterprise and Culture Committee supports the principles of the Bill; believes that St Andrew’s Day should be a day of national celebration and strongly supports the Scottish Executive’s commitment to achieving this objective; notes that the Enterprise and Culture Committee’s Stage 1 report concludes that the Bill does not fulfil this purpose and would not place a statutory obligation on employers to grant St Andrew’s Day as part of employee holiday entitlement; seeks to uphold the consensus across the Parliament that we should only legislate where necessary and when we can give effect to that legislation; believes that there is further work to be done to develop proposals to celebrate St Andrew’s Day; agrees to refer the St Andrew’s Day Bank Holiday (Scotland) Bill back to the Enterprise and Culture Committee for a further report on the general principles, and considers that further proposals should be developed for the celebration of St Andrew’s Day."
