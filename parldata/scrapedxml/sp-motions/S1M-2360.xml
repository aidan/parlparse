*S1M-2360 Gordon Jackson: The Pearce Institute in Govan-That the Parliament recognises the importance of the Pearce Institute since its foundation in 1902 as a community resource at the heart of Govan; understands that a number of city-wide and national groups, such as Glasgow Braendam Link and the Iona Community, also use the building for meetings and as offices; notes that the Institute's trustees have accepted the recommendation of the management committee to close the Institute within weeks after mounting financial crisis; welcomes the efforts of the local community, elected representatives and public agencies in exhausting every possibility to safeguard the Pearce Institute as a resource for the people of Govan; acknowledges the commitment of the Scottish Executive to building partnerships for social inclusion in areas such as Govan, and calls on the Executive to make every effort in supporting moves to save the Pearce Institute.
