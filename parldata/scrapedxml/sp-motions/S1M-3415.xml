*S1M-3415# Cathy Peattie: Firefighters' Pay Formula—That the Parliament notes the changes in the duties of firefighters since their current pay formula was established and, in particular, the greater skills firefighters now require, the additional hazards they face and the changes in the workforce on which their pay formula comparison is based, and believes that these factors should be addressed by a new formula for firefighters’ pay.
