*S2M-3747 Mike Pringle: HMV/Waterstone’s Acquisition of Ottakar’s plc Referred to the Competition Commission—That the Parliament is concerned about loss of competition in the large book retailer market; congratulates the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) for referring the acquisition of Ottakar’s Bookstores by the HMV Group to the Competition Commission; agrees with the OFT that "UK book-buyers value the fruits of this competition, which this merger would eliminate", and calls on the Competition Commission to prevent the merger.
