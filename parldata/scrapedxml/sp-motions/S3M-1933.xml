*S3M-1933 Brian Adam: Scrap the Fuel Duty Rise—That the Parliament notes the calls by both the Federation of Small Businesses and the Scottish Chambers of Commerce for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to cancel the proposed 2p rise in fuel duty, due to be introduced in autumn 2008; notes figures from the Scottish Chambers of Commerce that indicate that the UK Government has received an additional £505 million of revenue due to rising fuel prices over the last six weeks; notes that, according to the Federation of Small Businesses, deferring the 2p rise by six months would cost £550 million, and therefore calls on the Chancellor, in light of this dramatic increase in revenues, to scrap the proposed rise in fuel duty and to introduce a fuel price regulator.
