*S2M-3950 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Scottish Bottled Water—That the Parliament deplores the decision by WH Smith Travel to refuse to stock and prominently place Scottish bottled water in their shops in Scotland’s rail stations; notes that WH Smith Travel shops in Glasgow Central, Glasgow Queen Street and Edinburgh Waverley stations, amongst others, sell many different types of bottled water, including English, French and Italian, but no Scottish bottled water; recognises the important part Scotland’s major rail stations play as the gateway to the country for many visitors, and calls on all MSPs to urge WH Smith to change its policy on this matter and to start stocking Scottish bottled water.
