*S3M-3051 Joe FitzPatrick: Active Scotland Website—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Active Scotland website, www.activescotland.org.uk, which has been developed by NHS Health Scotland as a tool to support the physical activity workforce when working with patients, clients or pupils to answer the question "where do I go to be active?"; notes that the site captures a range of local physical activity opportunities in the form of spaces, places, services and contacts that can help the people of Scotland become more active; welcomes the Scottish Government’s commitment to a healthy Scotland as promoted in Healthy Eating, Active Living: An action plan to improve diet, increase physical activity and tackle obesity (2008-2011), and calls for continued progress to ensure that the people of Scotland enjoy the benefits of an active life.
