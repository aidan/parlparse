 *S2M-28 Tommy Sheridan: Deportation of Ali Serir—That the Parliament notes the case of Ali Serir, an Algerian asylum seeker threatened with deportation to Algeria on Friday 16 May 2003; further notes that Ali is married to Karen from Glasgow and has lived in Royston, Glasgow, for the last 18 months and that Karen is expecting their first child in August; condemns the way Ali and Karen were forcibly removed from their home at 5.20am on 6 February 2003 under an anti-terrorist investigation where no charges were made or are pending, and believes that Ali should be granted asylum to live with his wife and child in Glasgow as his life would be in danger if he returned to Algeria, given the very adverse publicity that has now been generated over his arrest and detention.
