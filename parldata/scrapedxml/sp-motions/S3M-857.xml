 *S3M-857 John Wilson: Equal Rights for Agency Workers—That the Parliament supports the EU directive that offers temporary agency workers protection and benefits equivalent to those enjoyed by permanent staff; notes that, without the passage of this directive or similar domestic legislation, temporary workers, many of whom are women or older adults, are subject to lower hourly rates and worse terms and conditions of employment while performing the same work duties; upholds the recommendation of the Trades Union Congress that there should be no waiting period for equal workers’ rights, and notes that, if rights are delayed for as little as three months of employment, more than 25% of temporary workers would be vulnerable to exploitation by their employers.
