*S3M-6740 Bob Doris: Committing to Subway Modernisation—That the Parliament believes that Glasgow’s subway system is a well-loved and key asset to both Glasgow and the wider west of Scotland region and that it provides a vital service that effectively transports locals, workers and tourists across large parts of the city and eases congestion on Glasgow’s roads; further believes that, over 30 years since the last modernisation programme for the subway was initiated, it is now time for a new modernisation programme that will significantly improve, among other things, ticketing, stations, track and rolling stock as well as the frequency and reliability of trains and enhance the commuter experience; considers that, without such investment, both the operating deficit and public subsidy will significantly increase and the reliability of the subway will suffer, and calls on Strathclyde Passenger Transport (SPT) to provide the Scottish Government with a robust, detailed and affordable business plan for subway modernisation to allow it to scrutinise the plan in detail with a view to working with SPT to identify how subway modernisation can be supported, whether by guaranteeing, under strict conditions, future interest payments on loans taken by the subway operating body in order to enable the significant capital expenditure needed or by any other effective method.
