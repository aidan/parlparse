*S3M-1970 Johann Lamont: Closure of Cyrenians’ Homes—That the Parliament deplores the closure of three residential homes in Aberdeen run by the Cyrenians, a decision forced on the organisation by a huge cut in funding by Aberdeen City Council; notes that this will affect 50 homeless people a year, with a further 100 affected by the closure of the Cygnet Project’s improving employability service, and calls on the Scottish Government to take immediate action to close this funding gap.
