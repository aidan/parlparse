 * S2M-2883# Fergus Ewing:The Future of BBC Highland—That the Parliament notes that BBC Scotland management have decided to close down Radio Scotland’s “Gary Robertson” show from June 2005; expresses concern that the loss of this “strand” (fixed item) on the weekday BBC Radio Scotland programme may result both in the loss of jobs at BBC Highland and also loss of its status within Scottish broadcasting; believes that this will result in the downgrading of the status of BBC Highland at a time when the BBC Scotland management should be encouraging decentralisation and consolidation of programming furth of Glasgow, and considers that BBC Scotland’s management should enter into negotiation on these issues with representatives of the BBC Highland staff.
