*S2M-3497.2 Shiona Baird: The Decline of Scottish Manufacturing—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3497) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from "and therefore calls" to end and insert "but believes that competitiveness need not be compromised by effective regulation and a strong public sector as demonstrated by Finland, Sweden and Denmark, three out of the four top countries in the World Economic Forum’s list of the most competitive countries; notes the potential for developing manufacturing through supporting new sustainable industries such as zero waste, energy efficiency and renewable energy generation, and further believes that the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party’s short-sighted opposition to the development of the Scottish wind energy industry risks seriously hampering the development of this potentially very important Scottish manufacturing industry."
