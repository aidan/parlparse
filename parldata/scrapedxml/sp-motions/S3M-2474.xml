 *S3M-2474 Tavish Scott: Scots Language Centre and Scottish National Dictionaries—That the Parliament notes the support given to the Scots language by the Minister for Europe, External Affairs and Culture in January 2008 when she stated that it "is part of our identity and our heritage as a nation. We must encourage confidence in the use of Scots in all its forms and create opportunities for it to thrive" and that our national languages "should be as valued as any other language spoken in the world"; welcomes this clear statement of support for the Scots language and all related languages, which reflect the rich and varied linguistic heritage found in Scotland from Shetland to Galloway; recognises the important work carried out by the Scots Language Centre and Scottish National Dictionaries in supporting the Scots language; views with concern the threat to the work of these two important bodies from the proposed cut to their funding by the Scottish Arts Council, and believes that their funding should be maintained so that they can continue to help to deliver the Scottish Government’s commitment to the Scots language.
