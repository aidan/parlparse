 *S2M-3768 Helen Eadie: First ScotRail Lets Down Christmas Shoppers in Fife Yet Again—That the Parliament notes there are people living outside Edinburgh who regularly use the train as their preferred mode of transport to the capital city instead of taking their cars; is concerned to learn that on 10 December 2005, in the run-up to the busy Christmas period, dozens of Christmas shoppers in the west Fife area faced misery at Inverkeithing train station as a lack of train capacity left them standing on the platform fuming when a tannoy announcement suddenly told them, without any prior warning, that the train was full and that they would not be allowed on the train; notes that there has been more than a 30% growth in passengers using trains in the last five years, and believes that, if this mode of transport is to attract people from their cars, then First ScotRail requires to ensure that, above all, reliable and adequate train capacity will be put in place, otherwise travellers will resort to the use of their cars instead.
