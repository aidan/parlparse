*S2M-5766 David McLetchie: Small Scotch Whisky Distillers—That the Parliament values the contribution made by small Scottish distillers to the Scotch whisky industry and urges the Scottish Executive to give full consideration to their needs in its examination of proposals to give stronger legal protection for Scotch whisky at a European Union level and to ensure that any such legislation does not discriminate against small Scottish distillers by prohibiting the bulk export of genuine Scotch for bottling overseas, which would be a restraint of trade and detrimental to their interests.
