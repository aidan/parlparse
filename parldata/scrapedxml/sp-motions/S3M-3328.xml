 *S3M-3328 Hugh Henry: Hospital Car Parking Charges—That the Parliament is concerned that proposals by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to limit free car parking to four hours could result in financial penalties being imposed on staff and the public; notes that alternative facilities are often not available; believes that staff having to leave work to move cars after four hours will be disruptive to both staff and patients; also notes that members of the public can require to attend hospital for more that four hours; further believes that these proposals are not consistent with the pledge made by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, and calls for clarification of policy by the cabinet secretary and a commitment by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to revise its policy to avoid financial penalties being imposed on staff or those requiring to attend hospital for longer than four hours.
