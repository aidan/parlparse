*S3M-4533 Robert Brown: Dementia in Care Homes—That the Parliament notes Remember, I’m still me, a joint report by the Care Commission and the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland on the provision of care in residential homes for people with dementia; notes that the report found that 70% of people living in the care homes visited had dementia; is concerned that the report found that some care homes fell seriously short of best practice and that people with dementia were not always getting the best possible care to meet their needs; is appalled that the report found that there was often no regular review of medication, even though 75% of people in homes were taking one or more psychoactive medicines, that the majority of care staff were generally unaware of best-practice guidance and that some felt that they did not have enough time to give the care that they wanted and that there was sometimes little activity, with activity coordinators not always trained or supervised, and calls on the Scottish Government to develop a National Dementia Strategy and work with NHS boards, local authorities and others to address urgently the shortcomings detailed in the report.
