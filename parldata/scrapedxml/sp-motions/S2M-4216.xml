 *S2M-4216 Richard Lochhead: The Spiralling Cost of the Nuclear Clean-Up—That the Parliament notes with great concern the news that the clean-up cost for existing nuclear facilities is set to rise by £9 billion to £65 billion; believes that this highlights that nuclear power is expensive as well as dangerous and dirty; considers that Scotland has no need for new nuclear power stations which, according to the UK Government-appointed Committee on Radioactive Waste Management, if built, would produce radioactive waste nine times stronger than currently exists and will cost billions of pounds to both build and clean up, and also believes that we should reject Labour’s nuclear ambitions, while promoting clean and safe energy technologies with which Scotland has the potential to lead the world.
