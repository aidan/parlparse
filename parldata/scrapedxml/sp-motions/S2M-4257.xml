S2M-4257 Michael Matheson: Privatisation of Search and Rescue Services—That the Parliament recognises the invaluable service provided by Scotland’s mountain rescue teams who, in partnership with the RAF, Royal Navy and Coastguard helicopters, have saved thousands of lives over the decades; notes with concern plans by Her Majesty’s Government to privately outsource search and rescue services; believes that replacing a public professional service with private commercial companies would not meet the high standards of the military air crews and recognises that military air crews would lose essential training if no longer involved in civilian rescues; believes that the highly professional and well-established practice of civilian and military search and rescue services working in partnership has served Scotland well, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty’s Government that the existing search and rescue service should be preserved. R Supported by: Alasdair Morgan, Stewart Stevenson, Mr Kenny MacAskill, Mr Adam Ingram, Robin Harper, Campbell Martin, Jim Mather, Chris Ballance, Mr Bruce McFee, Brian Adam, Bruce Crawford, Rob Gibson, Frances Curran, Christine Grahame, Donald Gorrie
