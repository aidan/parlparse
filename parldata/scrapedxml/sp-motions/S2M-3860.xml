*S2M-3860 Christine Grahame: Keeping Children Safe—That the Parliament, while recognising the importance of the sex offenders’ register and the Disqualified from Working with Children List, accepts that most abused children are abused by someone from within their immediate circle and not by strangers; believes that an approach to child protection that relies on procedures, lists and rigid rules will not keep many of our nation’s children safe but that society at large has a responsibility and a duty to protect the nation’s children; further believes that the criteria and the process for inclusion on the sex offenders’ register should be reconsidered, noting that Children 1st specifically recommends that not all people on this register should automatically be disqualified from working with children and that the criteria for so banning someone should be in the public domain to increase confidence in the child protection system, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to review the operation of both registers, while being mindful that it is not stranger danger but familiar faces which pose most risk to children, and to instigate a public awareness campaign to this end.
