*S3M-7855 Cathy Peattie: Silent Movies at the Hippodrome—That the Parliament welcomes the Hippodrome Festival of Silent Cinema, planned to take place at the Hippodrome, Falkirk, from 18 to 20 March 2011; notes that the Hippodrome is Scotland’s oldest purpose-built picture house, having opened on 11 March 1912, and considers that it is thus a most appropriate venue for the festival; further notes that the festival will include live musical performances, local archive films, classic and rare silent films; wishes the Hippodrome success in this and in its future activity, and looks forward to the centenary of the cinema next year.
