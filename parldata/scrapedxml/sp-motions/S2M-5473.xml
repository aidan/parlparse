*S2M-5473 Colin Fox: Welsh Assembly Abolishes Prescription Charges—That the Parliament congratulates the National Assembly for Wales for taking the decision this week to abolish completely NHS prescription charges for every patient in Wales from April 2007; agrees with the Welsh Minister for Health and Social Services, Dr Brian Gibbons AM, that the measure will reduce patient inequality and particularly benefit those patients with chronic illnesses or on low incomes and "enable those people who need medication to get it to improve their health and ultimately their quality of life", and believes that Scotland should follow the terrific example set in Wales and also abolish the charges.
