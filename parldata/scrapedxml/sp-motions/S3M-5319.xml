S3M-5319 Cathy Jamieson: Bill Shankly, Glenbuck’s Most Famous Son—That the Parliament wishes to pay tribute to the late Bill Shankly on the 50th anniversary of his appointment as manager of Liverpool FC, where he took the team from the old second division to win three league championships, two FA Cups and the UEFA Cup; notes that he began his career with the famous Glenbuck Cherrypickers, whose record in producing 50 professional footballers from a mining village with a population of only 1,000 people is unequalled in world football, and commends Bill Shankly’s assertion that "The socialism I believe in is everyone working for each other, everyone having a share of the rewards. It’s the way I see football, the way I see life." Supported by: Jamie Hepburn, Jack McConnell
