 *S1M-2665 Ms Margo MacDonald: New Hospitals-That the Parliament, whilst welcoming the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, notes that it will cost £184 million to build and will cost taxpayers some £1 billion to rent over its lifetime; agrees with the report by NHS consultant Dr Matthew Dunnigan, The Downsized Hypothesis: Value for Money, that the outdated analysis of patients' needs in the Lothian area used to determine the hospital's size has resulted in an underestimate of the number of acute beds required; regrets that the Scottish Executive has adopted the policy of previous Conservative Governments in Westminster which enriched the private sector and impoverished the NHS, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to review its opposition to establishing a Scottish trust for public investment to fund future projects similar to the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh.
