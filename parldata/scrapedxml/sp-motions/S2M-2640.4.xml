 * S2M-2640.4 Scott Barrie: Nuclear Weapons—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2640) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from “is opposed” to end and insert “acknowledges that defence and national security are matters reserved to the UK Parliament and acknowledges, in the words of the Government’s Strategic Defence Review, “the goal of the global elimination of nuclear weapons”; welcomes the many moves taken to reduce the number of weapons in the world including UK support for the convention to ban anti-personnel landmines, end-user certificates and other restrictions on the arms trade and the significant reductions in the UK’s nuclear weapons stockpile; notes the position of the Scottish National Party, in favour of withdrawal from the United Kingdom and NATO; recognises that withdrawal from the United Kingdom and from NATO would put at risk 25,000 direct MoD jobs in Scotland, 6,000 more dependent on MoD contracts and 12,000 more jobs supported by the military presence, and notes that between 2000 and 2004 the MoD placed 2,500 contracts in Scotland worth around £2 billion, all of which would be at risk under the SNP.” Supported by: Mr Alasdair Morrison*
