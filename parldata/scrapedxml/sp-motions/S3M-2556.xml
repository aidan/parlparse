 *S3M-2556 Pauline McNeill: Conflict Children—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Conflict Children campaign by the children’s newspaper First News in partnership with the UK Department for International Development and Save the Children, which aims to educate schoolchildren across the United Kingdom about the spread of conflict in our world, about conflict prevention, resolution and recovery and about the hundreds of thousands of children and young people who are affected by violence across the world and to encourage them to lobby their leaders and the United Nations for stronger international protections for children who are caught up in violence as a result of becoming child soldiers or due to threats to their personal safety or that of their families or difficulties in accessing education or healthcare; notes that the campaign has already received support from the Secretary of State for International Development, Douglas Alexander MP, and the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, David Milliband MP; congratulates those schools that have already signed up to supporting the campaign, and calls on all schools, local education authorities and the Scottish Government to do all that they can to encourage support for the campaign across Scotland. Supported by: Richard Baker*, Patrick Harvie*, Jackie Baillie*, Mary Mulligan*, Iain Gray*, John Park*, Dr Richard Simpson*, Sandra White*, Mike Pringle*, David Whitton*, Cathy Peattie*, Karen Gillon*, Ken Macintosh*, Marlyn Glen*, Trish Godman*
