*S2M-4877 Elaine Smith: Ministerial Statement on Right to Buy—That the Parliament welcomes the statement by the Minister for Communities on right to buy; notes that the statement is limited by being a statutory requirement under section 52 of the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, and supports longer-term and wider-ranging reform of right to buy, 26 years after its introduction, to make it appropriate for the 21st century housing landscape.
