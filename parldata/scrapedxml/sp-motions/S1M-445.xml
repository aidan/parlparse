*S1M-445 Tommy Sheridan: Circuses—That the Parliament expresses its concern that, despite the revelation in 1999 in an English court that training of animals to perform circus acts can involve severe cruelty, animals continue to be used in circuses; notes that even the best circuses offer animals a very basic and extremely restricted existence, with elephants chained for 23 hours a day, with big cats and domestic dogs kept in small cages, and horses and other animals tethered in cramped stalls, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to take action to end the practise of using animals in circus acts in Scotland.
