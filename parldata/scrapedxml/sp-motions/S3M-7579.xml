*S3M-7579 Karen Whitefield: Dedicated School Staff—That the Parliament recognises what it considers to have been the outstanding work carried out by thousands of local government staff in ensuring the safety of school pupils during the recent heavy snow falls; thanks those staff members for what it sees as their dedication and commitment to caring for the young people under their supervision; calls into question the letter sent by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning on 2 December 2010, which it believes effectively put pressure on councils to refrain from blanket school closures, an approach that contributed to a situation in which many children and teachers were stranded in schools overnight on Monday 6 December, and calls on the Scottish Government to recognise that decisions regarding school closures must be made at a strategic level within local authorities taking into consideration the effect that non-closure has on road usage during severe weather conditions as well as the effect on child and staff safety.
