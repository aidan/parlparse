*S2M-4979 Margaret Smith: Edinburgh Park Station—That the Parliament notes that Edinburgh Park rail station, which serves Scotland’s largest and most successful business park and the fourth largest economic area outside the centres of Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen, has been consistently denied a stop on the Edinburgh to Glasgow mainline; considers that this deficiency severely and unnecessarily restricts employees and visitors from across Scotland travelling by train to Edinburgh Park; notes that research has shown a clear desire for the provision of this service among the 15,000 financial sector employees currently working in and around Edinburgh Park and that providing a mainline stop at Edinburgh Park could help reduce congestion by removing significant numbers of cars from the road, strengthen the links between the Edinburgh and Glasgow business communities and help safeguard west Edinburgh’s long-term economic growth, and calls for the Scottish Executive and Transport Scotland to push for the rescheduling of mainline trains from Edinburgh to Glasgow to stop at Edinburgh Park at least twice per hour at peak times.
