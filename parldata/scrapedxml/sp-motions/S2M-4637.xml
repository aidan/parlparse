 *S2M-4637 Patrick Harvie: M74 Legal Case—That the Parliament notes with dismay that Friends of the Earth Scotland has been forced to withdraw from its legal case in the Court of Session against the decision of the Scottish Executive to proceed with construction of the M74 urban motorway; believes that this demonstrates the barriers faced by individuals and organisations seeking access to environmental justice; congratulates Friends of the Earth Scotland for its courageous decision to bring the case; believes that the ever-escalating cost of the project means that to proceed with construction would be a gross waste of public money; agrees with the findings of the independent public inquiry into the road that, "the public benefits of the proposal would be insufficient to outweigh the considerable disadvantages that can be expected", and believes that proceeding with construction of the road would drive a bulldozer through the Executive’s social justice, climate change and sustainable development commitments.
