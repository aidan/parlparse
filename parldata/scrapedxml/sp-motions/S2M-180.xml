*S2M-180 Ms Sandra White: Greater Glasgow NHS Board Withdrawal of Beta Interferon—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision of Greater Glasgow NHS Board to cap the number of sufferers of multiple sclerosis (MS) who will be treated with beta interferon, the drug widely thought to offer respite to MS sufferers and provide them with the best chance of a normal life; further notes the statement by the Scottish Executive on 4 February 2002 that "the NHS will pay for the cost of beta interferon and similar drugs for all qualifying patients in Scotland", and considers that the Executive should make urgent representations to the board and take all possible measures to ensure the necessary resources are put in place to guarantee that all MS sufferers in the board area receive the treatments they require.
