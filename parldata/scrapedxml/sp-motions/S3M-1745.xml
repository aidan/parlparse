 *S3M-1745 Claire Baker: Real Nappy Week - 21 to 27 April—That the Parliament welcomes Real Nappy Week 2008 and its theme Combat Climate Change; recognises that from birth to potty each baby uses between 4,000 and 6,000 nappies; notes that four-and-a-half trees are used to make the pulp for disposable nappies for one baby over a period of two-and-a-half years, that one cup of crude oil goes in to make one disposable nappy and that Fife Council spends over £84,000 a year sending disposable nappies to landfill; recognises that real nappies make a contribution towards the reduction of waste going to landfill in Scotland; supports parents’ ability to make the right choice for their babies but believes that this should be an informed choice; welcomes the range of events being promoted by the Fife Real Nappy Network during Real Nappy Week, and supports the commitment of volunteer mums who help parents make informed choices about nappies, including confirming that there is not a safety pin in sight but a whole range of poppers, velcro or nifty little plastic grips to ensure a snug fit. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Helen Eadie*, Mike Pringle*, Patrick Harvie*, Jamie Stone*, Robin Harper*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Marlyn Glen*, Bill Kidd*, Sarah Boyack*, Dr Richard Simpson*, David Whitton*
