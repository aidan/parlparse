 *S1M-1170 Richard Lochhead: Assisting the Fishing Industry with Fuel Costs—That the Parliament requests the Scottish Executive to publish urgently a package of funded measures to assist the fishing industry to cope with crippling fuel costs which have spiralled in recent months; notes that the catching sector is fuel dependent and therefore disproportionately disadvantaged; recognises that the impact on the sector is particularly widespread given that the wages of share fishermen are suffering as a result of the rise in fuel costs, and further urges Ministers to convene a meeting of the oil companies, energy experts and industry representatives to explore ways in which the industry can be assisted.
