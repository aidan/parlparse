 *S2M-2477 Jackie Baillie: Portuguese Socialists Prepare for Government—That the Parliament warmly welcomes the new Socialist government in Portugal, who in a landslide general election victory gained 45% of the popular vote, their biggest-ever win at the polls, indicating the eagerness of voters for change and belief in Socialist leader Jose Socrates’ promises of reforms to bring about a broad modernisation of the economy, focusing on education and professional training, and further agrees with the comments in Jornal de Negocios that "a new country was born yesterday".
