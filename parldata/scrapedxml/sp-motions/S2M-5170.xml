*S2M-5170 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Condemnation of Scampi Job Losses—That the Parliament condemns the decision by Young’s Seafood to send Scottish seafood 12,000 miles to Thailand to be processed; notes with concern that this move is a disaster for the environment as every tonne of scampi shipped to Thailand will generate half a tonne of carbon dioxide, contributing to climate change; further notes that this decision will result in the loss of 120 jobs in Young’s processing plant in Annan and that this is due to the company’s belief that the local workforce earn prohibitive wages despite local wages being no higher than the national average, and calls on the Scottish Executive to seek to ensure that Young’s uses the statutory 90-day consultation period to try and find suitable alternative employment for its workers in the local area and to do everything in its power to minimise compulsory redundancies.
