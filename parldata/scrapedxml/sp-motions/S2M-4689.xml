*S2M-4689 Mike Rumbles: Maternity Services in Aberdeenshire—That the Parliament notes with disappointment the decision of NHS Grampian to recommend to the Minister for Health and Community Care the closure of maternity units at Aboyne, Huntly, Fraserburgh and Banff; commends campaigners who have fought to retain these units on the positive way in which they have engaged in the board’s consultation process on the issue; continues to agree that these units are an excellent example of health services being delivered locally as advocated by Professor David Kerr in his report, Building a Health Service Fit for the Future; further agrees that expectant mothers should have the option of giving birth locally, at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary or in the home, and calls on the Minister to reject the board’s recommendation and retain these units to give expectant mothers a genuine choice.
