*S1M-3712 Tavish Scott: Scotland's Fishing Communities—That the Parliament notes with concern the open letter to fishermen from European Commissioner Franz Fischler issued last week; challenges his statement that the European Union would not be forcing anyone to scrap their boats or to give up fishing if the European Commission’s recommended white fish total allowable catches were accepted by the Fisheries Council; notes with dismay the implication that Mr Fischler is using the lure of fleet subsidies to win support from southern EU member states when expansion of their fleets is inappropriate in the current circumstances; reaffirms its full support for Scotland’s fishing communities, and calls on the Scottish Executive to continue to give its full backing to the Scottish white fish industry.
