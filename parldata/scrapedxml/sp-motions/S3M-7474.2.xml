*S3M-7474.2 Patrick Harvie: A Budget for Scotland’s People—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7474) in the name of Johann Lamont, insert at end "; further believes that the budget will only serve the interests of Scotland’s people if it protects public services from the unnecessary and irresponsible cuts being imposed by the UK Government; believes that options exist for fairly increasing taxation, especially at local level, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward a budget Bill that raises revenue instead of simply handing on the cuts to Scotland."
