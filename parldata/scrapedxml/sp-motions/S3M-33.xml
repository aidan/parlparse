*S3M-33 Iain Gray: Opposition to Ship-to-Ship Oil Transfer in Firth of Forth—That the Parliament opposes proposals by SPT Marine Services to transfer oil between ships in the Firth of Forth; expresses concern over the company’s role in the spillage of 35,000 gallons of oil in the Gulf of Mexico; notes the European Commission’s view that the transfer of oil between vessels is "a complex technical operation entailing a considerable risk of oil being split into the sea"; further notes the European Commission’s response to question E-0982/07 from Catherine Stihler MEP that "a project or plan that will adversely affect a special area of conservation can only be carried out for imperative reasons of overriding public interest and in the absence of alternative solutions"; does not believe that these conditions have been met, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should take steps to protect the Firth of Forth by ensuring that these ill-conceived plans do not come to fruition. Supported by: Elaine Murray*, Claire Baker*, John Park*, Rhona Brankin*, Malcolm Chisholm*
