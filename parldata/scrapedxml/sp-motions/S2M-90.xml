*S2M-90# Fergus Ewing: Weekend Ban on Scallop Fishing—That the Parliament opposes the introduction of any technical measures for the scallop fishing industry that would include a weekend ban; believes that such a ban (a), if geographically confined, will cause major displacement problems, (b) will produce no conservation benefit, as those who do not already work a five-day week work two 10-day trips a month, which amounts to the same fishing effort, and (c) will disrupt supplies to processors, who rely on continuity of supply, and thereby will threaten continued access to the lucrative Spanish market, particularly the weekend market for which a premium price is presently enjoyed, and notes that, in contrast to the lack of any contribution of a weekend ban to effective conservation measures, measures that would make a real and significant contribution to conservation have been proposed and developed by the Scallop Association and the Mallaig and North West Fishermans Association, which would enhance conservation whilst allowing the industry to remain viable.
