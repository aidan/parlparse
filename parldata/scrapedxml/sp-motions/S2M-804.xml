 *S2M-804 Donald Gorrie: Statement on Arabs by Robert Kilroy-Silk-That the Parliament condemns the blatantly untrue statements by Robert Kilroy-Silk that Arabs are "suicide bombers, limb amputators, women repressors", greatly regrets the rising tide of Islamophobia of which he is part; believes that his efforts to claim that his statements are justified by "free speech" do great harm to promoting genuine free speech within a rational debate and constructively criticising any foolish attitudes caused by excessive political correctness, and urges all relevant bodies to promote better education and discussion about Islam and Arab culture.
