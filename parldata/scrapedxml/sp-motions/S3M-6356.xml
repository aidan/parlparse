 *S3M-6356 Mike Pringle: National Myeloma Awareness Week 2010—That the Parliament welcomes National Myeloma Awareness Week, from 21 to 28 June 2010, which focuses on raising awareness of myeloma in primary care; notes that every year approximately 350 people in Scotland are diagnosed with myeloma and that work still needs to be done to ensure that these patients receive a timely diagnosis; supports Myleoma UK’s TAKE 2 of the Myeloma UK GP Pledge Campaign, which this year aims to deliver the Myeloma Diagnosis Pathway to 4,000 more GPs across the UK and help reduce the likelihood of delays in diagnosis; recognises the importance of the Myeloma Diagnosis Pathway as a reference tool to raise awareness of the common signs and symptoms of myeloma and the steps to take if myeloma is suspected; encourages members to get involved in the TAKE 2 campaign and take a copy of the Myeloma Diagnosis Pathway with them the next time that they have a GP appointment as well as encourage their friends, family and colleagues to do the same; welcomes the commitment in Better Cancer Care, An Action Plan to improve the early diagnosis of cancer, and calls on the Scottish Government to work in collaboration with the myeloma community to reduce unnecessary delays in the diagnosis of myeloma.
