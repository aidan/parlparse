 *S3M-1721 Dr Richard Simpson: Banning of Looped Blind Cords—That the Parliament acknowledges that, in the last 10 years, up to 20 children are reported to have lost their lives in the United Kingdom as a result of incidents involving looped blind cords; recognises that the United States banned the use of looped blind cords in the 1990s and that Australia followed suit in 2004, and supports the efforts of Gordon Banks MP in pressing the UK Government to begin immediate discussions with the British Standards Institute to introduce a new British Standard banning the use of looped blind cords to prevent further avoidable deaths.
