*S3M-4668 Johann Lamont: Panorama: Britain’s Homecare Scandal - an example of investigative journalism at its best—That the Parliament expresses grave concern regarding the arrest of Arif Farooq, the journalist who, with her colleagues in the Panorama programme, Britain’s Homecare Scandal, exposed scandalously poor quality of care experienced by elderly people in their own homes; notes that the programme has prompted action by the Scottish Government and an inquiry by the Parliament’s Local Government and Communities Committee into home care; applauds all those involved in producing a powerful programme, which is already ensuring more protection for older people who rely on home care; believes that this Panorama programme is in the finest tradition of investigative journalism, and is concerned that while undercover journalism and any methods involving deception must be closely monitored and operate within clear conditions, the action by the police in this instance could deter journalists from one of their core purposes of exposing wrongdoing, cruelty and neglect.
