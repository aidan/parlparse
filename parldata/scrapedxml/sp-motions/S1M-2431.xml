*S1M-2431# Mr David Davidson: Diabetes in Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament recognises that diabetes is a serious condition affecting over 220,000 people and their families across Scotland and that complications arising from it can have a devastating effect on individuals, including a loss of sight, chronic heart disease and limb amputation; notes that this figure could double over the next decade and that the number of people with undiagnosed diabetes is estimated to be over 90,000, a figure which is unacceptable, and believes that it is vital that the Scottish Diabetes Framework, once published, should become the vehicle for producing short, medium and long-term solutions to this public health challenge.
