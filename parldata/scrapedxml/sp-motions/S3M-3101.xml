*S3M-3101 Ian McKee: Edinburgh Tram Project—That the Parliament notes with concern that Edinburgh’s Princes Street, Scotland’s most famous street, will be closed for eight months in order to commence track-laying work for the Edinburgh Tram Project; further believes that the disruption will affect businesses, motorists and pedestrians, increasing frustration in the city, all to put in place a project forced through by Labour, the Tories and the Lib Dems essentially to replace the exceptional number 22 bus service while leaving behind a black hole for Edinburgh’s residents to pay, and nevertheless asks Transport Initiatives Edinburgh to ensure the lowest possible level of disruption to the city and its residents.
