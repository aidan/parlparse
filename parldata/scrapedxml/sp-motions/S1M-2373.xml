*S1M-2373# Mr Adam Ingram: Psychiatric Hospital Closures-That the Parliament notes where the resources from the sale of psychiatric hospitals and grounds have been allocated within the overall health budget; further notes the current condition of through care and community care services for mental health patients, carers and professionals, and believes that the current policy of the Scottish Executive of not transferring capital receipts to revenue should be renewed.
