*S3M-6969 Irene Oldfather: Scottish Human Rights Commission, Care about Rights?—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Scottish Human Rights Commission’s awareness-raising project, Care About Rights?, which relates to the care and support of older people; notes that the project aims to empower people to understand their rights and increase the ability and accountability of those who have duties to respect, protect and fulfil human rights and is aimed at everyone who comes into contact with, and has responsibility for, care services for older people; believes that an increased awareness and knowledge of human rights issues and practical advice about how to apply human rights principles in the delivery of care will ensure that older people are given the respect that they deserve, and therefore supports the aim of the commission to see a commitment to human rights becoming central in everyday practice and policy in the care and support of older people.
