*S3M-6160 Jackie Baillie: Record Exports as Scotch Whisky Defies Downturn—That the Parliament notes the positive economic impact that Scotch whisky had on the Scottish economy in 2009 despite the global economic downturn; understands that the rise of Scotch whisky exports at approximately 3% in value to £3.13 billion contributed £99 every second to the UK trade balance; acknowledges the value of Scotch whisky in delivering record exports in the face of a worldwide recession, and further acknowledges the role that Scotch whisky plays in maintaining economic ties with major trading blocks such as the United States of America, which remains the industry’s largest export market by value and is up 13%, reaching £419 million and congratulates Scotch whisky on another successful economic year.
