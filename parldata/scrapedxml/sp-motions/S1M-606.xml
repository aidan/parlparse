*S1M-606# Mr Alex Salmond: Peterhead Prison—That the Parliament notes the success of Peterhead Prison and the wide recognition it has received throughout the 1990s for developing the STOP programme for sex offenders and for its work over recent years; congratulates the prison officers, other staff and the local community on their efforts in building that success, and believes that it would be foolish in the extreme to in any way jeopardise the success of that programme with uncertainties over the future of the prison.
