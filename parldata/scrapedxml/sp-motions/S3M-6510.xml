 *S3M-6510 Hugh Henry: Bonus Payment to Outgoing Royal Mail Chief Adam Crozier—That the Parliament notes with concern the £2.5 million paid to the outgoing chief executive of Royal Mail in his final year; believes that such payments in the current financial climate are an insult to Royal Mail staff and customers; further believes that steps should be taken to avoid such excessive payments in future, and hopes that Adam Crozier will waive his right to a bonus payment.
