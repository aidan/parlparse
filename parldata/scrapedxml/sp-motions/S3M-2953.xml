 *S3M-2953 Alex Neil: Dependent Britain—That the Parliament notes that, as a result of the pre-Budget report announced on 24 November 2008 by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the estimated budget deficit for the UK Government will rise to over 8% of GDP in 2010 and the national debt will rise to nearly 60% of GDP, with both these figures excluding the billions required to pay off the debts arising from PPP/PFI commitments and the bail out of the banks; notes that the United Kindgom’s credit rating has now been downgraded to being, apart from Italy, the lowest in the developed world; deduces that, based on previous statements made by the unionist Labour, Liberal and Tory parties about the economic viability of an independent Scotland, the United Kingdom can no longer survive as a politically-independent state, and therefore invites those parties to advise which other nation should now assume responsibility for running Britain.
