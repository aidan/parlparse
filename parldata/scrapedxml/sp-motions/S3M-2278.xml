*S3M-2278 Jamie Hepburn: Oxfam’s Wish for an End to Poverty—That the Parliament welcomes the Oxfam campaign calling on leaders of G8 countries to live up to their commitments on international aid, health care and climate change; notes the success of the Oxfam lobby outside the Parliament on 26 June 2008, encouraging MSPs and members of the public to sign a Japanese-style "Tanabata" (star festival) wish card on the issue, and calls on as many people as possible to support the campaign in this way and increase political and moral pressure on G8 leaders to take serious action that will make poverty history.
