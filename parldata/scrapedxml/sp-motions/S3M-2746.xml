*S3M-2746 Richard Baker: Success as Edinburgh’s Nightclubs "Unight" to Tackle Violent Crime—That the Parliament welcomes the success of Unight, an innovative new safety initiative set up a year ago in a partnership between 21 of Edinburgh’s top nightclubs aiming to improve communication between bars and nightclubs to make the city’s nightlife safer; congratulates all 21 nightclubs for their involvement in the scheme and commitment to tackling antisocial behaviour, drugs and violent crime; welcomes the collaborative approach of participating nightclubs in sharing CCTV footage of antisocial and drug-carrying customers; supports moves to ban troublemakers from all city establishments; believes a zero tolerance policy against drugs, assaults and weapons is the right approach in tackling violent crime and antisocial behaviour; notes the full support of Lothian and Borders Police and the positive feedback received from customers; welcomes recent figures from Lothian and Borders Police that show a 21% reduction in overall crime at Unight venues since the scheme was introduced, with the decline in criminal activity reaching as much as 70% in some venues; supports calls to roll out schemes such as Unight that enable higher standards of supervision and safety to become reality in towns and cities across Scotland, and supports proposals to make such schemes a national standard throughout the club and bar industry in Scotland.
