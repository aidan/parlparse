*S2M-2153# Jim Mather: Medical Services in Kintyre—That the Parliament recognises the deep concern and sense of false economy that is shared by the people of Campbeltown and Kintyre regarding the closure of 10 elderly care beds; notes that over 1,500 people, so far, have turned out at public meetings to express their opposition to NHS Argyll and Clyde’s plans; recognises that, if the proposals go ahead, many patients will be transferred many miles, be prematurely returned to their homes or involuntarily block acute beds, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should reject these plans and give a commitment that the elderly care ward will be restored at Campbeltown Hospital.
