*S3M-6238 Gil Paterson: More NI Tax, Less Scottish Jobs—That the Parliament believes that the UK Government should reconsider the full implications of the proposed increase in National Insurance, which could result in £104 million being removed from the Scottish Government’s budget to the UK Treasury, at the cost of Scottish public sector jobs equivalent of 2,300 police officers or 4,000 nurses.
