 *S3M-158 Keith Brown: Scotland’s Representation in the European Parliament—That the Parliament notes the current proposal from the Electoral Commission to reduce the number of Members of the European Parliament to be elected to represent Scotland at the 2009 European elections from seven to six; considers this to be a significant cut in Scotland’s representation in Europe’s legislative body, and considers that, as well as taking into account the size of the electorate, the Electoral Commission should also consider the devolution of responsibility for implementing EU legislation to Scotland’s institutions and should therefore recommend to the UK Government that Scotland continues to elect seven Members of the European Parliament. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Mike Pringle*, Bob Doris*, Bill Kidd*, Kenneth Gibson*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Stefan Tymkewycz*, Alex Neil*, Aileen Campbell*, Ian McKee*, Rob Gibson*
