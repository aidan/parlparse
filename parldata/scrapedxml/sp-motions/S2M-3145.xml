 * S2M-3145 Murdo Fraser: The Future of Scottish Bank Notes—That the Parliament notes with concern Banknote issue arrangements in Scotland and Northern Ireland: a consultation document, published by HM Treasury in July 2005, which proposes additional restrictions on the rights of the Scottish clearing banks to issue banknotes; further notes that the Treasury is considering placing a requirement on Scottish banks “to issue only one note design for each denomination at any one time” and that such a stipulation would threaten the issuing of limited edition Scottish notes such as the £5 note featuring Jack Nicklaus recently issued by the Royal Bank of Scotland; believes that such restrictions would be an entirely retrograde step and represent a wholly unnecessary intrusion into the rights of Scottish banks to issue their own notes; recalls that it was through the actions and campaigning of the great Tory patriot, Sir Walter Scott, that the rights of the Scottish banks to issue notes were preserved in the 19th century, and calls on all Scottish patriots today to unite to oppose these Treasury plans which represent a threat to the successful Scottish banking sector.
