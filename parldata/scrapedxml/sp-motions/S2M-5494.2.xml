*S2M-5494.2 Murdo Fraser: Green Procurement—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5494) in the name of Patrick Harvie, leave out from "and calls on" to end and insert "further regrets that, whilst there are some good examples of local food procurement in Scotland, as the Environment and Rural Development Committee’s 8th Report (2006) notes, "there is no sense that the Executive has a robust strategy for rolling this out"; further regrets the bureaucratic hurdles faced, especially by small and social firms, in tendering for public contracts, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to establish a dedicated procurement unit to act as a single point of entry for the public sector and to be tasked with taking forward ways of procuring local produce without contravening European law."
