*S3M-5356 Bill Wilson: Kurdish Language Rights in Turkeyâ€”That the Parliament, noting the devastating effect of the loss of language and culture on the wellbeing of indigenous peoples the world over, urges the Turkish Government to commit to reforming the ideologies that impede progress toward the respect, protection and fulfilment of the full range of cultural and linguistic rights guaranteed to the Kurdish population in ways that are appropriate to the needs of that population, to honour the provisions of international and regional instruments that guarantee these rights to the Kurds, both as individuals and members of an ethnic and linguistic minority, to consider giving the Kurdish language de facto joint official status in the Kurdish provinces, not to criminalise the peaceful expression of Kurdish cultural and linguistic identity, to maximise the availability of education in Kurdish appropriate to the needs of the Kurdish population by allowing and assisting them to establish and operate Kurdish-medium schools and to implement all legal reforms made pursuant to the Copenhagen political criteria for accession to the European Union in the area of minority rights and also calls on EU institutions to grant accession to Turkey only following an accurate assessment of its fulfilment of these criteria.
