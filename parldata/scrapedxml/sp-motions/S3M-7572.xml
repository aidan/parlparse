*S3M-7572 Ken Macintosh: The Impact of the Cold Spell on Disabled Children and their Families—That the Parliament recognises the disproportionate impact that adverse, cold weather conditions can have on vulnerable groups; notes that disabled children who require intensive support from voluntary sector organisations such as Aberlour Child Care Trust may have been unable to access these services, which it considers vital, due to the extreme weather; recognizes the importance of interventions such as short-stay and crisis respite residential care in allowing families affected by disability to stay together; applauds what it sees as the valiant efforts of voluntary sector organisations in keeping these services open despite the snow, in some cases going the extra mile to provide respite support in the family home, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that these services have access to the levels of funding that they need to continue providing a lifeline to these children and their families despite the inclement meteorological and economic circumstances in which they currently find themselves.
