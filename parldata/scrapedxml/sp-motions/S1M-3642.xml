*S1M-3642 Tommy Sheridan: Firefighters' Strike—That the Parliament unreservedly condemns the Deputy Minister for Justice, Dr Richard Simpson MSP, for his remarks in relation to the firefighters’ dispute; believes that for a Minister in charge of the fire service to use the words, in relation to the firefighters’ dispute, "fascists  who would follow Mussolini" is a disgrace and can only influence the current industrial dispute; calls on the Minister to apologise unreservedly to the firefighters and the trade union movement, and also believes he can no longer be in charge of the fire service in Scotland and should resign or be sacked by the First Minister.
