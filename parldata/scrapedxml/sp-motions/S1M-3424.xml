 *S1M-3424# Shona Robison: Retailing of Fireworks by RS McColl—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision of the head office of the retailer RS McColl to issue a memo to all its outlets in Scotland asking them to display window posters advertising half-price fireworks six weeks before 5 November; considers this action to be a flagrant breach of the voluntary code of practice, which restricts advertising to within three weeks of Guy Fawkes' night; considers that RS McColl should reconsider the decision and set an example to other retailers by removing such window posters from their retail outlets in recognition of the voluntary code, and believes that this situation highlights the pressing need for the law on retailing of fireworks to be tightened through the introduction of a licensing system.
