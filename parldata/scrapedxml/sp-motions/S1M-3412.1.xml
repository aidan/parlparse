*S1M-3412.1 Ms Sandra White: Glasgow Airport Rail Link-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3412) in the name of Bill Butler, leave out from "believes" to end and insert "however notes with concern that there is still no commitment to the Glasgow CrossRail scheme which has been widely recognised as a key component to the success of the Glasgow Airport rail link opening up links to the airport not only from Glasgow city centre but also improving accessibility from the entire country, and considers that the Scottish Executive should immediately make the resources available and announce as a matter of urgency the earliest possible commencement date for work on the implementation of the Glasgow Airport link and the Glasgow CrossRail scheme."
