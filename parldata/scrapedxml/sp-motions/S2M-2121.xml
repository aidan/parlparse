*S2M-2121 Colin Fox: Scotland’s Private Prisons—That the Parliament notes the remarks of Tony Blair MP in April 1994, in condemning government proposals to privatise Scottish prisons, that "these proposals are wrong in principle and is committed to opposing them at every opportunity. … those who are sentenced to imprisonment by the state should be deprived of their liberty by those who are accountable to the state and not to private shareholders. … A Labour Government would bring the prisons back within the proper public prison system at the earliest opportunity"; further notes plans by the Scottish Executive for two further prisons that may be privately owned in addition to the one at Kilmarnock owned by Premier Prisons Ltd; believes that imprisonment remains the responsibility of the state and that profiteering from the incarceration of others is immoral, and therefore believes that all Scotland’s privately-owned prisons ought to be "back within the proper public prison system at the earliest opportunity".
