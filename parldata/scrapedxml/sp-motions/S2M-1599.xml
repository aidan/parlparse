*S2M-1599 Bill Butler: Edrington Group Dispute—That the Parliament acknowledges the strength of feeling expressed by the workforce at the Edrington Group plant in Drumchapel in their recent strike action taken in support of their current wage claim; notes that the demands made by the GMB union on behalf of the workforce are not unreasonable, given the current conditions across the whisky industry; hopes that a fair deal that meets the legitimate aspirations of the workforce can still be brokered, and calls on the management of the Edrington Group to respond positively to the workers’ request for meaningful dialogue with the GMB union to achieve a just resolution of this dispute.
