*S2M-532.3 Patrick Harvie: Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Billâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-532) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert " does not agree to the general principles of the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Bill because, whilst welcoming the seriousness with which the Scottish Executive takes the issue of antisocial behaviour, it regrets that the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Bill fails to address the causes of antisocial behaviour or to put enforcement measures in context, and believes, therefore, that the Bill will not deliver the solution to antisocial behaviour that it promises."
