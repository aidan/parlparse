*S2M-3289# Margaret Mitchell: Barnardo’s Freagarrach Project - 10th Anniversary—That the Parliament congratulates the Barnardo’s Freagarrach project in Falkirk on its 10th anniversary; commends the work it conducts which aims to reduce, and ultimately stop, the offending behaviour of young people aged 12 to 18 who are at risk of being removed from their communities due to the frequency or severity of their offending; applauds its outstanding record in 2003-04 which resulted in a reduction in re-offending by an average of 81% between the 12 to 16-year-old service and the 16 to 18-year-old service, and believes that the Scottish Executive should encourage more local authorities to support such projects.
