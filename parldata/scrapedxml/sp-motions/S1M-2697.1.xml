 *S1M-2697.1 Mr Brian Monteith: Class Sizes and Pupil Attainment-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2697) in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from "increasing" to end and insert "that the reduction in class sizes in Primary 1 to Primary 3 to 18 would involve a substantial revenue cost and an unquantifiable capital cost together with a removal of parental choice; acknowledges that class size is only one aspect of educational provision which may help to improve standards in Scotland's schools, and considers that greater devolution of decision making to teachers and parents should be the goal of the Scottish Executive.
