*S3M-6003 Mr Frank McAveety: Jock, You’re Immortal Now—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that Celtic Football Club is to erect a permanent statue in memory of Jock Stein, 25 years on from his passing, one of the most important figures in Scottish football history due to his time managing Celtic, Dunfermline Athletic, Hibernian and Leeds United, as well as the Scottish national team from 1978 until his untimely passing in 1985; notes Stein’s outstanding managerial record as the first manager to lead a British side to winning the European Cup in 1967 and winning 10 Scottish League championships, nine Scottish cups and six Scottish League cups; further notes that Stein has been recognised as both Celtic and Scotland’s greatest ever manager, and believes that this is a fitting tribute to the most successful manager in Celtic’s history.
