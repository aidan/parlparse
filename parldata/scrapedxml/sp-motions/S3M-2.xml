*S3M-2 Elaine Smith: Monklands General Hospital—That the Parliament recognises the opposition of the people of the Monklands area to NHS Lanarkshire’s proposal to downgrade Monklands General Hospital; believes that health service reconfiguration decisions should be based on the health and social needs of the people of Lanarkshire, weighted for the impact on reducing social and health inequalities, and not narrow financial considerations; further believes that the financial information provided to the NHS board as a basis for its decision was flawed; notes that the decision was reached after a consultation which was launched with a preferred option to downgrade Monklands and which dismissed 50,000 signatures, ignored the articulate comments made at public meetings and did not reflect the content of the many comprehensive submissions made; finds it incredible that NHS Lanarkshire is proposing to downgrade its busiest, most efficient and effective accident and emergency department, located in the area serving over half the population of Lanarkshire which suffers from some of the poorest health in Scotland alongside high levels of poverty and deprivation; notes that Wishaw and Hairmyres hospitals close to accident and emergency admissions much more frequently than Monklands; believes that a reduction in capacity by downgrading Monklands can only exacerbate that situation and increase the pressure on neighbouring hospitals, and believes that the clearly expressed wishes of the people of Monklands in the consultation phase, after the decision was made and during the recent election campaign, must be acted on by having this iniquitous decision reversed as soon as possible.
