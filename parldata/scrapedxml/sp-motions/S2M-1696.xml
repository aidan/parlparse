*S2M-1696 Bruce Crawford: Closure of Accident and Emergency Unit in Fife—That the Parliament expresses concern over the proposals by NHS Fife to move from two accident and emergency units serving Fife to only one; notes that initially accident and emergency services will be primarily based at Queen Margaret Hospital in Dunfermline, but that, in the longer term, these services will be relocated to Victoria Hospital in Kirkcaldy; recognises that the move to only one unit is based primarily on advice from the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS), but is concerned that wider risk assessment issues have not been given appropriate consideration, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that, when decisions are taken to close an accident and emergency unit, advice and direction should not simply come from the RCS but that all risk assessment factors should be taken into account and given appropriate weighting, including advice from other royal colleges, the location and distance of communities from the accident and emergency unit, the length of time it takes for more remote communities to access such a unit, the services available from GP practices and the impact on the ambulance service. Supported by: Ms Sandra White*, Carolyn Leckie*, Christine Grahame*
