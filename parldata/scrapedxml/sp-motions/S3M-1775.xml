*S3M-1775 Michael Matheson: Public Accounts Committee Findings on London Olympics—That the Parliament notes the findings of the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee report into the spiralling costs of the London Olympics; recognises its findings that identify the estimated costs for the London games as "entirely unrealistic" and accuse UK ministers of "wishful thinking", and calls on the UK Government to ensure that good causes in Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland are not further plundered to fund any shortfall in the cost of the London Olympics.
