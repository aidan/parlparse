*S3M-5931 Ted Brocklebank: Death of Sir Kenneth Doverâ€”That the Parliament notes with sadness the death of Sir Kenneth Dover, Chancellor of the University of St Andrews from 1981 to 2005, and former President of the British Academy; considers him one of the most able and most widely respected Greek scholars of the 20th century; further notes his numerous pioneering academic works which included Greek Word Order (1960), Aristophanic Comedy (1972), Greek Homosexuality (1978) and The Greeks and their Legacy (1989) as well as his excellent and frank autobiography Marginal Comment (1994), and, while sending condolences to his family, expresses a hope that his love and knowledge of Classics will continue to inform and inspire many generations to come.
