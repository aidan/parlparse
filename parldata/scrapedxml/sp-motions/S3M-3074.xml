*S3M-3074 Bob Doris: Welcoming Second-Stage Transfer in Glasgow—That the Parliament welcomes the positive outcome of the five second-stage transfer ballots where the tenants of Glasgow Housing Association (GHA) have voted to move to community ownership with Ardenglen, Cassiltoun, Glasgow West, Parkhead and Shettleston housing associations as opposed to the GHA; congratulates the 2,100 tenants involved in the transfer and the five successful housing associations; believes that the massive turnout and clear yes vote by tenants in each case show the desire of tenants for community ownership and endorses current moves for a further 21,000 tenants to be transferred into community ownership; hopes for a speedy ratification of these ballots by Scottish ministers to allow the process to be finalised; notes that the Scottish Government is committed to second-stage transfer and community ownership and, unlike the previous administration, which achieved no second-stage transfers, has managed to push forward community ownership in Glasgow, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that there is no let-up on pushing the GHA, which is supposed to be a transitional organisation, towards ensuring as many tenants as possible have the option to vote for full community ownership in their area.
