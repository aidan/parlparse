*S1M-2538.2 Tommy Sheridan: 'Our National Health' - Delivering Change—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2538) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "the Executive" to end and insert "NHS staff towards delivering the commitments in Our National Health: A plan for action, a plan for change but recognises that without radical increases in resources to deliver significantly increased wages and improved conditions for the thousands of currently low-paid health workers, delivery on longer-term goals including major reductions in waiting times and significant public health improvement will not be possible; further agrees on the urgent need for a new National Health minimum wage to attract and retain NHS staff currently underpaid and undervalued; agrees that all private hospitals should now be incorporated into the public sector with financial compensation only on terms of proven need and that consultants’ and others’ contracts should be renegotiated to prevent any more moon-lighting in the private sector which is a divisive, corrosive and counter-productive influence in our national health service; reaffirms our central belief in a first-class public health service free at point of use for every citizen regardless of income, paid through progressive general taxation, and rejects the further privatisation of health care through the Trojan horse of poor-value PFI schemes."
