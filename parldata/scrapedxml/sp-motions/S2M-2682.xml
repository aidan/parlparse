 S2M-2682 Jim Mather: Gourock to Dunoon Ferry Services—That the Parliament recognises the different commercial and geographical situations of the Gourock to Dunoon ferry services and the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services; welcomes the suspension of plans to tender the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services; believes that the decision of the Parliament on 8 December 2004 relates only to the Clyde and Hebrides ferry services, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to continue to seek expressions of interest from potential operators of unrestricted and unsubsidised ferry services between the town-centre piers of Gourock and Dunoon, on the condition that employees’ terms and conditions, including pensions, will be unaffected by any possible route development. Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill, Roseanna Cunningham, Brian Adam, Bruce Crawford, Rob Gibson, George Lyon, Fiona Hyslop, Mrs Margaret Ewing*
