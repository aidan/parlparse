*S3M-836# Sandra White: Apprentice of the Year—That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow carpenter, Mark Lynch, on being crowned Apprentice of the Year at the Master Builder of the Year Awards 2007 after fighting off competition from hundreds of apprentices around the United Kingdom; echoes the sentiments of the judges who described Mark as having all the qualities we want to see in all apprentices, including commitment to his trade and employer, along with the willingness and ability to continue to learn; considers that the construction industry’s future will be assured through the development of young people such as Mark Lynch; believes that Mark, who has shown an exceptional interest in his career from an early stage, taking part in Glasgow’s school vocational programme and spending half a day a week at Queenslie Training Centre learning a variety of construction trades before being accepted for an apprenticeship in carpentry and joinery with City Building (Glasgow) LLP, serves as a great example to others and demonstrates the benefits that apprenticeships bring to young people and Scotland as a whole, and hopes that these schemes will be developed to ensure that they play a central role in the new employment opportunities brought about as a result of Glasgow’s successful bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games.
