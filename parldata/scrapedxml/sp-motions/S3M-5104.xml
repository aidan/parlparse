 *S3M-5104 Stuart McMillan: Hidden Killer Campaign—That the Parliament congratulates the Health and Safety Executive for its awareness campaign targeting tradesmen across Scotland to beware of the hidden killer of asbestos; notes that the campaign aims to raise awareness of the risks posed by asbestos and how workers can best protect themselves; further notes that official figures show that about 20 tradesmen a week in the United Kingdom die from asbestos-related diseases and that this number is rising, and urges tradesmen everywhere to pay attention to the campaign in order to protect themselves and colleagues from the threat of asbestos-related conditions.
