*S1M-3450 Malcolm Chisholm: Action Against Coronary Heart Disease and Strokeâ€”That the Parliament recognises the unacceptable toll which coronary heart disease and stroke continue to take on Scottish families and communities; acknowledges the role of front-line staff in delivering and developing services for the thousands of people affected each year; supports health improvement initiatives to reduce the incidence of the diseases and the disproportionate burden suffered by the most disadvantaged communities, and looks forward to the development of more integrated services that are backed up by significant and dedicated resources.Supported by: Mrs Mary Mulligan*, Mr Frank McAveety*
