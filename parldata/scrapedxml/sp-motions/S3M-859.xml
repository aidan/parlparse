*S3M-859 Sarah Boyack: Welcoming Siphiwe Hlophe of SWAPOL to the Scottish Parliament—That the Parliament welcomes Siphiwe Hlophe, co-founder of Swaziland for Positive Living (SWAPOL), to the Parliament on the evening of 26 November 2007; pays tribute to her outstanding work in providing care and support for many of the thousands of people living with HIV and AIDS in the African state as well as vulnerable children including those orphaned by AIDS; notes that, although SWAPOL now offers a wide range of support to both male and female victims of HIV and AIDS, it was originally founded to support women who were disowned by their families and ostracised by society as "infidels" due to being diagnosed as HIV positive despite often having contracted the virus from their husbands, and congratulates the NUS Scotland Women’s Campaign for highlighting issues of gender discrimination related to HIV/AIDS and affording Members of the Parliament the opportunity to hear from Ms Hlophe in person by arranging her visit to Scotland.
