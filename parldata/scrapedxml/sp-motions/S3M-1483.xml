*S3M-1483 Kenneth Gibson: Suicide—That the Parliament notes with cautious optimism the decline in the rate of suicide, with the 2006 rates being 17.4 per 100,000 population for men and 5.3 per 100,000 population for women, the lowest over the period from 1991 to 2006; is nevertheless alarmed that Scotland still has the highest suicide rate in the United Kingdom, with 765 deaths due to confirmed or suspected suicide in 2006, an average of more than two each day; is aware that about three-quarters of suicides were of males, with one in four deaths among men under age 35 being as a result of taking their own lives and suicide continuing to be the leading cause of death for that demographic; notes that the risk of suicide in the most deprived areas of Scotland is nearly double the national average and that approximately 75% of suicides were completed by individuals who were not in contact with a health professional within the previous year; recognises the importance of providing help for these people and others affected by suicides and suicidal behaviour; lauds the work of Samaritans, Childline, Breathing Space - the suicide helpline for men aged 16 to 40, and Choose Life - the 10-year programme launched by the previous administration in 2002 aimed at preventing suicide and raising awareness of the issue; recognises the importance of immediate, accessible help for individuals who suffer from suicidal thoughts; acknowledges however that phone number hotlines are not widely known, and therefore seeks to increase public awareness of such programmes by developing a national suicide prevention helpline accessible via 999 to make it easily accessible in times of need.
