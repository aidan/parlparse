*S2M-1011# Mark Ballard: Enhancing Communities through Opposing Discrimination—That the Parliament notes the negative effects of segregated housing in preventing community unity and in diminishing the quality of life for everyone concerned and believes that the Scottish Executive should oppose all measures aimed at segregating housing in Scotland according to race, social status or occupation; expresses its concern that such measures might, whilst not being explicitly discriminatory, have discriminatory outcomes, excluding groups according to race, social status or occupation, and further believes that the Executive should promote all measures to enhance liveability and beneficial interaction throughout Scotland’s communities.
