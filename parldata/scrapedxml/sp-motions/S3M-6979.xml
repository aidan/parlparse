 *S3M-6979 Des McNulty: Tackling the Link Between Poverty and Educational Underachievement—That the Parliament expresses concern at what it considers to be the wide gap in educational attainment in Scotland between children from poorer and better-off families; believes that this reinforces and perpetuates existing patterns of poverty; further believes that it is not acceptable that Scotland’s poorest children make less progress at every stage of schooling than their better-off classmates; considers that, to break the cycle of deprivation, targeted support for children from the poorest homes and the most disadvantaged communities is needed to help them reach their full potential; welcomes Save the Children’s campaign, Better Odds At School, which highlights this issue of educational underachievement; supports the nurture class programme that is being carried forward by Glasgow City Council, which targets resources at improving the life chances of the most vulnerable children, and urges the Scottish Government to bend resources toward those in greatest need. Supported by: Patricia Ferguson*, Karen Whitefield*, Jackie Baillie*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Margaret Curran*, Rhona Brankin*, Michael McMahon*, Mike Pringle*, Elaine Murray*, Robin Harper*, Trish Godman*, Bill Butler*
