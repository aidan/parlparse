*S2M-4092 Jackie Baillie: Give Cyclists Room—That the Parliament congratulates Justin Beattie of Helensburgh on setting up the "Give Cyclists Room" campaign to promote greater awareness of cyclists on Britain’s roads; notes that awareness is being raised through a new website, www.givecyclistsroom.co.uk, and the sale of car window stickers; acknowledges that the grassroots campaign has been set up to alert drivers and cyclists alike to the fact that the single largest cause of collisions and near-collisions for cyclists is when other road users fail to appreciate just how much space a cyclist requires on the road; notes that in 2004 a total of 134 cyclists were killed on Britain’s roads and 2,174 were seriously injured, while 14,340 suffered from other injuries; wishes the campaign every success for the future, and encourages the Scottish Executive to alert other road users to their safety responsibilities in respect of cyclists in any road safety information and literature.
