*S1M-2961 Dennis Canavan: Scotland United—That the Parliament notes the tenth anniversary of the founding of Scotland United which falls on 11 April 2002; recalls the despair in Scotland at a fourth Tory election victory in England which deepened the democratic deficit; commends those who were prepared to work across parties to demand an opportunity for Scotland to choose its own constitutional future; recognises that such work injected a new urgency into mobilising a mass campaign for change which assisted in the process of establishing this Parliament, and expresses the hope that the principle of co-operation between politicians and the citizens of Scotland will assist in the process of developing this Parliament and creating an effective institution capable of winning Scotland’s respect. Supported by: Michael Russell*, Mr Frank McAveety*
