 * S2M-2802# Alex Fergusson:ME Awareness Week—That the Parliament recognises ME Awareness Week and acknowledges the recent announcement by the Scottish Executive that it will carry out a strategic needs assessment programme for ME sufferers in Scotland; further believes that a national approach is required for the treatment of sufferers of this disease and that a centre of excellence would be essential in order to best utilise professional expertise in the field, and believes that more balanced research is necessary to explore the neurological aspects of ME rather than the psychological ones which have already been explored in depth with no positive outcome.
