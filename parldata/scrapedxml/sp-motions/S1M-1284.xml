 *S1M-1284# Mr Kenneth Gibson: Voluntary Sector Access to Criminal Record Information—That the Parliament welcomes plans to introduce detailed criminal record checks on people working with children under 18 from July 2001; notes, however, that many voluntary organisations are deeply concerned at having to pay to obtain enhanced criminal record certificates; believes such costs place an extra burden on groups working with children; accepts the consensus position within the voluntary sector that it should not have to pay for access to vital child protection information; understands that financial barriers placed in the way of organisations working with children mean fewer safe environments for children and create a barrier to social inclusion, and asks the Scottish Executive to ensure that the voluntary sector free access across the board to criminal record information.
