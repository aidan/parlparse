*S2M-3634 Stewart Stevenson: Banking in Rural Scotland—That the Parliament deplores the attempt by Clydesdale Bank to prevent the possible takeover of their closure-threatened branches by the Royal Bank of Scotland; notes that for many of the rural communities affected the existence of a bank is a vital part of their infrastructure that anchors local business and personal life, and calls on Clydesdale Bank to abandon its current “dog-in-the-manger” attitude and co-operate with any organisation willing to continue banking services in affected towns and villages.
