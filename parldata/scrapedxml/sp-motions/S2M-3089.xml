 * S2M-3089 Chris Ballance: 20th Anniversary of the Sinking of the Rainbow Warriorâ€”That the Parliament commemorates the 20th anniversary of the sinking of the Rainbow Warrior on 10 July 1985 by the French secret service, causing the death of Greenpeace photographer, Fernando Pereira; hails the continuing voyages of Rainbow Warrior II to protect the Pacific Ocean; remembers that the first Rainbow Warrior was on its way to campaign against testing of nuclear weapons in the South Pacific when it was sunk; notes with grave concern the proliferation of nuclear weapon states in the last 20 years, and calls on the UK Government to meet its obligation as a signatory to Article 6 of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by abandoning plans to replace the Trident nuclear arsenal.
