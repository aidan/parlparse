 *S3M-6762 Margaret Mitchell: HeadStrong East Kilbride—That the Parliament welcomes the new HeadStrong support service provided by Breast Cancer Care Scotland that opened at the Kilbryde Hospice in East Kilbride in July 2010; considers the free once-a-week drop-in session delivered by trained volunteers who have themselves been affected by cancer to be an innovative service; acknowledges that the service will offer practical and emotional support and advice to people with any type of cancer; further notes that the Kilbryde Hospice is the fifth location in Scotland to offer the hair-loss service, with other services in Blantyre, Glasgow and Motherwell, and that last year more than 180 people used the service in Scotland; understands that, for cancer patients, losing their hair can be a traumatic experience, affecting both their self-confidence and wellbeing, and considers that the HeadStrong support programme is an excellent way to help boost patients’ confidence.
