*S2M-3582 Mark Ballard: Right to Education—That the Parliament notes that the Edinburgh University Students’ Association (EUSA) AGM passed a motion to twin EUSA with the Student Council at Birzeit University in the West Bank; further notes that the motion will associate EUSA with the Birzeit "Right to Education" campaign and calls on the University of Edinburgh to twin itself formally with Birzeit University; recognises the difficulties faced by students across the developing world in realising their right to education, and believes that Palestinian education faces enormous challenges resulting from Israeli Defence Forces’ policy and that British institutions such as the University of Edinburgh have an opportunity to assist the emergence of a vibrant Palestinian civil society by supporting the right to education in Palestine.
