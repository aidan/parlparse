*S3M-1964# Ted Brocklebank: Fife Energy Park—That the Parliament recognises the importance of renewables in Scotland’s energy equation; notes the endorsement by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth of the importance of the energy park, based at Methil, Fife; further notes that there is an active campaign to restore the rail link between Levenmouth and Thornton junction; recognises that the Levenmouth area which includes Methil is among the most deprived parts of Fife and that there is growing local concern about the apparent lack of progress in developing the energy park, and considers that the momentum must be maintained in putting Methil and Levenmouth firmly at the heart of Scotland’s renewable energy industry.
