*S3M-6038 Sarah Boyack: Number Shop Cut Doesn’t Add Up—That the Parliament expresses its deep concern at the City of Edinburgh Council’s proposals to close the Number Shop, a project that has helped thousands of adults across Edinburgh improve their numeracy and literacy skills over its 25-year history, as part of a programme of cuts to save £120,000; notes the concerns of the Friends of the Number Shop campaign group that the centre is irreplaceable because of its specialist teaching equipment, ease of disabled access and supportive atmosphere; recognises that the Number Shop’s central location makes it a facility that can be accessed to the benefit of people across the city; further notes the campaign’s assertion that plans to provide the service through other facilities will not result in any savings on staff costs, resulting in only minor savings and thus making the closure pointless; further notes that the Number Shop is one of six community centres and countless other community facilities faced with closure following the passing of the City of Edinburgh Council’s budget, and considers that these closures could have been avoided through Labour amendments that would have seen cuts made to external consultants, unnecessary schemes, non-essential back-office functions and pay freezes for chief officers and those earning more than £40,000 a year. Supported by: Bill Butler*, Karen Whitefield*, Des McNulty*, Cathy Jamieson*, Trish Godman*, Patricia Ferguson*, John Park*
