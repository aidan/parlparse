*S2M-2261 Tommy Sheridan: Reinstatement of Central College of Commerce Lecturer, Jim O’Donovan—That the Parliament notes the order issued to the Central College of Commerce by a Glasgow employment tribunal to reinstate sacked lecturer and trade union activist Jim O’Donovan by the end of January and pay him £60,000 in compensation; welcomes this decision but notes the tribunal’s finding that Mr O’Donovan was sacked originally for trade union activities, and agrees to order an open inquiry involving the Scottish Trades Union Congress into anti-trade union management of Central College and other colleges with similar industrial relations problems.
