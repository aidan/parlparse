*S2M-1852# Mary Scanlon: Infertility Services in Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the Scottish Executive of its intention to review the Expert Advisory Group on Infertility Services in Scotland’s (EAGISS) guidance on the provision of infertility services by NHS Scotland; notes that implementation of the guidance by NHS boards has been inconsistent since its launch in February 2000; recognises the extreme distress that infertility causes many couples across Scotland and the need to ensure that all couples that are eligible for treatment are able to access the same standard of service regardless of where they live, and considers that the Executive should set a completion date for the review of the guidance in order to address the inequality of service provision that continues to exist.
