*S3M-6071 Mike Pringle: Congratulations to Liberton High School and its Head Teacher, Donald Macdonald—That the Parliament congratulates Liberton High School and its head teacher, Donald Macdonald, in the vast improvement evident at the school since Donald first took charge in June 2005; notes that, following its most recent inspection in 2009, HM Inspectorate of Education (HMIE) described Liberton High as the most improved school in Scotland; further notes that, in 2009, 52 pupils from the school attended university, an increase from only seven who attended in 2005 when HMIE deemed overall school attainment unsatisfactory; considers this incredible improvement to be a just reward for all the hard work put in by the pupils, teachers, staff and parents at Liberton High in turning the school around, and wishes Liberton High and Donald Macdonald every success in the future as it continues to improve.
