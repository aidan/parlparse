 *S3M-5259 Dave Thompson: Northern Ireland Takes Lead in Reducing Drink-drive Limit—That the Parliament commends the decisions in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to lower the legal drink-driving limit in 2010 from 80mg to 50mg of alcohol per 100ml of blood; notes the broad range of support for an equal reduction in Scotland by the police forces, EU institutions, World Health Organization, medical and safety organisations, as well as by the Scottish Parliament via a motion on the Road Safety Framework, as amended and agreed to with no votes against on 17 September 2009; highlights the example of Switzerland that saw 44% fewer alcohol-related road deaths in the first two years following a reduction in the limit to 50mg in 2005; further notes with concern that the UK 80mg limit was set over 40 years ago and, along with Malta and Luxembourg, maintains the highest allowable legal limit of all EU countries; further notes the lack of implementation of the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution recommendation to transfer to the Scottish Ministers regulation-making powers relating to drink-driving limits, and finally calls on the UK Government to either lower the limit or allow the Scottish Ministers to do so.
