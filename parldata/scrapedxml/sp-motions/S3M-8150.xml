*S3M-8150 Mary Scanlon: Herbal Medicine Regulation—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the UK Secretary of State for Health on 16 February 2011 asking the Health Professions Council to establish a statutory register for practitioners supplying unlicensed herbal medicines; notes that this announcement followed discussions with health departments in the three devolved administrations to establish a unified UK-wide approach to the regulation of these practitioners; considers that the UK Government will have to have further discussions with the Scottish Parliament and the devolved institutions as it prepares draft legislation prior to the proposed implementation of this register in April 2012; welcomes that this proposal aims to ensure that the public can have access to a register of properly trained and qualified herbal practitioners who in turn will have access to all the medicines that the public wish to use, and supports further collaboration between the UK Government and the Scottish Parliament to secure a vibrant and healthy herbal sector that has potential, following regulation, to work alongside conventional medicine to provide good quality healthcare for Scottish people. Supported by: John Lamont*, Jamie McGrigor*, Murdo Fraser*, Mike Pringle*, Nanette Milne*
