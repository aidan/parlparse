*S2M-3589 Dr Jean Turner: Save the Alexander Elder War Memorial Chapel in the Glasgow Western Infirmary—That the Parliament welcomes any effort by NHS Greater Glasgow to save the Alexander Elder War Memorial chapel when the Western Infirmary closes in 2010-11; notes that the chapel, which was built by John James Burnet, commemorated its 80th year on 8 November 2005 and houses many beautiful stained glass windows and plaques dedicated to doctors and nurses of the Western Infirmary who gave their lives in two world wars, and therefore believes that the chapel should be retained completely, not only because of its historical importance and beauty, but because it is used daily by all faiths and has multi-faith pastors and nuns and because its very existence came about as an act of remembrance for those lost in war. Supported by: Ms Sandra White*
