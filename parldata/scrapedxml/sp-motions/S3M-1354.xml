 *S3M-1354 Christine Grahame: Reflecting on 40 Years of US Military Justice—That the Parliament notes that next month will mark the 40th anniversary of the My Lai massacre in Vietnam when between 350 and 500 Vietnamese civilians, the majority of them women and children, were shot dead by US troops who launched a deliberate and unprovoked attack on the village of My Lai; notes the international condemnation of this atrocity and war crime when this incident finally reached the public domain nearly 18 months later; notes that the US forces’ commanding officer Captain Ernest Medina who allegedly planned, ordered and carried out the massacre was subsequently acquitted by US military authorities and that Lieutenant William Calley served only three and a half years under house arrest despite being found guilty by a US court martial of taking a leading role in the massacre; contrasts that to the trials of detainees held at Guantanamo Bay who have already served several years of torture, interrogation and detainment and now face a series of US military tribunals, a process involving questionable prospects of a fair trial and in which even the American Bar Association, representing US attorneys, refuses to participate, and believes that, notwithstanding the seriousness of the charges made against the detainees, in true democracies only the application of law through an open, accountable and truly independent judicial process awards the right to claim authority and leadership in a cynical world increasingly torn apart by conflict, war and terrorism.
