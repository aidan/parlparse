*S2M-5328 Sarah Boyack: Betting Shop Staff Safety—That the Parliament notes that betting shops are among the few high street establishments in which cash handling is growing; further notes that, as a result, staff in Scottish betting shops are subject to risk of robbery and assault on a daily basis; believes that this risk is significantly increased due to longer opening hours and single-staffing of betting shops; notes that, in a survey of betting shop staff by Community, the union representing UK betting shop staff, 78% reported that they were concerned that they would become a victim of crime at work, and therefore welcomes the campaign recently launched by Community to end single-staffing and improve security in betting shops.
