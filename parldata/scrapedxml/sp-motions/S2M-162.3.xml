*S2M-162.3 Allan Wilson: Water Industry-As an amendment to motion (S2M-162) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from first "notes" to end and insert "believes that, having established Scottish Water in 2002, this is the right means of delivering cost-effective and improved services in accordance with the requirements of the Parliament and that, in the short time since Scottish Water's establishment, it has started the process of delivering cost effective and improved services, and further believes that a review of its ownership and funding now would undermine that progress to the detriment of all customers."
