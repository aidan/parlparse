 * S2M-3153 Shiona Baird: Moray Rural Schools Campaignâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by Moray Council that it is to withdraw its controversial proposals to close or merge more than 20 primary schools in the face of unprecedented public opposition; congratulates parents and community groups across the region on the resounding success of their campaign to save their local schools; commends council members for recognising the strength of public opinion on the issue and making an early announcement of their decision in order to avoid prolonging community uncertainty; believes that rural schools throughout Scotland must be adequately maintained and resourced if they are to remain as vital hubs of the community and not be subject to regular threats of closure or merger by cash-strapped councils; urges campaigners to continue to press for special status for rural schools, and calls on the Scottish Executive to adopt a presumption against their closure in view of their added value to the communities they serve.
