*S3M-2069 Mary Mulligan: Congratulations to the Lothian Cycle Campaign—That the Parliament congratulates the Lothian Cycle Campaign organisation on reaching the milestone of the 100th edition of its SPOKES bulletin, promoting the benefits of cycling for the environment and developing cycling as a healthy leisure pursuit; further notes that the first SPOKES bulletin was issued in April 1978 and that it is estimated that, in the time since the first edition, approximately 500,000 words have been written for the bulletins and that each print run is in excess of 10,000 copies, many of which are delivered by bike; congratulates the Lothian Cycle Campaign on the success of its local campaigning, including working with the previous administration to gain additional funding for Sustrans, amounting to £8 million over two years, and its more recent success in securing a car parking ban on the Mound in Scotland’s capital city; welcomes the establishment of Linlithgow Cycle Action Group, formed by local cyclists to promote cyclists’ issues in West Lothian and hopes that they will build on the successes of the Lothian Cycle Campaign; further welcomes the Bulletin 100 Exhibition that is being hosted by Edinburgh’s Central Library throughout June 2008, and wishes the Lothian Cycle Campaign every success in its future efforts to promote the values and benefits of cycling.
