*S2M-4964 Mike Pringle: Anna Politkovskaya: Journalist and Author—That the Parliament notes with deep sorrow and concern the assassination of the internationally recognised journalist and author, Anna Politkovskaya, in Moscow on 7 October 2006 and sends condolences to her family; notes the significant and long-lasting contribution Anna Politkovskaya made to the development of democracy and the advancement of human rights in Russia through her great courage, often matched with considerable personal sacrifice, risk-taking and dogged insistence in never compromising the fundamental ideals of strengthening free speech and a free press; recognises that Anna Politkovskaya touched the hearts of many when she spoke up on behalf of those without a voice, including in 2005 when she was welcomed to Edinburgh as a speaker at the Edinburgh International Book Festival; notes that her personal integrity and commitment to the truth was recognised in 2004 through the award of the Olof Palme Prize, and sends a message of support and encouragement to the colleagues and friends of Anna Politkovskaya that they should continue their brave work to advance the development of democracy in Russia.
