 *S3M-7817 Murdo Fraser: Promotion of North Inch Golf Club—That the Parliament acknowledges that North Inch golf course in Perth is one of the oldest and most revered courses in Scotland; recognises Perth’s long and proud connection with golf, including claims that the North Inch is the world’s first recognisable golf course, and the royal enactments in 1450 stating that King Robert II prohibited the playing of golf on the Inches, urging people to practise archery due to the threat of invasion; believes that VisitScotland, EventScotland, Perth and Kinross Council and other relevant agencies should promote the importance of North Inch golf course to boost tourism in Perth, and further believes that Perthshire has some of the finest golf courses in the world and that the area should be promoted as one of the world’s top destinations to play golf.
