*S3M-1544 Jamie Hepburn: Citizenship Oaths—That the Parliament notes with concern proposals to introduce citizenship ceremonies involving an oath of allegiance to Britain and the Crown for school leavers in the United Kingdom; believes that such a scheme would be unnecessary and unpopular in Scotland, and further believes that such a scheme could undermine the tradition in Scotland that sovereignty is vested in the people rather than any one individual or institution.
