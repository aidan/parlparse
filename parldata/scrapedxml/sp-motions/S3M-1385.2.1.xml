 *S3M-1385.2.1 Margaret Smith: Prisons Policyâ€”As an amendment to amendment (S3M-1385.2) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, insert at end "recognises the need to reduce the number of low-level receptions into custody for short-term sentences by focusing on tough community sentences that pay back into the community for the harm caused; further notes the need to improve treatment for those with mental health problems and drug and alcohol addictions, thus addressing the underlying causes of offending, and calls on the Scottish Government to build on schemes which provide offenders with education and skills training for work, not crime."
