*S2M-2158.3 Hugh Henry: Justice Issues with Specific Relevance to Reoffending—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2158) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from "unacceptable" to end and insert "Criminal Justice Plan’s acknowledgement that the rate of reoffending occurring in Scotland today is unacceptable; agrees that prison should be used where prison is the appropriate punishment but notes that prison is also intended to rehabilitate the offender, deter the prospective offender and protect the public; agrees that prison must sit within a range of different sentencing options to address reoffending, and therefore notes the increase in police numbers compared to the numbers delivered by the Conservatives, the establishment of the Sentencing Commission to consider a number of issues including early release, and that the recently published Criminal Justice Plan includes measures to tackle Scotland’s high reoffending rates, reduce crime and the fear of crime and strengthen confidence in the country’s criminal justice services."
