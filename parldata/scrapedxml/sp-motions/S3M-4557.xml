 S3M-4557 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Shame on Shell—That the Parliament condemns the Shell oil company for its continued refusal to accept any responsibility for actions leading to the hangings in 1995 by Nigeria’s then military government of Ken Saro-Wiwa and eight other Ogoni activists, despite being forced recently to pay £10 million in an out-of-court settlement; remembers that, in his final statement at his trial, Ken Saro-Wiwa predicted that Shell would one day be held accountable for "the crimes of ecological war the company has waged in the Delta"; pays tribute to the courageous, non-violent activism of Ken Saro-Wiwa and his comrades in the Ogoni Nine in their fight for the rights of the people of Ogoniland and to the tenacity of their families in their long pursuit of justice, and joins the ShellGuilty campaign group in demanding an immediate end to Shell’s illegal gas-flaring in Nigeria.
