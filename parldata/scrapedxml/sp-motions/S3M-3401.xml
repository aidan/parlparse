 *S3M-3401 Bill Kidd: Positive Opportunities for Gordon Brown—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement of Des Browne MP, former Secretary of State for Defence and for Scotland, that positive opportunities have presented themselves to move forward on nuclear disarmament following Barack Obama’s accession to the White House; agrees that, in the midst of the current global economic downturn, money spent on Trident could be far better spent elsewhere; believes that the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown MP, and the Secretary of State for Defence, John Hutton MP, should heed Mr Browne’s u-turn and follow suit, and further agrees that quite unlike the emperor and his new clothes it would seem that President Obama has a coat and that its tails are worth riding.
