 *S3M-2403Nigel Don:Aberdeen City Business Improvement Districtâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Aberdeen City Council to establish a Business Improvement District (BID); notes that BIDs have been particularly successful in a number of cities throughout north America and other parts of the United Kingdom at tackling various issues from cleanliness to crime and driving forward improvements to business areas; looks forward to seeing the development of the BID in Aberdeen, and considers that this is a forward-thinking move to help reinvigorate Aberdeen city centre and that the council should be congratulated in this regard.
