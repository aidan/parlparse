*S2M-1483# Chris Ballance: Real Cost of Road Transport-That the Parliament notes that the real cost of road transport includes the cost of climate change and significant health problems attributable to noise and air pollution and the ever-increasing costs of road maintenance; agrees, therefore, that fuel tax must be progressively increased subject to three conditions: firstly, that there must be overall tax reform that redistributes wealth downwards to prevent unfair impacts on people with low incomes, disabled people and people in remote communities, secondly, that there must be significant investment in public transport alternatives to the car and road freight so that people and businesses have more choice in mode of transport and, thirdly, that there must be incentives to encourage use of less polluting UK-grown biofuels, and believes that such moves would make Scotland more sustainable, safer and less polluted.
