 *S1M-3052.1 Patricia Ferguson: Powers of the Parliamentâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-3052) in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from "Scottish Executive" to end and insert "devolution settlement is right for Scotland, that wide powers have been devolved to the Scottish Executive and the Parliament and endorsed by Scottish voters in a referendum, that full use is being made of these powers to deliver the policies set out in the Programme for Government, and that these powers can deliver real improvements in the public services and help secure a strong and competitive economy."
