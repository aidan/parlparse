*S2M-4421 Pauline McNeill: Financial Support for Gaza and the West Bank—That the Parliament welcomes the latest humanitarian assistance plan, initiated by the European Union, Russia, the United Nations and the United States of America, to deliver funding for the management of essential public services such as health care and education in the West Bank and Gaza; supports further international humanitarian assistance measures required to address the tragic lack of hospital resources and supplies in both territories; recognises that the freezing of foreign aid since January 2006 has greatly diminished the ability of the Palestinian Authority to pay over 165,000 public sector employees; notes that 25% of West Bank and Gaza residents depend on Palestinian Authority wages for their livelihoods, and therefore opposes the continued withholding of crucial tax and customs revenues from the authority.
