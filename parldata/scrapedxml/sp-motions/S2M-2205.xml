*S2M-2205 Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Free Christmas Trees—That the Parliament applauds the Jerusalem Municipality’s free distribution of Christmas trees which will take place today, 23 December 2004; recognises that the Christmas tree distribution is a long-standing tradition of the Jerusalem Municipality which has taken place for dozens of years and which is symbolic of the way that Jerusalem unites all three monotheistic religions; welcomes the generosity of the Jewish National Fund which donated the trees, and echoes the sentiments of the mayor of Jerusalem, Uri Lupolianski, in wishing a merry Christmas to the Christian residents of Jerusalem and a year of peace, tolerance and brotherhood.
