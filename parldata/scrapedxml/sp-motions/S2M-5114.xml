*S2M-5114 Robin Harper: Edinburgh - Showing the Way to a Low Carbon Future?—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of a report on decentralised energy, commissioned by the City of Edinburgh Council, Greenpeace UK and WWF Scotland, suggesting that Edinburgh could become a world leader in the fight against climate change; notes the findings of the report that if Edinburgh implements its recommendations to opt for a decentralised energy system, using micro-renewable energy generation and combined heat and power (CHP), it could meet all of its energy needs, slash carbon dioxide emissions and save money, without the use of new nuclear power; contrasts the decentralised model with the present system used in the United Kingdom, whereby the vast majority of electricity comes from large, centralised and grossly inefficient thermal power stations that waste around two-thirds of their energy inputs; believes that, as long as fossil fuels are used to generate electricity, both generators and consumers of energy have a responsibility to ensure that this finite and polluting energy is used as efficiently as possible; acknowledges that decentralised energy is a tried and tested system which is already widely used across many parts of Europe, where combined heat and power networks are commonplace, and calls for other cities across Scotland and the rest of the UK to follow this example and to adopt a decentralised energy system fit for the 21st century.
