*S2M-207 Carolyn Leckie: Closing the Pay Gap - Nursery Nurses' Grading and Pay Disputeâ€”That the Parliament expresses concern that the nursery nurses' grading and pay dispute continues and that the employers have not recognised their modest and legitimate claim, one symptomatic of endemic and structural discrimination against women as well as of low pay in the public sector; further expresses its concern that, despite positive comments from the Scottish Executive on "closing the pay gap" and EU funding to address inequalities of pay related to gender, the Executive has been silent on whether it supports this predominantly female workforce in its long-running campaign to "close the pay gap" and gain professional recognition, and therefore calls on the Executive to put "closing the pay gap" into action by supporting nursery nurses in their rightful claim and assisting the employers to meet it by making the necessary funding available.
