 *S1M-3189 Robin Harper: Rural Developments in the Edinburgh Green Belt—That the Parliament notes the decision of Midlothian Council to commence the construction of a large roundabout near Roslin, Midlothian, despite the fact that objections to the proposal at the Midlothian Local Plan Inquiry have not yet been resolved; believes that the proposals as they stand are inappropriate in scale and damaging to a fragile area of Edinburgh’s Green Belt, and therefore calls on Midlothian Council to review the decision through a process of consultation on how transport links on the A701 can be best improved and the quality of the Green Belt protected.
