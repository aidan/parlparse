 *S3M-1288 Kenneth Gibson: Why Do We Feel So Broke?—That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the report, Why Do We Feel So Broke?, published on 4 February 2008, which shows that average UK disposable family income, after tax and housing costs, having declined from £16,544 in 2003 to £16,305 in 2006, plummeted to £15,231 in 2007; believes that this Gordon Brown-inspired squeeze is likely to worsen in coming months and years, placing ever-increasing burdens on already hard-pressed families; realises that the inability of the UK Government to prevent living standards from falling belies the myth of Labour’s economic competence; considers that such ineptitude at a time of strong growth in the world economy over recent years raises obvious worries about the impact of a global slowdown; acknowledges that both the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the National Institute of Economic and Social Research are of the view that substantial tax rises may be necessary for the UK Government to balance the books; regrets the fact that the Scottish Government does not have the fiscal powers to mitigate the impact of Scotland being thirled to the United Kingdom and therefore welcomes the small measures that it can take to ease the burden on taxpayers by, for example, encouraging local authorities to freeze the council tax, and agrees that Scotland could best serve the economic interests of our people if it were an independent nation with all the fiscal powers that would entail.
