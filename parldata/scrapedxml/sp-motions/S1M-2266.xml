*S1M-2266 Tommy Sheridan: Private Finance Initiative-That the Parliament endorses the comments made by the Liberal Democrat Treasury Spokesperson, Matthew Taylor, at the Liberal Democrat Party's annual conference that ". PFI is a form of debt . either way, the tax-payer pays" and his statement that the Labour Government was using PFI simply to make their figures look better which he believed was a "shocking scandal"; notes his further statement that "at the very least this is gross incompetence. Frankly, we believe the figures are being fiddled. If it was cricket Gordon Brown would get a life ban. . Most PFI contracts replace unaccountable and over-centralised publicly run services with even more unaccountable and over-centralised privately run services. .It is time to sweep away this secrecy. To expose private involvement in public services to proper scrutiny. To knock it off its pedestal. To allow real choice. Examine every option. Throw out the ideology,", and calls upon the Scottish Liberal Democrat partners of the Scottish Executive coalition to turn the words of their Treasury Spokesperson into action by opposing New Labour's ideological pursuit of private finance in Scotland's public services.
