*S2M-5799 Elaine Smith: Monklands General Hospital—That the Parliament welcomes the £300 million investment planned by NHS Lanarkshire; further welcomes the planned Maggie’s Centre, cancer service and the 24-hour community casualty unit at Monklands General Hospital, however condemns the decision by NHS Lanarkshire, ratified by the Scottish Executive, to downgrade the hospital; believes that health service reconfiguration decisions should be based on the health and social needs of the people of Lanarkshire, weighted for the impact on reducing social and health inequalities, and not narrow financial considerations; further believes that the financial information provided to the NHS board as a basis for its decision was flawed; notes that Elaine Smith MSP has referred the matter of the finances to the Auditor General for Scotland and is awaiting an outcome; further notes that the decision was reached after a flawed consultation which was launched with a preferred option to downgrade Monklands and which dismissed the 50,000 signatures collected by Karen Whitefield, Cathie Craigie and Elaine Smith MSPs, ignored the articulate comments made at public meetings and did not reflect the content of the many comprehensive submissions made; finds it incredible that NHS Lanarkshire has decided to downgrade its busiest, most efficient and effective accident and emergency department, located in the area serving over half the population of Lanarkshire and suffering from some of the poorest health in Scotland alongside high levels of poverty and deprivation; notes that Wishaw and Hairmyres hospitals close to accident and emergency admissions much more frequently than Monklands; believes that a reduction in capacity by downgrading Monklands can only exacerbate that situation and increase the pressure on neighbouring hospitals, and believes that this decision to downgrade Monklands should be reversed.
