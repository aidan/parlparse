 *S2M-4241 Christine Grahame: Just Pull Yourself Together?—That the Parliament recognises the work of Depression Alliance Scotland in providing information and support for anyone affected by depression and anyone caring for someone affected by depression; supports its campaign in raising awareness and understanding of depression, an illness which affected around 300,000 people in Scotland in the last recorded year, half of whom attempt to struggle on without seeking help; recognises that it is an illness and is not simply a case of "pulling oneself together" but that in the majority of cases is treatable, and fully supports its "Mother Father Son Daughter Brother Sister Lover Friend You" campaign raising awareness that depression affects us all either through personal experience or by knowing someone who suffers from depression and that depression is not something to be afraid to admit to or be ashamed of.
