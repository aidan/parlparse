*S3M-483♦ George Foulkes: Time for a Fresh Debate on Organ Donation—That the Parliament commends the ongoing work that British Medical Association Scotland is doing to raise awareness of organ donation; recognises that the number of people on the active and temporarily suspended transplant waiting list in Scotland rose by almost 20% from 695 in September 2005 to its highest level of 818 in July 2007 and yet only 50 organs were donated in Scotland last year and that at 10 June 2007 there were 135 people in the NHS Lothian area registered with UK Transplant as waiting for an organ; recognises that the current opt-in system of organ donation is unable to meet the increasing demands placed upon it; acknowledges the need for a full and proper public debate to establish the level of support that exists for a move to a system of presumed consent that will both inform future proposals in this area and raise awareness of the desperate need for organ donors, and considers that moves to turn the tremendous level of public and, increasingly, professional support that exists for organ donation into something meaningful should be supported by implementing a system of presumed consent.
