*S3M-7862 Liam McArthur: More Success for Orkney’s Traditional Music—That the Parliament notes the recent hat trick of Orcadian traditional music success with Birsay fiddler, Kristan Harvey, winning the BBC Young Traditional Musician of the Year award, Broken Strings, a seven-piece instrumental group of S3 students from Kirkwall Grammar School, winning a Danny Kyle Open Stage award at Celtic Connections and the band, Cara, which includes Orkney’s Jeana Leslie, winning the Top Group award at the Irish Music Awards; takes particular pleasure at the success of Orkney’s young musicians, and considers that this demonstrates that traditional music is not only alive and well in Orkney but has a great future as the next generation joins Orkney’s thriving traditional music scene.
