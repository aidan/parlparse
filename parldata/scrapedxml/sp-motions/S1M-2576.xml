*S1M-2576 Irene McGugan: Instrumental Teaching in Schools and Support for Music-That the Parliament notes with concern the application of the criterion of "ability to pay" in relation to access to instrumental teaching, which is a crucial element of the music curriculum at Standard and Higher Still grades in schools; believes that such teaching should be `available to all children, free at the point of delivery, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to examine the structural underfunding of music which exists and adopt all necessary measures to ensure that every element and genre of musical activity is properly supported and developed in order that future generations of Scottish musicians can continue to achieve international recognition in traditional, classical, acoustic, jazz, folk, rock and popular music.
