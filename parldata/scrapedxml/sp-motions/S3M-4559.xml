 S3M-4559 Jamie Hepburn: ID Cards Ruled Out as "Compulsory" for British Citizens—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by Alan Johnson MP, Home Secretary, that ID cards will not be compulsory for British citizens; considers, however, that Mr Johnson’s announcement obfuscates the intention of the UK Government to make the passport a "designated document", meaning that the details of everyone who applies for a passport will be stored on a national identity register and that the identity scheme will remain, in practice, compulsory; believes that the UK Government’s change of tack is a mere attempt to implement the identity scheme through the back door, and calls on the UK Government to wholly abandon this wasteful and unpopular scheme.
