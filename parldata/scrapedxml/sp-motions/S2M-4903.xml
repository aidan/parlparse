*S2M-4903 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Environmental Justice for All—That the Parliament notes the Scottish Environment Protection Agency’s report, change tomorrow today, on the state of Scotland’s environment; notes with concern that the report identified continuing problems in Scotland with issues of localised air pollution, reductions in stratospheric ozone, risks to water quality from diffuse pollution, increases in the amount of waste being produced, potential ecological damage from nutrient enrichment and acidification and loss of biodiversity; further notes that the report raises concerns over gaps in knowledge about a number of aspects of the environment including, for example, land quality, especially of soil, the environmental implications of hazardous chemicals and the relationships between the environment and human health, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to undertake an immediate series of investigations into the state of land quality, the implications of hazardous chemicals and the relationships between the environment and human health with a view to introducing future legislation to protect Scotland’s land and people and deliver environmental justice for all.
