 *S2M-592 Carolyn Leckie: South Lanarkshire Council's School Closures-That the Parliament is concerned by the decisions taken by South Lanarkshire Council with regard to secondary school provision; believes that these decisions were based on a flawed consultation process and flawed information, including inaccurate demographic information; further believes that the council did not take full cognisance of the community's view and, indeed, misinterpreted the nature of substantial opposition; considers that the council has not proven the benefits of such large schools as planned in East Kilbride, which are much bigger than anywhere else in South Lanarkshire; is concerned that the council has not taken sufficient cognisance of the travel problems that will ensue and has left the south of East Kilbride, which has a population on the lowest incomes in East Kilbride and the greatest housing expansion, with no secondary provision whatsoever, and considers that the Minister for Education and Young People should not approve any of South Lanarkshire's proposed closures but should recommend that the council re-opens the consultation process.
