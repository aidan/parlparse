 *S3M-2385 Bashir Ahmad: Fighting in South Ossetia and Georgiaâ€”That the Parliament strongly condemns the fighting in South Ossetia and Georgia which has led to over 2,000 reported civilian deaths; calls on both sides involved in the conflict to take up an immediate ceasefire to allow negotiations to begin; views the actions of the Russian Federation as unacceptable and wholly disproportionate; notes with extreme concern the escalation in violence which has spread beyond South Ossetia, and calls upon the United Nations, European Union and other influential partners to intervene in the region to prevent further unnecessary deaths.
