*S3M-6845Stuart McMillan:Tall Ship Glenlee Arrives in Greenock—That the Parliament welcomes the news that the historic tall ship, Glenlee, has arrived in Greenock for renovation at Garvel dry dock; notes that the renovations at Garvel are part of a £1.5 million refurbishment project launched by the Clyde Maritime Trust to make essential improvements to the Glenlee in time for her move alongside the new Riverside Museum in spring 2011; further notes that while in dry dock the ship’s hull will be cleaned, blasted and ultrasonically tested and the rear deckhouse will be resized to be more in keeping with the original design, and acknowledges that Glenlee is the only remaining Clyde-built sailing vessel afloat in the UK and officially became an accredited museum in 2008.
