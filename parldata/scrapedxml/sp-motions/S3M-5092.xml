*S3M-5092 Bill Wilson: Ethical Procurement in the NHS—That the Parliament welcomes the NHS Purchasing and Supply Agency publication, Ethical Procurement for Health: Guidance, a document for use by the NHS in England to promote stronger, fairer and more ethical trade in the health sector; considers that the need for such a publication was underlined by the findings of a recent delegation of the British Medical Association’s Medical Fair and Ethical Trade Group to Pakistan, which found, amongst other things, that, in a single street in Sialkot, 10 children were at work making surgical instruments, including some as young as seven, and calls on NHS Scotland to use Ethical Procurement for Health: Guidance as the basis for developing similar guidance in Scotland.
