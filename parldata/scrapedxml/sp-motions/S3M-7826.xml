*S3M-7826 Brian Adam: Working Rite Success in Aberdeenâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the first five graduates of the Working Rite project in Aberdeen, which gives a brokered six-month work placement for people turned off by school but desperate to build a future for themselves and is supported by the following local organisations in providing the training opportunities: Andrew Shepherd Construction Ltd, Heat Care Oil and Gas, Atlas Lift and Services, Aberdeen Forward and John Mutch Building Services Ltd; further congratulates the graduates, Craig Crystal, Garry Cheyne, Chris Hood, Darren Christie and Sean Donald, who have benefited from this opportunity; commends this partnership between Working Rite and Langstane Housing Association, which has had a 100% success rate in providing either apprenticeships or full-time jobs to participants, and recognises the continued input by local small businesses into what it considers this worthy enterprise.
