*S3M-7176 John Scott: Listed Places of Worship Grant Schemeâ€”That the Parliament notes the success of the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme, which helps many churches and other places of worship meet the costs of essential maintenance; notes that this interim grant scheme was introduced in 2001 and returns in grant aid the difference between 5% and the actual amount spent on VAT on eligible repairs and maintenance to listed places of worship; further notes that this scheme is due to end on 31 March 2011; believes that the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme continues to play a valuable role in supporting and maintaining places of worship, and urges UK ministers to continue the scheme beyond March 2011.
