*S2M-277 Mr Brian Monteith: Stirling's Appeal to Secure William Wallace Portrait—That the Parliament commends the efforts of Stirling’s Smith Art Gallery and Museum to secure a rare 17th century portrait of William Wallace originally owned by the Wauchopes of Niddrie Marischal, Edinburgh; notes that the gallery has launched an appeal to raise £20,000 to purchase the picture from a private collection in London, and believes that, if this is successful, the portrait would greatly enhance the Smith’s permanent collection of Wallace artefacts, as well as forming an integral part of its major exhibition to commemorate the 700th anniversary of the death of Wallace, scheduled to be held in summer 2005.
