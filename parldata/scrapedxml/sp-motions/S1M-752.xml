*S1M-752 Alex Johnstone on behalf of the Rural Affairs Committee: Impact of the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order, 1999-That the Parliament notes the terms of the report by the Rural Affairs Committee The Impact of the Scottish Adjacent Waters Boundaries Order, 1999 (SP paper 42), in particular its dissatisfaction and concern about the level of consultation carried out prior to the introduction of the boundaries order, that the introduction of a boundaries order appears not to have identified any inconsistency with the Civil Jurisdiction (Offshore Activities) Order 1987, and that the amount of fishing activity in the disputed area does not appear to have influenced the Order, and further notes the Committee's recommendation that the Secretary of State for Scotland should either introduce a new, revised Order, or support a Bill calling for a revised boundary proposed in the House of Commons by Archy Kirkwood MP.
