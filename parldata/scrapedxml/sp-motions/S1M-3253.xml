*S1M-3253 Mr John Swinney: Deferred Waiting Listsâ€”That the Parliament notes the recent report by the Auditor General for Scotland, Review of the management of waiting lists in Scotland; believes that public confidence in the waiting list system is at an all-time low, and considers that, for public confidence to be restored, the following immediate action should be taken by the government in Scotland: (a) the deferred list should be abolished and a complete waiting list established in order to ascertain the true number of people waiting for treatment in Scotland and (b) all current and new patients whose treatment has been reclassified from day case to out-patient should be given a "waiting time guarantee" and that the guarantee should be redefined to include the complete patient journey from referral by a general practitioner to treatment.
