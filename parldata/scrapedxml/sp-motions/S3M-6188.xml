* S3M-6188 Bill Kidd: New Restrictions on the Independent Living Fund—That the Parliament notes with concern that changes to the Independent Living Fund (ILF) eligibility criteria, proposed by the UK Government, will restrict new applications to those severely disabled people who are in paid employment of 16 hours or more and that it could massively reduce the number of new people eligible for the ILF, which assists severely disabled people to access essential support, and further notes that the Association of Directors of Social Work has calculated that, under the new criteria, only four new Scots applicants will be eligible for ILF this year.
