*S3M-3539 Aileen Campbell: UNICEF Highlights the Children’s Arc of Prosperity—That the Parliament notes the publication of a report by UNICEF, Child Poverty in Perspective: An Overview of Child Well-being in Rich Countries, which provides an overview of the state of childhood in the majority of economically advanced nations of the world; notes with concern that, according to the report, the United Kingdom lags behind other highly developed countries in terms of relative poverty and deprivation, quality of children’s relationships with their parents and peers, child health and safety, behaviour and risk-taking and subjective wellbeing; further notes that, of the top 10 countries meeting the best child-wellbeing indicators, the majority are small, independent nations that are identified in the Scottish Government’s National Conversation as part of the arc of prosperity, and believes that only independence will equip Scotland with the power that it needs vastly to improve child wellbeing and end child poverty in Scotland.
