 *S3M-2376 Bashir Ahmad: Additional Investment in Scotland’s Dental Services—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing of an additional £75 million in funding for dental services across Scotland; further welcomes the £21.5 million that will be invested in Glasgow over the next two years; notes that many Scots, particularly those in rural areas, struggle to find a place on an NHS dental surgery list, and congratulates the Scottish Government on its effective and thorough response to rising concerns over the lack of NHS dentists in Scotland and its drive to improve standards across Scotland’s dental surgeries.
