*S2M-3898 Alasdair Morgan: The Future of the Saltire—That the Parliament notes with concern recent calls for the Saltire to be replaced as the national flag of Scotland and its misappropriation by far right groups in the United States of America; considers the Saltire to be a powerful symbol of Scotland’s identity; further notes the comments of the Lord Lyon, Sir Thomas Innes of Learney, in 1956 that, “The Cross of St Andrew is the flag which any Scotsman [or woman] is entitled to fly or wear as evidence of his [or her] national identity”, and believes that the Saltire is an internationally recognised symbol of Scotland with which all modern Scots, regardless of origin or belief, can associate.
