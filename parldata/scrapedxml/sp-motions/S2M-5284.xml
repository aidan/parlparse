*S2M-5284♦ Ms Sandra White: Scotland’s Voice Must Be Heard—That the Parliament notes, with due concern in respect of the legitimacy of open and free democratic debate, that the outcome of the much-publicised debate on a replacement to Trident has already been reached through the Conservative Party’s committed support to the Government’s stated position; expresses disappointment that a real debate cannot be secured in either the House of Commons or the Scottish Parliament; considers that this issue is of great importance to the people of Scotland, especially considering the very real danger to Glasgow and much of the west through contamination in the event of a nuclear accident, and therefore believes that the people of Scotland should be given the chance to debate this tough issue and to decide by means of a referendum on Trident, echoing the sentiments of the Presiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament when, as reported in The Scotsman, he stated that referenda "provide citizens with tangible power over what they see as the crucial issues of the day, even if these have been ignored by the Executive and the Parliament". Supported by: John Swinburne*, Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Tommy Sheridan*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Roseanna Cunningham*
