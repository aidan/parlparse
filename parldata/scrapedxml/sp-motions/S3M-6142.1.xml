*S3M-6142.1 Alex Johnstone: Fuel Pricesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-6142) in the name of Liam McArthur, leave out from "and calls" to end and insert "as a result of the Liberal Democrats and the Scottish National Party voting against Conservative amendment S3M-4006.1 on 30 April 2009, which called on the Scottish Government to report back to the Parliament on the extent to which a fuel duty derogation for rural areas would be permissible under EU law and what impact such a derogation would have on carbon emissions and the Scottish Government, and welcomes the commitment of a future Conservative government at Westminster in relation to the introduction of a fair fuel stabiliser."
