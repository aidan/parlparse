*S3M-6408Hugh O’Donnell:Withdrawal of Funding for South Lanarkshire Disability Forum—That the Parliament notes with disappointment the decision by South Lanarkshire Council to withdraw funding from the South Lanarkshire Disability Forum (SLDF) owing to non-financial reasons and regrets SLDF’s subsequent decision to close; recognises that SLDF has provided advice and support across the range of disabilities and help for those in need of it to obtain their benefit entitlements as well as signposting the routes toward appropriate sources of aid and advice; regrets the disappearance of these services, which continue to be greatly in demand; understands that, although the decision by South Lanarkshire Council’s Director of Social Work Resources to withdraw all funding from SLDF with effect from 31 March 2010 was taken in October 2009, SLDF was not notified of the decision until mid-February 2010, and suggests that, had more time been given by South Lanarkshire Council to consultation with SLDF and the users of its services prior to the decision to close the forum, the loss of these services could have been avoided.
