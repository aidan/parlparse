*S3M-4719 Jamie Hepburn: Equality for All Armed Forces Veterans—That the Parliament notes the campaign of the Armed Forces Pension Group to secure equality of pensions for former regular members of the Armed Forces who served for fewer than 22 years at any time to April 1975 and who were discharged before 5 April 1975; further notes that currently former service members who fall into this category receive no service pension at all and that this also applies to those regulars who were discharged prior to 1981 and who do not meet the criteria of length of service and age; believes this current situation to be a form of discrimination against those who have risked their lives in active service, and supports the group’s call for the introduction of pension rights based on years of service and related, pro rata, to pensions received by contemporaries who completed 22 years of service.
