 *S2M-267# Shona Robison: Vlaams Blok Visitâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the forthcoming delegation to the Parliament of Flemish MPs, which includes a member of the far right Vlaams Blok group; believes that Vlaams Blok's extreme views on immigration are not compatible with the founding principles of the Parliament; is concerned that this visit may lend credibility to Vlaams Blok and give it a platform for its views, and urges the Presiding Officer to review the decision to allow Vlaams Blok to visit the Parliament.
