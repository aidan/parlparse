*S3M-3235.1 Jamie Hepburn: Appointment of Chair of the Board of the Scottish Qualifications Authority—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3235) in the name of Jack McConnell, leave out from "also notes" to end and insert "believes that this appointment has been conducted in accordance with the robust standards required by the Commissioner for Public Appointments in Scotland’s code of practice; further believes that the system of public appointments in Scotland compares favourably with that of other countries, and also believes that accusations of cronyism and conflicts of interest rarely stand in the way of UK Government ministers making public appointments, for example in the appointment of political figures to traditionally neutral diplomatic overseas postings such as the British High Commission in Malawi."
