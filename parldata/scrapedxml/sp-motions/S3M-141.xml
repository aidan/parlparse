*S3M-141 Michael Matheson: Healthy Meal Uptake in Falkirk Schools—That the Parliament congratulates Falkirk Council on its initiatives to encourage more pupils to take up school meals; notes that 97% of all eligible pupils attending schools have received free meals and that 62.9% of primary school pupils have taken school meals, the highest figures in mainland Scotland; recognises that the policies of the previous SNP-led administration have led to this improvement, and notes that there is a correlation between the price and uptake of school meals with Falkirk Council’s school meals being the cheapest in Scotland.
