*S3M-3566 Jackie Baillie: NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde’s Contempt for Consultation—That the Parliament regrets the decision taken by the board of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to remove 24/7 anaesthetics service, coronary care, treatment for strokes, gastrointestinal bleeds and epileptic seizures from the Vale of Leven Hospital to the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RHA) in Paisley; further regrets the decision to close the Christie Ward, which provides invaluable inpatient acute mental health services to the local community; considers that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has displayed utter contempt for the views of the local community; strongly considers that insufficient attention has been given to a reconfiguration of services based north of the river; further notes that this decision is not keeping services local, as promised by the Scottish Government, and therefore calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to reject these proposals, retain 24/7 anaesthetics and the Christie Ward at the Vale of Leven Hospital and reconfigure services currently delivered by the RAH to be delivered north of the river for an enhanced catchment area.
