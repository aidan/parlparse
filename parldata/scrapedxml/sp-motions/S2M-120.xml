 *S2M-120# Ms Sandra White: Raids on Lap-Dancing Clubs—That the Parliament notes the series of raids on lap-dancing clubs conducted by the Gardai in the Republic of Ireland; further notes the discovery of illegal immigrants, drugs and connections with organised crime; condemns the exploitation and trafficking of women associated with these establishments; regrets that such activities still take place in the 21st century, and considers that the Scottish Executive should urgently investigate the operation of lap-dancing clubs to ascertain whether there are any connections with organised crime and take whatever action is necessary to end the exploitation and trafficking of women.
