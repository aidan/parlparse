*S2M-4766 Mr Brian Monteith: Common Fisheries Policy—That the Parliament welcomes the news that Walmart-ASDA has joined calls for Britain’s withdrawal from the Common Fisheries Policy in order to protect and preserve fish stocks in the North Sea and the livelihoods of local Scottish fishermen, such as those in the Kingdom of Fife; notes that the Common Fisheries Policy has failed to deliver sustainability of fish supplies and calls on Her Majesty’s Government and the European Union to introduce a new management regime, devised by local fishermen, which would give them a stake in enhancing and managing the stocks on which their livelihoods, often the sole income of communities, depend; believes that the North Sea should be declared a marine conservation zone, and considers that Members should put party politics aside and recognise that this approach is in the interests of Scotland, the fishing communities, the fish and the ecology of the North Sea.
