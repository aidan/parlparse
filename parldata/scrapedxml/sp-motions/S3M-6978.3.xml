*S3M-6978.3 Patrick Harvie: Drugs Strategyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-6978) in the name of Fergus Ewing, insert at end ", but, in so doing, notes that experts such as Professor Pertwee of Aberdeen University and Sir Ian Gilmore, former President of the Royal College of Physicians, have called for a reconsideration of the failures of current drug legislation; believes that the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 neither promotes good health nor reduces crime associated with drug taking; recognises that some alternative approaches such as those taken in Portugal have been found to promote health and reduce crime, and, while recognising that drug policy is reserved to the UK Government, urges Scottish ministers to engage with the UK Government and to acknowledge the broader debate that is now taking place in civic Scotland and which examines alternatives to the current legislation."
