*S2M-162.2 Frances Curran: Water Industry-As an amendment to motion (S2M-162) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from "to businesses" and insert "and believes that these charges bear disproportionately on domestic and small business customers rather than big business customers; calls on the Scottish Executive to investigate models of social ownership that would incorporate democratic accountability and a transfer of the burden of charges from domestic to business customers on a sliding scale basis and to initiate a review of the role of the Water Industry Commissioner for Scotland; calls for Scottish Water to be allowed to borrow from the European Investment Bank, and further calls for the debt previously owed by the three water authorities to be written off by Her Majesty's Government, as happened in England and Wales in 1996."
