*S3M-3451 Rob Gibson: Democratic Republic of Congo’s Financial Turmoil—That the Parliament notes the current financial turmoil of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) with particular concern for the $9 billion minerals-for-infrastructure contract with the Chinese Government, which is in limbo due to objections from western donors led by the Paris Club of creditors and the International Monetary Fund (IMF); further notes that the DRC is still being torn apart by a civil war, that has claimed an estimated 3 million lives, and at present endures the highest debt levels in its history; acknowledges the concerns of western donors, the IMF and the Chinese Government as well as the DRC regarding the future of this lucrative investment plan, and finally calls urgently for an amicable agreement to be struck between all the parties involved so that the DRC can move forward and make the desperately needed infrastructure investments that are required to help lift this potentially rich country out of a cycle of despair.
