*S3M-1236 Irene Oldfather: Improving Services and Support for People with Dementia—That the Parliament welcomes the findings of the report, Improving Services and Support for People with Dementia, by the House of Commons’ Committee of Public Accounts; accepts that while the report is focused on the provision of care services in England, many of its findings can be applied to Scotland; agrees with the report that early diagnosis is essential for planning the long-term care needs of dementia patients; expresses concern that only 31% of GPs consider themselves to have received basic training in the diagnosis and management of dementia; acknowledges that the number of dementia patients in Scotland is expected to rise to an estimated 108,000 by 2031; recognises that, in order to respond to this increase, substantial improvements must be made to meet the highest standards of community and health care; notes that the Scottish Government has made dementia a national priority; further notes that, unlike for cancer, there is no lead clinician with responsibility for dementia, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to create a dementia tsar with responsibility for improving dementia services in both the community and care homes and for creating a long-term dementia strategy to meet future challenges.
