 *S2M-2248 Susan Deacon: Scottish Rugby—That the Parliament notes with extreme concern the current situation within Scottish Rugby which has seen the resignation of a number of senior figures within the organisation, including David Mackay as Chairman of the Executive Board and Phil Anderton as Chief Executive, following a no confidence vote in the Chairman by the SRU General Committee; recognises the importance of rugby at both a local and national level as one of Scotland’s major sports; applauds the efforts which had been made by the former Chairman and Chief Executive to take forward a strategy which would secure a sustainable future for rugby in Scotland; believes that it is vital that effective leadership and direction is restored within Scottish Rugby at the earliest possible date, and supports calls for the reinstatement of David Mackay as Chairman of the Executive Board and Phil Anderton as Chief Executive to secure this objective.
