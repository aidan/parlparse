*S2M-2101 Mike Pringle: A Climate of Fear—That the Parliament expresses concern regarding the growing climate of fear in the United Kingdom; notes the inflammatory nature of the media report, "Alert after ‘Arabs’ take photographs of Holyrood"; further notes the detrimental impact that such a climate of fear may have on the Scottish tourist industry, and believes that, while the issue of security is imperative, this must be balanced with respect for civil liberties.
