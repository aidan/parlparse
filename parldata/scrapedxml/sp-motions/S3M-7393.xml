*S3M-7393♦ Jim Hume: Sudden Arrhythmia Death Syndrome (SADS)—That the Parliament recognises the devastating impact that the death of an apparently healthy young person from a previously undiagnosed heart condition can have on the friends and family of the deceased; further recognises that, on average, 12 people in the United Kingdom die each week from a heart condition associated with sudden arrhythmia death syndrome (SADS); understands that this figure is likely to be less than the actual total because of the difficulties that it believes exist in accurately identifying and recording such deaths; congratulates the work of charities such as Cardiac Risk in the Young and the Selkirk-based Scottish HART for highlighting the deaths of young people from SADS and campaigning for greater awareness; welcomes the Cardiac Assessment of Young Athletes programme run by Professor Stewart Hillis, which screens young people involved in amateur sport for potential heart conditions, and wishes to see a greater awareness of deaths in young people from SADS.
