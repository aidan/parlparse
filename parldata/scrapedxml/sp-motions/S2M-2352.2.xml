*S2M-2352.2 Christine Grahame: Charities and Trustee Investment (Scotland) Bill—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2352) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end "but, in so doing, notes the Scottish Executive’s commitment to protect the National Collections’ charitable status but has concerns that Scotland’s colleges may fall foul of section 7(3)(b), and calls for there to be a clear statement on the face of the Bill of the purpose of a charity, namely that only those organisations which have as their overriding purpose the provision of a benefit to the public should qualify for charitable status, and for the Executive to bring forward appropriate amendments at Stage 2 to this effect."
