*S3M-5475 Stuart McMillan: Privatisation of British Waterwaysâ€”That the Parliament notes reports that British Waterways is to be privatised by the UK Government; further notes that British Waterways is a cross-border organisation that through large-scale investment over the last decade has provided improved and increasing opportunities to access the canal infrastructure in Scotland, in particular at Kirkintilloch with the new Southbank Marina, and elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and calls on the UK Government not to sell British Waterways as well as ensuring that a different long-term solution is established for Scotland.
