 *S2M-453 Tommy Sheridan: Number of Deportations by Her Majesty's Government Between 1990 and 2002—That the Parliament notes that the New Labour Government deported 255,413 people between May 1997 and December 2002 while the Tory Government deported 174,967 people between January 1990 and April 1997; further notes that New Labour now deports seven people an hour compared to two deportations an hour in 1990, and believes that this illustrates clearly New Labour’s negative attitude to immigrants seeking to build a new life within the UK.
