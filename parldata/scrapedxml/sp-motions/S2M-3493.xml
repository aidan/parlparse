*S2M-3493u Carolyn Leckie: Pay Up for Equal Pay—That the Parliament condemns the failure of public bodies in Scotland to achieve equal pay; specifically condemns local authorities for dragging their heels for years and making no effort to secure the monies necessary to achieve equal pay for their female workforce; has urgent concerns about Glasgow City Council’s offer to employees which represents thousands of pounds less than women would be confident of achieving through equal pay claims; condemns the council and others for using the threat of cuts in services and redundancies to put pressure on women to concede what is lawfully theirs as right, and believes that the Scottish Executive has failed to deal with this issue which it has been well aware of since its inception and should now intervene, as it is legally obliged to do by equal pay legislation, to secure justice for women employed by local authorities, including making adequate resources available as it is not words that achieve equal pay but deeds and money.
