 * S2M-2672 Dr Jean Turner: Save Stobhill Hospital and Scottish Inpatient Beds—That the Parliament urges NHS Greater Glasgow to retain inpatient beds at Stobhill and to stop bulldozers moving in to Ward 4A after this condemned ward was reopened twice in the last fortnight on humanitarian grounds to move patients from trolleys into beds; considers that this clearly demonstrates that inpatient beds in Stobhill need to be retained in addition to the much desired Ambulatory Care and Diagnostic Unit being built; as a result urges the Scottish Executive not to cut further inpatient beds within the city of Glasgow; considers that to do so is not the way forward for the NHS in Scotland and that an assessment of the bed requirement for the 15% of patients who need inpatient treatment be conducted so that NHS Greater Glasgow and the NHS in Scotland have ample beds to meet patients needs.
