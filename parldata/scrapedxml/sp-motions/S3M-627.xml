*S3M-627 Joe FitzPatrick: European Shark Weekâ€”That the Parliament notes that European Shark Week runs from 8 to 14 October 2007; condemns the practice of shark finning which sees sharks hauled on board ships to have their fins removed before being thrown back into the water, often still alive; notes that, although this practice has been illegal for European fishermen since 2003, the current legislation contains many loopholes and is not being properly enforced or monitored in all EU countries; further notes that many species, such as the hammerhead shark, are now on the endangered list as a result of finning; recognises the vital role that sharks play in the marine ecology, and calls on the European Union to put a stop to this cruel, unnecessary and wasteful practice.
