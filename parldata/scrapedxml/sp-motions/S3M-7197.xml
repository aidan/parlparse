 *S3M-7197 Kenneth Gibson: Pilot Island Fuel Discount Scheme—That the Parliament commends the UK Government for its plans to introduce a pilot island fuel discount scheme; expresses concern at the exclusion of Arran from this scheme, despite petrol costs on the island being among the highest in Scotland; believes this to have been an oversight rather than a deliberate omission, and therefore urges the UK Government to include Arran in the pilot. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Alasdair Allan*, Aileen Campbell*, Stuart McMillan*, Rob Gibson*, Anne McLaughlin*, Robin Harper*, Brian Adam*, Gil Paterson*, Angela Constance*
