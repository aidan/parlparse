*S3M-4885 Karen Whitefield: GTC Scotland Teaching Awards—That the Parliament congratulates Heather Slimmon from Kirk O’Shotts Primary School in Salsburgh on being awarded professional recognition as a sustainable development teacher by the General Teaching Council for Scotland (GTCS); notes that her award is in recognition of her work in supporting the school’s progress toward a second Eco-Schools Green Flag award; further notes that Ms Slimmon has been instrumental in establishing the school’s first eco-committee and encouraging pupils throughout the school, along with teachers, non-teaching staff and parents to become actively involved; considers that there are huge benefits to Kirk O’Shotts Primary of having a teacher gain an enhanced standard of knowledge and skills in this field; notes that, as a result, the school now has a fully operational travel plan, a silver health-promoting establishment award and is currently working toward the gold award; welcomes the increasing emphasis on sustainable development education in Scotland’s schools and commends Ms Slimmon’s work to ensure that sustainable development is firmly embedded in the curriculum at Kirk O’Shotts Primary and in the values and actions of the school and in encouraging pupils, teachers and parents to plan for a better and more sustainable future; commends the hard work, enthusiasm and commitment of all 18 teachers who were recently awarded professional recognition status by GTCS, and looks forward to more teachers across Scotland achieving this valuable award in the future.
