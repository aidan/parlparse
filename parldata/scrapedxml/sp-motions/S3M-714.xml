*S3M-714 Hugh O’Donnell: Reverse Auctions on Social Care—That the Parliament deplores the practice of reverse auctions, whereby a ceiling price is put on a commodity and bidders are invited to tender for goods or services at a lower price; notes that this is being used by some of Scotland’s local authorities, including South Lanarkshire Council, as a method of obtaining services in relation to social and personal care for people requiring such services, and believes that such a methodology is completely inappropriate for securing services directly impacting on vulnerable people in Scotland’s communities, that such tendering methods should not be used and that it is morally repugnant for such a system to be used for the provision of social care services in Scotland.
