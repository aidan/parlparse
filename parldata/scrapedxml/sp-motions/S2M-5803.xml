*S2M-5803 Tommy Sheridan: Ending Tax Breaks for Ministers—That the Parliament condemns the existence of a tax break which allows Scottish Executive and Westminster ministers to not pay tax on the provision of government cars; notes that all other taxpayers, including MSPs and MPs, have to pay substantial sums in tax, and calls for the Scottish Executive to demand that Her Majesty’s Government ends this unjustifiable tax perk.
