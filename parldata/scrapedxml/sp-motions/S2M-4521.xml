*S2M-4521 Jackie Baillie: Ofcom Consultation on Junk Food Advertising—That the Parliament is very concerned that almost one fifth of boys and 14% of girls aged 2 to 15 in Scotland are obese; recognises that childhood obesity is a public health time bomb which needs to be tackled urgently and that poor diet is a key contributory factor; notes that TV advertising is the primary way in which junk foods are marketed to children; recognises that a wide range of health and consumer groups, including the British Heart Foundation Scotland, Sustain, Which? and many others, have called for children to be protected from junk food television adverts before the 9 pm watershed; notes with disappointment that the recent Ofcom consultation on restricting food advertising to children rules out protecting children from junk food television adverts before the 9 pm watershed as "disproportionate"; calls on Ofcom to attach greater weight to the health and well-being of young people than it does to the interests of the advertising and food industries, and urges Ofcom to give the option of ending junk food TV adverts before the 9 pm watershed equal consideration in its consultation as its other, weaker, options.
