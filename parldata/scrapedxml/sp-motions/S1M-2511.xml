*S1M-2511 Michael Russell: Head of Communications at North Ayrshire Council—That the Parliament congratulates North Ayrshire Council on appointing Mr Gerry O’ Brien as its new head of Communications; notes Mr O’ Brien’s previous posts with the Conservative Party and the Conservative Group in the Scottish Parliament; expects that Mr O’ Brien will have few ideological problems in helping to implement new Labour policies in North Ayrshire as they are mostly identical to failed Tory policies, and hopes that Mr O’ Brien’s efforts are rewarded with the same success as the Tories in recent years, who have all but disappeared from the electoral map in most of Scotland.
