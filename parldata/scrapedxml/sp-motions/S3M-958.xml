*S3M-958 Brian Adam: Neurosurgergy Needs Assessment—That the Parliament recognises the public opposition to centralising neurosurgery services and expresses its support for keeping the existing four neurological specialist centres; congratulates the organisers of the 25,000 signature petition to the Parliament, and recognises the prime importance of patient care in this issue and the inadequacies in coverage that one centralised unit would bring, also noting the lack of particular financial benefit of such a scheme as confirmed in the draft report on the national needs assessment for neurosurgery services.
