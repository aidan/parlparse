 *S3M-6423 Liam McArthur: Garden Furniture Orkney—That the Parliament notes that Garden Furniture Orkney was commended by the judging panel of the first National Scottish Community Service Awards, being one of the 12 shortlisted projects from 88 entries; further notes that the project, devised and run by Lindsay Hall, the Orkney Islands Council’s community service supervisor, builds garden furniture from unwanted waste wood; commends the project for recycling 90% of the wood that it sources to create picnic tables and benches, which are given to charitable groups for their own use or to sell to generate much needed funds, and congratulates Lindsay Hall and Orkney Islands Council for this well deserved recognition of this excellent project.
