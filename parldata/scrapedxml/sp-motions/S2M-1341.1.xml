 *S2M-1341.1 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Major Events and Festivals in Scotland-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1341) in the name of Mr Frank McAveety, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the success of the festivals and events throughout Scotland over many years, created and contributed to by a variety of organisations, whether central or local government, national or area tourist boards or private or public bodies; notes that the impediment to further success has been a shortage of funds and that the creation of an additional and unnecessary tier of bureaucracy is not the solution, and calls for the abolition of EventScotland and the creation of an event fund for appropriate organisations and bodies to access in order to continue and build upon the success to date."
