*S3M-3437 Jackie Baillie: Build Dumbarton Academy Now—That the Parliament urges West Dunbartonshire Council to commit to funding a new-build Dumbarton Academy at its budget-setting meeting on 12 February 2009; considers that the building is in an appalling state with substantial repairs required to bring the school up to minimum standards; understands that this is of concern to pupils, parents and teachers alike; believes that the pupils are restricted in their learning opportunities due to the condition of the learning environment; further believes that West Dunbartonshire Council has the resources to fund the project, and therefore strongly urges the council to build a new Dumbarton Academy without further delay.
