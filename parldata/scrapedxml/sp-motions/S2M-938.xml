 *S2M-938# Mr Duncan McNeil: Baywatch-That the Parliament notes with dismay figures published by the Baywatch campaign group that show that over 20% of disabled parking bays in supermarket car parks are being used by non-disabled drivers; acknowledges the frustration of disabled drivers when the store management appears reluctant to enforce its own parking policy; appreciates that, for their part, some store managers are not clear about their powers to compel drivers to move from specially designated bays; notes that this situation leaves supermarkets vulnerable to future legal action under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 (as amended), and considers that, if a satisfactory solution cannot be found, the possibility of giving local authorities the appropriate enforcement powers should be examined.
