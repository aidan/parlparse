 *S2M-1227 Christine Grahame: Unseen-That the Parliament notes the report by the Royal National Institute of the Blind (RNIB), Unseen - Neglect, isolation and household poverty amongst older people with sight loss, of March 2004; notes that nine out of 10 blind and partially-sighted people are aged 60 and over and that the recurring theme in the survey is that people in older age groups were poorer and less likely to have received services designed to help them live independently and safely and, in particular, that in the area of support and care only 48% have received a home assessment, only 32% were aware of mobility training and only 46% of the social services rehabilitation service; notes that only 37% had been offered a cooker sticker and 47% a liquid level indicator; notes that 74% have an income below £195 per week with only 20% aware of extra expenses available for sight loss, and therefore supports the RNIB's recommendations that every person with sight loss is offered an assessment of needs, suitable services and suitable tools so that they can live independently and with dignity, that attendance allowance should be automatically available to all registered blind and partially-sighted people and that Her Majesty's Government should issue benefit take-up targets and fund advocacy for take-up projects as part of a drive to ensure that benefits reach all entitled to them.
