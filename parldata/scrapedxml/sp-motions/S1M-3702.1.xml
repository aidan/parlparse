 *S1M-3702.1 Alex Fergusson: Approval of SSI—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3702) in the name of Patricia Ferguson, insert at end "but, in doing so, notes amendments S1M-3621.1 and S1M-3621.2 which were approved by the Rural Development Committee on 10 December 2002 and therefore regrets the exclusion from the boundaries of the Cairngorms National Park of those areas of Highland Perthshire and Drumochter, including the forest of Atholl, Beinn a ‘Ghlo and Blair Atholl, all of which were recommended for inclusion within the park’s boundary by Scottish Natural Heritage in its report, prepared for the Scottish Executive, on the proposal for a National Park in the Cairngorms, and is concerned that, if these areas remain excluded, the attainment by the park of World Heritage Status may be put in jeopardy, and further regrets that the Order does not include the Gaelic translation of Cairngorms National Park which is Pàirc Nàiseanta a’ Chàirn Ghuirm." Supported by: Fergus Ewing*
