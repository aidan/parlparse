*S2M-2372# Roseanna Cunningham: G8 Summit—That the Parliament recognises that the G8 Summit being held in Gleneagles, Perthshire, from 6 to 8 July 2005, offers an opportunity for Scotland to debate issues related to international aid, trade justice and debt relief; acknowledges that there will be inconvenience and disruption to many communities as a result of hosting this summit, and is of the view that such disruption can only be justified if the representatives of those countries with the greatest economic power arrive at decisions which will allow countries in the developing world to grow and prosper, at their own pace and in their own way, by the provision of appropriately-targeted aid, debt relief and a just framework of trade rules. Supported by: Linda Fabiani*, Rob Gibson*
