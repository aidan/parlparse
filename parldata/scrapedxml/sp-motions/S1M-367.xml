*S1M-367 Fergus Ewing: Jobs Crisis in the Highlands and Islands—That the Parliament expresses grave concern at the loss of over 3000 jobs at the Barmac yards in Ardersier and Nigg and at the threat to a further 400 jobs at the Lewis Offshore fabrication yard at Stornaway, and notes that this job crisis may according to Highlands and Islands Enterprise cost the economy of the Highlands and Islands £74 million per annum; welcomes assurance given by the Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning to a meeting of Highlands and Islands MSPs on 1 December 1999 that all necessary resources will be made available to Highlands and Islands Enterprise and to local councils to combat this crisis; believes that the estimated £20 billion revenue to the London Exchequer from oil and gas over the next five years is in substantial part attributable to the skills of a dedicated workforce at such yards and that they and their communities deserve a re-investment to secure the Highlands and Islands economy; demands that the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament review the taxation system which has caused uncertainty for present and future investment; notes the importance of the Highlands and Islands Convention as a genuine forum to reach positive recommendations and calls for its immediate re-establishment, and believes that the Highlands and Islands requires nothing less than a comprehensive jobs regeneration plan.
