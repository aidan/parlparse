 *S1M-2579# Mr Jamie Stone: Non-Trunk Roads-That the Parliament notes that the first serious winter weather has resulted in non-trunk roads in the Highlands being in an extremely dangerous condition; recognises that this has come about as a result of the Highland Council downsizing its winter roads maintenance service as a result of the trunk roads maintenance contract being awarded to BEAR Scotland Ltd, and accordingly considers that the Scottish Executive should undertake an urgent review of all roads maintenance in the Highland Council area in order to avoid any future repetition of the recent dangerous problems.
