*S3M-1864 Elaine Smith: Keep INTO Out—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed introduction of private company, INTO, to deliver core education provision at Glasgow Caledonian University; considers that privatisation of this provision would undoubtedly be detrimental to the quality of service delivery as it is unlikely to be of the same quality as mainstream provision; acknowledges the impact on terms and conditions of staff employed by private companies like INTO which is likely to reduce their morale and ultimately impact on the quality of the learning experience of students; notes that Glasgow Caledonian University is a publicly funded institution and is therefore accountable for how it uses its public funds; recognises the obligation of Scottish universities to remain active in the recruitment of international students unable to access appropriate education in their native countries and therefore accepts the need to provide a consistently superior service that is not subject to market demands; notes that education is far too important to be trusted to market forces, and believes that the introduction of the private sector in such a sensitive area of educational provision is clearly dangerous and must be resisted. Supported by: Helen Eadie*, John Wilson*
