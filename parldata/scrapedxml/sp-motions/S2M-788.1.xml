*S2M-788.1 Chris Ballance: Energy Bill - UK Legislation—As an amendment to motion (S2M-788) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out "agrees" and insert "believes that the Energy Bill as proposed will disadvantage the Scottish renewables industry, endanger the Scottish Executive’s targets for renewable energy development, establish a UK Nuclear Decommissioning Agency for the management and handling of radioactive waste with no environmental objectives and maintain the current lack of Executive powers over stored radioactive waste; considers that these issues of concern could be resolved through consultation with Her Majesty’s Government to the satisfaction of this Parliament, and therefore until those issues have been resolved does not agree."
