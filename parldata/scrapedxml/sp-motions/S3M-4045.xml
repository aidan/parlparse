 *S3M-4045 Rob Gibson: Salute Eigg—That the Parliament congratulates the people of Eigg on holding the first Eigg Giant’s Footstep Family Festival on 2 and 3 May 2009, which will focus on the island’s renewable electricity scheme that powers most of the island’s homes and businesses; notes that the festival will include talks, workshops, music and theatre as well as a host of experts to provide advice and answer questions on what individuals and communities can do to tackle climate change; recognises the gigantic strides that the islanders of Eigg have made and are continuing to make since taking control of their island in 1997, and wishes every success to the island’s bid, as Scotland’s only finalist, to win the UK-wide NESTA Big Green Challenge competition.
