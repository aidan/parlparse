 *S2M-1069# Ms Sandra White: Life Expectancy in Glasgow-That the Parliament notes with concern the recent life expectancy figures released by NHS Health Scotland; believes that these figures highlight a massive divide between the east and west and the more and less affluent areas of Scotland; notes that life expectancy in Glasgow Shettleston constituency is the lowest in Scotland at 63.9 years and that this is almost 15 years less than some parts of the country and on a par with many developing countries; believes that there should be a national debate on poverty and the links between ill-health and low life expectancy, and further believes that the Scottish Executive should make a ministerial statement about how it will address this problem.
