 *S2M-4537&lt;&gt; Jackie Baillie: Learning Disability Week 2006—That the Parliament congratulates ENABLE Scotland on commissioning research undertaken by the Scottish Consortium for Learning Disability; notes that the research on the impact of "The same as you?", the Scottish Executive’s seminal policy framework on services for the people with learning disabilities and family carers, has been published to mark Learning Disability Week which takes place between 18 and 25 June 2006; believes that it demonstrates the tremendous difference made to the lives of people with learning disabilities by the implementation of "The same as you?" including new services, such as local area co-ordinators in West Dunbartonshire; considers that there has been a qualitative transformation in the lives of many people with learning disabilities; acknowledges that the survey recognises the positive impact that "The same as you?" has made on those who have benefited from it; notes that not all people have seen positive changes in their lives; considers that the policy needs to be driven at a local and national level, and encourages the Scottish Executive to ensure that all children and adults with learning disabilities in Scotland can benefit.
