*S2M-5409 Donald Gorrie: Scots Language Dictionaries—That the Parliament recognises the long history of Scots language dictionaries, from Jamieson’s in 1808 to the 10-volume Scottish National Dictionary completed in 1976, the Dictionary of the Older Scots Tongue completed in 12 volumes in 2002 and the online Dictionary of the Scots Language in 2004, which together put Scotland at the forefront of producers of dictionaries of minority languages; also welcomes the work being done on Faclair na Gàidhlig, and, in order to safeguard the future of these long-term dictionary projects, urges the Scottish Executive and other government, commercial and charitable organisations to co-operate in providing the requisite funds for continuing work on them.
