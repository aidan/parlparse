*S3M-617 Jim Hume: Early Payments for Less Favoured Areas Support Scheme and the Beef Calf Support Scheme—That the Parliament recognises the significant benefit to those in the agriculture sector in having access to the Less Favoured Areas Support Scheme (LFASS) and Beef Calf Support Scheme (BCSS); further recognises the recent difficulties experienced by the sector, and considers that the Scottish Government, in supporting a viable and sustainable agriculture industry, should bring forward LFASS and BCSS payments to relieve the unprecedented pressure on the sector created by the damaging effects of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak and the recent dramatic hike in feed prices.
