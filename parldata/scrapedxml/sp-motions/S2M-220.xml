*S2M-220 Jackie Baillie: Children's Hospice at Balloch—That the Parliament welcomes the commencement of construction work on Scotland's second children's hospice at Balloch; recognises the considerable work of the Children's Hospice Association Scotland (CHAS) in providing a caring and supportive environment for terminally-ill children and their families; applauds the tremendous effort of volunteers in Dunbartonshire and throughout Scotland who have worked so hard to raise funds; notes that £7 million of the £10 million required to build, equip and maintain the new hospice at Balloch has been raised; further notes that an additional £3 million is needed to ensure that CHAS has sufficient reserves to underpin the cost of running Robin House, and recognises that, with continued voluntary effort and the generosity shown by many people, this target will be achieved by the completion date for the building of Robin House Children's Hospice in August 2004.
