*S2M-5556 Jackie Baillie: If it is "Scotch" it must be Scottish—That the Parliament welcomes the recent vote by an influential group of Members of the European Parliament, on the Committee for Environment, Public Health and Food Safety, to support proposals that will ensure stronger legal protection for Scotch whisky at a European Union level; applauds the Scotch Whisky Association’s efforts to improve this area of law; further welcomes the news that this will better protect traditional practices within the whisky industry and improve the international protection of "Scotch Whisky" as a geographical indication; believes that this is crucial to allowing the whisky industry to tackle unfair and misleading practices overseas, and encourages the Scottish Executive to play its part in making certain that to be "Scotch" it must be Scottish.
