 *S3M-7507.1 Patrick Harvie: Silently Stressed, NUS Scotland’s Research on Student Stress—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7507) in the name of Robert Brown, insert at end "considers that the UK Government’s proposal to burden students with up to an estimated £50,000 debt by the end of their courses will only add to the stress that students experience and will harm their mental health as well as limiting their career choices and undermining the position of higher education in society, and urges the Scottish Government to reject any similar proposals in Scotland and instead to commit to the state’s continued role in funding higher education in Scotland."
