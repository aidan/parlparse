 *S3M-625 Kenneth Gibson: Class Sizes—That the Parliament commends the Scottish Government for its commitment to reducing class sizes to 18 in primary 1 to primary 3; notes that there are cost implications in delivering this policy not only in terms of additional staff but, in circumstances where popular schools are full to capacity, also in the need for building modifications; is aware that, while teachers strive for smaller classes, ensuring that one’s children access the school of their choice is often a parent’s first consideration; recognises that in some open-plan classrooms up to 66 children are in a class served by two teachers; believes that building constraints can be overcome and children’s educational experience greatly enhanced by considering the employment of two teachers in a class of 33 (36 if there is space), rather than a teacher and an occasional classroom assistant, and is also of the view that raising the starting age for primary school, in line with standard practice in Germany, Scandinavia and elsewhere, would not only be sound education policy, but would also allow for smaller class sizes and should be explored by the Scottish Government.
