 *S2M-4856 Tommy Sheridan: Scotland’s Homelessness Disgrace—That the Parliament notes with concern the publication of the latest homelessness figures which show that applications under homeless persons legislation have risen to 59,970 applications to local authorities in 2005-06, an increase of 2,516 on 2004-05; also notes that a higher proportions of households from the most deprived neighbourhoods and from the Black, Black Scottish or Black British ethnic group applied for assistance compared with other groups; further notes that the number assessed as homeless in 2005-06 has remained at over 40,000 and the number assessed as homeless and in priority need has remained at over 30,000; recognises that these figures are a direct result of the failed housing policies of the Scottish Executive, taking social housing out of local government control, and the failure to invest in socially affordable housing to address the needs of Scotland’s communities while public money is spent on the privatisation of public services and wars of oppression which many consider to be illegal, and calls on the Executive to invest in a major programme of socially affordable house building as a matter of urgency.
