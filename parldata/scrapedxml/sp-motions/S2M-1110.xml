*S2M-1110# Frances Curran: President of COSLA Should Resign-That the Parliament has no confidence in the president of COSLA, Pat Watters, and considers that his refusal to negotiate a national pay and careers structure with the nursery nurses' union UNISON has provoked a national strike, now in its fourth week; believes that, as the leader of local authorities in Scotland who deliver the age three to five curriculum, Mr Watters has responsibility for ensuring excellent standards in our pre-five sector for both children and staff, and believes that Mr Watters has failed in this responsibility and should tender his resignation.
