*S2M-3818 Tommy Sheridan: End Illegal Blockade of Cuba—That the Parliament notes the UN General Assembly vote of 182 to 4 to demand that the United States of America ends “as soon as possible” its 45-year-old economic and commercial embargo against Cuba taken last month; further notes that last month’s vote at the UN General Assembly was the 14th successive year that the vast majority of the world’s nations have voted to condemn and demand an end to the USA’s illegal economic and commercial blockade of the Socialist Republic of Cuba; regrets that the USA, Israel, Palau and the Marshall Islands voted against the resolution and Micronesia abstained but believes that these countries are completely out of step with the majority of the world who believe that the USA’s continued blockade is legally, morally, politically and ethically unacceptable, and resolves to write to the US Embassy in Edinburgh and in London to demand that the USA adhere to the overwhelming will of the United Nations and respects resolutions passed by the United Nations in the same way as it expects other countries to do.
