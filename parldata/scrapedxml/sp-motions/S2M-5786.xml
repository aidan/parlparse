*S2M-5786 Shiona Baird: Changing the Energy Climate—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Scottish Renewables Forum’s latest manifesto, Changing the Energy Climate, and supports in particular the following five key action points: to create a vision for the Scottish people and industry to understand our future in a carbon marketplace and the opportunities and challenges arising from this; to establish clean energy targets with strategies for delivery, including a renewable electricity target of at least 50% of demand and a 10% green heat target by the end of 2020; to ensure timely decisions on environmentally acceptable renewable energy planning applications; to establish long-term revenue stability mechanisms for emerging technologies, heat and microgeneration, and to ensure that investment in environmentally acceptable grid infrastructure and distribution networks is agreed quickly and delivered on time.
