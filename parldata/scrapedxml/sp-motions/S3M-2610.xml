*S3M-2610 Jack McConnell: Congratulations to Action for Children—That the Parliament notes the launch of Action for Children and Action for Children in Scotland, formerly NCH and NCH Scotland; notes the publication of As long as it takes: a new politics for children to coincide with the launch; congratulates NCH and its predecessor organisations for all their work on behalf of children since 1869; welcomes Action for Children’s commitment to building on all of that work, and wishes it well as it continues its work for children and young people for as long as it takes.
