*S3M-6448 Joe FitzPatrick: Freedom Flotilla—That the Parliament condemns the actions of the Israeli Government that, in what is considered to be in violation of international law, ordered the boarding of the freedom flotilla in international waters leading to the deaths of at least nine human rights activists; notes that among the 600 passengers detained is Dundee man Ali El-Awaisi, who was delivering humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza that included 13 pallets full of medicine, clothes, toys and building materials, worth around £30,000, donated by the people of Dundee; welcomes the donations given by the Fire Brigade Union, Tayside for Justice in Palestine, Friends of Al-Aqsa, Yusuf Youth Initiative and all the mosques in Tayside and all others who contributed, and calls for the immediate release of Ali El-Awaisi and all members of the freedom flotilla and an end to the blockade of Gaza.
