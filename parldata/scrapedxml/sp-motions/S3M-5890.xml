*S3M-5890 Marilyn Livingstone: Cuts to Fife’s Extra-curricular Music Service—That the Parliament regrets the decision by Fife Council to implement education cuts that will see the extra-curricular music service’s core budget cut by 50% over the next few years; notes that the cuts could result in 17 staff members losing their jobs in each of the next three years; expresses concern at the reduced opportunities for young people in Fife to learn to play a musical instrument and the building of confidence and skills that this brings; considers that the cuts will be detrimental to the culture of musical excellence in Fife, local music groups such as Fife Youth Orchestra and events such as the Fife Festival of Music, which attracts thousands of people each year, and considers the decision to be inconsistent with the Celebrating Fife in 2010 initiative through which £2 million has been invested in culture.
