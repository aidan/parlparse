*S3M-1659 George Foulkes: Look OK...Feel Crap?—That the Parliament supports the Look OK…Feel Crap? campaign piloted across the Lothians in order to reverse the suicide rate among young adults in that region; recognises that the campaign’s website www.lookokfeelcrap.org has helped thousands of young people to deal with depression which is often an underground and life-threatening illness by giving ongoing support and information provision, and believes that the 47% increase in inquiries from clients and carers is an illustration that this campaign is saving lives.
