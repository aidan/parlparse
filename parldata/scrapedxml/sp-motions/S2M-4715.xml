 *S2M-4715 Irene Oldfather: Graeme Obree - The Flying Scotsman—That the Parliament recognises the contribution of Graeme Obree, double world champion cyclist, to placing Scotland on the world cycling map; notes Graeme’s courage in writing and speaking about sensitive issues of bullying and mental illness; welcomes the release of "The Flying Scotsman", a film based on the book by Graeme Obree; applauds the Edinburgh International Film Festival Committee’s decision to open the 60th festival with the UK premier of the film on Monday 14 August 2006; notes that the film depicts the true-life career highlights and personal achievements of Graeme Obree who, among many other achievements, won the one-hour world cycling championship in 1993 on a bicycle which he designed and constructed himself in a bike shop in Irvine, Ayrshire; commends the sensitive way in which the director of the film, Douglas MacKinnon, portrays the personal hurdles of bullying and depression which Graeme overcame to allow him to pursue his sporting dream and believes that this will set a positive example for Scottish young people; recognises the collective efforts of EventScotland, the Scottish Executive and Scottish Screen in promoting the film; welcomes the Executive’s support of the film industry in Scotland and, in particular, the recent announcement that Scottish Screen has awarded an additional £150,000 to the Edinburgh Film Festival this year, attracting a further £100,000 match funding from Edinburgh City Council and the UK Film Council; believes that Graeme’s achievements and "The Flying Scotsman" will successfully assist in promoting Scotland abroad, and congratulates everyone involved in the project.
