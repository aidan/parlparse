*S3M-2798 Mike Pringle: Post Office Closures in Edinburgh—That the Parliament is deeply disappointed at Post Office Ltd’s decision to close 11 Post Office branches in Edinburgh as part of the UK Government’s Post Office Network Change Programme, which is set to close 2,500 post offices across the United Kingdom; is concerned at the damage that the closures will do to communities in Edinburgh that rely on their local post office; recognises the problems that the closures will cause for elderly residents and those with mobility problems, who could now face a daunting journey to their nearest post office; regrets that once Post Office Ltd has decided on closing a post office branch only Postwatch, now part of Consumer Focus, can review the decision before it is announced, following which there is no appeal process, and notes the questions that this raises as to the credibility of the branch closure consultation process.
