*S2M-5303.3 Mr Mark Ruskell: Fisheries—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5303) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end "and affirms that this outcome can best be achieved by shifting to long-term ecosystem-based management plans aimed towards achieving maximum sustainable yield, by making use of bycatch quotas and more technical measures in order to reduce discards and mortality in fisheries with high bycatch levels, by making innovative use of the European Fisheries Fund to support fishermen and associated communities and by supporting bottom-up approaches including the use of regional advisory councils, and urges the Executive to ensure that Scottish fishermen’s adaptability and sacrifices are not undermined by short-term pressures."
