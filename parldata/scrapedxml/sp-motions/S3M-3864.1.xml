 *S3M-3864.1 Bob Doris: A Step Closer to Maryhill and Possilpark’s Town Centre Regeneration—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3864) in the name of Patricia Ferguson, leave out from "and looks" to end and insert "; considers that the £60 million fund was put at risk by Labour initially voting against the Scottish budget and welcomes the fact that there is now cross-party consensus to see town centres across Scotland, both urban and rural, receive additional help from the Scottish Government, and looks to the Scottish Government to assist partners in all such communities to access these funds."
