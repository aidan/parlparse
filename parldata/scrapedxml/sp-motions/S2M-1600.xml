*S2M-1600 Shiona Baird: Support for Marine Renewables—That the Parliament welcomes Her Majesty’s Government announcement that it will provide £50 million to the marine energy industry and welcomes the Scottish Executive document Harnessing Scotland’s Marine Energy Potential that indicates the potential for 7,000 green jobs to be created in this sector; notes that the Portuguese have committed three times this level of investment, installed grid connection infrastructure and indicated a strong interest in purchasing six wave energy converters; urges the Executive and Her Majesty’s Government to ensure that the 7,000 jobs are not lost by a failure to provide the kind of investment in development and infrastructure needed to be a world leader in this technology, and calls on the Executive to put in place the necessary investment and policy, planning and fiscal framework that will ensure that the world’s first wave-powered farm, designed and built in Scotland, is located in Scotland.
