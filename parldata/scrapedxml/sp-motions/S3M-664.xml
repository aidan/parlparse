*S3M-664 George Foulkes: Equal Means Equal—That the Parliament believes that, on the very few occasions where men are paid less than women doing the equivalent job, men should be paid the same, equal wage; believes that the City of Edinburgh Council should abide by the spirit of the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 and ensure that equal pay means equal, regardless of gender; condemns the SNP/Liberal Democrat-led administration for exploiting a legal loophole which discriminates against low-waged men just to save money, and encourages the City of Edinburgh Council to rethink its decision to exclude men from the equal pay settlements that Edinburgh council workers rightly deserve. Supported by: Elaine Murray*, David Whitton*, James Kelly* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
