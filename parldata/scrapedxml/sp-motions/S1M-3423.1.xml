 *S1M-3423.1 Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh: Race Equality-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3423) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "and welcomes" to end and insert "but, whilst welcoming the anti-racism and race equality work being done by the Executive and other national and local bodies, hopes that the new race awareness campaign will not be yet another tokenistic imposition from the centre, and realises that real and lasting reform must start by giving ethnic minorities the freedom of choice to pursue their own chosen avenues."
