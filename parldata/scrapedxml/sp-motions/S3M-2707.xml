*S3M-2707 Ken Macintosh: Funding for Gaelic Medium Schools—That the Parliament welcomes the continuation of support for Gaelic medium education, building on the work of the previous administration in securing the status of the Gaelic language and in funding the expansion of learning and teaching through the medium of Gaelic; believes that support for Gaelic medium education is the key to ensuring the survival of the language; recognises the campaigning efforts of parents across the country and the desire of those in Edinburgh, Fort William, Portree, Barra and elsewhere for stand-alone Gaelic medium schools to expand on the success of the existing Gaelic medium units; welcomes any additional capital funding to help build or refurbish these new schools but believes that recent announcements are insufficient and that the Scottish Government should match the example of the previous administration in the £3.5 million of support given to Glasgow to establish an all Gaelic school, and believes that any funding commitment should last longer than just two or three years if it is to help secure the long-term future of the Gaelic language.
