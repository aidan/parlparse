 *S3M-7396 Elaine Smith: No Compulsory Redundancies and No Scottish Public Sector Pay Freeze—That the Parliament commends the Public and Commercial Services Union’s (PCS) response to the UK Government’s Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR); believes that the CSR represents a draconian attack on public services, public service workers and the most vulnerable people in our society; notes that the union’s alternative case against cuts in public spending includes investment in public services for economic growth and the collection of £120 billion lost annually through uncollected, avoided and evaded tax; believes that there is a Scottish public sector alternative to mass job cuts and a pay freeze; understands that such an alternative could incorporate an end to the costly use of consultants and contractors and an effective use of the Scottish Parliament’s tax-raising powers to encourage economic growth alongside a policy of pay coherence across the Scottish public sector to replace the 43 individual pay-bargaining units; notes that a drop-in briefing and lobby is scheduled to take place in the Scottish Parliament on 18 November 2010, and encourages as many MSPs as possible to attend.
