*S3M-613 Tavish Scott: Lerwick - 2007 Fishing Port of the Year—That the Parliament notes that Lerwick Port Authority has won the 2007 Fishing Port of the Year award in the face of competition from the other finalists, Newlyn Pier and Harbour Commissioners, Peterhead Port Authority and Plymouth Sutton Harbour Fisheries; further notes that Lerwick’s success is well-deserved, given the excellent facilities it provides for both the white fish and the pelagic fishing fleets, in recent years leading the way in the introduction of a modern temperature-controlled fish market, an electronic fish auction and deep water berths to match the growing needs of the fishing fleet; believes that the success is the result of the hard work and vision, over many years, of the port authority’s staff and board members and of the many Lerwick businesses that support the fishing industry, and congratulates them on their well-deserved success.
