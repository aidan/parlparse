*S1M-2325 Tommy Sheridan: Liquid-based Cytology/Human Papilloma Virus Test-That the Parliament believes that the liquid-based cytology/human papilloma virus test should be available to all women across Scotland on the NHS free of charge to increase cervical cancer detection rates, given (a) the fact that it has a higher accuracy rate than screening by the cervical smear test and (b) the potential it has for detecting the disease in 40% of women who go on to develop this type of cancer, for reducing spending on treating cervical cancer by 23% and for reducing the need for examinations by specialists by 70%, and calls on the Scottish Executive to reinstate funding for the pilot projects at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary, Monklands, Ninewells and Raigmore hospitals.
