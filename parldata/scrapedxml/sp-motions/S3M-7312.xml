 *S3M-7312 Anne McLaughlin: In Memory of Zouhair Baya and Ibrahim Benothman—That the Parliament welcomes Jamal Baya to Scotland on his trip to visit the grave of his brother; notes that Mr Baya is the brother of Zouhair Baya, a Tunisian who stowed away, along with Ibrahim Benothman, aboard the cargo ship, the Pascal, which was carrying a cargo of phosphates from Sfax in Tunisia to Scotland; understands that both young men were found dead when the ship docked in Ayr harbour in 2008; expresses its sympathy to Mr Baya and his family; recalls that the Muslim community in Glasgow organised a burial for Zouhair and Ibrahim at Cathcart cemetery and that only after the men were buried were they identified following what it considers the laudable determination of various people across Scotland to do so; thanks the Muslim community in Glasgow and Edinburgh for helping to both identify Zouhair and organise his brother’s visit; thanks also the Port Authority in Ayr, the Scots-Tunisian community and others, and hopes that the visit will be of benefit to Jamal Baya and his family, helping them to come to terms with this family tragedy.‪‪
