 S3M-4670 Jamie Hepburn: Reviving Scotland’s Town Centres—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that £40 million has been assigned to 48 towns across Scotland as part of the Scottish Government’s Town Centre Regeneration Fund; notes that this funding will revitalise town centres across central Scotland, with £2.7 million having been allocated to North Lanarkshire Council for projects in Airdrie, Bellshill, Coatbridge, Cumbernauld, Kilsyth, Motherwell, Wishaw and, as part of the £2 million grant allocated to Falkirk Council, Bo’ness, Stenhousemuir and Grangemouth; welcomes further bids for the second tranche of funds, amounting to £20 million, to be allocated later this year, and believes that, in the current economic climate, these funds will facilitate vital improvements for Scotland’s town centres by improving community amenities, supporting local economies and sustaining and creating jobs. Supported by: Bill Kidd, Michael Matheson, Kenneth Gibson, Bob Doris*, Gil Paterson*
