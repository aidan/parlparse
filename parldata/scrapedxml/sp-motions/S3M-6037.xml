 *S3M-6037 Sarah Boyack: Passport Project Recognised with Kids Count Award—That the Parliament congratulates Access to Industry’s Passport Project on being awarded a special Director’s Award at the Kids Count Inspiration Awards; notes that the awards recognise individuals and organisations that have been responsible for inspiring young people in their communities through practical initiatives that make a positive difference to young people’s lives and afford them greater freedom to determine their own futures; further notes that the award recognises and reflects the motivation and hard work of the young people with whom the project works who sometimes find themselves in difficult circumstances that are beyond their control; further notes that the Passport employability programme supports young people moving on from care and prison backgrounds to overcome barriers back into employment and education by focussing the project on innovation, creativity, commitment and passion to ensure a structured, quality one-to-one service for young people; welcomes Access to Industry’s approach to working with Edinburgh-based colleges and other organisations such as John Lewis and Royal Mail to provide learning opportunities and work placements for young people; further notes that, between January 2007 and February 2010, Passport has worked with a total of 473 young people, with 240 gaining SQA qualifications, 47 securing employment, 78 moving on to college and a further 97 moving on to training programmes, and wishes the project and the young people who use it continued success into the future.
