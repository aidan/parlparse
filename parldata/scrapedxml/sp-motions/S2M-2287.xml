 * S2M-2287# Margaret Smith:Shared Equity—That the Parliament commends Communities Scotland and the City of Edinburgh Council for the efforts they are making to deal with the problems of lack of affordable housing in Edinburgh, particularly for first time buyers, essential public sector workers and those on low incomes; welcomes the Scottish Executive’s discussion paper on shared equity, published in November 2004; considers that the Executive should implement shared equity pilot schemes as a matter of urgency, noting that such schemes may represent a solution for owners in Pennywell faced with the demolition of their homes as part of the council’s PPP 2 proposals for Craigroyston High School, and believes that the Executive should act immediately to review home loss payments paid under the Land Compensation (Scotland) Act 1973 with a view to at least bringing them into line with minimum and maximum amounts paid in England.
