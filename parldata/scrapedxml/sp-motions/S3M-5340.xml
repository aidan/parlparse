 *S3M-5340 Robert Brown: International Day for the Abolition of Slavery—That the Parliament recognises the International Day for the Abolition of Slavery on 2 December 2009, which recalls the date of the adoption in 1949 by the United Nations General Assembly of the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others; notes with sadness that, on the 60th anniversary of the convention, women and children are still being trafficked for commercial sexual exploitation across the world; welcomes the ratification by the United Kingdom of the Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking in Human Beings but regrets that there is still only limited involvement of key voluntary sector agencies in identification and support of such women; further notes the potential conflict between the UK Border Agency asylum processes and the 45-day reflection period, and urges the Scottish Government to work with all relevant agencies to identify, support and safeguard those who are trafficked into Scotland for commercial sexual exploitation, particularly given the potential increase in demand for prostitution that could occur in the lead-up to the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow.
