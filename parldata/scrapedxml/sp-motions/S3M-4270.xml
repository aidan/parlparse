*S3M-4270 Ross Finnie: Hewlett Packard to Reconsider Erskine Relocations—That the Parliament expresses grave concern over the decision by Hewlett Packard to relocate 843 employees from its Erskine site to the Czech Republic during 2010; notes that Hewlett Packard has already cut 150 jobs in February 2009, meaning that current relocations raise possible job losses on the site to nearly 1,000, and calls on Hewlett Packard to reconsider this short-term decision made in the midst of economic recession and retain its core facility and employees at Erskine.
