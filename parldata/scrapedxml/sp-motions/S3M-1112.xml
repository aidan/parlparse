*S3M-1112# Alasdair Allan: Development of the Gaelic Language—That the Parliament commends Comhairle nan Eilean Siar (Western Isles Council) and Comhairle na Gaidhealtachd (Highland Council) for the recent publication of their Gaelic plans; notes the important work done by the community and by many agencies and bodies in Scotland to maintain and develop the Gaelic language; welcomes the work done by both the previous Scottish Executive and current Scottish Government in this regard, particularly the Gaelic language plan and the Government’s programme for Gaelic; recognises that the coming few years will decide whether or not Gaelic is to survive as a community language, and therefore recognises that a sense of urgency in this area of policy is essential to ensuring that the number of speakers has, by the 2021 census, been stabilised at 2001 levels as the prerequisite for long-term growth.
