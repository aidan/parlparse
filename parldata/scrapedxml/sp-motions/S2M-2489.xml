 * S2M-2489# Richard Lochhead:Grampian Dental Crisis—That the Parliament notes that Grampian accounts for one third of patients deregistered from NHS dentistry since 1999; further notes the difficulties currently being faced by patients in Grampian who are unable to register with an NHS dentist or obtain treatment by hospital-based services such as orthodontics where waiting times are as high as seven years; is particularly concerned by the impact on children’s dental health, and believes that the current situation will prevent the Scottish Executive from introducing universal free dental checks by 2007 unless urgent action is taken to improve the availability of NHS treatment and to encourage dentists to locate to the region. Supported by: Mr David Davidson*, Stewart Stevenson*, Tommy Sheridan*, Alex Neil*, Brian Adam*
