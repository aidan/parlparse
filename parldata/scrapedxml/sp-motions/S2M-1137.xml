*S2M-1137# Colin Fox: Standard Life Job Losses-That the Parliament condemns the decision by Standard Life to sack 1,000 staff by the end of the year; is not convinced that the company will reduce risk to its customers or staff by these measures and notes with concern the long-term impact on staff and policyholders of the move towards demutualisation announced today, and considers it to be imperative that the company should open talks with a recognised trade union to ensure that staff are protected and treated fairly at this time.
