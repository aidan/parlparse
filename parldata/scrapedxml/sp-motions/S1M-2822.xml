*S1M-2822# Shona Robison: Sale and Use of Fireworks-That the Parliament notes the results of the survey carried out by the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in which almost 98% of people supported tighter restrictions on the availability of fireworks; recognises that there has been a large increase in the problems caused for both people and animals by the irresponsible use of fireworks; is concerned that the voluntary code of practice for the sale of fireworks is frequently disregarded, and considers that the Scottish Executive should do everything in its power to tighten up on the regulations relating to the sale and use of fireworks and, in particular, should review the powers available to local authorities in respect of vendor licensing.
