 *S2M-737# Mark Ballard: Bilston Glen-That the Parliament believes that the proposed expansion of the A701 between Bilston and Edinburgh should be cancelled as it is dangerous for the local community which has expressed its resentment through several hundred letters, will encourage car use and will destroy green belt land including Bilston Glen, an area of beautiful, ancient, irreplaceable SSSI woodland; considers that the expansion is taking place despite the dedicated actions of international ecological protesters and the stated aims of both the Parliament and Midlothian Council of increasing democratic consultation, promoting more sustainable transport, and protecting SSSI and green belt environments, and believes that no further development should be undertaken that will jeopardise the Glen or the communities of Roslin and Bilston.
