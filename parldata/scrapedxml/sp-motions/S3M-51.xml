*S3M-51 Sandra White: Israeli-Palestinian Relations—That the Parliament expresses concern at the deterioration in Israeli-Palestinian relations and the possible consequences for ordinary people caught up in the ongoing conflict; believes that reconciliation and compromise from both sides is the only way forward in resolving this issue, and, to this end, expresses grave disappointment at the decision to demolish the Al Ansari library in Jerusalem, one of the most important libraries in Jerusalem housing a collection of over 30,000 books in Arabic, the destruction of which would be both a great blow to the cultural survival of the Palestinian people and any chances of a peaceful settlement to this conflict. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Rob Gibson*, Christine Grahame*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Kenneth Gibson*, Bill Kidd*
