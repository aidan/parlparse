*S3M-5603 Marilyn Livingstone: Proposed Cuts to Funding for Architecture, Built Environment and Planning—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by the Scottish Funding Council to cut funding for architecture, built environment and planning in universities by 22%; understands that, should the Scottish Funding Council reduce the number of funding groups from 25 to four as proposed, the effect of this for the built environment group would be a fall in funding, on the basis of 2008-09 figures, from £6,415 to £5,000 per student, which would represent the largest of the cuts proposed to any sector and would place architecture, built environment and planning in the lowest funding group; further understands that some concern has been raised about the incomplete and partial evidence on which the proposal is founded; believes that a 22% cut in funding would severely impede the Scottish Government’s targets on climate change and housing through reducing the number of built environment graduates who would be expected to lead in developing building standards and sustainable and energy-efficient designs and exacerbating an already strained planning system, and urges the Scottish Funding Council to reconsider its proposals for such drastic changes to the funding system at a time when investment should be encouraged.
