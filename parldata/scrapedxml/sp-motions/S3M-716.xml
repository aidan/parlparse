*S3M-716 Sarah Boyack: Organic Food—That the Parliament welcomes the recent findings of the EU-funded Quality Low Input Food study that organic food contains fewer of the compounds that are harmful and more of those that are beneficial to health than conventionally cultivated produce; notes that the four-year, £12 million project involved growing fruit and vegetables and rearing cattle on adjacent organic and non-organic sites across Europe and concluded, for example, that 40% more antioxidants could be found in organic fruit and vegetables than in non-organic varieties, while organic milk can contain up to 60% more antioxidants and desirable fatty acids than conventionally produced milk; further notes that the findings of such a large-scale study call into question the current position of the Food Standards Agency that the balance of current scientific evidence does not support the view that organically produced food is more nutritious than other food, and believes that the Scottish Government should step up its support for organic produce in light of this new EU-funded research.
