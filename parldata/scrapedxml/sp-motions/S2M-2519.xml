*S2M-2519 Rosie Kane: Muslims Targeted by Anti-Terror Legislation—That the Parliament condemns the remarks of the Home Office minister, Hazel Blears, to the Home Affairs Select Committee, and widely reported in the press, in relation to counter-terrorism powers that "some of our counter-terrorism powers will be disproportionately experienced by the Muslim community" and that "the threat is most likely to come from those people associated with an extreme form of Islam"; regards these remarks as directly associating our Muslim communities with terrorism; believes that they will be used by racists and far-right thugs as a green light to attack Muslims and will result in an increase in racist attacks; believes that the targeting of Muslims by the security services will be done on a racist basis and abhors the fact that a Labour government elected with the support of substantial sections of Muslim communities should now be targeting those communities as if they were "the enemy within", and further notes that the last terrorist outrage committed in the United Kingdom was by a far-right racist against the lesbian and gay community.
