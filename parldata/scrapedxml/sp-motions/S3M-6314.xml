 *S3M-6314 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Access to Fossil Fuel Levy Surplus—That the Parliament believes that the £185 million Scottish fossil fuel levy surplus has the potential to support investment in Scotland’s growing renewables industry and assist Scotland’s response to the challenges presented by climate change; regrets that the Scottish Government has not hitherto been given access to these funds, and calls on the UK Government to release the fossil fuel levy to Scotland at the earliest opportunity.
