*S2M-88# Christine Grahame: Minch Moor—That the Parliament notes the concerns of local people, hill-walkers and ramblers about the application by AMEC Ltd to locate a wind farm at Minch Moor, near Innerleithen and Walkerburn in the Scottish Borders, an area designated by Scottish Borders Council in its 1995 Structure Plan as a "preferred area of search" for wind farms; further notes that the application concerns the erection of 14 turbines some 100 metres high, with at least seven of the turbines being visible from Walkerburn and three being directly adjacent to part of the Southern Upland Way; is aware that, as yet, there is no indication from AMEC Ltd on how and where the power lines will run; shares the local, national and international concern that this unspoiled countryside, including the skyline defined by Priesthope Hill and Windlestraw Law, will be blemished should this development proceed; further shares concerns that tourism in this economically vulnerable area will suffer, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should review its planning policy on the proliferation of wind farms and examine planning policy elsewhere in Europe, in particular Germany, Netherlands and Denmark, with the purpose of developing a proactive national planning-led approach to the location of wind farms.
