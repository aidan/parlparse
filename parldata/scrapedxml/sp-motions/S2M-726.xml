 *S2M-726 Nicola Sturgeon: Guantanamo Bay-That the Parliament notes that 660 suspected terrorists, including nine UK citizens, continue to be detained at the US Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; further notes that these prisoners, who have been detained for almost two years, are being denied access to US courts to test the legality of their continued detention, have no access to civilian lawyers and that their only prospect of trial will be by closed military tribunals in which military personnel will act as interrogators, prosecutors, defence counsel, judges and, in cases where the death penalty is imposed, executioners; welcomes the fact that the US Supreme Court has agreed to consider whether lower courts in the United States of America were right to conclude that US courts lack jurisdiction to consider challenges to the legality of the detention of foreign nationals captured abroad in connection with hostilities and incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay; is concerned, however, that, in reaching a decision, the Supreme Court has access to all relevant information including the evidence that many of the individuals held at Guantanamo Bay were not arrested in connection with hostilities; welcomes, in that regard, the involvement of lawyers in the United States of America, England and Scotland in trying to secure basic human rights for those held at Guantanamo Bay, and agrees that this motion may be submitted as part of, and that those signing give support to, a parliamentarians' amicus brief being prepared by lawyers for submission to the US Supreme Court calling for all prisoners to have access to an impartial court to determine their status and test the legality of their continued detention.
