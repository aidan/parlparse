*S2M-1899.2 Alex Fergusson: Making the Most of Scotland’s Forests—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1899) in the name of Lewis Macdonald, insert at end "notes, however, that new planting is at an all-time low, that Forestry Commission Scotland and Forest Enterprise Scotland are budgeted to receive £80 million in the next financial year from the taxpayer with the consequential competitive disadvantage to the private sector and that the promised Executive statement on the link between the agricultural and forestry industries following the introduction of the single farm payment has still not been made, and believes that these factors demonstrate that the Executive betrays a lack of understanding of the importance of the private sector to Scotland’s forestry industry."
