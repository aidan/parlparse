*S3M-2245 Bob Doris: Save Glasgow’s School Buses—That the Parliament condemns the decision of Labour-led Glasgow City Council to alter the distance for which free school bus travel is provided from two miles to three miles, which will affect around 1,500 school children; notes that this move was voted through in February 2008 in the face of fierce objections from SNP opposition on the council and that the move will save £670,000, which is totally unnecessary as the council estimates a growth in its reserves from around £10.7 million under the previous administration to around £30 million under the current SNP government; condemns the decision of the council only to publicise this decision in the run-up to the summer holidays in what appears to be a deliberate ploy to prevent opposition campaigns by local parents against this ill-considered move; believes that the comments of Labour Councillor, Gordon Matheson, gives the game away when he stated that the council is falling into line with "national guidelines" but fails to point out that these are non-statutory and were drawn up under the previous administration in 2003; is concerned that these moves may put at risk child safety and school attendance; demands that the council stops using the city’s school children as a political football; believes that the proposals should be halted and that the council should use next year to fully consult parents across all Glasgow’s schools to ensure that children can get to school safely and easily, and, in the meantime, wishes local parents who are campaigning against the council’s plans, such as those in Glasgow Milton, every success in their campaign.
