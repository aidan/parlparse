*S3M-1871 Claire Baker: A School of Ambition - Kirkland High—That the Parliament congratulates Kirkland High School in Methil, Fife, for making good progress in its latest HM Inspectorate of Education report; welcomes Kirkland High pupils to the Parliament for the Europe Day Conference; congratulates the headteacher, Ronnie Ross, and his team of staff for bringing improvements in pupil attainment; notes that the report highlights areas where improvements could be made and that the school is continuing to work hard to bring about the required improvements; highlights that Kirkland High was part of the schools of ambition programme which allowed the school to invest heavily including in its drama facilities; notes that the report highlights that pupil attainment was strongest in art, music and computing, and strongly condemns the Scottish Government’s decision to axe the schools of ambition programme and its failure to provide any replacement funding programme and fears that future opportunities for similar investment by Kirkland High and other schools of ambition will not be possible, reducing opportunities for many pupils from deprived areas across Scotland to fulfil their true potential.
