 *S3M-2330 Dr Richard Simpson: Beauly to Denny Power Line—That the Parliament notes that, in Historic Scotland’s consultation for an inventory of historic battlefields, responses show that the Sheriffmuir battlefield meets all the proposed criteria for the inventory, which propose that battlefields will receive the same protection as historic gardens and designed landscapes; further notes that the proposed Beauly to Denny power line passes through the centre of the Sheriffmuir battlefield; also notes that this important protective measure has come too late to be considered by the inquiry reporters, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take this into account when reaching its decision on the route and nature of the proposed power line.
