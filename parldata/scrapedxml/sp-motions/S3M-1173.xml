*S3M-1173 Irene Oldfather: Campaign to Ban Snaring in Scotland—That the Parliament agrees that the continued use of snaring subjects thousands of Scotland’s wild animals every year to a degree of suffering, including disembowelment, mutilation and death by slow strangulation, which is unacceptable and could not legally be inflicted on domestic animals; agrees that Scotland’s wildlife, pets and farmed animals should not be exposed to indiscriminate trapping methods such as snares which are known to exact a heavy toll of non-target animals, including European protected species; notes that last year’s Scottish Executive consultation on the future of snaring elicited a more than two-to-one majority in favour of an outright ban on snares; welcomes the campaign to ban snaring in Scotland launched on 15 January 2008 by Advocates for Animals, the League Against Cruel Sports, Hessilhead Wildlife Rescue Trust, the Hare Preservation Trust, the International Otter Survival Fund and Scottish Badgers, and sponsored by the Marchig Animal Welfare Trust, and believes that snaring should be banned. Supported by: Elaine Smith*, Kenneth Gibson*, Patrick Harvie*, Trish Godman*
