 *S3M-6412 Jamie Hepburn: A Government of the Financial Elite for the Financial Elite—That the Parliament notes that 23 of the 29 members of the coalition making up the UK Government are believed to be millionaires; considers, that, while there are no grounds for debarring an individual from being part of an executive on the grounds of financial status, the narrow socio-economic profile of the UK Government is a poor reflection of the demographic realities of wider society, and believes that this raises concerns about the ability of the so-called Con-Dem coalition to understand the experience of people in Scotland and across the UK. Supported by: Alasdair Allan*, Stuart McMillan*, Bill Wilson*, Bill Kidd*, Patrick Harvie*, Robin Harper*
