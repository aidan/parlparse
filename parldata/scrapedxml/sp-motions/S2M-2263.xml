*S2M-2263# Alex Johnstone: The Closure of Rural Primary Schools in Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament notes the concerns of local communities and parents about the continuing closure of rural primary schools across Scotland; regrets the closure of rural primary schools, especially in cases where they are well attended and enjoy widespread parental and community support; recognises the vital role that rural primary schools play in sustaining community life, often in some of our most marginal, fragile and remote communities, and the part they play in providing a diverse educational infrastructure, thus helping to allow parents to exercise choice in placing their children in schools; acknowledges that rural primary schools often provide a first-class standard of education to pupils, and calls on the Scottish Executive to respond to the continuing concerns of rural parents and communities about rural primary school closures by taking action to tighten the rules on rural school closures, providing new guidelines on this subject and introducing a national presumption against the closure of rural schools.
