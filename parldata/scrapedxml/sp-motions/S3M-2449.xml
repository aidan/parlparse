 *S3M-2449# Keith Brown: All Aboard to Alloa, Again—That the Parliament notes the first journey by a passenger train from Dunfermline to Alloa in 28 years, by Pathfinder Tours, that took place by special arrangement with the route’s owners on Monday 27 August 2008; recognises that the rail route between Alloa and the Fife Circle does not currently meet specifications for regular passenger travel, with problems including inadequate signalling; believes, however, that the possibility of resuming regular passenger services is made more practical by there already being usable track over the route; also notes the potential for such a route to bring a rail service to Clackmannan and the West Fife villages, as well as a new direct route between Stirling and Edinburgh; further notes the stated long-term aim of SESTRAN to resume passenger services between Alloa and Dunfermline, and is encouraged that relevant bodies are increasingly taking steps to make more journeys like this one a reality.
