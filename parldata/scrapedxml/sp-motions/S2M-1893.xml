 *S2M-1893# Frances Curran: Equal Pay—That the Parliament welcomes the comments of the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Patricia Hewitt, that getting rid of "career sexism" is vital to closing the gender pay gap but regrets that the Scottish Executive utterly failed the nursery nurses on this very issue during their three-and-a-half-month-long strike over pay; notes that this group of workers, 95% of whom are women, have suffered "career sexism" for far too long resulting in pay discrimination; considers that the Executive should be ashamed of itself for sitting on its hands and doing nothing when over 4,000, mainly women, workers took to the streets, and fully supports any nursery nurses who take up the advice of the Equal Opportunities Commission to pursue the issue of pay equality through employment tribunals.
