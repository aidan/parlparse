*S2M-3739 Robin Harper: Home Education—That the Parliament expresses concern that some local education authorities in Scotland are not adhering to the statutory guidance on the circumstances in which parents may choose to educate their children at home which was issued by the Scottish Executive in March 2004 with the aim of improving relationships between local authorities and home-educating families; notes that, while the majority of councils have changed their policies, procedures and practices to reflect the statutory guidance, many others have delayed or refused consent to parents wishing to withdraw their children from school, despite those parents having provided adequate information about their home-based education provision; notes that in England and Wales the law allows for the deregistration of a pupil from any school upon written demand, whereas in Scotland parents require council consent to remove their child from a state, but not a private, school; commends the majority of councils in Scotland for engaging positively with home-educating families and making the guidance work, and supports Schoolhouse and the home education community in Scotland in their call for an amendment to section 35 of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 so that children attending state schools in Scotland may be withdrawn from state schools upon written notification to the local authority.
