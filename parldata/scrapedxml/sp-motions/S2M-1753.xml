 *S2M-1753# Robert Brown: Railway Masts—That the Parliament notes that Network Rail has been given permitted development rights with regard to safety work on railway lines; notes that it is currently erecting 29-metre high masts in residential areas across Strathclyde to support its GSM-R safety communication equipment with little or no consultation with local residents; notes that considerable doubts have been expressed as to whether its proposed system has been fully tested, is suitable and whether it will be technologically obsolescent before the system is completed across the United Kingdom, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should require Network Rail to go through normal planning application procedures before proceeding with the erection of further masts.
