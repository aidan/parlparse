*S3M-2300 Robin Harper: Wind Farm Moratorium on Peat Lands—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Scottish Government’s research report, Calculating carbon savings from wind farms on Scottish peat lands, and the analysis that the total carbon payback period for wind farms constructed on peat lands is typically under three years; condemns calls for a moratorium on wind farm developments on peat land as without scientific basis and damaging both to action against climate change and the renewable energy industry, and calls on government, industry and environmental bodies to continue to work together to ensure good practice and protection for biodiversity on Scottish peat lands.
