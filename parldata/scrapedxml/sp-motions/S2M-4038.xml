 *S2M-4038 Carolyn Leckie: Fight the Power—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the CD, "Fight the Power, defendiendo el socialism", featuring poet and rap artist Benjamin Zephaniah, King Biscuit Time, Rodney P, Braintax, Skinnyman, Emmanuel feat KRS1 and many more, which was created by the afore-mentioned artists on their initiative in response to the undemocratic ban of four Scottish Socialist Party (SSP) MSPs who stood up for democracy and the right to protest against the leaders and actions of the G8; expresses gratitude for such a tremendous show of solidarity, support and understanding for the protest; regrets that such a fundraising initiative has been necessary to ensure that no one suffers hardship from the removal of £30,000 from the four MSPs’ salaries and allowances, including employees reliant on that funding from the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body; congratulates the artists for their political principles and their performances; notes that in the face of another undemocratic ban, Ken Livingstone, Mayor of London has stated that "This decision strikes at the heart of democracy….Elected politicians should only be able to be removed by the voters"; endorses that view, and calls on all MSPs who took such draconian action against the four SSP MSPs to acknowledge the rash, unfair and undemocratic nature of their action, apologise accordingly and make reparations by purchasing a CD. R Supported by: Frances Curran*, Tommy Sheridan*
