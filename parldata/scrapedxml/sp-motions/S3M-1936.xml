*S3M-1936 Bill Wilson: Challenging the European Investment Bank—That the Parliament welcomes the publication, with the financial assistance of the European Union, of the Citizens’ Guide to the European Investment Bank (EIB) by the coalition of development and environmental NGOs known as Counter Balance: Challenging the European Investment Bank; sympathises with the organisation’s desire that the EIB becomes a public interest-driven bank and a tool for achieving the UN Millennium Development Goals, that it should play a major role in the fight against climate change and that it should operate as a truly accountable institution and lend in a responsible manner rather than give public subsidies for private companies; concurs with the aim of increasing awareness among various civil groups of the environmental, social and human rights impacts of the EIB’s operations outwith the European Union, and believes that the EIB’s destructive activities to date, based on an outdated and counterproductive development model, would justify the name "Extractive Industries Bank" as referred to in the document.
