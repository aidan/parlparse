 *S2M-4244 Shona Robison: National Depression Week—That the Parliament recognises that 17 to 23 April 2006 is National Depression Week and supports the work by the Depression Alliance Scotland in raising awareness about depression; realises that depression is a common illness affecting one in five people in Scotland; notes that estimates suggest that as many as 75% of people with depression do not seek help from their doctor because they see it as a weakness and not a treatable illness, and hopes that National Depression Week will help to overcome the stigma that those who suffer from depression in Scotland still face.
