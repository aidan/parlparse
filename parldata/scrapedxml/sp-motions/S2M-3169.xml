*S2M-3169# Ms Sandra White: Welcome to Glasgow’s 2014 Commonwealth Games Bid—That the Parliament welcomes and supports Glasgow’s bid to bring the 2014 Commonwealth Games to the city; believes that it can only be beneficial to Scots of all ages, and our youth in particular, to have access to new and enhanced sporting facilities; expects that an upgraded Hampden Park will be utilised as the focal point for the athletics and showcasing of the games; believes that the Scottish Executive should provide the significant bulk of funding for the built infrastructure required for the games, and considers that a successful Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games will further the growing national confidence of the Scottish people.
