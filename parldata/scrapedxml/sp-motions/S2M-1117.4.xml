 *S2M-1117.4 Robert Brown: The Failure of the BBC to Hand Over Tapes to the Fraser Inquiry-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1117) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "notes the current Holyrood Inquiry being conducted by The Rt Hon The Lord Fraser of Carmyllie QC as instigated by the First Minister and the Presiding Officer; encourages all those with an interest in the Inquiry to provide Lord Fraser with all required documentation and material and strongly encourages both the Inquiry and the BBC to arrive at a mutually acceptable resolution to the ongoing issue surrounding the availability of information from tapes of the Wark Clements Productions' programme entitled "The Gathering Place"; supports the independence of the BBC against political interference as a fundamental bulwark of our civil liberties, and believes that the Parliament would undermine the independence of the BBC by seeking to compel it to take any particular course of action but would nevertheless welcome a decision by the BBC to allow Lord Fraser appropriate access to the tapes."
