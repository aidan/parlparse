*S2M-4303 Jim Mather: Payment of Public Money to Lobbying Organisations—That the Parliament notes the payment of public money through non-departmental public bodies such as Scottish Enterprise and Scottish Water to private lobbying organisations such as the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), largely through subscriptions; is concerned that in the case of Scottish Enterprise £194,796.77 was paid by a public body to the CBI over six years; welcomes the decision of Scottish Water to stop paying money to the CBI, and recommends that, to avoid any potential conflict of interest, all public bodies reconsider the practice of supporting private lobbying organisations through membership subscriptions.
