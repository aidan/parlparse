*S3M-5357 Nanette Milne: Young Carers—That the Parliament congratulates the Aberdeen Young Carers Project on its 10th anniversary; notes that the Chill Out Zone opened in 2002 provides clubs, such as a Homework Club, which enables young carers to be in an environment where they have space to do their homework away from their caring responsibilities; further notes that the Aberdeen Young Carers Project also enables young carers to realise that they are not alone in their caring role; congratulates Mary Drever, Aberdeen Young Carers Project Leader, for her unstinting efforts to support Aberdeen’s young carers, and commends the many young carers in Aberdeen and across Scotland for the selfless care and support that they give to their loved ones all year round.
