*S2M-3683 Colin Fox: Support for Union Members at First Bus in Aberdeen—That the Parliament supports the Transport and General Workers Union members at First Bus in Aberdeen who have taken industrial action in pursuit of a pay claim; believes that the strike action reflects a widespread discontent among drivers in Aberdeen about their low levels of pay and proposed changes to pension rights and working conditions; believes that there is widespread anger at the glaring disparity within the different areas of First Group in relation to drivers’ wage rates; notes that in a ballot drivers voted by 96% to support the current strike action; notes that similar action at Lothian Regional Transport and First Bus South East Scotland earlier this year resulted in an improved pay offer for workers there, and regrets the considerable inconvenience the strike has caused to the general public but believes that the onus is on the company to come forward with an improved offer to end the dispute, one which does not involve a reduction in the present conditions of employment of drivers.
