*S2M-1457# Dr Jean Turner: Glasgow Marriage Counselling Service - Couple Counselling Scotland-That the Parliament recognises the excellent work done by Glasgow Marriage Counselling Service (GMCS) in association with Couple Counselling Scotland; notes, in particular, their expertise and involvement with families where children are drawn into partnership dysfunction that requires the assistance of well-trained couple counsellors; is aware that training costs around £5,500 per counsellor, of which £3,500 is paid by counsellors who later give their time on a voluntary basis; is astonished that such an essential service to families which is in line with the principles set out in the Scottish Executive consultation paper, Family Matters: Improving Family Law in Scotland, does not have direct funding and depends on varying levels of support for such services from local authorities, and notes with concern that one local authority has indicated its intention to reduce substantially their vital support of GMCS with attendant consequences for the service.
