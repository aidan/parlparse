 *S2M-306 Elaine Smith: Chile-That the Parliament welcomes the events taking place on 11 and 13 September 2003, sponsored by Amnesty International, Chile Democratico and the STUC, to commemorate the 30th anniversary of the military coup that brought down the democratic government of President Salvador Allende in Chile on 11 September 1973; remembers the thousands of Chileans who were killed, detained, tortured and exiled by General Pinochet's brutal regime; expresses renewed solidarity with them, their friends and relatives; supports their demands for truth and justice as the necessary building blocks of the new Chile; pays tribute to the people of Chile who struggled for almost 17 years to return their country to democratic rule and to the Scottish people who supported that struggle; re-affirms a commitment to providing refuge and asylum to people, like the Chileans who came to Scotland in the mid 1970s, who are fleeing persecution and need a safe haven to rebuild lives shattered by oppression, war and conflict in their homelands; values their contribution to Scottish society and the enriching diversity they bring to our country; pledges on-going support for the cause of democracy, human, civil and political rights everywhere in the world, and calls for an end to oppression, discrimination and exclusion of any kind worldwide.
