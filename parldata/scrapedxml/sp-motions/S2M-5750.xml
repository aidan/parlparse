*S2M-5750 Rosie Kane: Say No to Fluoridation of Scotland’s Water Supply—That the Parliament is concerned about recent comments made by Andy Kerr, Minister for Health and Community Care, in Holyrood in support of mass medication through the fluoridation of Scotland’s water supply; notes that fluoridation of the water supply has been linked with brittle bone disease, cancer and many other conditions; further notes that not enough is known about the dangers of the cumulative effects of fluoride on the individual; believes that the claimed benefits in relation to preventing tooth decay may be outweighed by the documented negative side effects of water fluoridation, and finally agrees to oppose any future legislation to introduce mass medication through Scotland’s water supply.
