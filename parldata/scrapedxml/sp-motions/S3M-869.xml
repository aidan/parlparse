*S3M-869 Jamie Hepburn: Discrimination Against Women in Saudi Arabia—That the Parliament condemns the decision of an appeal court in Saudi Arabia to double the number of lashes and add a jail sentence as punishment for a woman who was gang-raped; expresses its serious concern at the ongoing legal discrimination against women in Saudi Arabia and believes this to be a violation of their fundamental human rights; further believes that it is inappropriate for heads of western democracies to associate themselves with the Saudi regime while such state-sanctioned discrimination and abuse exists, and calls on government at all levels in the United Kingdom to use its diplomatic influence to promote equal rights and democracy in Saudi Arabia.
