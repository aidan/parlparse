*S2M-889.1 Mr Jamie McGrigor: The Future of Scottish Football-As an amendment to motion (S2M-889) in the name of Mr Kenny MacAskill, leave out from "significant" to end and insert "importance in terms of its economic, social and health benefits and also its contribution to our culture and identity; believes, however, that football clubs must take responsibility for their own commercial decisions and that a well-run football club should be sustainable without the need for public funding; further believes that the Scottish Executive can help club finances by lifting the outdated alcohol ban in all-seater stadia, and invites the Scottish Football Association to consider reinstating the home international championship as a means of generating additional revenue for the development of the game."
