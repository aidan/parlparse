*S3M-2030 Christine Grahame: Common Ridings and Borders Processions—That the Parliament recognises the historic and cultural importance of the common ridings across the Scottish Borders, such as those in Selkirk, Hawick, Lauder, the Braw Lads’ Gathering in Galashiels and Penicuik’s Hunter &amp; Lass Week; considers that, since the enactment of the Police, Public Order and Criminal Justice (Scotland) Act 2006, these local celebrations have had to meet quite onerous requirements that are not suitable for well-established and uncontroversial public processions, and would invite the Scottish Government to review the operation of the Act as it applies to such ridings and processions.
