 *S3M-7119 Murdo Fraser: Highland Perthshire in Cairngorms National Parkâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the extension of the Cairngorms National Park to include parts of eastern and Highland Perthshire, which comes into force on 2 October 2010; considers that Blair Atholl is the natural southern gateway to the Cairngorms National Park; thanks all the organisations involved in ensuring that Blair Atholl and Highland Perthshire became included in the national park, including the Pitlochry Partnership, the John Muir Trust, the Mountaineering Council of Scotland, the Blair Atholl Area Tourism Association and many others; further considers that the Spittal of Glenshee is the natural eastern gateway to the national park and thanks all the organisations involved in ensuring that the boundary was extended to include it, and believes that these areas are now rightly part of the Cairngorms National Park and that this will give the local economy a boost.
