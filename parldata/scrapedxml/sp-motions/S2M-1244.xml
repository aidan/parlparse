*S2M-1244 Tommy Sheridan: Plaid Cymru Leader's Comments on Draft European Constitution-That the Parliament notes the comments of Ieuan Wyn Jones, leader of Plaid Cymru, in relation to the draft European Constitution that "This draft new constitution is a charter to tighten the grip of the larger nation states of Europe. The voice of the smaller countries will be reduced, while the needs of stateless nations like Wales or Scotland will be ignored completely" and believes that these comments illustrate clearly that the draft constitution is not in the interests of those in Scotland who believe in democracy, socialism and independence.
