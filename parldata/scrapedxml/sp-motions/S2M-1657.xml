*S2M-1657 Dr Jean Turner: Lack of High-Dependency Beds in Greater Glasgow—That the Parliament condemns the decision by NHS Greater Glasgow to transfer the gynaecology and gynaecology oncology unit from Stobhill Hospital to Glasgow Royal Infirmary without ensuring the provision of essential additional high-dependency beds and therefore compromising clinical judgements and increasing waiting time for surgery, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to intervene to ensure that patients receive an improved service or one that is at least as good as that which existed previously at Stobhill Hospital.
