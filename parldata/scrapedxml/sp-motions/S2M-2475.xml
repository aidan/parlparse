*S2M-2475 Rosie Kane: Murder of Dionisio Ribeiro Filhoâ€”That the Parliament notes with regret the murder of the Brazilian environmentalist, Dionisio Ribeiro Filho; expresses condolences to his family and to the people of Brazil; pays tribute to Dionisio Ribeiro Filho for his tireless work in protecting the rain forest and in establishing the Tingua Biological Reserve; notes that this murder comes only 10 days after the murder of the environmentalist, Dorothy Stang; condemns utterly the use of death squads used by illegal loggers and ranchers to invade forest areas, and calls on the Scottish Executive to put pressure on the world community for greater protection of local communities, environmentalists and the land they protect.
