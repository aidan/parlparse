*S1M-2285 Allan Wilson: Sports Promotion in Scotland's Schoolsâ€”That the Parliament recognises the contribution sport makes to both the physical and mental health of young people as well as providing a positive and attractive alternative to anti-social and offending behaviour; endorses the various initiatives, such as the School Sports Co-ordinator and Active Primary School Programmes put in place by the Scottish Executive through sportscotland and the increasing opportunities for young people to participate in sports in schools, and calls on local authorities, and others, to engage fully with these initiatives.
