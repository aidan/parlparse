 *S2M-684# Cathy Peattie: Linked Work and Training Trust Central - BURA Award-That the Parliament congratulates Linked Work and Training Trust Central (LWTTC) on its Best Practice in Regeneration award, the only Scottish organisation among this year's five British Urban Regeneration Association (BURA) awards; notes BURA's comment that LWTTC is an outstanding example of a project that "builds the capacity of excluded communities to develop and harness their own skills, commitment, experience and confidence to contribute to sustained local economic and social regeneration"; further notes that in Empowered To Practice: The Future of Community Learning and Development Training in Scotland the Scottish Executive recognised the LWTTC model of work-based training and recommended its expansion, and believes that the Executive should ensure that funding authorities support the wider adoption of such programmes.
