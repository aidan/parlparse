 *S1M-2356 Ms Margo MacDonald: International Criminal Court-That the Parliament believes that it is now necessary to create a new International Court comparable to those sitting at the Hague and Arusha specifically charged with the judicial processes intended to lead to the trial of Osama Bin Laden and any others against whom evidence is established linking them to the atrocities against the United States of America on 11 September 2001 and that the composition of the court should reflect international jurisprudence including Islamic judges, and further believes that the creation of such a court by the Security Council will clearly signal to the international community that the pursuit of those responsible for these atrocities is an international endeavour on a judicial basis and that the atrocities committed on 11 September were criminal in nature and should not be dignified as an act of war.
