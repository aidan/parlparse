S3M-4543 Jamie McGrigor: Reversal of Forfeitures Affecting Descendants of those who Supported the Royal House of Stuartâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the forthcoming petition to permit legislation to be introduced in the Westminster Parliament repealing forfeitures and attainders still in existence affecting those whose ancestors supported the Royal Stuarts; notes that these Jacobites lost civil rights and property and were tainted with the label of "corruption of blood"; further notes that this included all ranks from peers and lairds to clerks in government offices, including such well-known figures as Rob Roy and Flora MacDonald, and believes this to be appropriate as an act of reconciliation in the Year of Homecoming when so many of their descendants are returning to Scotland. Supported by: Nanette Milne, Elizabeth Smith, Bill Aitken, Bill Kidd, Maureen Watt, David Stewart, Ted Brocklebank, Jackson Carlaw, Mary Scanlon
