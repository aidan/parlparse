*S3M-5704 Malcolm Chisholm: Congratulations to the Finola Education Trust—That the Parliament recognises that the Leith teenager, Finola Forman, who suffers from cerebral palsy, has chosen to attend a specialist residential further education course and that such facilities are available only in England; congratulates the Finola Education Trust on raising the £36,000 additional money that was required for the first year of the three-year course on top of the contribution from the City of Edinburgh Council; acknowledges the contribution of Leith FM and many others in promoting the campaign, and believes that teenagers such as Finola should be able to exercise choice concerning the further education that they receive without the need for such extensive fundraising.
