 * S2M-2824.2 Miss Annabel Goldie: Tackling Serious and Organised Crime - Developing Strategic Partnerships—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2824) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from “the Scottish Executive’s” to end and insert “actions which will create an efficient court process; backs the Scottish Executive’s efforts to ensure greater co-operation with European and international criminal justice agencies; believes that the status of the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency should be strengthened and therefore hopes that it will not be undermined by the creation of the Serious Organised Crime Agency; commends the success of the Crown Office in recovering £5.4 million since the introduction of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002; continues to support the sustained efforts of all those involved in disrupting and destroying the criminal networks which profit from inflicting violence and misery on communities in Scotland, but believes that crime will continue to blight too many Scottish communities until there is an increased police presence on our streets coupled with a zero-tolerant attitude to crime.”
