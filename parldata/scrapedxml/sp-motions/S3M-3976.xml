*S3M-3976 Patricia Ferguson: Glasgow City Council School Closure Decision—That the Parliament congratulates those who campaigned successfully for the retention of Ruchill Primary School; salutes the hard work and commitment of those who put forward the case for Wyndford, St Gregory’s, St Agnes’s and Our Lady of the Assumption primary schools; believes that the decision taken by Glasgow City Council on 23 April 2009 to close these schools is mistaken and fails to take adequate account of the social impact on the communities served by the schools and the effect of travel distances, the lengthening of the school day and the availability of and access to out-of-school activities, and hopes that every effort will be made by Glasgow City Council to mitigate the effects of this decision on the communities of Maryhill.
