*S1M-3687 Jackie Baillie: Children's Hospice Association Scotland Hospice at Balloch—That the Parliament notes with concern the recommendation to the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park Authority to reject the planning application from the Children’s Hospice Association Scotland (CHAS) for a new hospice at Balloch; recognises and applauds the excellent and valuable work undertaken by CHAS for families of terminally-ill children and the pressing need for another hospice to be established; considers the development of the new hospice to be of national significance and notes that any further delay in the planning process will mean that the service will come simply too late for many children; congratulates the many individuals and communities in the Dumbarton constituency and across Scotland who have contributed through their considerable fundraising efforts to making the second hospice a reality, and calls upon the Park Authority, in recognising that the park is there for the enjoyment of all and not to be preserved in aspic, to apply common sense and compassion by supporting the application for a new hospice at Balloch.
