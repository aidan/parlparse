*S2M-5400 Margaret Mitchell: Covenanters’ Field, Bothwell—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by South Lanarkshire Council to allow house building on the last remnant of the battlefield of the Battle of Bothwell Bridge in 1679, known as Covenanters’ Field, which has been left virtually undisturbed for 327 years; further notes that Covenanters’ Field was given to the local authority by the Battle of Bothwell Bridge Commemoration Service Committee in the 1980s to be held for safekeeping and protection; welcomes the proposal put forward by Bothwell Community Council to relocate the Covenanters’ Monument to the field, to establish a garden of remembrance and to develop the field as a tourist attraction by creating a "Covenanters’ Trail" to commence at the field and follow the Clyde Valley through Dalserf Church and onwards to some of the other Covenanters’ sites, and calls on the local authority to reconsider its proposals in light of the historic importance and local community opposition to the development of the Covenanters’ Field.
