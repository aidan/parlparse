*S3M-1880 Bill Wilson: The BBC’s Attack on Venezuela—That the Parliament deplores the clear implication of the BBC’s words on page 28 of the May/June issue of its magazine, World Agenda, that, with regard to human rights and democracy, Venezuela is comparable to Burma and Iran; notes that Venezuela continues to improve the welfare of its people, particularly in terms of combating poverty and illiteracy, raising pensions and improving healthcare; considers that Venezuela, since Hugo Chávez’s election in 1998 and with the exception of the short-lived US-backed coup, has an excellent track record with regard to democracy as evidenced by the fact that Chávez not only won 11 national votes in nine years and that all elections have been described by international monitors as free and fair, but also by the fact that he respected the electorate’s recent narrow rejection of a proposed new constitution; believes that the independent Latinobarómetro report on Latin American countries demonstrates that Venezuelans have an overwhelmingly positive view of their democracy and great confidence in their government and president, and accordingly calls on the BBC to justify its categorisation of Venezuela alongside Burma and Iran and, if it is unable to do so, to retract its words and offer an unequivocal apology to the government and people of Venezuela whose integrity it has called into question.
