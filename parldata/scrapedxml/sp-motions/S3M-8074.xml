*S3M-8074 Anne McLaughlin: Shameful Old Firm Violence—That the Parliament expresses its concern at the number of arrests taking place at the time of Glasgow’s Old Firm football matches; notes that, in less than two weeks, Strathclyde Police made a total of 263 arrests for offences related to the last two Old Firm games; believes that the players and managers need to take a lead and demonstrate responsibility to fans of the game; considers those who attend football matches with the sole purpose of causing violence, or who use their team’s result as an excuse for violence, to be absolutely shameful and repugnant; further considers the increase in domestic violence against women and racial abuse to be of real concern, and welcomes the First Minister’s commitment to working with the police, football teams, local authorities and football fans to stamp it out before Glasgow’s reputation becomes tarnished.
