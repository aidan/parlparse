 *S3M-5526 Pauline McNeill: Closure of the Queen Mother’s Maternity Hospital—That the Parliament notes with sadness the closure of the Queen Mother’s Maternity Hospital in Glasgow; commemorates its work over the years; recognises the pioneering ultrasound techniques developed at the facility that brought the hospital world-wide recognition; notes the view of Professor Andrew Calder who called for the name to be retained at the new site and for it to be named the Queen Mother’s Maternity Unit of the Southern General Hospital, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to consider this proposal.
