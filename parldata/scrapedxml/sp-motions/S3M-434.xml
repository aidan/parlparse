*S3M-434♦ Duncan McNeil: Unidentified, Unprotected—That the Parliament notes the publication on 13 August 2007 of the letters of assurance correspondence between the Scottish Executive and local authorities, including Inverclyde Council; notes that this reveals that the authorities are unable to identify, far less provide services for, children in their areas living with parental drug misuse; acknowledges that, if authorities do not know who or where these children are, they cannot provide them with the services they need and which the Executive strategy, Hidden Harm - Next Steps: Supporting Children – Working with Parents, states that they should receive at an early stage, and therefore believes that local authorities and agencies should be given every possible assistance to meet the obligations that they are currently not fulfilling before there is another needless and preventable loss of life.
