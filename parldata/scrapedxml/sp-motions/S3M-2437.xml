 *S3M-2437# John Scott: Farming’s Retreat from the Hills—That the Parliament notes the publication of the Scottish Agricultural College report, Farming’s Retreat from the Hills, detailing the dramatic and ongoing decline in sheep and, to a lesser extent, cattle numbers on Scotland’s hills; notes in particular that between 1998 and 2007 the national sheep flock declined by around 2.3 million animals with the impact especially felt in less favoured areas such as the north west Highlands and Ayrshire; further notes the potentially negative implications of this decline on wider rural economies and biodiversity, and therefore considers that all relevant agencies should carefully examine the findings of the report and consider what measures might be taken to alleviate the problems it outlines.
