*S2M-5105.3 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Funding Equal Payâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-5105) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, insert at end "further offers 100% solidarity to those workers in Glasgow and other local authorities who are compelled to ballot on industrial action in opposition to unacceptable changes in working conditions and contracts being imposed by local authorities which have waited far too long to act on equal pay and are now further penalising low-paid workers by attacking their meagre wages in order to fund the pay increases of other low-paid workers."
