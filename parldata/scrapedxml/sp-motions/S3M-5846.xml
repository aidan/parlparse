 *S3M-5846 Christine Grahame: Why Ad Hoc?—That the Parliament notes with concern the establishment of an ad hoc committee to consider the End of Life Assistance (Scotland) Bill; notes that the first paper on this issue submitted to the Parliamentary Bureau was unequivocal in advising that the Bill was within the remit of the Health and Sport Committee; further notes that a second and subsequent undisclosed paper resulted in the decision to establish an ad hoc committee; notes, however, that, of the six members of the ad hoc committee, four are serving members of the Health and Sport Committee, including the Convener, who is Deputy Convener of Health and Sport Committee; requires the bureau to produce that second paper to clarify for what reason the ad hoc committee is fit for purpose and the existing Health and Sport Committee is not, and further requires the bureau to state the number of occasions when clear advice to the bureau has been rejected and the number of occasions when, and in what form, further advice has been requested.
