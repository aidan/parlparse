 *S1M-2012.1 David McLetchie: Holyrood Project—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2012) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from "without" to end and insert "within the previously approved cost ceiling of £195 million, and to this end calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body in conjunction with the Scottish Executive to consider alternative methods of funding elements of the project through partnership with the private sector which will achieve that cost target and avoid cuts in other budgets."
