 *S3M-6445 Joe FitzPatrick: Release of Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga—That the Parliament welcomes the release and pardon by Malawian President Bingu wa Mutharika of Steven Monjeza and Tiwonge Chimbalanga who were serving 14 years in prison with hard labour after being convicted of gross indecency and unnatural acts; believes that the conviction and sentencing was unlawful and a breach of Malawian, African and international law; is hopeful that this move demonstrates a commitment to human rights by the Malawian authorities, and calls for an end to the persecution and criminalization of people based on sexual orientation.
