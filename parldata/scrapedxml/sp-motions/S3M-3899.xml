 *S3M-3899 Ken Macintosh: No to Compulsory Redundancies at the Daily Record and Sunday Mailâ€”That the Parliament expresses its strong concern at the decision by Trinity Mirror to issue compulsory redundancies to some staff at the Daily Record and Sunday Mail despite a number of voluntary redundancies already having been agreed; notes the strong circulation of both these Scottish titles and their highly profitable contribution to the financial strength of the parent company; notes too the contribution of the Daily Record and Sunday Mail to Scottish public life; worries that drastic cuts in staff to both papers will affect the quality and breadth of their coverage of Scottish affairs, and calls on the management of Trinity Mirror to reinstate those individuals identified for compulsory redundancy, keeping the door open for voluntary agreement instead, and to negotiate constructively with the National Union of Journalists on the future of these vital Scottish newspapers.
