*S1M-1105 Fergus Ewing: Vehicle Body Repair Specialists and VAT-That the Parliament calls upon the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government to end the discrimination suffered by those vehicle body repair specialists which are not owned by insurance companies and which therefore do not enjoy exemption from VAT on labour; notes that this places the independent repair shops at a severe competitive disadvantage, and further calls upon the Executive to investigate whether this constitutes an infringement of EU law and competition policy or is open to challenge at the behest of the Competition Commission or otherwise.
