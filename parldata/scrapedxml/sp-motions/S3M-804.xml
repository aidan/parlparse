*S3M-804 Karen Whitefield: No Time to Lose—That the Parliament notes that over 80 organisations have signed up to support the No Time to Lose manifesto, developed by the Scottish Institute for Residential Child Care in partnership with Aberlour Child Care Trust, the Fostering Network, the British Association for Adoption and Fostering, Who Cares? Scotland and the Scottish Throughcare and Aftercare Forum, which highlights the challenges confronting service providers and problems experienced by children and their families; further notes that around 5,000 children and young people are currently looked after away from home in residential or foster care at any one time and that services are currently stretched to the limit, and calls on the Scottish Government to develop a national strategy, based on the recommendations contained in No Time To Lose, to ensure that children in care have an everyday childhood and the opportunity to fulfil their potential, reducing the gap in outcomes that currently exists with their peers. Supported by: Ken Macintosh*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Robert Brown*, Bill Butler*, Robin Harper*, Cathy Peattie*, David Whitton*, Claire Baker*, Patricia Ferguson*, Elaine Murray*, David Stewart*, Jackie Baillie*, Cathie Craigie*
