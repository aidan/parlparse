*S3M-3861 Anne McLaughlin: Worrying Rise in Racist Incidents in Glasgow—That the Parliament expresses its concern that while racist incidents in Scotland fell by 1% overall the figure for Glasgow increased by 7%; is further concerned that people of Pakistani origin make up a third of those who are racially abused; calls for a wide range of measures to be put in place to combat this surge of racism within the city including a more targeted focus on identified incident hotspots, increasing funding to organisations promoting community cohesion and better reporting mechanisms for victims of racist attacks; is also concerned that racial tension can increase during times of economic difficulty, and therefore calls on all levels of government to work with the appropriate authorities, to be cautious of the increase and to put in place suitable measures to combat any further rise in racist attacks. Supported by: Bob Doris*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Elaine Smith*, Brian Adam*, Alasdair Allan*, Aileen Campbell*, Rob Gibson*, Willie Coffey*, Sandra White*, Christine Grahame*, Patrick Harvie*, Bill Kidd*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Jamie Hepburn*, Christina McKelvie*, Stuart McMillan*
