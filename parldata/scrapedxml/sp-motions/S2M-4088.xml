 *S2M-4088 Pauline McNeill on behalf of the Justice 1 Committee: European Commission Green Papers on Applicable Law in Divorce and Succession and Wills—That the Parliament notes the concerns raised by the Justice 1 Committee in relation to recent European Commission Green Paper proposals on applicable law in divorce and succession and wills; agrees that the proposals are not in the best interests of the people of Scotland, and, in light of the Committee’s views that these proposals are fundamentally flawed and unnecessary, calls on the Scottish Executive to urge the UK Government not to opt in to any draft European Community instruments which emerge following the conclusion of these consultation processes.
