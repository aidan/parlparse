*S2M-3870.3 Shiona Baird: Future Energy Policy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3870) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from "notes" to end and insert "acknowledges that electricity makes up only around 20% of Scotland’s total demand for energy; recognises government figures showing that a safe and secure mixture of practicable renewable technologies, combined with achievable energy efficiency measures, mean that Scotland needs not face an energy gap; notes the Scottish Executive’s findings that simple energy efficiency measures could save Scottish businesses £1.3 billion per year, thereby improving their competitive advantage; believes that nuclear power remains uneconomic, unsustainable, unsafe and ultimately unnecessary, and calls on the Executive to use existing devolved powers to increase investment in energy efficiency and emerging renewable technologies, particularly micro-renewables, as part of a safe, secure and sustainable energy policy for Scotland."
