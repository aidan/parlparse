*S3M-3247 Willie Coffey: Robert Burns 250th Anniversary Commemorative Stamps—That the Parliament notes the terms of motion S3M-01215 (Commemoration by Royal Mail of the 250th Anniversary of the Birth of Robert Burns), lodged by Willie Coffey MSP on 24 January 2008; welcomes the announcement by the Royal Mail that it is to produce two first class stamps to commemorate this important anniversary; notes that the beautifully designed stamps depict the famous Alexander Naismith portrait of Burns and the bard’s most famous and enduring line "A man’s a man for a’ that"; further notes that in recognition of his significance, not just in Scotland but around the world, Burns is the only person outside the Royal Family to feature in three special stamp issues, in 1966, 1996 and now in 2009, and welcomes the announcement by the Royal Mail as a contribution to the growing momentum behind the Year of Homecoming 2009.
