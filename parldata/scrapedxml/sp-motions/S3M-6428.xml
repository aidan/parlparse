*S3M-6428 George Foulkes: Lothian and Borders Police Gets Results After Drugs Ban—That the Parliament commends Lothian and Borders Police on securing five arrests for offences relating to the drug, mephedrone, within just one month of mephedrone and related cathinones being banned under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971; recognises that it was the previous Labour government that took action to ban the substance, now equipping police forces with the necessary enforcement powers to crack down on those dealing in mephedrone; notes that Class B drugs carry a maximum prison sentence of five years for possession and a maximum prison sentence of 14 years for supplying and other trafficking offences; is aware of the increasingly devastating impact that drugs have on communities across Scotland, and joins Scotland’s police forces in sending out a clear message that possession and use of this drug or any illegal drug will not be tolerated.
