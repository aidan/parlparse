*S3M-1686 Kenneth Gibson: Restore the 10p Tax Rate—That the Parliament notes the comments of The Rt Hon Ed Miliband MP, Minister for the Cabinet Office and Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, that it "is a matter of regret" that people on low incomes are to lose out from the abolition of the 10p income tax rate; further notes the comments of the leader of the Scottish Parliamentary Labour Party, in 2000 when she was Minister for Communities, that the introduction of the 10p tax rate would put "more money" in the purses of working women; expresses concern that the abolition of this rate will increase the taxes of at least 324,000 low-paid Scottish workers who only pay the 10p rate, and calls on Her Majesty’s Government to abandon this policy, in light of its disproportionate effect on low-paid workers, particularly at a time of rising food and energy prices.
