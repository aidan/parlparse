*S2M-103.3 Fiona Hyslop: Young People—As an amendment to motion (S2M-103) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from first "will" to end and insert "recognises, however, that it is essential for Scotland that we have the powers to ensure that young people do not have to leave Scotland in their 20s to find a future; further recognises that tackling the low birth rate and developing an effective inward migration policy for Scotland are vital elements towards ensuring that there are enough young Scots to maintain our country’s vitality, and, in the meantime, notes that it is right for there to be a Children’s Commissioner and for the Scottish Executive to develop measures in the field of education and youth work, and to provide additional support for learning, volunteering, culture, sport and leisure facilities for young people in Scotland."
