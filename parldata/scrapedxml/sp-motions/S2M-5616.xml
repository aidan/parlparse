 *S2M-5616 Helen Eadie: Congratulations to the National Westminster Bank, Powergen, the AA, Esure and SAGA—That the Parliament congratulates and commends the National Westminster Bank which now guarantees that its customers will speak to call centre staff in Barnsley or Cardiff rather than to an overseas call point; further notes that in recent months a number of big British organisations have announced that they are bringing call centres back to the United Kingdom, including Powergen and the AA, with the Executive Chairman of Esure, Peter Wood, reportedly suggesting that the trend for outsourcing is doomed as companies in the UK are recognising that the front-line agents of their companies need to provide quality, not quantity, of calls answered; particularly congratulates companies such as Saga, an insurance and over-50s holiday company, that have stuck to a policy of keeping their business operations in the UK, and finally, on behalf of the people of Scotland, hopes that all businesses and public agencies in Scotland will review their call centre operations and address another area of serious customer frustration, namely that they make a clear commitment that every customer or caller has the option of being able to speak to a company representative live in the event of press button options failing to address the concern of the caller.
