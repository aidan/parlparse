*S3M-3250 Richard Lochhead: Common Agricultural Policy Health Check—That the Parliament, noting the recent agreement in the Council of Ministers on the European Commission’s legislative proposals for the Health Check of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), acknowledges the Scottish Government’s commitment to work with stakeholders on how key aspects of the proposals should be implemented in Scotland and on the longer-term implementation of CAP in Scotland and believes that future decisions must reflect the distinctiveness of agriculture in Scotland and support a dynamic and competitive industry with farmers playing their full part in achieving the Scottish Government’s purpose of sustainable economic growth through food production and the environmental management of our agricultural land, combined with the delivery of other economic and social public goods.
