*S3M-815 Hugh O’Donnell: National Epilepsy Centre—That the Parliament welcomes the proposals brought forward by the leading Scottish charity, Quarriers, to build a national centre for excellence in the treatment of epilepsy which will be fully integrated with the Institute of Neurological Sciences at the Southern General Hospital in Glasgow; welcomes the opportunity that such a centre would offer in providing world-class services to people with epilepsy, and believes that every effort should be made by both the NHS and the Scottish Government to support the proposal.
