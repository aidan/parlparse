*S3M-3322.2 Stewart Stevenson: Transport Prioritiesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-3322) in the name of Des McNulty, leave out from "lacks" to end and insert "(STPR) focuses on the three STPR priorities of addressing safety on the network, maximising use of the network and making focused investments that deliver national benefits and notes that the STPR is not the only mechanism for the delivery of surface transport infrastructure supported by the Scottish Government which also involves working with regional transport partnerships and councils and that the Scottish Government is engaging with local communities such as Elgin, Inverness and Maybole to deliver solutions to a range of transport infrastructure issues that have important local benefits." Supported by: John Swinney*
