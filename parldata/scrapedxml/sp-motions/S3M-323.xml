*S3M-323 Angela Constance: Free Personal Care for the Elderly in West Lothianâ€”That the Parliament congratulates West Lothian Council on being singled out in a recent report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation as an example of good practice with regard to the provision of free personal care for the elderly; commends the hard work of all the staff involved in the delivery of the service across West Lothian, and invites other local authorities to learn from the good practice provided by West Lothian Council in terms of providing a high-quality service at a relatively low level of expenditure.
