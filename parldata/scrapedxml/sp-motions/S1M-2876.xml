*S1M-2876 John Farquhar Munro: Third Party Insurance for GM Crops—That the Parliament notes press reports that insurance companies are unwilling to provide third party cover against accidental contamination by GM crops; further notes with concern how vulnerable this may leave organic farms in the vicinity of GM crop field trials, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to the European Commission that a temporary moratorium on GM crop field trials should be imposed until a statutory third party insurance scheme is introduced that will protect the interests of other third parties.
