*S1M-1916 Pauline McNeill: National Cot Death Awareness Week—That the Parliament pledges its support to National Cot Death Awareness Week from 8-14 May 2001; notes that changes in the way that babies are positioned for sleep has helped reduce cot deaths in Scotland by 60%; is concerned by the link between cigarette smoke and cot death, with an estimated seven-fold increase in risk for infants of women who smoke during pregnancy; further notes the Cot Death Trust’s warning that the 100% increase in 15-year-old girls smoking in the past 10 years could result in an alarming rise in the number of cot deaths, and therefore welcomes the Scottish Cot Death Trust's research at the Queen Mother's Hospital Glasgow to determine whether innovative motivational counselling offered to pregnant women will be more successful than traditional advice in helping these women give up smoking.
