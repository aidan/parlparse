*S2M-4982 Murdo Fraser: T in the Park Success at UK Festival Awards 2006—That the Parliament congratulates the organisers of T in the Park on winning "Best Major Festival" at the UK Festival Awards for the second year running; further congratulates the organisers of T in the Park for putting on the country’s largest and most successful music festival, putting on a spectacular festival for over 75,000 festival goers each day; applauds the festival organisers for making it the first festival to be "carbon neutral" and offset its carbon dioxide emissions by planting thousands of trees in three forestry projects in Scotland, Mexico and Uganda, making T in the Park the biggest carbon neutral festival in the world; welcomes the opportunity that T in the Park gives to new Scottish talent on the T Break Stage and Futures Stage; notes that T in the Park makes a massive contribution to the Scottish economy, bringing £7.5 million to the local economy in Perth and Kinross and another £10.5 million to Scotland’s tourism industry through worldwide media coverage, and wishes the organisers continued success with future T in the Park festivals.
