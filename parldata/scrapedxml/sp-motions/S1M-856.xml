*S1M-856# Mr Andrew Welsh: Assisted Area Status of Arbroath—That the Parliament notes with concern the exclusion of Arbroath from the revised Assisted Area boundary proposals; recognises that while significant gains have been made in recent years to restructure the local economy, the case for re-inclusion is strong, given the consistently high levels of unemployment, the significant dependence on a declining manufacturing sector, and the opportunities which exist to benefit from Regional Selective Assistance; understands that without Assisted Area status recent gains in Arbroath will be reversed, and invites the Scottish Executive to make representations to the Department of Trade and Industry to reinstate the excluded areas.
