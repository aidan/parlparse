*S1M-3937 Karen Gillon: Civil Service Jobs Dispersal-That the Parliament welcomes the progress made on the dispersal of civil service jobs throughout Scotland; believes that an assessment should be made of the benefits that dispersal has brought to the respective local economies; notes the pending dissolution of the Parliament and seeks early expedition of the timetable for future dispersals to ensure further progress; acknowledges that the dispersal selection criteria take account of cost, operational effectiveness, social, economic and environmental considerations and the position of staff, but nonetheless believes that future dispersals should ensure that all communities share in the economic and social benefits of the relocation policy.
