 *S2M-544# John Farquhar Munro: Access to Terrestrial TV Channels in Rural Areas-That the Parliament notes that residents in parts of the Highlands and Islands do not receive independent terrestrial TV channels unless they purchase an encryption card from BSkyB on a regular basis; further notes with concern that access to terrestrial channels in those communities with analogue relay systems will be removed when the analogue signal is switched off in 2010; believes that TV license payers should not have to pay more because of their geographical location, and considers that Her Majesty's Government should take action to ensure that all UK TV license payers have unrestricted access to terrestrial TV channels.
