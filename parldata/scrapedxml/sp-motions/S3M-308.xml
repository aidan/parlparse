*S3M-308 Karen Whitefield: Airdrie Health Resource Centre—That the Parliament believes that there must be no delay in the building of the new health resource centre in Airdrie, particularly in light of the recently publicised problems at the existing Airdrie Health Centre, where staff and patients have to endure cramped and unsuitable conditions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that any review of NHS Lanarkshire’s, A Picture of Health, document retains the previous commitment to build the new resource centre in Airdrie town centre.
