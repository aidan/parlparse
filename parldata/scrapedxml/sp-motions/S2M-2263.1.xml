 *S2M-2263.1# Christine Grahame: The Closure of Rural Primary Schools in Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2263) in the name of Alex Johnstone, insert at end "notes, however, that in the Members’ Business debate on motion S2M-1003 from Christine Grahame on school closures in the Scottish Borders on 25 March 2004 (Official Report col 7180-7181), David Mundell stated "It would be helpful to make clear the position—which is also my position—of my Conservative colleagues on Scottish Borders Council. They clearly believe that no school should close unless closure has the support of parents and the community. On the consultation proposals that have been put forward by Scottish Borders Council, it is already clear in most cases that if the closure of a school does not attract the support of parents and their communities, Conservative councillors on Scottish Borders Council will not support it", and further notes that, despite this statement of intent, Conservative councillors have voted, inter alia, for the closure of the following primary schools against the express wishes of parents and larger community, Cranshaws, Oxnam, Teviothead, Hutton, Burnmouth and Glen Douglas." Supported by: Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Fiona Hyslop* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
