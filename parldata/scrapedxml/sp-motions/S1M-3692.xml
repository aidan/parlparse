*S1M-3692 Sarah Boyack: Fire in the Old Town, Edinburgh-That the Parliament expresses its regret over the fire in the heart of the historic Old Town in Edinburgh; commends the work of all the firefighters from brigades across the south-east of Scotland that were involved in tackling the blaze and the commitment of council staff and the police who worked to protect lives and provide emergency accommodation for residents; notes the need for a swift outcome to the full investigation into the causes of the fire; acknowledges that the incident has left a "gaping wound in the heart of Edinburgh's Old Town"; encourages swift establishment of ownership of the thirteen buildings in the devastated area and safe demolition where required on safety grounds, and calls for consultation with the local community about the future of the site and for a sympathetic reconstruction which complements the character of this internationally acknowledged historic site.
