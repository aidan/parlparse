*S3M-6688 Ian McKee: UK Immigration Control—That the Parliament expresses deep concern at the UK Government’s plan to introduce a permanent cap on the number of non-EU migrants; considers that the Scottish economy, including public services, relies on immigrants from non-EU nations and that a cap would deprive sectors such as the oil and gas industry, catering and traditional industries of essential expertise; believes that a cap would threaten the number of skilled migrants employed in the NHS and schools, including doctors and teaching staff; considers that the Scottish economy has distinct needs and that a one-size-fits-all approach on immigration would harm the economy at a time when it is trying to grow out of recession; further believes that Scotland faces serious demographic challenges that can be partly addressed by increasing the number of skilled migrants; supports the comments made by the Federation of Small Businesses that a cap would prevent companies from filling vacancies in times of high demand; is of the view that Scotland should be exempt from any cap system, and calls on the UK Government to ensure that any immigration control reform is centred on economic and geographic need, not ideology.
