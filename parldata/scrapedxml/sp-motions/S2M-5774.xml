*S2M-5774 Ms Margaret Curran: Scotland in the United Kingdomâ€”That the Parliament believes that the United Kingdom is a mutually beneficial relationship for Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland and England; notes that devolution "is a process, not an event"; notes the additional powers that have been devolved to the Scottish Parliament since 1999; notes that the majority of people in Scotland oppose separation from the rest of the UK; believes that such a course would result in either cuts in vital public services or massive increases in taxation, and believes that Scotland should retain the benefits of being part of the UK while, where appropriate, increasing the powers available to the Scottish Parliament.
