 * S3M-6603 Mary Scanlon: Congratulations to Buckie RNLI on 150 Years of Life-saving Traditionâ€”That the Parliament congratulates all involved in the Buckie Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) station, which celebrates its 150th anniversary this year; commends this station, which was established in 1860 with the first boat named Miriam, which saw her first service on 2 December 1861, since which time Buckie has been the home to a further eight RNLI lifeboats, including the current Severn-class lifeboat, the William Blannin, which has been in service since may 2003; further commends all current and past crew and volunteers of this station for their dedication and commitment to saving lives, with the Buckie RNLI volunteer crew the busiest in the north east in 2009; notes that Buckie RNLI has received many bravery commendations over the years including being awarded a plaque of merit and a diploma by the Swedish Lifeboat Society when it rescued 19 crew of the Stockholm steamer, Frej; recognises the many other lives that have been saved by crew from this lifeboat station over the last 150 years as a result of the gallantry and commitment of the volunteers, and wishes continued success to the entire RNLI movement, which relies solely on public generosity to continue its 24/7 life-saving search and rescue work.
