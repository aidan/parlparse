*S2M-3530 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Holocaust Memorial Day—That the Parliament welcomes the unanimous decision of the United Nations General Assembly to designate 27 January as Holocaust Remembrance Day; notes that the Assembly urged the nations of the world to observe the day so that future generations will be spared acts of genocide; further notes that the resolution rejects Holocaust denial, encourages countries to develop educational programmes about the horrors of genocide and condemns religious intolerance, incitement, harassment or violence based on ethnic origin or religious belief, and urges all members to play their part in encouraging Holocaust Memorial Day activities in their constituencies and regions during January.
