*S2M-3274.1 Mr Brian Monteith: It’s Simply Not Cricket—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3274) in the name of Christine Grahame, leave out from first "notes" to end and inserts "believes that the English victory in the Ashes Test, coupled with Scotland’s 10th place in the world rankings, is helping to deliver a resurgence of interest in playing cricket in Scotland; further believes that there is something truly civilised about cricket, from the dulcet tones of Richie Benaud to the Yorkshire drawl of Geoffrey Boycott, the sense of fair play and sportsmanship between competing participants, the inclusive mixture of accents of all classes and regional accents and the physical bravery of facing a hard ball travelling at over 90 mph, to the skill of delivering a googly and the chess-like tactical fielding so that batsmen will play straight to silly point, all of which were on display during the Ashes Test; accepts that one group’s minority sport is another community’s central interest and that all should be given their place in the sun with excellence in any sport being reported by public service and commercial broadcasters; notes that this year’s Ashes Test brought a tear to many an eye, including many Scots’, and, in a world full of doom and gloom, made many people the world over feel proud to be British, and calls on members of the Scottish National Party to display greater generosity of spirit and for them to acknowledge that British sporting achievements which encourage young people to become physically active are to be welcomed rather than cheaply disparaged."
