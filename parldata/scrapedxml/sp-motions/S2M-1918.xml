*S2M-1918 Robert Brown: Powers over Casinos—That the Parliament notes the growing opposition to the Gambling Bill recently launched by Her Majesty’s Government in Westminster; believes that claims that the proposed regional casinos to be allowed under the Bill will boost urban regeneration are much over-stated; is concerned that the Bill is likely to lead to a significant rise in gambling addiction in Scotland; is aware that experience in countries like Australia shows that the problems occur disproportionately in deprived areas, and believes that key decisions on whether or not to allow the licensing of facilities like this should be a matter for decision in Scotland as part of other planning and licensing legislation and that consideration should be given to passing the appropriate powers to the Scottish Parliament in this area.
