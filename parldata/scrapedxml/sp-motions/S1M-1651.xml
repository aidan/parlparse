*S1M-1651 Fergus Ewing: Dentistry Services in Rural Scotland—That the Parliament believes that the setting of the threshold for NHS commitment payments to dentists at a gross earnings level of £25,000 a year penalises those dentists who practice in remote parts of Scotland who are unable to achieve the threshold earnings and therefore access the payment; notes that local access to the services of a dentist in such parts of Scotland is crucial but severely threatened by the current flat rate threshold; urges the Scottish Executive to press for a reduced threshold rate for those dentists operating in rural areas where it cannot be expected, given their patient base, that the threshold will ever be achieved and calls upon the Executive to ensure that people living in rural Scotland and the islands of Scotland are able to access NHS dental services locally.
