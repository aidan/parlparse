*S2M-287.2 Mr John Swinney: The Scottish Economy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-287) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from "endorses" to end and insert "recognises the enormous potential of the Scottish people; accepts that Westminster control of Scotland’s economic policy has been disastrous for Scottish living standards, population and national self-esteem; notes that, to reverse that trend, the Scottish government must create the maximum competitive advantage for the Scottish economy, and therefore calls on all parties to work together to win for the Parliament the full powers that all independent countries enjoy, in order to create a competitive advantage and the conditions for a prosperous and just Scotland."
