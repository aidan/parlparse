*S3M-632 Jackson Carlaw: Vale of Leven Hospital—That the Parliament rejects current proposals to downgrade Vale of Leven Hospital; commends the excellent work done by local campaigners who organised and participated in a highly successfully march attended by some 20,000 concerned local residents expressing their understandable opposition to the running-down of their community’s hospital; acknowledges that the campaign to maintain Vale of Leven Hospital’s current service levels continues unabated following the success of the march; congratulates Ms Vivien Dance of Hospital Watch on co-ordinating a petition, signed by 13,000 members of the local community, calling on the proposal to remove services from Vale of Leven Hospital to be rejected, and urges the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to use the powers she has to ensure that these proposals are indeed rejected as a matter of urgency.
