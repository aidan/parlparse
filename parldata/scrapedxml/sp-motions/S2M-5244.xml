*S2M-5244 Tommy Sheridan: Subversion of Democracy—That the Parliament condemns the undemocratic and underhand gerrymandering attempts of the Labour Party to subvert the democratic system of single transferable vote (STV) for local government elections; acknowledges that attempts to manipulate party names into blocks on the ballot paper would undermine the basic democratic principles of STV; recognises that this manipulation on the part of the Labour Party is a cynical electoral ploy to subvert the democratic process of the election and is due to the falling support for Labour councillors in local government, and therefore rejects utterly this underhand attempt to subvert the basic principles of democracy.
