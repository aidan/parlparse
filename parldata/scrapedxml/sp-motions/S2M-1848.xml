*S2M-1848 Robin Harper: Working Group on Hate Crime Reportâ€”That the Parliament notes the report of the Working Group on Hate Crime, published on 8 October 2004; calls on the Scottish Executive to act urgently on the 14 recommendations contained within the report, in particular to introduce a statutory aggravation as soon as possible for crimes motivated by malice or ill will towards an individual based on their sexual orientation, transgender identity or disability and to consider a statutory aggravation for domestic abuse with a view to combating violent crimes against women, and further calls on the Executive to act as expeditiously as possible on all those recommendations within the report that do not require primary legislation, including issues of training, awareness raising, alternative disposals, victim support, education and implementing attitudinal campaigns against prejudice using and learning from the "One Scotland. Many Cultures" and "see me" campaigns, focusing on the LGBT and disabled communities and to identify hate crime as one of the priorities to be addressed by Community Safety Partnerships.
