 *S2M-1960.2 Mr Kenny MacAskill: The Fire (Scotland) Billâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-1960) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end, " but, in so doing, recognises that the Fire Service has served Scotland and its communities well and has done so with firefighters, management, employers and local authorities working in partnership and therefore expresses concern about the proposed abolition of the Scottish Central Fire Brigade Advisory Council and its replacement with a non-statutory body, in conjunction with increased ministerial powers allowing for Scottish Executive action without a forum for proper debate and discussion, at a time when there is concern over the retention of control rooms and other aspects of the service."
