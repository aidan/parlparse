 *S1M-3879.2 Mr Brian Monteith: Educationâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-3879) in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from "in places" to end and insert "the response of the Scottish National Party has been to advocate policies which, whilst well-intentioned, would require placing requests to be abolished, catchment areas to be re-drawn and, therefore, parental choice to be considerably restricted, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to reaffirm its support for the placing request provisions of the Education (Scotland) Act 1981."
