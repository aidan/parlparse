*S1M-1700.2 Fiona Hyslop: Fuel Povertyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-1700) in the name of Jackie Baillie, leave out from "commends" to ends and insert "recognises the consistent calls from a number of parties for fuel poverty to be tackled as an early priority by the Executive, particularly in a country which has so much fuel wealth but also so much fuel poverty, is disappointed that the Housing (Scotland) Bill as currently drafted contains no targets for the eradication of fuel poverty or other measures previously indicated in earlier consultation documents, is further disappointed in the lack of detail, funding and timetabling of the Central Heating Initiative particularly for pensioners in areas where councils are considering wholesale stock transfer of council homes; recognises that Scotland should have its own Fuel Poverty Strategy, and calls on the Executive to address all these issues as a matter of urgency."
