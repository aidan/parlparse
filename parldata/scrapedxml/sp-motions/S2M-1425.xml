 *S2M-1425 Mark Ballard: Oil War and Climate Change-That the Parliament welcomes the conference, "Oil, War and Climate Change", which took place in Edinburgh on Saturday 29 May 2004; acknowledges that Tony Blair has said that climate change is the most important environmental issue facing the world today and that Her Majesty's Government's Chief Scientific Adviser, Sir David King, describes climate change as a bigger threat than global terrorism; believes that the crisis in Iraq is symptomatic of a greater battle for control of scarce resources, and calls on the Scottish Executive to step up its measures to tackle climate change by using its influence to promote environmental justice, expressing the will of the Scottish people on reserved issues including defence and energy, setting binding emissions reduction targets for Scotland and taking action to reduce Scotland's greenhouse gas emissions by cutting airport expansion and road building, investing in public transport, supporting environmentally-sustainable renewable energy developments and working towards energy efficient housing in Scotland.
