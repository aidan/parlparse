*S3M-228 Pauline McNeill: Women and Human Trafficking—That the Parliament expresses its continuing deep concern about the number of women who, falling victim to trafficking, are brought to Scotland and forced to work in our growing illegal sex trade; notes that more than 6,000 foreign women are already believed to be here through this route, many living a miserable existence as virtual prisoners of the criminal gangs who brought them to Scotland with promises of a new and better life, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work closely with the UK Government to ensure a well-resourced and co-ordinated inter-agency approach to ending sex slavery in Scotland and to provide to the women affected every possible chance to rescue themselves from those who would exploit them. Supported by: Alex Neil*
