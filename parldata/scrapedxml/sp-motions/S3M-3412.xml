 *S3M-3412 Jackie Baillie: Keep Respite Care at Fyneview—That the Parliament notes the proposal under consideration by Argyll and Bute Council to cut funding to the Fyneview Respite House in Lochgilphead; considers that there has been a lack of consultation with all service users and carers in Argyll and Bute regarding the future of Fyneview; understands that there are no other respite facilities for 18 to 64-year-olds in the area, making Fyneview an invaluable resource for the community; believes that Argyll and Bute Council should not terminate respite care at Fyneview, particularly as the Scottish Government has made an extra £9 million available to enable local authorities to provide additional services for carers and an extra 10,000 respite weeks on top of existing service, and therefore calls on the council to reject the proposal.
