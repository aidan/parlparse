*S3M-954 George Foulkes: The Future of Non-Formal Adult Education and Learning Opportunities in Edinburgh—That the Parliament recognises the concern expressed by the Edinburgh Adult Education Group about the effect of the proposed cuts on adult learning in the City of Edinburgh and the consequent impact on current and future services; notes that in 2006-07 more than 40,000 citizens in Edinburgh took part in non-formal adult learning opportunities delivered by the Council and voluntary sector providers; further notes that one in five adults in Scotland have difficulty with reading, writing and number work; recognises the pressure on council budgets but notes that proposals to substantially cut the budget of the City of Edinburgh Council’s Community Learning and Development department look likely to result in the loss of a significant number of City of Edinburgh Council Community Learning and Development posts, the closure of community centres including Riddles Court, which has been a city centre hub for adult learning activity for more than 100 years and cuts in revenue grant funding to voluntary sector adult learning providers, and recognises that the cuts will seriously diminish a good-quality service which has taken years to build, will result in the loss of services to the people of Edinburgh, will seriously limit the city’s ability to contribute effectively to its lifelong learning priority and will constrict the Parliament’s ability to deliver a skills strategy that provides opportunity for all people across Edinburgh.
