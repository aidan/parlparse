 * S2M-2281 Dr Jean Turner:Lack of NHS Board Fundingâ€”That the Parliament urges NHS boards to carry out immunisation, especially for mumps in the 13 to 25 years age group and for 17 to 20-year olds who were only offered a single dose of MMR through a catch-up campaign in 1988, who have not been offered a second dose and who have not been exposed to an infection of mumps due to low levels of infection during their primary school years; believes that GPs should not be hindered in administering immunisation due to the financial constraints of NHS boards, and further believes that the Scottish Executive should intervene to prevent delay in order to protect these young people.
