 *S3M-6036 Ian McKee: In Memory of Sir James Black—That the Parliament mourns the passing of one of Scotland’s greatest sons, Sir James Black, who was born in Uddingston, Lanarkshire, grew up in Fife and studied medicine at the University of St Andrews; recalls that he went on to become one of the greatest scientists of the 20th century, was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1988 and the Order of Merit in 2000; pays tribute to a life lived in service to humanity; recognises his scientific endeavour and outstanding contribution to medicine through the invention of propranolol, the first ever beta-blocker, at the time a major medical breakthrough in the treatment of angina and heart disease, which has gone on to save millions of lives worldwide; further recognises that the invention of cimetidine, the first ever H2 antagonist revolutionised the treatment of duodenal ulcers by removing the need for painful and costly surgery; contends that this brilliant man, who remained humble throughout his life despite his many considerable achievements, was indeed one of the finest products of the Scottish educational system; extends its sympathy and offers heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and former colleagues of Sir James Black, and believes that Scotland and the entire world owes him a massive debt of gratitude.
