*S2M-374 Christine Grahame: Common Ridingsâ€”That the Parliament supports the time-honoured informal arrangements whereby local police in the Scottish Borders temporarily hold up traffic while roads and streets are occupied in connection with the common ridings; notes that these festivals are seen by some police officers as an excellent opportunity for proactive community policing; notes that routes, timings and consequent road closures are traditional and therefore well known to residents and visitors; notes that this arrangement has worked well for decades; notes the current pressure from the Scottish Executive to formalise these arrangements for trunk roads since management of these roads was privatised and considers that the case for such formalisation is not proven; notes that the proposals in the draft guidance document were the result of consultation between Amey Highways Ltd, Dumfries and Galloway Council and police and excluded Scottish Borders representatives and, according to the Scottish Borders Council, "contains a number of errors and flaws"; notes that implementation of these requirements will place a significant financial burden on Scottish Borders Council, and therefore urges the Executive to reconsider these proposals after full consultation with Scottish Borders Council, the local police and all other interested parties.
