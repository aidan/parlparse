*S3M-6647 Jackie Baillie: Luss Visitor Centre—That the Parliament is concerned about the decision by the Loch Lomond and Trossachs National Park Authority to reject a community proposal to run the visitor centre in Luss; understands that Luss Community Council together with Luss Community Development Trust would have reopened and maintained the centre, creating training and employment opportunities; deeply regrets that the national park authority closed down the debate on the future of the centre at its meeting on 23 June 2010, at which it is believed that the community proposal was not fully discussed, by awarding preferred bidder status to a commercial operator from outwith the area, and calls on the Scottish Government to intervene and reverse this decision, which will see a public asset, paid for by the taxpayer, benefiting a commercial operator instead of the community of Luss.
