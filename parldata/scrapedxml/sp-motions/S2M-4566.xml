 *S2M-4566 Pauline McNeill: Barnardo’s and Support for Children Abused Through Prostitution—That the Parliament notes that a long-term study has been carried out by Barnardo’s into its work with children who have been exploited for sex or groomed for abuse through prostitution; understands that the research indicates that early intervention in the lives of these young people reduces their risk of exploitation and helps them achieve positive changes in their lives; commends Barnardo’s Glasgow Street Team for its work supporting children and young people at risk of sexual exploitation but is concerned that such support depends more on geography than need, and looks forward to local authorities across Scotland developing the protocols for working with young people at risk of sexual exploitation, as called for in the Scottish Executive’s 2003 strategy on vulnerable children. Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Jackie Baillie*, Maureen Macmillan*, Richard Lochhead*, Eleanor Scott*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Sarah Boyack*, Nora Radcliffe*, Murray Tosh*, Marlyn Glen*, Shiona Baird*, Robin Harper*, Tommy Sheridan*
