*S3M-2921.1 John Scott: A Fresh Start for Scottish Aquaculture—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2921) in the name of Michael Russell, after "competitor nations" insert "further supports efforts to advance the enviable international reputation of Scotland’s wild salmon stocks and, in light of the potential damage to the health and integrity of wild stocks caused by escaped farmed fish, believes that a robust commitment to reducing escapes and improved traceability must be a central element of the new Strategic Framework; recognises the continued threat posed by Gyrodactylus salaris to farmed and wild salmon stocks alike and, in light of the economic and ecological damage that an outbreak could cause, considers that further serious consideration must be given to measures aimed at reducing the likelihood of the parasite entering Scotland."
