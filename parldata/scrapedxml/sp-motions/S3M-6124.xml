*S3M-6124 Dave Thompson: Celtic 0 - 2 Ross County, Bucked by the Staggies—That the Parliament congratulates Ross County Football Club on its historic 2-0 Scottish Cup semi-final win over Celtic; welcomes the goodwill felt throughout the Highlands from this momentous win, with more County fans travelling from the Highlands to watch the match at Hampden Park than the entire population of Dingwall; notes that this win puts County on the map as a serious competitor, and wishes these Highland heroes all the best in the Active Nation Scottish Cup Final on 15 May 2010 back at Hampden Park.
