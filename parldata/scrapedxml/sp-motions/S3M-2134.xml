 *S3M-2134 Jamie Hepburn: Unacceptable Levels of Poverty in Scotland—That the Parliament notes with concern the Office for National Statistics publication, Scottish Households Below Average Income 2006-07, which shows some 17% of households in Scotland and 21% of children are living in relative poverty, with 12% of children living in absolute poverty; believes that these figures are morally unacceptable and represent a failure of successive UK governments to take poverty in Scotland seriously, and further believes that the Parliament and Scottish Government need the normal powers of independence, including powers over the welfare and taxation system, in order to tackle poverty in Scotland. Supported by: Alex Neil*, Bill Kidd*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Bashir Ahmad*, Brian Adam*, Stuart McMillan*, Christine Grahame*, Bill Wilson*, Rob Gibson*, Alasdair Allan*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Christina McKelvie*, Bob Doris*, Kenneth Gibson*, Willie Coffey*
