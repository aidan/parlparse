 *S3M-1169 George Foulkes: No Excuse for Elder Abuse—That the Parliament expresses concern that an estimated 7% to 9% of older people in Scotland are victims of at least one form of abuse; recognises that over 40% of victims suffer more than one kind of abuse; notes that abuse can occur in an older person’s own home, in care homes or in hospitals or through any service an older person receives; is aware that abuse is perpetrated by family members, neighbours and friends, professional care workers, informal carers, those who provide financial and legal services and others; seeks to reduce the level of abuse of older people and ensure that victims of elder abuse have access to appropriate support and legal resources, and continues to support and work with agencies to help raise awareness of this issue, remove the fear of abuse currently felt by older people and fulfil our obligation to do everything we can to protect those most vulnerable in society. Supported by: Cathie Craigie*, Hugh Henry*, Elaine Murray*, Christine Grahame*, Alex Neil*, Mike Pringle*, Andy Kerr*, Robin Harper*, Bill Kidd*, David Stewart*, Bob Doris*, Bashir Ahmad*, Cathy Peattie*, Marlyn Glen*, Kenneth Gibson*, Richard Baker*, Sarah Boyack*, Margaret Mitchell*, James Kelly*, Charlie Gordon*
