*S3M-2042 Murdo Fraser: Angus Post Office Closures—That the Parliament notes the recent publication of Post Office Ltd’s Area Plan Proposal for North East, Tayside and Fife; further notes with concern that there are a number of proposed post office closures in Angus, including proposed branch closures in Forfar and Southmuir, as well as reduced services in Glamis; believes that these post office branches perform an important role in the local communities that they serve; hopes that the branches will not be closed or have a reduced service as this will have a detrimental impact on the affected communities, and believes that the views of the postmasters and the communities affected by the proposed closures must be fully considered before any decisions are made on the future of the post office network in Angus.
