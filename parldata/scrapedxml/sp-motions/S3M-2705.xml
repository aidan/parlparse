*S3M-2705 Jackie Baillie: When Do Three Cs Make a B?—That the Parliament notes the publication of the Schools Estates Statistics 2008 on 30 September 2008, which lists those schools considered to be in most need of substantial repair; expresses considerable surprise at the absence of Dumbarton Academy from that list given the condition of its school buildings; notes that the three buildings that make up the school campus have all been designated as category C, which is "poor", and require almost £2 million of investment in emergency repairs; further notes that the three Cs became a "satisfactory B" suggesting, at best, a degree of confusion; acknowledges that the rebuilding of Dumbarton Academy was dropped by West Dunbartonshire Council from the phase one schools regeneration programme and appears now to have been dropped from the SNP government’s list of priorities; strongly believes that the time for woolly statements and promises of jam tomorrow from the SNP has now long passed, and calls on the Scottish Government to set out a clear timetable and funding path for the replacement of the school in the interests of this and future generations of young people in Dumbarton.
