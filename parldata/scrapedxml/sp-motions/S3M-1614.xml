*S3M-1614 Nicol Stephen: Fifth Anniversary of the Start of the Iraq War—That the Parliament observes that Thursday 20 March 2008 is the fifth anniversary of the start of the Iraq war; expresses its sympathy for the families and friends of the 174 British troops, over 4,000 troops from other countries and over 80,000 civilians who have been killed in the war so far; regrets that the war has involved the expenditure of £6.5 billion of taxpayers’ money; notes that the war was entered into on the basis of poor intelligence and insufficient planning and that the reasoning of Her Majesty’s Government in deciding to enter the war is still not known, and therefore calls for a full public inquiry to help to ensure that British forces are not involved in such ill-conceived campaigns in the future. Supported by: Iain Smith*, Liam McArthur*, Mike Rumbles*, Ross Finnie*, Robert Brown*, Alison McInnes*, Margaret Smith*, Jim Tolson*, Mike Pringle*, Jim Hume*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Jeremy Purvis*, Jamie Stone*, John Farquhar Munro*, Tavish Scott*
