*S2M-5227 Carolyn Leckie: St Andrew’s Day Anti-Racism Event—That the Parliament expresses its full support for the STUC’s St Andrew’s Day anti-racism event taking place on Saturday 25 November 2006 in Glasgow; encourages all MSPs and workers to support, publicise and attend the anti-racism march, which will set off from Blythswood Square at 11 am and culminate in a celebration of equality and diversity at the ABC in Sauchiehall Street, and believes that, in the present climate of violent attacks on members of minority ethnic communities and dawn raids on the families of those fleeing repression and torture, it is more important than ever to give a clear demonstration that Scotland stands together against racism.
