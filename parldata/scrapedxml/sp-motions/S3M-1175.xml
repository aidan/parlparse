 *S3M-1175 John Park: Winter Break for Scottish Football—That the Parliament supports the recent call from the Scottish Football Association Chief Executive, Gordon Smith, to introduce a winter break into Scottish football; notes that the concept of a winter break has support from respected figures in the game such as Alex Ferguson, Walter Smith and Craig Levein; recognises that European countries such as Germany have had successful winter shutdown periods for a number of years; believes that a winter break would be beneficial for players, protect playing surfaces and would show consideration to the safety of spectators travelling to matches, and hopes that discussions between Scottish football’s governing bodies can find a way forward on this issue.
