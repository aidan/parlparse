*S2M-5480 Mr Jamie Stone: SEERAD Animal Gatherings Order—That the Parliament notes that, if the Animal Gathering Order is introduced as proposed, it will introduce a licensing system under which event organisers would have to ensure a livestock standstill of 27 days before and 27 days after any show; further notes that it would require disinfectant facilities to be installed at every showground to clean and disinfect clothing and footwear that comes into contact with animal waste or mud and that it would also mean that all vehicles would need to be disinfected when entering and exiting show fields; believes that this will threaten the continuation of a great many livestock events across Scotland, events which are vital in maintaining the link between farmers, local communities and the general public; further notes that livestock bio-security problems rarely come from members of the public, but are instead almost always imported from other countries with poor bio-security and traceability systems, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to withdraw the order.
