*S2M-3859 Carolyn Leckie: Scottish Prison Service’s Telephone System—That the Parliament is extremely concerned that prisoners in Scotland, who receive extremely limited income, pay inflated rates for telephone calls in comparison with prisoners in England; notes that the rate is 11p per minute in Scotland and 6.5p per minute in England; recognises that maintaining relationships is key to increasing chances of rehabilitation; finds it abhorrent that Siemens is making excessive profits from a literally captive market, and believes that this inequality and exploitation should stop and that the Scottish Executive should seek to eradicate the inequity and unfairness of the Scottish Prison Service’s telephone systems.
