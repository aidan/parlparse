*S3M-5937 Christina McKelvie: Celebrating National Social Care Week and World Social Work Day—That the Parliament expresses its support for Scotland’s National Social Care Week, beginning on 15 March 2010, and World Social Work Day on 16 March 2010 and their celebration of the excellent work in often difficult circumstances done by social workers and social care workers throughout Scotland every day; notes that 163,000 people are employed in social work or social care in Scotland, that an estimated 650,000 Scots or their families use social work services every year and that 84% of users rate services as good quality and 76% say that they help them to live more independent lives; believes that, in a time of unemployment and recession and with a growing number of older people in the Scots population, social care and social work services are more vital and more valuable than ever, and endorses the continuing work by the Association of Directors of Social Work and the Scottish Social Services Council to positively raise the profile of the social work and social care professions through the Social Work Changes Lives campaign.
