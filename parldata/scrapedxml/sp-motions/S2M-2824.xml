 *S2M-2824 Cathy Jamieson: Tackling Serious and Organised Crime - Developing Strategic Partnerships—That the Parliament believes that tackling serious organised crime is key to a safer Scotland; recognises that criminal networks operate across local, national and international boundaries; commends the achievements of those responsible in Scotland for bringing to justice those engaged in serious organised crime; supports the Scottish Executive’s actions to achieve speedy and efficient court processes, its efforts to ensure greater co-operation with European and international criminal justice agencies and its plans to strengthen the status of the Scottish Drug Enforcement Agency; commends the success of the Crown Office in recovering £5.4 million since the introduction of the Proceeds Of Crime Act 2002, and will continue to support the sustained efforts of all those involved in disrupting and destroying the criminal networks which profit from inflicting violence and misery on communities in Scotland.
