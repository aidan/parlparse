 *S3M-7951 Cathie Craigie: Telecommunication Access for BSL Users—That the Parliament believes that the estimated 6,000 Deaf people in Scotland whose first or preferred language is British Sign Language (BSL) have a right to access telecommunications in a manner equivalent to the way in which hearing people use the phone every day and that current text-based solutions for Deaf people do not provide equal access; considers that new economic research demonstrates that if an open, competitive, UK-wide market for video relay services for BSL users were established, significant net benefits for the economy would be created, and calls on members to work with other parliamentarians across the UK to take appropriate action to address this matter and create a genuine opportunity for telecommunications equality for the BSL community for the first time.
