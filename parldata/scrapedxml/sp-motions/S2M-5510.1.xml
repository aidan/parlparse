 *S2M-5510.1 Murdo Fraser: Scottish Water—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5510) in the name of Mr Mark Ruskell, leave out from "further notes" to end and insert "believes that Scottish Water is failing its customers because it is inefficient, misallocates resources, overcharges customers, particularly businesses which were overcharged by £44 million every year, and holds back much-needed development; further believes that Scottish Water must be removed from state control and transferred into a "not-for-dividend" organisation in line with Welsh Water, and considers that this would enable Scottish customers to benefit from the lower costs and higher levels of service enjoyed by their counterparts south of the Border."
