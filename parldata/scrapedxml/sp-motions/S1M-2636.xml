*S1M-2636 Michael Russell: Roman Remains-That the Parliament notes the need to conserve, protect and exhibit the Roman heritage of Scotland; expresses concern that the Scottish Executive has given permission for part of Dere Street to be used by four-wheel drive vehicles, which is likely to lead to irreparable damage and loss of valuable artefacts, and congratulates the Antonine Guard Organisation on its continuing campaign on this and other matters such as the threat to the Cramond remains. Note: The member who lodged this motion has provided the following Latin translation: Ruinae Romanae Parliamento Scotorum, cum patrimonium illud a Romanis traditum conservandum, custodiendum, repraesentandum censeat, summa gravitate contra Scotorum proceres Executivos, ut vocantur, eloqui placet, quod eorum permissu partem eius viae, quae Dere Street nominatur, vehiculis per quattuor rotas impulsis conteri licet, id quod et damna irreparabilia et rerum pretiosissimarum ibi reperturarum iacturam consequi necesse est; item eidem Parliamento Antoninianae cohorti gratulari placet, quae et hoc periculum propulsare perseveraret et multa alia huiusmodi, velut illud detrimentum quod ruinis Cramondianis imminet
