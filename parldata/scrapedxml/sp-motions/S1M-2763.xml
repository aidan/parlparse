 *S1M-2763# Margaret Smith: Asylum Centre, RAF Turnhouseâ€”That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should give all possible assistance to Edinburgh City Council in relation to the possible development of an asylum seekers accommodation centre at the former RAF Turnhouse site in West Edinburgh, should do all it can to encourage the Home Office to engage in meaningful and timeous consultation with the council, local residents and elected representatives to allow a full and proper evaluation of the site and of the impact on the local community and on key council services such as housing, law enforcement, education and transport and should acknowledge also the present difficulties in relation to available public housing stock in the City of Edinburgh, and further considers that Scottish ministers should produce a national resettlement framework so that resettlement of asylum seekers from any Scottish centre would involve all areas of Scotland and would ensure distribution across all local authority areas.
