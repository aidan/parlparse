 S3M-3216 Patricia Ferguson: Tackling Under-age Drinking in Maryhill and Saracenâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the poster campaign aimed at tackling under-age drinking that has been launched at the Saracen Co-op in Glasgow and the posters that will be displayed in off-sales in Maryhill and Saracen; supports this initiative by Strathclyde Police and Glasgow Community and Safety Services, which aims to cut down on antisocial behaviour by reducing alcohol sales to under-18s; encourages all off-licences in these communities to participate in the campaign by being vigilant and making good use of the guidelines and resources provided to them as part of the initiative, and particularly welcomes the fact that, as part of the campaign, diversionary activity programmes will be available for young people in these areas. Supported by: Bill Butler, Mr Frank McAveety, Cathy Jamieson, Karen Whitefield, George Foulkes, Trish Godman, James Kelly, Richard Baker, Mary Mulligan, Des McNulty, David Whitton, Jackie Baillie, Paul Martin, Marilyn Livingstone, Pauline McNeill, Rhona Brankin, Cathy Peattie, Hugh Henry
