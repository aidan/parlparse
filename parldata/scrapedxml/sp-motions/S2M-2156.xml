*S2M-2156# Rob Gibson: Improving Scottish Air Ambulance Services—That the Parliament notes with concern a recent consultation by the Scottish Ambulance Service over the future of air ambulance services in Scotland from March 2006; further notes the intention to opt for a new provider with a radically different approach that uses one fewer aircraft to deliver the required work; welcomes the improved accommodation on the new types of aircraft on offer but highlights the deep concerns of Orkney Islands Council which has little confidence in these proposals without the retention of island-based fixed-wing aircraft in the new contract instead of relying on aircraft based in Aberdeen, Inverness or Glasgow; questions the availability of busy coastguard helicopters as back-up in bad weather; draws attention to Shetland Islands Council’s wish to retain an Islander aircraft from the inter-island air service for emergencies; voices concern over the need for a helicopter refuelling stop at Oban on missions from Barra to Glasgow that could itself be affected by severe weather; reiterates the evidence of records for gales and fog which show that an improved air ambulance service for the remote mainland and islands of Scotland requires a greater investment in appropriate aircraft, more of which should be based in the places most affected by severe weather, and believes that the Scottish Executive should ensure that a best value contract does not place lives in greater jeopardy under the proposed new contract.
