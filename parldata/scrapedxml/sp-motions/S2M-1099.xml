 *S2M-1099 Chris Ballance: Road Safety and World Health Day, 7 April 2004-That the Parliament notes that the World Health Organisation (WHO) has designated road safety as the theme of World Health Day 2004 on 7 April 2004; further notes that the WHO has indicated that 1.2 million people die from road traffic injuries each year; notes that the WHO predicts that by 2020 road traffic injuries will be a greater killer globally than malaria, tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS and that, despite excellent progress in tackling the problem, Scotland's annual death toll from road traffic remains unacceptably high, and supports World Health Day 2004 and measures to improve road safety in Scotland.
