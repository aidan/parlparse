 S3M-4554 Bill Wilson: Brambles as good as Blackberries—That the Parliament believes that Scotland’s cultural and linguistic heritage is something to be proud of, noting the many and varied traditional names given to food grown in Scotland, such as brambles, neeps, tatties and syboes; believes that the Year o Hamecomin is an ideal time to celebrate Scotland’s cultural and linguistic heritage; encourages local and national retailers to consider making wider use of traditional names for food products in labelling and point-of-sale material, and believes that such a move could enhance the quality of service that shops offer both local customers, who would see their own terms being used and respected, and visitors from elsewhere, who would be better aware of the richness and diversity of Scotland’s culture.
