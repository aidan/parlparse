*S1M-1183 Tommy Sheridan: Eniola Adewale—That the Parliament believes that the recent removal of Nigerian asylum seeker Eniola Adewale to Leicester and the subsequent rejection of his application for asylum was due to the fact that he has consistently campaigned in Scotland for decent living conditions for asylum seekers and against the climate of racism, abuse and ignorance confronting asylum seekers; believes that the treatment Eniola has received amounts to an abuse of human rights and his freedom of expression and an abuse of Scottish hospitality; calls upon the Home Secretary to revoke his rejection of Eniola Adewale’s application for asylum immediately on the grounds that his deportation to Nigeria constitutes a grave risk to his life and liberty, and agrees to support Eniola’s appeal against deportation.
