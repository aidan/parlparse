 *S1M-3101# Bill Butler: Local Authority Funding—That the Parliament commends the initiative of Glasgow City, Argyll and Bute, Dundee City, Inverclyde, Midlothian and West Dunbartonshire councils in commissioning a special report from Professor Arthur Midwinter, Grant Distribution and the Mismatch Effect: An Assessment of its Impact on Council since Reorganisation, which concludes that there is "clear evidence of the erosion of grant income" between 1996-97 and 2001-02 in these local authority areas; acknowledges the report’s view that the flawed reorganisation of local government ordered by the last Conservative government is the root cause of a situation where, in these six local authority areas in the period, government grants fell by 4.8% in real terms compared to an average drop of 1.2% across Scotland’s councils and council tax rose by 20% in real terms compared to an average of 16%, and believes that the Scottish Executive should seriously consider accepting the central recommendation of the report, namely that it should provide a supplementary grant of £50 million to redress this historical mismatch of funding: £32 million to Glasgow, £5 million to Dundee, £3.4 million each to Midlothian and Argyll and Bute and £2.5 million each to West Dunbartonshire and Inverclyde respectively, such funding arising from a more equitable distribution of grant increases in the future.
