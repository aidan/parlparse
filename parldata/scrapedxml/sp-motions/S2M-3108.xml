 *S2M-3108# Alex Fergusson: Munchausen’s Syndrome by Proxy—That the Parliament notes the decision of the General Medical Council (GMC) to strike off Professor Sir Roy Meadow after finding him guilty of serious professional misconduct; further notes that Professor Meadow coined the term Munchausen’s Syndrome by Proxy (MSbP) in 1977 and, in his role as an expert witness, gave evidence on MSbP which led to many children being removed from their natural mothers and subsequently being "freed" for adoption; further notes that the Scottish Children’s Reporter Administration conducted an internal review of cases involving MSbP which many commentators have described as a whitewash, and believes, in light of the GMC’s decision, that the Scottish Executive should instigate a fully independent inquiry into all cases in which MSbP was a significant factor in a court or panel’s determination.
