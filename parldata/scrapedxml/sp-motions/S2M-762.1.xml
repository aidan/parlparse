*S2M-762.1 Miss Annabel Goldie: Delivering a Quick, Effective Youth Justice System-As an amendment to motion (S2M-762) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end; "; in particular considers that at the heart of effective youth justice is the Children's Hearings system; calls, therefore, for the Children's Hearings system to be better resourced with a wider range of disposals in order that hearings can perform a more effective role in relation to youth justice and assist in the wider function of community mediation, and further calls on the Scottish Executive to alleviate the burden on the Children's Hearings system by sending persistent 14 and 15-year-old offenders to youth courts, while keeping 16 and 17-year-olds in adult courts."
