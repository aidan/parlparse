 *S1M-2817 Richard Lochhead: Labour Administration of Aberdeen City Council-That the Parliament condemns Aberdeen City Council's Labour administration for its flagrant disregard of the citizens of the city by voting to (a) allow the Lord Provost to continue to take a friend on overseas trips, (b) close the Grandholm Bridge, which will once again bring gridlock to the city and (c) abolish the meals-on-wheels service and replace it with a fortnightly frozen food delivery and, in light of these contemptuous actions, calls on the council's Labour administration to resign immediately.
