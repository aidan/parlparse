*S2M-4822&lt;&gt; Ms Sandra White: Graduate Debt—That the Parliament notes the report published today by the Reform think tank which finds that UK-wide graduate debt has risen by 318% since 2000 and that graduates across the United Kingdom face a bleak financial future; further notes recent Royal Bank of Scotland research which found that, of all UK cities, Glasgow has, at 60%, the second-highest proportion of its students having to work part-time, and considers that the Graduate Endowment fee should be abolished and student loans replaced by grants as the best way to remove the debt burden and allow the full range of young people to participate in higher education.
