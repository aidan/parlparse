*S3M-1136 Helen Eadie: 100 Years on, Remembering Emmeline Pankhurst—That the Parliament remembers all those who fought over the years for the right to vote and particularly remembers that 100 years ago Emmeline Pankhurst, the leading suffragette and founder of the Women’s Social and Political Union in the battle for the right to vote, wrote powerfully on 18 February 1908 from Holloway jail giving her vivid account of the drudgery and misery, meagre rations, coarse clothing with its convicts’ arrows and her stark surroundings and notes her subsequent removal to hospital; further notes that on 10 January 1918 the House of Lords approved the Representation of the People Bill giving married women aged over 30 the vote and the US House of Representatives in Washington voted in favour of women’s suffrage, and hopes that political parties across the country will celebrate the involvement of women in politics.
