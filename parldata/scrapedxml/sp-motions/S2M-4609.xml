 *S2M-4609 Cathy Peattie: Antonine Wall and Kinneil Museum—That the Parliament welcomes the support pledged to the World Heritage Site bid for the Antonine Wall by East Dunbartonshire, Falkirk, Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and West Dunbartonshire; notes that this is part of a multinational bid incorporating Germany, Austria, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary, linking sites that mark the boundaries of the Roman empire; believes that the Antonine Wall, running from Bo’ness in the east to Old Kilpatrick in the west, is an outstanding archaeological treasure, not just nationally but internationally, and should be promoted as such; is therefore concerned that Kinneil Museum, at the eastern end of the wall near to the remains of a roman fortlet, is threatened with downgrading or closure; notes that about 2,000 people have signed a petition backing the campaign to save the museum, and calls on Falkirk Council to heed local and international voices and recognise that Kinneil Museum is a unique resource that should be retained and enhanced. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
