*S3M-3959 Christina McKelvie: Iraqi Trade Unions—That the Parliament welcomes Abdullah Muhsin of the General Federation of Iraqi Workers to Scotland and congratulates NASUWT on sponsoring his visit to the Scottish Trades Union Congress Annual Congress 2009; believes that he was supposed to bring representatives of Iraqi and Kurdish teachers’ unions with him but that their visas to leave Iraq and enter the United Kingdom were not granted because the Iraqi Government has seized control of the teachers’ unions under decision 3 of the Governing Council, which was appointed by the United States of America as the nominal authority in Iraq between July 2003 and June 2004 supposedly to force elections on these unions that have held conferences and elected their leadership since 2003, and condemns the UK Government for its actions in refusing these visas and thereby supporting the suppression of trade unions in Iraq.
