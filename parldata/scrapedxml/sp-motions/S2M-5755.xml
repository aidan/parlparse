*S2M-5755 Stewart Stevenson: Pi Day—That the Parliament recognises 14 March (3/14 when written in the US convention) to be international Pi Day and also the birthday of the famous theoretical physicist, Albert Einstein; further recognises that the mathematical constant Pi (π), which has a numerical value approximately equal to 3.14159 and represents the ratio of a circle’s circumference to its diameter, is one of the most significant numbers in mathematics with countless uses in engineering and physics and numerous practical applications within the construction, manufacturing, engineering, telecommunications and computing industries, and further recognises the intellectual intrigue provided by the number for mathematicians and mathematics enthusiasts in Scotland and throughout the world, since its first calculation by the Babylonians several thousand years ago, and the entitlement of such people to a day to celebrate their arithmetical passion for this, one of the few numbers to have been proved to be transcendental and for which there is thus no possible algebraic expression.
