*S3M-2002 Richard Lochhead: Common Agricultural Policy Health Check—That the Parliament, noting the European Commission’s legislative proposals for the health check of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform, welcomes the Scottish Government’s commitment to consult on these proposals, and on the longer-term implementation of CAP in Scotland, in order that agriculture remains a dynamic and competitive industry with farmers playing their full part in achieving the Scottish Government’s purpose of sustainable economic growth through food production and environmental management of our agricultural land.
