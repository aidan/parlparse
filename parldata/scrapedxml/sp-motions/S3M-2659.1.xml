 *S3M-2659.1 Mary Mulligan: Working Together on Child Poverty and the Minimum Wage—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2659) in the name of Bob Doris, leave out from "Labour MSP Mary Mulligan" to end and insert "when the Conservative Party used filibustering in an attempt to talk out the National Minimum Wage Bill during its crucial final stage in the House of Commons, not one SNP MP stayed to vote to help ensure its passage or even register support despite the party’s rhetoric before and since on this issue; considers that the personalised criticism that the intention in submitting amendment S3M-2621.1 was to seek to "engage in party politics on the issue of child poverty" and break unity on the issue of the national minimum wage to be laughable, given not only the partisan and self-congratulatory motion which it alters, but also the tone, tenor and standard of SNP motions in this Parliament more generally, including on the subject of child poverty and the national minimum wage."
