*S1M-2568 Mr Mike Rumbles: International Year of Mountains-That the Parliament notes that 2002 is the International Year of Mountains; supports the event's aim of raising public awareness of the high ecological value and wider socio-economic significance of mountains; recognises the global importance of Scotland's mountainous areas, particularly their role in shaping the nation's image and culture, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to support the year's celebrations by fostering debate between local communities, farming interests, rural businesses, public bodies, and non-governmental organisations on how to maximise the mutual benefit from activities aimed at safeguarding, enhancing and promoting enjoyment of Scotland's mountain heritage.
