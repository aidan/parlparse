*S1M-1404 Phil Gallie: District Courtsâ€”That the Parliament expresses its concern over the detrimental effects of the current strike being undertaken by UNISON members in Glasgow District Court on the administration of justice and calls upon the Scottish Executive to do everything in its power to resolve the current situation and in the longer term to transfer the responsibility for administration of district courts to the Scottish Courts Administration and to seek to negotiate a no strike agreement with court staff to put them on a par with police and prison officers.
