*S1M-1396 Fergus Ewing: Dispensing of Prescription Only Medicines by Veterinary Surgeons-That the Parliament believes that it is essential for animal welfare and for farmers and others who look after livestock and other animals that veterinary surgeons retain the privilege to dispense prescription only medicines; further believes that the abolition of the right of veterinary surgeons to dispense prescription only medicines would cause severe practical difficulties and create real risks that some animals will not be treated thus compromising their welfare, and further believes that the removal of this right would jeopardise the viability of provision of care for some animals, given low commercial animal values, and that the current system allows planned health visits by veterinary surgeons to farms involving routine preventative and treatment medicines recommended and sold by the veterinary practice so as to cross-subsidise emergency illness care to individual animals at rates which would otherwise not be independently viable.
