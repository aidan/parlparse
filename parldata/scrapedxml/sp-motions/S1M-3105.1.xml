*S1M-3105.1 Bruce Crawford: National Waste Strategy-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3105) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "supports" to end and insert "notes that in February 2000 the European Commission applied for a declaration that the UK had failed to fulfil its obligations in particular under Council Directive 75/442/EEC of 15 July 1975 on waste, and that the UK accepted this failure and the European Court of Justice found the UK (including Scotland) in breach of a number of waste related Directives; further notes that the National Waste Strategy was published in 1999 together with a commitment to the production of Area Waste Plans by the end of 2000 and that this target date was subsequently extended to a final deadline of March 2002; is concerned with the slow progress being made towards the better management of waste in Scotland, and believes that in order to speed up progress the Executive must firstly introduce mandatory targets, on an all Scotland basis, of 30% to 35% for recycling and composting of household waste by 2010."
