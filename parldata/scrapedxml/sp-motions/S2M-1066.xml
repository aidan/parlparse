 *S2M-1066 Murdo Fraser: Strip Stamps on Scotch Whisky-That the Parliament deplores the announcement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer that Her Majesty's Government will introduce tax stamps on sprits throughout the UK; recognises that tax stamps will impact directly on the Scottish whisky industry; supports the statement by the Scotch Whisky Association that the introduction of tax stamps on whisky will impose financial pain on legitimate businesses; believes that a tax stamp system will be an ineffective means of combating fraud and illicit trade while imposing substantial costs and practical problems on the industry, particularly in relation to labelling and storage, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make immediate representations to Her Majesty's Government against the introduction of tax stamps. Supported by: Phil Gallie*, Mr Ted Brocklebank*, Alex Fergusson*, Bill Aitken*, Margaret Mitchell*, David McLetchie*, Murray Tosh*, Mr David Davidson*, Miss Annabel Goldie*, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton*
