 *S2M-2730 Alex Neil: No Confidence in HM Chief Inspector of Prisons—That the Parliament notes the request by Alex Neil MSP to attend the media briefing by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons on 26 April 2005 within Kilmarnock Prison, the purpose of which was to provide a briefing on the November 2004 investigation into the prison; notes that Mr Neil’s request was refused; condemns this action by the Chief Inspector as being totally undemocratic and treating the Parliament with contempt; considers that the issuing of this report to the media 24 hours before it was provided to MSPs is further evidence of the contemptuous way in which the Chief Inspector is treating the Parliament, and, in light of this along with his failure to deal adequately with the crises in Kilmarnock Prison, now calls on him to consider his position.
