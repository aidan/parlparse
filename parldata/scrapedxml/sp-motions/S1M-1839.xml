*S1M-1839# Mr Brian Monteith: Right to Faith-based Education—That the Parliament notes the provisions of Article 2 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), which states that "no person shall be denied the right to education. In the exercise of any functions which it assumes in relation to education and to teaching, the state shall respect the rights of parents to ensure such education and teaching in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions"; supports the principle of maintained denominational schools, as first introduced by the Education Act 1918, which ensures that such education and teaching is made available by local authorities for members of the Roman Catholic faith, and believes that, should this principle be found to be in contravention of any other article of the ECHR, all necessary steps should be taken to ensure that such faith-based educational provision continues to be available to children in Scotland in line with the wishes of parents.
