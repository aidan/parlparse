 *S3M-7479 Stuart McMillan: People’s Millions Success for OYTS—That the Parliament congratulates Ocean Youth Trust Scotland (OYTS) on winning its People’s Millions contest, which took place on Monday 22 November 2010; notes that OYTS has won £50,000 of the People’s Millions, which will allow 84 young people to take part in Sea Change in Young People, a project that aims to inspire positive change in those involved through the challenge of adventure under sail; considers that this will enable them to connect with Scotland’s spectacular coastline in a way that they have never done before; acknowledges the hard work of everyone at OYTS involved in securing this funding, and hopes that all the young people who take part in the project enjoy their adventure under sail.
