*S3M-1051 Robert Brown: Establishment of a Commission on Trump Planning Application—That the Parliament instructs the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to establish an independent, short-life commission to investigate and report to the Parliament on all aspects of the Scottish Government’s handling of the planning application for the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire; agrees that the commission should be instructed to conclude its work within 28 days, with a view to re-establishing confidence in the independence and robustness of the planning process and to enable the application to be determined fairly and rapidly and with a lessened risk of legal challenge; authorises the commission to examine the decision-making process of ministers and officials, the legal advice relied upon and the transparency of their actions; calls on the Scottish Government to make available to the commission all relevant briefing papers, notes, transcripts, emails and records to enable the commission to reach conclusions and obtain answers more effectively and comprehensively than can be accomplished through the more restricted process of formal parliamentary questions or freedom of information requests, and requests the Scottish Government to require officials and ministers to co-operate fully and openly with the commission.
