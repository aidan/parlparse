*S2M-4684 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Abertay Redundancy—That the Parliament notes with deep concern the University of Abertay Dundee’s decision to make a member of its academic staff compulsorily redundant and its refusal to consider redeployment, voluntary severance, early retirement or other mutually acceptable options suggested by the employee’s trade union, the University and College Union (UCU), and considers that such behaviour flies in the face of good employment practice and is likely to damage the university’s reputation and make it harder for it to recruit good academic staff in future.
