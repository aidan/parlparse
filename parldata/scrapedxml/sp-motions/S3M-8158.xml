*S3M-8158 Robin Harper: National Trust for Scotland—That the Parliament commends the progress made by Sir Kenneth Calman and the management team at the National Trust for Scotland in what it sees as their positive response to the trust’s 2010 strategic review; recognises the charity’s genuine efforts to engage with its 310,000 members as it modernises and streamlines its governance, most notably in conducting a ballot for the election of trustees to serve on its new board; further recognises and appreciates what it considers to be the central and crucial role fulfilled by the trust in safeguarding and ensuring access to Scotland’s natural and cultural treasures; welcomes Sir Kenneth’s decision to attend the Parliament on 16 March 2011, on a visit sponsored by Pauline McNeill MSP, to address and engage with members directly and openly on what has been achieved and is still to be done, and believes that the trust is in a unique position to provide independent, expert advice on a range of policy matters linked to heritage. R Supported by: Mike Pringle*, Kenneth Gibson*, Patrick Harvie*, Jackie Baillie*
