 *S2M-3377.1 Murdo Fraser: The Scottish Economyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-3377) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from "regrets" to end and insert "notes, however, that under the stewardship of the Scottish Executive economic growth has consistently trailed that of the United Kingdom; believes that independence would be a costly and unwelcome distraction from the concrete action that can be taken within the devolved framework to boost economic growth, and therefore urges the Executive to cut red tape, privatise Scottish Water, increase investment in transport and cut business rates at the earliest possible opportunity."
