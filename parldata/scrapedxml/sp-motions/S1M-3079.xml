*S1M-3079# Mr Murray Tosh: Trunk Road Improvements-That the Parliament welcomes the commitment announced by the Scottish Executive on 27 March 2001 to implementing trunk road improvements on the A75 and A77 trunk roads and its decision to commission further studies of proposed overtaking and climbing lane opportunities on both roads in the A75/A77 ports approach study; and believes that the Executive should include any additional schemes that its further studies validate for inclusion in the forward programme of trunk road improvements without deleting or deferring projects already identified for implementation.
