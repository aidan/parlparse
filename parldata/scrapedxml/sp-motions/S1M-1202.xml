 *S1M-1202 Mr Kenneth Gibson: Council Tax Collection—That the Parliament notes the content of Citizens Advice Scotland’s report Won’t Pay or Can’t Pay – The Real Cost of Scotland’s Council Tax Debt; is aware that administrative problems, such as delays in processing forms or sending out bills, billing errors and over-complicated forms result in a debt crisis for those on low incomes; realises that lack of communication between local authority departments and other agencies leads to delays in people receiving their entitlement to council tax benefit despite receiving related benefits such as housing benefit or income support; is concerned that the process of proceeding straight to formal debt collection without prior negotiation only increases overall indebtedness, making it harder for the debtor to make reasonable and affordable repayment plans; seeks from the Scottish Executive a commitment to work with local authorities to identify practical ways of preventing council debt occurring as a result of their own administrative processes, looking in particular at the ability to pay and the development of corporate debt strategies that will not make an individual’s debt worse, and calls for a debate on why many Scots are unable, rather than unwilling, to pay council tax debt.
