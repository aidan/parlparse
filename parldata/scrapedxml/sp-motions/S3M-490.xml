*S3M-490 Rhoda Grant: Call for First Minister to Apologise to the Scottish Crofting Foundation—That the Parliament believes that the First Minister should apologise to the Scottish Crofting Foundation for excluding it from the summit held on 13 September 2007 on safeguarding a sustainable food supply for Scotland; further expresses surprise that the Scottish Crofting Foundation was not told officially that the summit had been arranged and, despite contacting the Scottish Government, was still not invited to attend; believes that crofting plays a vitally important role in the food industry, given that crofters from all over the highlands and islands supply thousands of store sheep, lambs and calves annually as well as providing lambs for direct export to continental Europe, and considers that the Scottish Government should invite the Scottish Crofting Foundation to any future meetings relating to the food industry in Scotland. Supported by: Peter Peacock*, David Stewart*
