 *S3M-4426 Robin Harper: Successes of the Scottish Forest Alliance Project—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement of the successes to date of the Scottish Forest Alliance, one of the largest tree planting, native woodland creation and regeneration programmes in recent years; recognises that almost 3.5 million trees have been planted or allowed to regenerate naturally over the last nine years of the project, some 1,059 trees for every day of the project so far; notes that a total of 3,297 hectares have been planted or allowed to regenerate naturally with native trees, an area more than one and a half times the size of the city of Inverness; further notes that the 14 project sites throughout Scotland welcome almost half a million visitors each year, more than the Parliament; recognises the project’s important role in regenerating Scotland’s fragmented native woodlands, restoring the landscape and wildlife of these woodlands and promoting and enabling local employment and community involvement, and congratulates the Woodland Trust Scotland, RSPB Scotland, Forestry Commission Scotland and BP for collaborating on such a successful project.
