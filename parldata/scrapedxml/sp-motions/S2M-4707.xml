*S2M-4707 Ms Sandra White: Best Wishes and Hopes for Success to Yorkhill Hospital’s Staff Representing Scotland in the Eurospital 2006 Football Tournament in Portugal—That the Parliament sends its best wishes and hopes for the success of Yorkhill Hospital’s staff team which will represent Scotland in the Eurospital 2006 football tournament to be held on 24, 25 and 26 August in Coimbra in Portugal; recognises that this tournament brings together teams of European hospital workers from 10 nations across the continent in friendly rivalry and promotes international understanding and solidarity among health staffs of varied cultural backgrounds; hopes for the continued success of the tournament, now in its fourteenth year, and believes that the hard work, dedication and skill of the Yorkhill staff gives them a chance of bringing the trophy back to Scotland.
