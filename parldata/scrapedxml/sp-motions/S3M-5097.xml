 *S3M-5097 David Whitton: Local Government Boundary Commission Decision to Keep Princes Gate in East Dunbartonshire—That the Parliament welcomes the revised recommendations published by the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland, proposing that Princes Gate housing estate in Bishopbriggs remain within East Dunbartonshire; notes that the revised recommendations will also retain the site to the rear of the Aldi supermarket designated for affordable housing, the loss of which would have had a detrimental effect on East Dunbartonshire Council’s being able to make provision for affordable housing, allow children from Princes Gate the opportunity to continue their education with siblings and friends in East Dunbartonshire Council schools and allow children living in Princes Gate in receipt of special needs provision to continue to receive this from East Dunbartonshire Council social work services; congratulates the residents of Princes Gate for conducting a disciplined and determined campaign to get to this point, and hopes that all residents and elected representatives of Princes Gate residents in East Dunbartonshire Council, the Scottish Parliament and the UK Parliament make representation to the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland prior to the close of consultation on 28 January 2010.
