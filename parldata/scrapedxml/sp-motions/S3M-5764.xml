*S3M-5764 Jackie Baillie: Cairndow Community Childcare Facility—That the Parliament is concerned about the proposal by Argyll and Bute Council to withdraw funding from the Cairndow Community Childcare facility; understands that the centre, which is in a rural area, is one of the few local childcare facilities that provides both pre-school and wrap-around care; considers that the withdrawal of funding may result in higher care charges being introduced that will negatively impact on families in the area, and calls on Argyll and Bute Council to reconsider this proposal.
