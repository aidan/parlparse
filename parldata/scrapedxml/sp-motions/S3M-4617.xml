*S3M-4617 Elaine Smith: Widening Access to the Arts—That the Parliament congratulates the Royal Ballet for putting on five days of shows in Havana during its historic first visit to Cuba; commends the company’s Cuban star, Carlos Acosta, for being instrumental in promoting this tour; appreciates that the shows have included a tribute to Cuban ballet legend Alicia Alonso who, at 88, remains the head of the Cuban national ballet; notes that, while the shows were sold out within hours of ticket release, arrangements were made to show the performances on giant screens outside the theatre; further notes that this is the first major ballet company to perform in Havana since the Bolshoi almost 30 years ago; observes that in 1959 Fidel Castro made a commitment to make the arts available to everyone with the result that, under the system of state funding, the ballet became a key part of everyday Cuban culture, and hopes that this successful visit signals a deepening political and cultural rapprochement between the United Kingdom and Cuba.
