 *S3M-4636 Sandra White: Pensioner Poverty—That the Parliament notes the publication of European Commission statistics showing that nearly a third of pensioners are living in poverty; acknowledges that concerted action is required to tackle this situation; further notes that the Work and Pensions Committee’s review of the UK Government efforts to tackle pensioner poverty is due to be published on 30 July 2009, and hopes that it will serve to shape future UK Government strategy toward pensioner poverty.
