*S2M-4396 Campbell Martin: North Ayrshire Council Garden Tidy Scheme—That the Parliament condemns the action of the Labour administration of North Ayrshire Council in axing the local authority-run Garden Tidy Scheme, which previously allowed pensioners and vulnerable members of the North Ayrshire community to have their grass cut free of charge; is concerned that removal of the scheme has resulted in many elderly people being approached on their doorsteps by unknown individuals offering expensive grass cutting services and that for many elderly residents this has been an unsettling and worrying experience; acknowledges that those who were previously in receipt of services under the Garden Tidy Scheme are not fit enough to maintain their gardens and cannot afford to employ professional gardeners, and therefore calls on North Ayrshire Council’s Labour councillors to reverse their decision and to reinstate the Garden Tidy Scheme.
