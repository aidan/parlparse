 *S3M-3799 Elaine Smith: EHRC Helpline Advice Service Cuts—That the Parliament is concerned at the Equality and Human Rights Commission’s (EHRC) proposal to cut 50 posts from its helpline advice service, including the restructuring of its Scotland office resulting in the loss of four full-time equivalent posts; believes that this decision is ill timed with the number of calls to the EHRC helpline increasing due to the recession; is further concerned that women, people from black and minority ethnic backgrounds, disabled people and carers will be particularly disadvantaged by this decision, and calls on the EHRC to review its plans and to do more to promote this service so that those people already at a disadvantage are not further disadvantaged by these inopportune cutbacks.
