 *S2M-1343 Tommy Sheridan: Israel and War Crimes-That the Parliament notes the continued illegal occupation of Palestinian territories by the Israeli Army and the indiscriminate killing of men, women and children within the occupied territories and the deliberate destruction of over 3,000 Palestinian homes over the last three-and-a-half years; condemns the most recent killings of 19 Palestinians by the Israeli army, including 15-year-old Asmaa al Mughayer and her 13-year-old brother Ahmed who were shot through the head by Israeli Army snipers while on the roof of their home; believes, given the indiscriminate killings and deliberate demolition of so many Palestinians' homes, that the Israeli Government, and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, in particular, are guilty of war crimes through breach of Article 53 of the Geneva Convention, which states that "Any destruction by the Occupying Power of real or personal property belonging individually or collectively to private persons, or to the State, or to other public authorities, or to social or cooperative organizations, is prohibited, except where such destruction is rendered absolutely necessary by military operations"; believes that Israel's actions are not justified military operations and therefore condemns its actions as unacceptable war crimes; agrees to communicate its disgust over the Israeli Government's actions to the British Prime Minister and directly to the Israeli embassy, and further agrees to investigate a Scottish parliamentary boycott of Israeli goods in protest at their actions.
