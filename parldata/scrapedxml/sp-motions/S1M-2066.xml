*S1M-2066# Mary Scanlon: Men's Health Week, Scotland: 7-14 September 2001—That the Parliament pledges its support for Men’s Health Week, Scotland, from 7 to 14 September 2001; acknowledges the collaboration between Men’s Health Forum Scotland, health boards, the business sector, community health initiatives and the voluntary sector to publicise Men’s Health Week, Scotland; recognises that the majority of factors which impact negatively on men’s health are preventable; notes that 75% of suicides are male and almost 60% of premature male deaths are from coronary heart disease and cancer, yet men attend their GPs less than half as often as women; further notes that co-ordinated efforts are necessary to ensure that men take responsibility for their health and that services commit themselves to the challenge of working with men, and believes that MSPs should support the collaboration by promoting positive messages about men’s health and Men’s Health Week, Scotland, thereby encouraging more men to take responsibility for their own health and well-being.
