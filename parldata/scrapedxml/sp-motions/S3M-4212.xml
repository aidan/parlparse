*S3M-4212 Margo MacDonald: Language Teaching at Edinburgh Universityâ€”That the Parliament is concerned that the University of Edinburgh has announced its intention to cut its budget for the teaching of languages and that one in five secondary schools is not presenting candidates for examination in modern languages and so calls on the Scottish Government, as a matter of urgency, to explore with the university ways of maintaining and developing modern language teaching to ensure the future supply of teachers of language as Scotland fights to maintain a presence in foreign business markets.
