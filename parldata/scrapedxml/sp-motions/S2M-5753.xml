 *S2M-5753 Irene Oldfather: Together Since 1957 - 50th Anniversary of the Treaty of Rome—That the Parliament acknowledges that 25 March 2007 marks the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome which established the European Economic Community, now the European Union, and represented a decisive step away from the turmoil of world war and towards the building of a modern peaceful Europe; recognises the benefits that the last 50 years have brought member states in terms of freedom, democracy, prosperity, jobs and growth; appreciates that European citizens now have access to a single market, easier travel across EU borders, opportunities to study across Europe, access to EU regional aid such as the structural funds programme which has benefited many Scottish communities, improved regional policy, gender equality and better consumer rights; is aware that there are many events taking place across Europe to mark this important anniversary and encourages Scottish people to participate; notes that the European institutions have agreed that celebrations to mark the 50th anniversary and Spring Day in Europe on 9 May should focus on Europe’s young people, and agrees that it is appropriate, when celebrating the freedom, peace and prosperity that the EU has achieved so far, to look to the next 50 years in Europe and consider what kind of Europe its citizens and, in particular, its young citizens, wish for the future.
