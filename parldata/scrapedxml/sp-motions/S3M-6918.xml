 *S3M-6918 Cathy Jamieson: Knockshinnoch Castle Colliery Disasterâ€”That the Parliament commemorates the 60th anniversary of the Knockshinnoch Castle Colliery disaster near New Cumnock, which saw 129 men trapped underground; remembers the 13 who lost their lives in the disaster; recognises the life-saving work carried out by all volunteers and rescuers, who helped bring 116 men back to safety, and, at this time, expresses solidarity with the miners and their families in Chile as work continues to rescue the men currently trapped underground in the San Jose copper and gold mine.
