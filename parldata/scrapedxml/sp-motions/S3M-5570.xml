*S3M-5570 Robin Harper: Scotland and Solway Tweed River Basin Management Plans—That the Parliament welcomes the recent publication of the first basin management plans for the Scotland and the Solway Tweed river basin districts; acknowledges that, on the back of the early passing of the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003 by the previous Parliament, these management plans have the potential to keep Scotland ahead in Europe in the second decade of the 21st century; considers that the Scottish Government has established the most comprehensive, risk-based regulatory tools in Europe for protecting and improving the water environment, ensuring that water management is based on assessments of genuine environmental risk and that developments are considered against criteria to encourage sustainable development and deliver benefits that outweigh risks to the water environment; welcomes its determination that regulation is not just about protection but about improvement, as shown in the long-term restoration plans for those elements of Scotland’s water environment that remain downgraded; congratulates the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and the Scottish Government for the levels of integration of planning already achieved, but calls on all stakeholders in the Scotland and Solway Tweed river basin districts, especially local authorities and farming, fishing, industrial, tourism and developer interests, to work closely together to ensure that the ambitious targets set for all water bodies in Scotland will be achieved over the next 17 years.
