*S2M-2218# Stewart Stevenson: Scotland on the Internetâ€”That the Parliament agrees that promotion of Scotland as a brand is vital to our economic success; believes that a distinctive internet identity via a top-level domain (TLD), such as .SCOTLAND, .SCOT, .SCO or similar, has an increasingly important role to play, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should promote the research necessary to allow the submission of an early bid to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) for an appropriate TLD.
