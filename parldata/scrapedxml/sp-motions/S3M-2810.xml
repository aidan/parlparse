*S3M-2810 Kenneth Gibson: Lest We Forget—That the Parliament commemorates on 11 November 2008 the 90th anniversary of the 1918 armistice, which ended the First World War; acknowledges Scotland’s heavy sacrifice in that appalling conflict, which cost Scotland 147,609 fatalities and hundreds of thousands of wounded from the 557,000 Scots, most of them volunteers, who served in the British armed forces; notes that Scotland’s losses represent around 19% of the estimated 761,000 British war dead at a time when Scotland had less than 9.5% of Britain’s population; considers that tens of thousands of other Scots also perished while serving valiantly in the London Scottish, Liverpool Scottish, Australian, Canadian, New Zealand, South African and other regiments raised throughout the British Empire; recognises that every community in Scotland and countless Scottish families suffered grievously; believes that few families endured as much as the Mochrie family of Kilbirnie, Ayrshire, which had five brothers serving in the British Army three of whom, 19 year-old Private Robert Mochrie of the Royal Scots Fusiliers, 21-year-old Private Matthew Mochrie of the Cameronians, and 28 year-old Corporal James Mochrie of the Gordon Highlanders, were all tragically killed on the first day of the Battle of Loos on 25 September 1915, along with thousands of their compatriots; further notes that 36 year-old Private Andrew Mochrie, also of the Cameronians, was killed at the Battle of Arras on 9 June 1917; is aware that John Mochrie, of the Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire Regiment, survived the conflict as did his sister, Euphemia, a nurse with Queen Mary’s Army Auxiliary Corps, whose son, William McKim, was killed serving on HMS Hood in the Second World War, and understands that many of us are the descendents both of those who bravely fought and died for their country and those lucky enough to return home, often maimed and traumatised, to an uncertain future and that it is our solemn duty both to remember them and to commemorate their sacrifices.
