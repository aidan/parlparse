*S2M-5466 Dave Petrie: Support for FSB Report on the Effect of Supermarkets on Town Centres—That the Parliament acknowledges the recent Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) report on the effect of supermarkets on existing town centre retailers; notes the report’s findings that up to 80% of shoppers now do their food shopping in out-of-town supermarkets and up to 93% of retailers in some towns have experienced negative effects following supermarket development; expresses strong concerns over the significant decline in the level of business activities undertaken by existing retailers and its effect on the local economy; calls on the Scottish Executive to support small and local businesses, which are the backbone of the Scottish economy; believes that the movement away from town centres only increases urban decline and does nothing to tackle the core issue of inner city regeneration; considers that issues concerning town centre planning, parking facilities and traffic congestion need to be addressed to encourage shoppers back into these areas; supports the FSB proposals, including the establishment of a town centre action group and strategy plan to help promote and co-ordinate the delivery of retail and local services in town centres and provide assistance through funding packages; supports locally produced goods and their environmental benefits in terms of food miles and commends supermarkets who pursue a policy based on local production, and considers that supermarkets should be monitored strenuously to ensure that they are competing fairly.
