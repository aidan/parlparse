*S3M-5119.3 Liam McArthur: Autumn Fisheries Negotiations—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5119) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from first "notes" to end and insert "recognises the need for a complete overhaul of the Common Fisheries Policy and action to address the environmental and economic folly of discards; believes, however, that the Government’s immediate priority must be to tackle the current crippling situation facing Scotland’s fishing fleet and the prospect of further cuts in effort and quotas, and therefore urges the Scottish Government to work urgently and constructively with the fishing industry and the UK Government on priorities for the forthcoming EU fisheries negotiations to secure the best possible outcome for the Scottish fleet and the longer term sustainability of fish stocks."
