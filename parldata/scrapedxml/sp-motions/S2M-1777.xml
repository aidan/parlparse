 *S2M-1777# Shiona Baird: Zero Waste—That the Parliament congratulates the Royal Society of Arts on its 21st century manifesto which seeks to stimulate enterprise, expand education and develop mutually reinforcing policies, products, technologies, behaviours and lifestyles that reduce waste of all kinds, with zero waste as the long-term ideal; recognises that the whole of Scotland would derive huge economic and environmental benefits from pursuing a zero waste approach; acknowledges that zero waste is not simply about managing waste better and recycling more, but is about managing resources throughout their lifecycle and eliminating waste in every area of human activity; and considers that the Scottish Executive should follow the example of New Zealand and adopt, as a matter of priority, a nationwide zero waste strategy that will begin to tackle Scotland’s growing waste mountain. Supported by: Rosie Kane*, Eleanor Scott*, Frances Curran*, Mr Mark Ruskell*, Patrick Harvie*, Richard Lochhead*, Linda Fabiani*
