 *S3M-6863 Stewart Maxwell: University of the West of Scotland’s Campus Revamp—That the Parliament congratulates the University of the West of Scotland (UWS) on its £250 million campus revamp that will see the construction of new town-centre accommodation and the refurbishment of existing dormitories in a bid to attract more international students; applauds UWS’s ambition for Paisley to be recognised as a campus town and compete with the very best in the United Kingdom and abroad in attracting prospective students, and believes that this is yet another important step in the continued regeneration of Paisley.
