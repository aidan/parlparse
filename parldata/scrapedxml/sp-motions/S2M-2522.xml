*S2M-2522# Mark Ballard: Wipe Out Debt—That the Parliament notes the Wipe Out Debt 2005 petition and its call for full cancellation of the unpayable debts of the world’s poorest countries by fair and transparent means; further notes that, despite the work of campaigners and politicians worldwide, 88% of the debts of the poorest countries remain uncancelled; further notes that full cancellation of debt, when allied to reform of unfair trade rules, would act to lift millions of the world’s poorest people out of poverty, and believes that the G8 summit at Gleneagles presents an excellent opportunity to encourage the governments of rich countries to make good on their promises and deliver the resources needed to make poverty history.
