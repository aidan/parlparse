*S3M-208 Bashir Ahmad: Democracy in Palestineâ€”That the Parliament expresses concern at the recent developments that have resulted in the formation of an emergency government which excludes the democratically elected Hamas representatives who reflect the will and choice of the Palestinian people; expresses further concern at the dissolution of the national security council, believing that these actions will conversely lead to a worsening of the situation in Palestine for ordinary people, and calls on the UK Government to support the promotion and preservation of democracy in the region and act in an even-handed manner with consideration for all parties involved.
