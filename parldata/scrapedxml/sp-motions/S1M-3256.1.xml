 *S1M-3256.1 Mr Kenneth Gibson: Better Communities in Scotland: Closing the Gap—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3256) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "warmly" to end and insert "notes with disappointment the content of the Scottish Executive’s community regeneration statement Better Communities in Scotland: Closing the Gap; believes that community regeneration is a topic worthy of serious consideration, and demands that the Executive go back to the drawing board and come back when it has some well thought out, workable solutions to the problems faced by Scotland’s deprived communities."
