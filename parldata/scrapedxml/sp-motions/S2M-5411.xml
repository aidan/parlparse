*S2M-5411 Linda Fabiani: 4th Edinburgh International Festival of Middle Eastern Spirituality and Peace—That the Parliament supports the 4th Edinburgh International Festival of Middle Eastern Spirituality and Peace which will take place from Wednesday 7 February to Sunday 11 March 2007; supports the festival’s aim to celebrate the diversity contained within the religious, spiritual, educational, cultural, ethnic and international traditions of the Middle East as well as in Scotland; welcomes the opening up of the festival this year to events in other parts of Scotland, and congratulates the organisers, the Edinburgh International Centre for World Spiritualities and the Edinburgh Institute for Advanced Learning, for bringing together people from across all the principal faith and spiritual traditions of Scotland and creating a forum for dialogue and mutual understanding among the religious and spiritual traditions, particularly at a time when negative media images and war in the Middle East are increasingly polarising opinions and exacerbating divisions among our communities.
