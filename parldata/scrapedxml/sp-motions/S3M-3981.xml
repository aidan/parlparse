 *S3M-3981 Mike Pringle: Family Fund—That the Parliament commends the work of the Family Fund, the United Kingdom’s largest provider of charitable grants to disabled children; notes that last year the Family Fund gave over £29 million in grants to 48,000 families across the United Kingdom for goods and services to improve the quality of their lives; further notes the recent launch of Family Fund extra, the Family Fund’s new online shopping service, which allows any family with a disabled child a discount of up to 25% from several major retailers; also notes that anyone shopping online can help disabled children, at no extra cost to themselves, by buying through Family Fund extra from nearly 100 different retailers, and encourages people to use this excellent new service to support the Family Fund’s valuable contribution in helping disabled children and their families.
