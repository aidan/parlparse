*S3M-3522 Rob Gibson: Obstructing Global Artistic Expression—That the Parliament notes the petition campaign by leading figures in the arts world calling for a reversal to the new stringent visa controls that are preventing top foreign musicians, actors, scholars and artists from visiting Scotland and the wider United Kingdom; notes with concern the new UK Border Agency (UKBA) regulations requiring foreign artists not only to prove their identity with biometric data, fingerprint scans and digital photographs but also to show that they have an established sponsor willing to take full financial responsibility for them while in the country and to vouch for all their activities while on British soil; notes with concern the huge impact that this will have on both host organisations and visitors, which has already resulted in a number of cancelled shows, and finally believes that the UKBA should encourage and promote the entry of talented global musicians, actors, scholars and artists interested in contributing to Scottish and UK cultural, intellectual and civic life.
