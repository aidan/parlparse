*S1M-2571 Michael Russell: Fèisean nan Gàidheal—That the Parliament congratulates Fèisean nan Gàidheal, the National Association of Gaelic Arts Youth Tuition Festivals, on its work in the last year in involving over 3,600 young people in Gaelic cultural events, and commends the hard work by all in the organisation in order to involve a new generation of young people in Scotland’s Gaelic heritage despite the present range of difficult circumstances which face Gaelic, not least the fact that the present shortage of Gaelic teachers results in the language relying heavily on the goodwill of volunteers, such as those in Fèisean nan Gàidheal.
