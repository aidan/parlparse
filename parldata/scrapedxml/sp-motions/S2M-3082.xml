*S2M-3082 Ms Sandra White: End Pregnancy Discrimination—That the Parliament notes the findings of the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) Scotland which found that 54% of pregnant working women in Scotland experience discrimination and that three quarters of these women are afraid to report incidents of discrimination for fear of harming their job security; urges the Scottish Executive, in light of the depopulation crisis, to promote greater maternity rights among both public and private sector employers to ensure that this kind of discrimination does not occur; notes the massive contribution that women make to the economy of Scotland and that their future contribution to that economy is jeopardised by this form of discrimination, and further urges ministers to support EOC Scotland’s call to deliver an end to pregnancy discrimination in Scotland.
