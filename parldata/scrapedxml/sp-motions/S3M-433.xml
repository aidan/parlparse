*S3M-433# Cathy Jamieson: The Cruiser Varyagâ€”That the Parliament notes the ceremony attended by senior Russian politicians, navy personnel and veterans to remember and commemorate the famous Russian Cruiser, Varyag, which lies off the coast of Lendalfoot, South Ayrshire; welcomes the many Russian visitors who attended the events to mark this important occasion for the Russian nation, including the officers and crew members of the Russian naval vessel, Severomorsk, which has been moored off the Ayrshire coast as part of the celebration; recognises the significant work locally by individuals and organisations that has helped to develop this event over the last two years, most notably by Girvan Horizons and South Ayrshire Council; thanks the people of Lendalfoot and South Carrick for the warm welcome they have given to the many Russian visitors who come to the Varyag memorial, and hopes that this event will continue to grow in stature and prominence over the coming years and serve to strengthen and develop the links of friendship and comradeship between the people of Scotland and Russia.
