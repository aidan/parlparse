*S3M-1619 Christine Grahame: Gurkhas’ First-Class Service, MOD’s Second-Class Treatment—That the Parliament notes the campaign by the former Gurkhas to seek parity in pension and residency rights for those troops from the Brigade who served and fought as part of the British Army before 1997; recognises the bravery and distinction which the Gurkhas have demonstrated throughout their service, often in the frontline of many of the bloodiest conflicts in the world, and condemns the attitude of the Ministry of Defence and the UK Government in failing to honour these brave fighters by treating them as second-class troops, despite the first-class service that they have given over a period of 200 years.
