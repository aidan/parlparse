 *S2M-1983 Mr Mark Ruskell: National Farmers Union Scotland and Fair Trade—That the Parliament supports the National Farmers Union Scotland in its campaign for fair trade with supermarkets; is alarmed at the power of supermarkets to dictate prices below production costs of milk and other products; agrees that a code of practice for retailers needs to be made compulsory and enforceable and that a lack of contracts between supermarkets, processors and suppliers is a major problem that needs to be rectified; believes that there should be a fair trade inquiry into the practices engaged in by supermarkets in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to report on the effect such practices have on the rural economy and environment and the livelihoods of people and communities dependent on agriculture.
