 *S1M-3488# Donald Gorrie: Support for Families and Children-That the Parliament believes that, in the light of research showing that 50% of persistent offenders first come before children's panels as being in need of care and protection because of domestic violence or family breakdown, the Scottish Executive should give much greater support to voluntary organisations that support families and children suffering violence or breakdown, so that such organisations can fulfil a bigger role, in co-operation with social work services departments, in preventing such crises leading to young people embarking on a career of offending.
