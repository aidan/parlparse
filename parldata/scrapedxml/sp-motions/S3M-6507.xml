*S3M-6507 Patrick Harvie: Gender Pay Gap—That the Parliament recognises the pay gap that continues to exist between men and women in the workplace as illustrated by a recent Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) Scotland study; notes that, on average, women still earn 12.2% less for full-time work and 32% less for part-time work; welcomes the small reduction in the pay gap since 2008, but recognises that much more has to be done, and supports the EHRC’s call to businesses to be proactive and address this pay gap by adopting transparent pay policies and more flexible working practices.
