*S3M-1722 Sarah Boyack: Concern at Edinburgh Community Mediation Service Budget Cut—That the Parliament notes with concern a 29% cut in the City of Edinburgh Council’s grant to the Edinburgh Community Mediation Service for this financial year; further notes that, since inception of the service in 1995, the council’s support of mediation as a cost-effective resource to combat antisocial behaviour and promote community safety has served as a model for local authorities elsewhere in Scotland; believes that this cut will make it extremely difficult to effectively deal with referrals, especially at a time when mediation is embedded in the council’s procedures for all complaints concerning neighbour conflicts and that the now required strategy of prioritising casework would be contrary to the lessons learnt in the service’s history that even seemingly small disputes can escalate to antisocial behaviour and criminal charges, and consequently urges the council to reconsider this cut and the Scottish Government to revisit its settlement with the council given that it is clearly precipitating unprecedented cuts in services, particularly those affecting vulnerable groups and of which the Community Mediation Service is sadly just one example. Supported by: Malcolm Chisholm*, George Foulkes*
