*S3M-4393 Helen Eadie: Congratulations on Efforts to Secure Employment for Disabled People—That the Parliament congratulates the assemblies in Northern Ireland and Wales as well as the Westminster government where government ministers have taken initiatives by establishing task forces to ensure that a distinct and crystal clear message is sent to all procurement management within public services across the United Kingdom that a direct focus must be given to working with Remploy and other supported workshop providers in the award of government contracts to help the continuance of employment of disabled people, particularly in the face of the major challenges facing the economy; expresses its pride that the Scottish Parliament was among the first in the UK to use the provisions of Article 19 of the EU public sector procurement directive, which ensures the legal framework to award such special public service contracts; pays special thanks and a tribute to Lynn Garvie, Head of Purchasing in the Scottish Parliament, who made sure that the will of the Parliament was delivered in this regard while undertaking her procurement duties following the opening of the new Holyrood building, and, finally, hopes that the Scottish Government will examine the examples of ministerial best practice in the other UK assemblies and the UK Parliament and give some urgency and importance to the direction of public service procurement officials across Scotland to deliver for disabled people and help protect their employment in difficult economic times. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
