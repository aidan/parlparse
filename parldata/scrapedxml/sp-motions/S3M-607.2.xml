*S3M-607.2 Jeremy Purvis: The Scottish National Party’s Broken Promises—As an amendment to motion (S3M-607) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from "recognises" to end and insert "further notes the SNP Government’s reluctance to keep its promise to students and dump student debt by writing off the debt to the Student Loans Company for Scottish domiciled graduates; notes the SNP Government’s refusal to meet its manifesto pledge for mandatory carbon reduction targets of 3% per annum; recognises that the SNP gained votes on these pre-election promises to the people of Scotland which they are now failing to keep, and calls on Scottish ministers to make a statement to the Parliament explaining which of these pre-election promises are no longer government policy and why, and which promises they do intend to implement and by when."
