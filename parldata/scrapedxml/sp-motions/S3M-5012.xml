*S3M-5012 Willie Coffey: National Identity Fraud Prevention Weekâ€”That the Parliament notes that research carried out for the organisers of National Identity Fraud Prevention Week, being held from 12 to 18 October 2009, shows that more people have fallen victim to this crime in the United Kingdom than in Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Belgium combined; considers this to be an unacceptable position and urges businesses, especially the banks and other lenders, government and customers to take all steps possible to minimise the opportunities for fraud, and commends the efforts of the police and prosecuting authorities to tackle the perpetrators of this increasingly complex crime.
