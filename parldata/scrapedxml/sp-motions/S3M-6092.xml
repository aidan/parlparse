 *S3M-6092 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Extension to the Listed Places of Worship Grant Schemeâ€”That the Parliament calls on HM Treasury to extend the Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme, due to end in March 2011; notes that the scheme enables listed places of worship to claim back 100% of the VAT incurred on repairs and maintenance to the building, professional fees and repair works to fixtures such as bells and organs; further notes that this has helped those who look after these valuable heritage and community buildings, such as the Church of the Good Shepherd, to maintain them for future generations; notes that this Edinburgh church is Grade 1 listed and was the first place of worship designed by Sir Robert Lorimer, in 1890, who continued his work with the design of the Thistle Chapel in St Giles Cathedral and the National War Memorial at Edinburgh Castle, and highlights that the loss of this grant scheme will have a huge impact on those congregations who will have to find extra funding to cover the VAT on the costs of repairs.
