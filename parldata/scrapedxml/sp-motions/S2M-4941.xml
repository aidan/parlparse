 *S2M-4941 Rosie Kane: ID Cards—That the Parliament notes that the Home Office has released figures stating that the cost of introducing ID cards will be £5.4 billion over the next 10 years; further notes that there is widespread concern about such cards on the grounds of civil liberties, and considers that the £5.4 billion would be better spent on reducing the massive levels of poverty and inequality in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom.
