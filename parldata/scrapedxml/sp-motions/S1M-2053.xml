 *S1M-2053 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Women's Royal Voluntary Service—That the Parliament warmly congratulates the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service (WRVS) on its outstanding commitment and contribution to public service in Scotland, estimated conservatively at £12 million in free working hours alone, but which is immeasurable in terms of loving kindness; expresses Scotland’s pride in, and gratitude for, the WRVS’s work in all manner of fields for the past 63 years, from service in hospitals, homes, prisons and lunch clubs to work in toy libraries, child contact centres, courts and at emergency scenes, and notes that a fine example of the faithfulness of those in the voluntary service is shown by the volunteers at the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Glasgow, where Alice McPherson, Sarah Cullen, Olive Colraine and Helen Burrow have just received awards ranging from a 15-year service certificate to 15-year service medals for their dedication to the remarkable WRVS hospital shop, where child patients and parents receive not only service but cheer and kindness.
