*S3M-484 Bill Wilson: Renfrewshire Council’s Public Petitions Committee—That the Parliament congratulates Renfrewshire Council on introducing, under the inspired leadership of Councillor Derek Mackay, a public petitions committee modelled on that of the Parliament; notes that this is thought to be the first time a council has done this; notes that it will not result in any duplication of legal procedures or consultation arrangements; notes that it should strengthen the connection between the council and the community, and further notes that it is but the first step in a wider programme of decentralisation and democratisation embarked on by Renfrewshire Council.
