*S2M-4955 Mr Ted Brocklebank: Fife Constabulary—That the Parliament commends the efforts of the officers of Fife Constabulary in providing security for the vitally important multi-party talks on the future government of Northern Ireland which finished in St Andrews on 13 October 2006; also commends Fife police for their successful stewarding of the Dunhill Cup; believes that, following their work on providing security for the G8 summit, policing the Open golf championship and Prince William’s graduation last year, Fife police are building on their reputation for the successful policing of large events, and further believes that the people of Fife are very fortunate to be served by such a professional and dedicated force.
