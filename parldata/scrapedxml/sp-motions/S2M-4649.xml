*S2M-4649 Brian Adam: Dental Crisisâ€”That the Parliament regrets that a further 3,539 patients are to lose access to NHS dental treatment after yet another dental practice has chosen to go private; notes that in May 2006 there were 13,892 people on the NHS dental waiting list in Grampian and that the new Aberdeen dental centre will have capacity for only an additional 24,000 appointments a year, which is inadequate to deal with the current crisis, and calls on the Scottish Executive to get to grips with this situation and to take measures to resolve the problem that exists in Grampian and throughout Scotland.
