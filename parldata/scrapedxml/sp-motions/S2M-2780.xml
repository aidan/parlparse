*S2M-2780 Irene Oldfather: Bicycle Helmets—That the Parliament notes that the majority of deaths in cycling accidents occur as a result of head injuries; is aware that the number of pedal cyclists admitted to hospital with head injuries as a result of being involved in a transport accident was 527 in the year ending March 2004; recognises that wearing a correctly fitted helmet has been shown to significantly reduce the risk of severe injury; notes the action that the Scottish Executive has taken to date by funding the Scottish Road Safety Campaign, which develops key road safety education initiatives and encourages the use of protective headgear through the Scottish Cycle Training Scheme, but recognises, nonetheless, that further action will be required to reduce the number of cyclist deaths related to head injuries.
