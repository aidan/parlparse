*S3M-6217 Helen Eadie: Call for First Minister to Guarantee Respect for Disabled People—That the Parliament is shocked to learn of reports of insulting and offensive comments allegedly made to a wheelchair user with fibromyalgia by an SNP councillor during campaigning in Cowdenbeath; deplores any such comments made; further believes that, if substantiated, a written and public apology should be issued immediately; asks that the First Minister requires all representatives of his party to respect and honour all people irrespective of their disability, race, gender, religion or sexual orientation, and hopes that that this will remind everyone of the need to do everything possible to encourage people who experience inequality to be involved in political campaigning and stand for public office.
