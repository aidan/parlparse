*S3M-2621 Bob Doris: Ending the Shame of Child Poverty—That the Parliament notes with alarm statistics produced by the Campaign to End Child Poverty that show that Glasgow has the worst levels of child poverty in Scotland including large areas, such as Glasgow North East where 73% of children - 12,010 out of 16,435 - come from families that are either workless or in receipt of working tax credit, and smaller clusters, such as in north Barlanark and Easterhouse south where the proportion in workless families or in families on working tax credit is 98%; supports those involved in the United Kingdom’s biggest ever event to end child poverty, at Trafalgar Square on Saturday 4 October 2008; further supports the call of the organisers of the march for the UK Government to spend just £3 billion a year to reach its own target to halve child poverty by 2010 and stay on course to end child poverty altogether; believes that all governments and administrations in the UK should work positively together in order to address child poverty issues; acknowledges that this can mean different approaches and strategies within different areas of the UK, and further believes that an excellent example of this is the Scottish Government’s approach, including moves to abolish prescription charges, extend entitlement to free school meals and school clothing grants, the freezing of the council tax and the introduction of direct payments to kinship carers of looked-after children.
