*S3M-3920 Bill Kidd: Carers’ Poverty, Enough is Enough—That the Parliament welcomes the carers’ poverty protest on 22 April 2009; considers that the Carer’s Allowance, at £53.10 per week, is the lowest of the earnings replacement benefits; initially calls on the UK Government to make an urgent increase to this allowance to bring it more in line with other earnings replacements benefits, and calls for a wider review of the benefits for carers and, in particular, the position of pensioners with regard to the overlapping rule between the Carer’s Allowance and the state retirement pension.
