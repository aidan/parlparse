*S2M-4215 Carolyn Leckie: Solidarity with Local Government Workers in Their Fight to Defend Their Pensions—That the Parliament congratulates the trade unions and their members for having the courage and strength to stand up to government attacks on their contractual pension rights and entitlements; admires the show of solidarity displayed by over 200,000 workers in Scotland and over one million more across Britain; regrets that the actions of the Scottish Executive and the Westminster Government have led to strike action being necessary; believes that the Executive should reconsider its stance on the legal position of the Rule of 85, given the conflicting advice from COSLA and UNISON and the contradictory statements of the Westminster Government; further believes that the Executive should reconsider its position in relation to ensuring that local government workers suffer no detriment in terms of their pension rights or entitlements; considers that, as a matter of urgency, the Executive should publish its proposals for resolution of this dispute, whether or not the Westminster Government approves, and believes that the only fair and just way to settle this dispute is for the Executive and employers to offer a solution acceptable to local government trade union members. Supported by: Campbell Martin*, Ms Sandra White*
