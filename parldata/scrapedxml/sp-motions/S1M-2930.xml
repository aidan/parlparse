*S1M-2930 Fergus Ewing: Inverness Air Links - Public Service Obligation—That the Parliament recognises the huge significance of direct links between Inverness Airport and London hub airports to the economic and social well-being of the Highlands and Islands, particularly in relation to tourism, exports, the business economy and employment; notes that the peripherality of Inverness and the dependence of the Highlands on air transport are unusual in UK terms and that other transport links from the north of Scotland cannot provide an adequate substitute for the established air links; believes that the absence of a fast alternative adds weight to the case for the imposition of a Public Service Obligation (PSO) which would allow the ring-fencing of the Gatwick slots, which is necessary for the continued operation of the service; further believes that early implementation of a PSO is crucial, and calls on the Scottish Executive to press further the case for a PSO with the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions and press for that Department to approach the European Commission on this matter as was done by the previous Minister for Transport and Planning.
