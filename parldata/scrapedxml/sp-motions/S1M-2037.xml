*S1M-2037 Donald Gorrie: Frozen Money—That the Parliament notes the evidence in the report Frozen Money produced by the Citizen’s Advice Bureaux (CABx) Scotland; accepts the conclusions of that report, particularly regarding the hardship and misery inflicted upon individuals and families on the basis of debts accrued to local authorities; acknowledges the concern expressed by CABx Scotland that the level of such arrestments may rise since the Abolition of Poindings and Warrant Sales Act 2001 was passed; notes that, although the regulation of bank arrestments and benefits is reserved to Westminster, the governance of local authorities, responsible for around 91% of such arrestments, is within the competence of the Scottish Parliament; urges all of Scotland’s local authorities to accept a voluntary code of conduct which will pledge them to (a) keep all of their residents meticulously well-informed in terms of how much they owe for council tax and other charges, (b) ensure that, when residents fall into debt, they will do everything in their power to negotiate mutually acceptable terms of repayment and (c) guarantee that they will use sheriffs’ officers and bank arrestments only as an absolute last resort; calls upon the Scottish Executive to enter into negotiations with Scotland’s local authorities in order to agree terms for that code of conduct, and urges Her Majesty's Government to bring forward legislation, as a matter of urgency, to ensure that there is no conflict between the principle of protecting benefits from arrestment and the operation of this protection in practice.
