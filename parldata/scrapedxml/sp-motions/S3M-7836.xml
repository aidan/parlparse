*S3M-7836 Stuart McMillan: Public Money Wasted on Sports Centre U-turn—That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement that Inverclyde Council has decided to scrap its plan to build a £10 million sports centre at Rankin Park, Greenock; notes that an estimated £338,000 of public money has already been spent on preparatory work for this project; further notes the local authority’s decision to instead go ahead with a number of smaller proposals; believes that such proposals should include a place for Belleaire Football Club, which has been established for over half a century and has made the grass pitch at Rankin Park its home ground; considers that, in the current economic climate, to have what it sees as such a vast outlay of public money on work on a project only for it to be scaled back is unacceptable, and hopes that the local authority will be more prudent in its future decision making. Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Bill Kidd*, Sandra White* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
