*S2M-774# John Swinburne: Recognition of Kinship Care-That the Parliament recognises that many grandparents have become the new foster care parents of children whose mothers and fathers have become disconnected from mainstream society; acknowledges that such care arrangements are usually more stable and result in a positive impact on the young person, as a consequence of grandparents' strong sense of commitment to provide care, but shares concerns about the financial consequences experienced by grandparents in providing this care; agrees that, if the needs of the child are the same, then the cost is the same, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should recognise this form of kinship care by instructing local authorities to ensure that related carers should have the same financial assistance and be subject to the same scrutiny as recognised foster carers.
