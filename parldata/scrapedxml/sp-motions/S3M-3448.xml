*S3M-3448 Brian Adam: Support for Oil and Gas Sector—That the Parliament supports the findings of the recent Oil and Gas UK report, The Oil &amp; Gas UK 2008 Activity Survey, which reveals that a reduction of available credit and a low oil price will have a marked effect on exploration and development activity over the next 12 to 18 months; notes the value of the oil and gas industry to Scotland, with 150,000 jobs and estimated revenues of over £13 billion going to HM Treasury this year; further notes that jobs losses in the energy industry are already being experienced in and around Aberdeen, and calls on the UK Government to bring forward measures in its 2009-10 budget to encourage new investment, to ensure that oil and gas fields are fully utilised and to ensure that the exploration of new fields continues despite current economic difficulties.
