 *S3M-2661 Margaret Mitchell: Congratulations to The Heraldâ€”That the Parliament congratulates The Herald newspaper on 225 years of continuous publication across Scotland; applauds the founding principles of its first editor who endeavoured to "engage in the task of informing and instructing his fellow citizens...and preserve his mind as free as possible from any prejudice which, without meaning to impose upon the public, might lead him to partial representation of the facts"; notes the growing collaboration between The Herald and The Mitchell Library, which is custodian of, and formally manages online, the extensive Herald archives and six million photographs, and wishes these two great Glasgow institutions continued success for the future.
