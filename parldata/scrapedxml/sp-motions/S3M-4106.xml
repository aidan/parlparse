*S3M-4106# Dr Richard Simpson: Overnight Freight Trains to Longannet—That the Parliament recognises the serious problems being experienced by residents in the Riverside, Broomridge and Braehead areas of Stirling, Clackmannanshire, Kincardine and Larbert as a result of heavy coal freight trains being introduced on the railway line; understands that this is having a damaging effect on the quality of life of local residents, many of whom lived comfortably in proximity to this busy line until the introduction of the coal trains; notes that Network Rail has stated that it will examine the noise and vibration test data being made available to it by Clackmannanshire and Falkirk councils respectively; regrets that Stirling Council has so far not undertaken similar studies; welcomes the efforts by Network Rail to tackle line and signalling problems at hot spots along the line, and considers that, notwithstanding the vital importance of transporting coal to Longannet for Scotland’s energy needs, residents in these areas would welcome a reduction in the environmental impact of these trains.
