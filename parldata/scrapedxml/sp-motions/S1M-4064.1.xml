*S1M-4064.1 Mr Keith Harding: Closing the Opportunity Gap for Older People-As an amendment to motion (S1M-4064) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "by" to end and insert "but notes that its policies are not working, care homes are having to close due to a funding crisis, waiting lists and times are rising, more older people feel insecure in their homes and there is an insufficient level of provision of appropriate housing for older people and considers that, if the Chancellor was to abolish his punitive stealth tax on pension funds in the forthcoming budget, the opportunity gap for older people would be greatly reduced.
