 *S1M-1548.1 Richard Lochhead: Fisheries—As an amendment to motion (S1M-1548) in the name of Mr Jamie McGrigor, at end insert "; notes that, while other European Member States provide generous financial support for their fishing industries, Scotland’s industry receives minimal support, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to announce an appropriate level of new investment in the industry given that such additional support for our fishing communities in their hour of need will ensure that they continue to make an enormous contribution to Scotland."
