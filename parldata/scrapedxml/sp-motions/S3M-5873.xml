*S3M-5873 Bill Wilson: Who Benefits from GM Crops and Large-scale Agribusiness?—That the Parliament welcomes Friends of the Earth’s (FOE) report on GM crops, Who benefits from GM Crops 2010?, which raises serious questions about the claims for the benefits of GM crops made by the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-Biotech Applications (ISAAA), an organisation thought to be funded by Monsanto and other entities with economic interests in GM technology; notes that the report states that there is little sign of new GM traits reaching the commercial production stage, that in six key GM-growing countries serious concerns have arisen regarding the social and environmental impacts of GM crops, that in the Southern Cone of Latin America vast GM plantations are displacing peasant and indigenous communities, pushing the agricultural frontier deeper into the forests and increasing pollution and health problems due to the increased use of pesticides, that an analysis of GM trends shows little or no evidence for the contention that GM crops can help tackle climate change, that GM crops are not generally grown to feed people and that opposition to them remains strong; believes that the FOE report is bolstered by the revelations of the film, Food, Inc., regarding the practices of Monsanto and the consequences of these for the genetic diversity of crops, small farmers and food security; also welcomes issue 259 of Resurgence magazine on the future of food, which offers further extensive criticism of the short and long-term effects of large-scale agribusiness; agrees with FOE, Food, Inc., Resurgence, the Soil Association and others that a healthy and sustainable food supply can only be secured through adopting alternative approaches such as agro-ecology, organic farming and non-GM crop science, and calls on individuals and governments to examine the report and take appropriate action.
