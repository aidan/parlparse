 *S2M-4509 Alasdair Morgan: Plight of the Karen People in Burma—That the Parliament notes recent approaches on the part of the United States to the UN Security Council seeking a resolution on Burma’s continuing human rights abuses; recognises that the Karen people, who have been victims of genocide at the hands of Burma’s unelected dictatorship, were loyal allies of Britain during World War II; believes that we owe a debt of honour to them, and calls on the UN Security Council to pass a resolution condemning the Burmese Government’s treatment of its own people.
