* S3M-5907 Marilyn Livingstone: Viewforth High School Commended in HMIE Reportâ€”That the Parliament notes the HM Inspectorate of Education inspection of Viewforth High School in Kirkcaldy in March 2010; commends the findings in the subsequent report that the strengths of the school include staff commitment to taking forward improvements to support the learning needs of all young people, the positive environment for learning that motivates and builds confidence in the pupils and the eagerness of the young people to learn and achieve; believes that this is a tribute to the skills, experience and hard work of the headteacher and staff despite the constraints of the school building, which was deemed not fit-for-purpose in an audit conducted five years ago, and urges Fife Council to take seriously the report recommendations for an improved building and to make the case for a new school an urgent priority.
