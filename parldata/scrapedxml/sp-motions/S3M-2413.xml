 *S3M-2413Charlie Gordon:British Airports Authority—That the Parliament welcomes the Competition Commission’s recommendation on the British Airports Authority (BAA)’s divestment of either Glasgow or Edinburgh airports as an appropriate remedy to BAA’s near monopoly of Scottish airports and one that will create a level playing field on which the airports serving the city regions of Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow can flourish.
