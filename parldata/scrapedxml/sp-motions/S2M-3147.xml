 * S2M-3147# Ms Sandra White: Voting Difficulties for Disabled Peopleâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the Polls Apart 4 Scotland research carried out on behalf of Capability Scotland which show that the number of disabled people who experienced difficulty or impossibility in voting in person has risen from 17% during the 2003 Holyrood elections to 24% at the 2005 Westminster elections due to lack of accessibility at polling stations; is dismayed that one in five voters with a learning disability found voting difficult because of lack of access to information of how to vote or a failure to help on the part of polling station staff due to their lack of training in dealing with people with learning disabilities, and is worried about the failure to address the problems of lack of awareness of many disabled people of the availability of the postal vote and the difficulties which many who did have a postal vote had with the process.
