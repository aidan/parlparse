*S3M-114 Patrick Harvie: Independent Asylum Commission—That the Parliament welcomes the Independent Asylum Commission (IAC) as its roadshow comes to Glasgow; notes that asylum seekers continue to be removed in distressing and unnecessary dawn raids; applauds the IAC’s intention to listen to the testimonies of asylum seekers and refugees, which are often left out of the debate on asylum; agrees that the asylum process regularly leaves individuals facing unfair treatment, destitution and a loss of dignity, and encourages those with experience of the asylum process to contribute to the work of the IAC by submitting oral, written or recorded testimony.
