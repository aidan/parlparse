 *S3M-5882 Sarah Boyack: Some People are Gay. Get over it!—That the Parliament notes its concern at findings by Stonewall Scotland that indicate that two thirds of the Lesbian Gay Bisexual and Transgender community in Edinburgh have been victims of verbal assault while one third have been physically attacked; is further concerned at recent news reports of homophobic bullying; welcomes the Stonewall Scotland campaign, Some people are gay. Get over it!, which has been taken up by the Edinburgh Community Safety Partnership in collaboration with Stonewall Scotland to stress that homophobic and transphobic hate crime will not be tolerated; encourages people who are the victims of homophobic hate crimes to report them to the police; further welcomes the Lothian and Borders Police Safer Communities Department’s commitment not to tolerate any sort of discrimination in Edinburgh and its stated pride in the city’s multicultural communities, and supports the view that all forms of bullying are unacceptable and have no place in Scottish society.
