 *S3M-7655 Hugh O’Donnell: Commercial Pressure on Israel—That the Parliament considers that there is a growing number of calls from the Scottish public and from businesses for a boycott of goods on sale in Scotland from Israel, owing to the continued illegal occupation and ongoing land grab in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip; is deeply concerned at the successive failure of UK and US governments to persuade Israel to implement a complete settlement freeze, and calls on the Israeli authorities to recognise their obligations under international law to end the occupation and what it sees as the colonisation of East Jerusalem and the West Bank to the detriment of the local population.
