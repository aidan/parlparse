*S3M-7437 Jackie Baillie: SNP Closed the Christie Ward—That the Parliament is dismayed at the recent decision of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde not to reinstate the Christie ward at the Vale of Leven Hospital after it was damaged in a fire; believes that the Christie ward formed a crucial part of inpatient services at the Vale of Leven Hospital; recognises that the decision is fiercely opposed by the community, patient groups and the Vale of Leven Monitoring Group set up by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to oversee what was called the Vale Vision; regrets that the cabinet secretary does not seem to believe that it is in the best interests of local people to keep the ward open, despite their clear views; further notes that the SNP was elected on a manifesto of keeping services local, and therefore believes that this represents another SNP broken promise. Supported by: Mr Frank McAveety*, Elaine Smith*, Rhona Brankin*, Patricia Ferguson*
