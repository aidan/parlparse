*S3M-6061 Dr Richard Simpson: Welcoming the Fourth Anniversary of the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005—That the Parliament welcomes the fourth anniversary of the coming into force of the Smoking, Health and Social Care (Scotland) Act 2005, which it considers has significantly improved Scotland’s health, setting the precedent for the rest of the United Kingdom; considers that, on its fourth anniversary, the effects of its introduction so far include reducing Scotland’s heart attack rate by around 14%; believes that, in the coming years, this Act will continue to have a positive effect in reducing smoking and smoking-related diseases in Scotland, and considers that further reform in smoking legislation passed this year will build on that landmark Act. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
