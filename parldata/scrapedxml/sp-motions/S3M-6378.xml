*S3M-6378 Annabel Goldie: Erskine Week—That the Parliament welcomes Erskine Week, which is scheduled to run from 1 to 8 June 2010 to raise funds to support Scotland’s ex-servicemen and women; congratulates Erskine Hospital for the important work that it does in providing residential, respite, palliative care and emotional support; notes that events are being held in Glasgow and across the west and east of Scotland to give as many Scots as possible the chance to participate; recognises that these events include a sponsored walk in Clydebank, a can collection in Newton Mearns, a bikers’ meet in Bishopton, a ladies’ golf day in Bishopbriggs, and many more; believes that Scotland’s armed forces set an inspiring example of courage; asserts that Scotland as a society owes its ex-servicemen and women a profound debt of gratitude and has a moral duty to support them in their hour of need, and furthermore appeals to the people of Scotland, a caring and charitable people, to do or give whatever they can to help one of the most vital charities in Scotland.
