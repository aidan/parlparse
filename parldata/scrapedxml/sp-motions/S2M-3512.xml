*S2M-3512 Mr Mark Ruskell: Climate Change - Prime Minister’s U-turn—That the Parliament notes the comments on climate change made by Tony Blair to a summit of G8 energy and environment ministers in London earlier this week; condemns Mr Blair’s craven submission to those misguided nations who wrongly believe that binding targets for the emissions of greenhouse gases will somehow undermine their economies; strongly believes that a sustainable environment need not be incompatible with a strong and sustainable economy, and acknowledges that, while reducing such emissions is a challenge, it is one that must be faced if we are to avoid the far greater challenge of a rapidly changing climate. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
