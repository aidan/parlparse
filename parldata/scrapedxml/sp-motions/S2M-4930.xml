*S2M-4930# Ms Sandra White: Increase in Domestic Abuse—That the Parliament views the increase in reported domestic abuse as very worrying, especially in light of the fact that the majority of cases involve victims who have been abused before and the emergence of "legal aid deserts", areas, including Glasgow, Edinburgh and others, where victims are unable to access lawyers to take on their cases due to changes in the way civil legal aid is paid, meaning many solicitors will not take on such cases because they cannot afford to; agrees with Ranald Lindsey, convener of the Law Society of Scotland’s Access to Justice Committee, who stated that "Our consciences are basically being exploited by the Executive on this. They know that it’s difficult for us to turn away Mrs Jones who’s been battered black and blue, saying that we’re not being paid enough", and believes that the Scottish Executive should address this growing problem as a matter of urgency.
