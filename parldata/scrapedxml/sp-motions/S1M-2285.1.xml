*S1M-2285.1 Irene McGugan: Sports Promotion in Scotland's Schoolsâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-2285) in the name of Allan Wilson, insert at end "; notes that other European countries prioritise sport in the curriculum but that Scottish schools do not even offer the recommended minimum of two hours of physical education per week and that children at one in seven secondary schools no longer have access to a grass playing field; further notes that almost 40% of schools do not have a football pitch and that the already unacceptably high obesity rates among young Scots are still rising, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to cease lodging self-congratulatory motions, to take meaningful action to prioritise sport for children and young people and to ensure that locally available and appropriate facilities are accessible to all."
