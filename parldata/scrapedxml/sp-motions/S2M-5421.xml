 *S2M-5421 Carolyn Leckie: Rename Queensberry House as Fletcher House—That the Parliament notes that there are few people celebrating the 300th anniversary of the Act of Union; recognises that the dissolution of the Scottish Parliament in 1707 was a defeat for the Scottish nation; notes that the central figure who colluded with the monarchy and the English state in the removal of power from that Parliament against the will of the people of Scotland was James Douglas, the Duke of Queensberry and original owner of the Queensberry House building in the new Holyrood complex; further notes that, in contrast, the person noted for the most honourable and progressive role in that period was Andrew Fletcher of Saltoun, who fought against the union and to maintain a Scottish Parliament, and who also championed democratic reforms such as annual elections to that Parliament, only the Parliament having the power to declare war and the removal of the royal veto which, 300 years later, have still never been achieved; believes that the re-establishment of the Scottish Parliament in the late 20th century testifies to the foresight of those such as Fletcher; therefore believes that it would go some way to acknowledge the wrong and injustice that was done if Queensberry House were renamed Fletcher House, and looks forward to the day when that building will reside within a Parliament with full powers in an independent Scotland.
