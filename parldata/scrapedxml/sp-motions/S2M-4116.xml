*S2M-4116 Jeremy Purvis: Standard Life Demutualisation—That the Parliament notes the recently prepared economic impact assessment of Standard Life; recognises the financial, social and employment record of this mutually owned company, particularly in Edinburgh and Scotland; acknowledges that Standard Life is the last large mutual insurance company preparing to demutualise during the summer of 2006 and that, in spite of well-intentioned aims, there can be no absolute guarantees as to its ownership, headquarters, operation and employment policies; notes that the company directors have announced that, in the event of a successful demutualisation exercise, it is intended that unclaimed shares be placed in a charitable foundation, as has been the case in all demutualisations in the United Kingdom; whilst approving of this proposal, calls on the company to enhance the aim of creating a long-lasting charitable foundation by ensuring that present-day members can contribute some, or all, of their allocation of shares, and encourages generosity by members, with the directors giving a lead with their own allocation, indicating that the charitable foundation will be the future recipient of "orphan assets" at the appropriate time, be they unclaimed shares, policies or dividends, thus ensuring that a part of inter-generational equity created over the last 180 years in this successful company is available in the years to come to benefit the greater community of Scotland.
