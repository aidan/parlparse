*S3M-2004 Margaret Smith: Routes Out of Prison Scheme—That the Parliament welcomes the £2 million National Lottery grant for the Routes Out of Prison scheme in which ex-offenders work with short-term offenders to prepare them for integration into the community before their release from prison; hopes that the national rollout of the scheme will make a real difference to Scotland’s reoffending statistics, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Justice to ensure that cutting reoffending is a key priority for the Scottish Government.
