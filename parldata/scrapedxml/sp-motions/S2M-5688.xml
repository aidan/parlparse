*S2M-5688♦ Richard Lochhead: A Review of Scotland’s Response to Flooding—That the Parliament notes the devastation experienced by communities in Moray and throughout Scotland as a result of flooding in recent years; recognises the increasing threat to the nation of flooding as a result of climate change; believes that it is time for a thorough review of flood management and policy to ensure that Scotland is equipped to respond effectively to flood risks in the 21st century, and notes that the review should include the modernisation of legislation, the roles of engineering and sustainable management approaches in managing flood risk, the relevant funding mechanisms given that small local authorities such as Moray Council must carry an enormous and disproportionate financial burden as a result of nature, and the role of local and national authorities in the delivery of flood management.
