*S2M-5379 Christine Grahame: Turning Up the Heat on Scottish Gas—That the Parliament condemns the announcement by Scottish Gas that it will introduce £5 fines for customers who fail to pay rising fuel bills within 28 days, despite the company making £4 million profit a day; notes the company’s growing customer dissatisfaction levels, with many customers refusing to pay on time due to inaccuracies in the way their bills have been calculated, and condemns the practice of bonuses paid to engineers who persuade often elderly customers into having sales staff in their homes to sell them heating systems that they do not require; notes that over one million customers left the company last year after it raised prices by 22%, and urges existing customers to vote with their feet and find an alternative supplier which can provide both value for money and good levels of customer service where they may save as much as £100 to £150 per year.
