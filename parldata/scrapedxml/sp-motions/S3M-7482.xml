*S3M-7482 Bob Doris: Maryhill Burgh Halls Urban Regeneration Award—That the Parliament is delighted that Glasgow’s Maryhill Burgh Halls won the award for Category 5, Best contribution to Urban Regeneration in Scotland through the use of European Structural Funds at the European Structural Funds Best Practice Awards at the Glasgow School of Art on 23 November 2010; considers that this prestigious award was hard won by the Maryhill Burgh Halls Trust in recognition of its work in leading an inspirational community-focussed project; notes that the £9.2 million renovation project is half way toward completion and considers that it will see the 132-year-old structure being brought back from the brink of ruin to become one of Glasgow’s most prized community assets, comprising offices, café, public hall, recording studio, children’s nursery, meeting rooms and courtyard garden, and looks forward to the completion of the project in the summer of 2011.
