*S2M-3358 Patrick Harvie: Immediate Suspension on Dawn Raids—That the Parliament reiterates its serious concern over the unnecessary and inhumane methods used by the UK Government in the removal and detention of children prior to deportation, which cause fear and distress to the children involved; congratulates all campaigners who oppose this disgraceful treatment of children on their work; recognises the First Minister’s commitment to intervene on this matter and his intention to initiate discussions with the Home Office to establish a protocol which will cover all removals of children and young people in Scotland; supports Positive Action In Housing’s call for an immediate suspension on dawn raids carried out by immigration officers on families with children whilst this protocol is established, and calls on the Scottish Executive to support this plea for a moratorium on dawn raids in order to demonstrate its willingness to safeguard the welfare of the children concerned. Supported by: Chris Ballance*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Campbell Martin*, Mike Rumbles*, Linda Fabiani*, Robin Harper*, Eleanor Scott*, Shiona Baird*, Mark Ballard*
