 *S3M-2153 James Kelly: Parkinson’s Disease Society—That the Parliament notes the findings of a recent survey carried out by the Parkinson’s Disease Society, in which it was highlighted that 32% of people with Parkinson’s are not being diagnosed by specialists, that more than 3 in 10 disease sufferers have never seen a Parkinson’s disease nurse specialist, that more than one-third of sufferers have never been referred to a physiotherapist, that more than half have never been referred to an occupational or speech and language therapist; welcomes the views of many respondents that a Parkinson’s disease nurse specialist was found to provide a useful source of information about their condition; notes that some NHS boards continue to provide no access to nurse specialists and that the provision of specialist nurses in other areas is heavily oversubscribed, and calls on the Scottish Executive and NHS boards to examine this report in detail to ensure that Parkinson’s disease sufferers are able to access the appropriate range of support services in every area of Scotland.
