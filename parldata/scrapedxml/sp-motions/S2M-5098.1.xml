*S2M-5098.1 Murdo Fraser: Supporting Positive Transitions from School Towards Work—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5098) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "is therefore deeply concerned that so many young people in Scotland remain disengaged from education, employment or training; is further concerned by recent remarks from CBI Scotland that companies are having "to invest an unacceptably high proportion of the £2 billion they commit to training annually on what is effectively remedial education"; acknowledges, however, that voluntary agencies across Scotland are working hard to engage young people who are NEET; congratulates the Smith Group, which is dedicated to empowering such agencies already involved in this work; welcomes the Scottish Executive’s financial support provided to many of these agencies but, in light of the extreme difficulties voluntary organisations routinely face in terms of accessing secure funding, calls on it to reduce the bureaucracy involved in applying for funds and to ensure that long-term funding is available for successful and proven projects."
