 *S2M-2430 Rosie Kane: Victory for McLibel Two—That the Parliament congratulates Helen Steel and David Morris, known as the McLibel Two, after their epic three-year battle with McDonald’s, who have won their appeal at the European Court of Human Rights for equality of resources and legal representation, as well as being awarded £24,000 in compensation; celebrates the bravery and determination of the two in taking one of the world’s most powerful corporations to court, even though they had no legal representation and no money, for the right to be able to publicise what they felt to be the truth about McDonald’s; notes that McDonald’s spent £10 million on the original trial which they won against Steel and Morris’ awareness-raising leaflets, and hopes that the European Court’s decision will encourage more anti-globalisation campaigners to take on the world’s corporations, knowing that they have a right to a level playing field in terms of legal aid and representation.
