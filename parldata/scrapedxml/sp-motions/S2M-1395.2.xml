*S2M-1395.2 Jim Mather: Economy of the Highlands and Islands-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1395) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from "endorses" to end and insert "believes that the Highlands and Islands have both the right and the potential to be an economy that is diverse, dynamic and sustainable; commends the progress that has been achieved to date by individual endeavour, quality local services, business resilience and innovation in spite of hurdles which must be overcome in order for that potential to be realised; considers that these hurdles include the threats to primary and acute healthcare, the failure of the Scottish Executive to mount a coherent campaign for the contribution of adequate EU structural funds, the lack of affordable housing, poor transport links, higher fuel costs and an overall failure adequately to address the needs of key industries, and urges the Executive to produce a comprehensive strategy that will overcome these inhibitors and enable the Highlands and Islands to achieve its full potential."
