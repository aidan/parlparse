*S2M-2275.1 Richard Lochhead: Climate Changeâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-2275) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "notes" to end and insert "is disappointed to note that a comparison of our per capita greenhouse gas emissions with the United Kingdom and the other EU member states shows Scotland with the fourth highest level of emissions; urges the Executive to adopt ambitious targets in relation to its relevant devolved responsibilities and to take necessary steps to ensure Scotland is able to mitigate and adapt to inevitable climate change; recognises that greenhouse gas emissions can be reduced by a range of measures, including the acceleration of renewables projects, energy efficiency, increased forestry cover, promoting research and development of clean technologies, and greater promotion of public transport, but recognises that, in order to effectively tackle climate change, Scotland requires the powers enjoyed by independent countries, including powers over fiscal, energy, aviation and foreign policy."
