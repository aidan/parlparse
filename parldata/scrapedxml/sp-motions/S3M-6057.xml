*S3M-6057 Michael Matheson: Walk Around the Block Protest—That the Parliament recognises the need for the regeneration of Denny town centre; notes with concern the growing frustration in the Denny and Dunipace area at the lack of progress in taking this regeneration forward, which resulted in the "walk around the block" protest where more than 1,000 people signed a petition calling on the administration of Falkirk Council to bring forward an alternative plan for the regeneration of the town, and considers that further years of inaction on this matter will not be tolerated by the local community.
