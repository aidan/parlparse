*S3M-3151 Christine Grahame: AC/DC - We Salute You—That the Parliament recognises the significant musical contribution of rock band AC/DC, whose founding members, Angus and Malcolm Young, moved from Scotland to Australia and joined with Bon Scott, another Scottish émigré, to create what has become a musical legend with the band selling an estimated 150 million albums worldwide and establishing themselves as one of the best-selling rock bands of all time; notes that the popularity of AC/DC continues to grow and welcomes their forthcoming performance at Scotland’s national football stadium on 30 June 2009, and finally acknowledges the musical inspiration that the band has provided to thousands of Scottish musicians who have themselves gone on to great international success.
