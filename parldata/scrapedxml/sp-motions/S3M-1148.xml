*S3M-1148 Helen Eadie: Marie Robson’s Beautiful New Unused Home—That the Parliament notes with concern the case of Marie Robson of Lochgelly, a 49-year-old woman with special needs whose 75-year-old mother and 78-year-old father last spring helped to furnish and equip at the cost in excess of £5,000 the brand new purpose-built house which she has not been able to use because of the cap imposed on the social work budget by the SNP/Liberal Democrat-controlled council since last May, denying her the possibility of a care package along with another 24 urgent cases requiring care packages, and  further notes that the council leaders have said that they will continue to put budgets before those people in greatest need.
