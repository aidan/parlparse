*S3M-6882 Robin Harper on behalf of the RSSB: Flooding in Pakistanâ€”That the Parliament expresses its sympathy with the millions of people in Pakistan who have lost everything in the recent floods that continue to threaten the country; recognises that the help that has been so generously afforded by the people of Scotland and the United Kingdom will be needed for some years to come to repair an economy and a landscape that has been almost completely destroyed; notes that Pakistan has chopped down more of its trees than any other country in the world, bar one, removing the major natural control of flooding, and urges the Scottish Government to help focus much of our aid and expert assistance now and in the future towards the restitution of the upland and riverine forest cover of Pakistan in order to reduce the likelihood of such a disaster ever happening again.
