*S3M-4376 Jamie Hepburn: Unelected Members of the UK Cabinet—That the Parliament notes that as a result of the Prime Minister’s recent reshuffle no fewer than seven members of the House of Lords are now entitled to attend meetings of the UK Cabinet; considers that this is the highest number since Winston Churchill was Prime Minister in 1951 and is more than the total number of Cabinet Secretaries in the Scottish Government; believes that this development reduces the democratic accountability of the UK Cabinet as well as reflecting the increasingly isolated position of the Prime Minister in his parliamentary party, and further believes that as the UK Government looks at reform of the Westminster Parliament it would do well to learn from the system by which Scottish Government ministers are subject to approval by the Parliament.
