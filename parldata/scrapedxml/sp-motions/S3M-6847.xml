 *S3M-6847Robert Brown:Better Community Eyecare Services in Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the recent publication of the pilot projects evaluation report on the Review of Community Eyecare Services in Scotland; notes that the Review itself had been commissioned by the Scottish Executive in 2004 and had reported in 2006, building on the introduction of free eye tests and identifying the need for the provision of integrated eyecare networks; notes further the ongoing support provided by the current administration to pump priming pilot projects across Scotland; welcomes the fact that 80% of people now have access to integrated eyecare services; welcomes particularly the focus by NHS boards, including NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, on the specific needs of children with eyesight problems; notes the work of the Scottish Eyecare Group since 2009 in leading the establishment of managed clinical networks for the delivery of eyecare services, and looks forward to further action on the recommendations of the evaluation report, particularly in sharing good practice, improving transition services for young people and providing better emotional support for people newly diagnosed with sight loss.
