*S2M-2186 Richard Lochhead: Right to Readâ€”That the Parliament notes that 96% of books are never made available in large print, audio or Braille formats; further notes that there are 180,000 blind or partially-sighted individuals in Scotland who are being denied the ability to enjoy these books; welcomes the Right to Read campaign which is being organised by the Right to Read Alliance, a group of fourteen charities which campaigns for everyone to be able to read the same book at the same time and at the same price, for a greater number of books to be published in accessible formats and to ensure that no student is denied the right to learn because they cannot read study materials; encourages as many people as possible to sign up to the Right to Read Charter; calls on all local authorities to ensure that public libraries stock books in large print, audio and Braille formats, and further calls on all Scottish publishers to ensure that books are made accessible to those who suffer from partial sight or blindness.
