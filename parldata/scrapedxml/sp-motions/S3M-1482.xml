*S3M-1482 John Wilson: Prison Numbers—That the Parliament supports stronger alternatives to prison when dealing with crime; furthermore notes the Pew Center on the States report which calls the USA the global leader in the rate at which it imprisons its citizenry, with more than one in 100 adults behind bars in that country, and in addition applauds the stance taken by the states of Texas and Kansas to slow their prison population growth, as more cash-strapped federal states are faced with soaring costs and thus recognise that prison does not impact on recidivism or overall crime rates according to the Pew Center research.
