*S2M-850# Jackie Baillie: Tackling Debt—That the Parliament welcomes recent research into debt by Citizens Advice Scotland, published in On the cards – Scottish Citizens Advice Bureaux clients experiences of debt; notes the findings of the report such as the increasing level of debt stress experienced by clients highlighted by the fact that the average debt client owes £22 for every £1 of monthly income, the prevalence of consumer debt across every income group and the role of changes in circumstances such as job loss, illness and relationship breakdown in creating debt problems; further notes the implications of this research for the debt arrangement scheme brought forward under the Debt Arrangement and Attachment (Scotland) Act 2002, particularly the low levels of surplus income available to many debtors to make repayments to their debts and the unacceptable levels of pressure and harassment experienced by some debtors as creditors compete to get repayment of their debts, and considers that the Scottish Executive should take action to ensure that all debtors, even those with limited surplus incomes, are able to access the debt arrangement scheme to gain protection from undue creditor harassment and unnecessary debt enforcement action and recognise and support the valuable role played by citizens advice bureaux in advising those with debt problems.
