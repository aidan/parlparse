*S3M-5267.1 Mary Mulligan: Child Poverty Bill - UK Legislationâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-5267) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, insert at end "and, in so doing, regrets that the Scottish Government will not be placing a duty on local authorities to meet the agreed targets for reducing child poverty, given their partnership role in tackling child poverty, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to review the single outcome agreements currently available to ascertain whether local authorities have developed a child poverty strategy that will contribute to Scottish and UK targets aimed at abolishing child poverty and, if not, to return to the Scottish Parliament with a proposal to place a duty on local authorities to do so."
