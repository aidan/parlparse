*S1M-1656 Michael Russell: Future of Scottish Education—That the Parliament welcomes the acceptance of the McCrone settlement by Scottish teachers and looks forward to a new era of co-operation and consultation between government, teachers, parents and education authorities which could result in much beneficial development of our educational system; rejects the moves towards selection and privatisation of education outlined by the Prime Minister in recent speeches; expects the Scottish Executive to make no attempt to imitate such policies which are not only directly contrary to the Scottish educational ethos but would re-create resentment and division in our schools; calls upon the Scottish Executive to emphasise its desire to improve Scotland’s distinctive education system by following the example of the Northern Ireland Executive in abandoning league tables, and further encourages the Scottish Executive to re-examine critically target setting for schools and the burden of externally imposed assessment on Scotland’s young people. Supported by: Mr Duncan Hamilton*, Mr John Swinney*, Mr Andrew Welsh*, Christine Grahame*, Kay Ullrich*, Nicola Sturgeon*, Alasdair Morgan*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Bruce Crawford*, Irene McGugan*
