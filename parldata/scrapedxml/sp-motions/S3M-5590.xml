*S3M-5590 David Whitton: Graduates for Business Scheme—That the Parliament deplores the decision by Scottish Enterprise to scrap the Graduates for Business scheme with the loss of seven jobs; considers that the decision to cut the graduate employment scheme was made by Scottish Enterprise purely on cost grounds despite the programme being viewed as a great success by employer organisations: notes that 250 flexible graduate internships were arranged annually with two thirds of participants offered permanent posts after being on the programme, and calls on Scottish Enterprise to act on the open letter from the UK Commission for Employment and Skills to invest in the future of Scotland’s young people and reinstate the graduate programme as a matter of urgency.
