 * S2M-2969 Patrick Harvie: Falling Public Support for ID Cards—That the Parliament welcomes the fact that public support for identity cards is falling, as a recent poll by ICM showed that 43% of the population now consider ID cards to be a bad, or very bad, idea; reiterates that a majority of MSPs backed parliamentary motion S2M-2463, which stated that proposals for an identity card and database scheme are flawed on political, technical and financial grounds, that the scheme offers an ineffective response to problems of security and fraud and poses an unacceptable threat to civil liberties; further notes its concern that individuals could pay up to £300 for an ID card; believes that the cost of an ID card amounts to little more than a new poll tax for the people of Scotland, and calls on the UK Government to drop the current proposals for ID cards and a national identity database. Supported by: Mr Bruce McFee*, Ms Sandra White*, Mark Ballard*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*
