*S3M-3382 Margaret Curran: Better Representation of Easterhouse and Castlemilk—That the Parliament condemns the unfavourable and inaccurate description of Easterhouse and Castlemilk as "beautiful names, scummy estates" by Spectator journalist Fraser Nelson on Coffee House, the Spectator blog, on 30 January 2009; regrets that areas in the east end of Glasgow rarely feature positively in the national press; calls for journalists to address the exemplary voluntary service and commitment of local residents and the hard work of teachers and community organisations that contribute to the development and regeneration of this part of Glasgow, and acknowledges that, while there are many problems to be overcome, the area would benefit from a less dismissive response from high-profile journalists and greater accolades for its achievements.
