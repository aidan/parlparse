*S3M-5170 Ross Finnie: On-call status of Community Maternity Units Undermines Their Futures—That the Parliament notes NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde’s decision to change the operation of the community maternity units (CMU) at the Vale of Leven Hospital and Inverclyde Royal Hospital to an on-call service at nights and weekends; believes that this will undermine the confidence of mothers-to-be in the use of the CMUs, and further believes that such a change in the operation of the CMUs is incompatible with the undertaking given by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to keep them open for a trial period of three years while concurrently running a public awareness campaign to promote and increase usage of the CMUs.
