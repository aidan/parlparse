*S3M-5071.2 Jeremy Purvis: The Scottish Economyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-5071) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from "recognises" to end and insert "; believes that it is in the best interests of the Scottish economy to encourage a vibrant and competitive banking sector by separating the investment and retail functions of the biggest banks and giving customers and businesses the choice of smaller and more secure banks, for example by bringing the Bank of Scotland home to Scotland as a low-risk high street bank that serves the needs of local people and businesses."
