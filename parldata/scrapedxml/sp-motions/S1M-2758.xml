*S1M-2758 John Farquhar Munro: Dangerous Roads in the Highlandsâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the findings of the European Road Assessment Programme and the Automobile Association showing that seven out of the 10 most dangerous roads in Scotland are in the Highlands; believes that this is a symptom of many years of serious under investment in the Highlands on road maintenance and improvements, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to work with Highland Council in order to find solutions and address these problems.
