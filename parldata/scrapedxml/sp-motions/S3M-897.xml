 *S3M-897 Sandra White: Darling Must Resign—That the Parliament expresses serious concern over the privacy and security of thousands of Scottish families as a result of HM Treasury’s sheer incompetence in losing the child benefit details of 7 million families including parents’ and children’s names, addresses, dates of birth, child benefit and national insurance numbers and in some cases, bank or building society details; refuses to accept the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s apology for the extremely serious failure but insistence that people are not at risk from identity fraud; believes that such empty promises are an insult to families across the country who at this time are very worried that they may be at risk, especially in light of comments by the technology analysts, Gartner, who warn that, if the information is in the hands of criminals, they could try to take over peoples’ bank accounts to remove the money in them and information from Douglas Thomson of Glasgow who may have already suffered such a theft after having £2,800 removed from his bank account by someone who pretended to be his wife, but convinced his bank through the use of child benefit information to empty their account; believes that, as the person ultimately responsible, the Chancellor, Alistair Darling MP, should resign and that the millions of families suffering undue worry and the loss of their confidential information over this issue should be compensated by the UK Government. Supported by: John Wilson*, Bill Kidd*, Christina McKelvie*, Aileen Campbell*, Bashir Ahmad*, Alasdair Allan*
