*S2M-4635 Mr Andrew Welsh: Happy Canada Day—That the Parliament wishes all Canadians living in Scotland, and those with Canadian sympathies, a happy Canada Day on 1 July 2006; recognises that it was 139 years ago that the British North America Act 1867 created the Dominion of Canada and began the process of devolving power away from the London parliament to the Canadian state, and notes that highlights of this process included joining the League of Nations in 1921, the Statute of Westminster in 1931 which gave Canada complete control over both foreign affairs and domestic matters, the Citizenship Act of 1947 by which Canadians ceased to be British subjects and were created Canadian citizens, the loss of the House of Lords in 1949 as the final court of appeal for Canadians, to be replaced with the Supreme Court of Canada, and the Constitution Act of 1982 by which the parliament in London ceded its remaining powers over Canada. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
