*S2M-3648 Carolyn Leckie: Happy Birthday Sweet 16?—That the Parliament supports the Family Fund’s latest campaign, Happy Birthday Sweet 16?, which is designed to help families with severely disabled or seriously ill children who are 16 and over; notes that there is a huge gap in provision for such families caring for their children at home; congratulates the Family Fund on its charitable work, which provides grants to families with disabled or seriously ill children up to the age of 15 in the absence of adequate support from the state; agrees that the stresses and strains placed on families caring for a disabled or ill child do not disappear on the child’s 16th birthday and that the loss of this grant has a severe impact on the quality of life for these children and their families, and calls for the funding of the Family Fund to be increased by at least £5 million to allow the organisation to extend its remit to help families with children over 16, whilst recognising that the state should be providing far more support and resources for these vulnerable families.Supported by: Frances Curran*, Campbell Martin*, Shiona Baird*, Eleanor Scott*, Ms Sandra White*, Donald Gorrie*
