 *S2M-4100 Colin Fox: NHS Prescription Charges—That the Parliament opposes the decision to increase NHS prescription charges to £6.65 per item; believes that the increase will mean that even more patients will be forced to go without the medicines that they need because they simply cannot afford to buy them; notes that more than 200,000 Scots on Disability Living Allowance and 300,000 on Incapacity Benefit, for example, do not qualify for free prescriptions and have to pay in full; recognises that the charges are soon to be abolished altogether in Wales, and calls on the Scottish Executive to halt the rise here while its own consultation on prescription charges is ongoing and calls on all interested parties to reply to that consultation by the 30 April 2006 deadline.
