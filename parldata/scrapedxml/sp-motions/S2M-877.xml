*S2M-877# Mr Jamie McGrigor: Livestock Improvement Schemeâ€”That the Parliament recognises the considerable success over the last few years of the Livestock Improvement Scheme and, in particular, the Bull Hire Scheme in providing quality bulls to crofters at reasonable prices; notes with concern changes to the scheme that will require crofters to pay in advance for bull hire and wintering costs; fears that these changes will deter crofters from obtaining high quality bulls with quality assurance and thus run against the committed aims of both the Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department and the Crofters Commission of increasing the quality of the Scottish beef herd, and believes that the Scottish Executive should improve the efficiency of the current scheme rather than introducing upfront payments for bull hire that would put a severe financial strain on scheme members.
