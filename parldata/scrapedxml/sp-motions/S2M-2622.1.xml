 * S2M-2622.1 Miss Annabel Goldie: Firearms Legislation—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2622) in the name of Mr Kenny MacAskill, leave out from “recognises” to end and insert “notes the legislation passed by Westminster following the tragedy in Dunblane; supports the continuing role of Westminster in being responsible for firearms legislation; recognises and welcomes the fact that Scotland has seen a decline in gun crime despite increases in crime with legal and illegal weapons in England; notes that, despite a ban on handguns, there continue to be handgun-related crimes in Scotland, and believes that, in order to reduce the illegal use of firearms and the consequent tragedies, there is a need to ensure that there are police on the beat to deter and detect crime, a fully-resourced court system to prosecute those who choose to break the law and adequate prison places to ensure the protection of the public from continual law breakers.”
