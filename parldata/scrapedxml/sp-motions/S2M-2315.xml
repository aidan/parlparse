 * S2M-2315 Mr Mark Ruskell:International Climate Change Taskforce—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of Meeting the Climate Challenge, the latest report of the International Climate Change Taskforce; notes with grave concern its conclusion that irreversible climate change will occur once atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations reach 400 parts per million (ppm); further notes that, with such concentrations currently at 379 ppm and rising at around 2 ppm per year, this limit is likely to be reached in around 10 years time, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to suspend all major projects that will undermine progress towards tackling climate change, such as the M74 extension, the Aberdeen Western Peripheral Route and the expansion of Glasgow International Airport.
