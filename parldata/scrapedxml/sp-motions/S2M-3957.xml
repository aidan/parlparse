*S2M-3957 Donald Gorrie: International Workers’ Memorial Day—That the Parliament congratulates the STUC on its campaign for recognition of International Workers’ Memorial Day on 28 April; supports its call for recognition of the event throughout Scotland; recognises that, of the one million workers who lose their lives annually across the world, more than 60% of these accidental deaths are avoidable, and urges the Scottish Executive to work with the Westminster Government to further reduce workplace deaths in Scotland and officially recognise this commemorative day.
