 *S3M-4575 Sandra White: Glasgow University Centre of Excellence—That the Parliament congratulates the University of Glasgow upon securing an investment of £28 million from the Medical Research Council for the establishment of a centre of excellence in virology research and believes the fact that Glasgow beat off stiff competition from universities across the United Kingdom, including Oxford and Cambridge, clearly demonstrates the continuing excellence and world-class reach of Scotland’s educational establishments.
