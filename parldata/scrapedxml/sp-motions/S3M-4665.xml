 *S3M-4665 Jamie Hepburn: Inquiry into Allegations of MI5 and MI6 Complicity in Torture—That the Parliament notes the publication of a parliamentary report by the Joint Committee on Human Rights calling for an inquiry into allegations of MI5 and MI6 complicity in torture; agrees with the report that a system whereby ministers have been able to shirk responsibility and accountability by providing hollow blanket denials is "woefully deficient"; believes the practice of assisting other states in the commission of torture, or acquiescing in such torture, to be abhorrent; further notes that, according to a poll published by the PoliticsHome website, 65% of voters believe that the UK’s moral authority on the international stage has been weakened over the last 10 years as a result of government foreign policy, and calls on the UK Government to take heed of the calls of the Joint Committee on Human Rights and embark on a full inquiry, as soon as is possible, into this matter.
