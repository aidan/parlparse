 *S3M-3536 Des McNulty: Support for St Margaret of Scotland Hospice—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision of NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to issue notice to the St Margaret of Scotland Hospice that funding for longer stay continuing care beds will be withdrawn from early 2012; considers that the current arrangements for funding palliative care provision have placed St Margaret’s at a very considerable disadvantage, with St Margaret’s receiving £31,000 per bed per year compared with a Scottish average of £86,000 per bed per year, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to take all steps necessary in conjunction with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to ensure that St Margaret’s can continue to deliver top quality continuing and palliative care. Supported by: David Whitton*, Michael McMahon*, Mary Mulligan*, Trish Godman*, Margaret Curran*, David Stewart*
