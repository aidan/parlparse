* S3M-6191 Ken Macintosh: Israel’s Contribution to Medicine, Science and Technology—That the Parliament considers that one-sided coverage of Israel and the Middle East is more likely to confirm prejudice than promote understanding and awareness across political, ethnic and religious divides; believes that it is wrong to continually portray a whole county and its people in universally hostile and negative terms; views with dismay some of the intemperate language posted on the Parliament’s e-petitions website expressing hostility to the forthcoming exhibition on Israel’s contribution to medicine, science and technology; is pleased that the most offensive comments have now been removed, and believes that, through hosting this small exhibition, the Parliament will allow at least a limited opportunity to look at the scientific and medical advances made by Israelis and from which Scots and others have benefited.
