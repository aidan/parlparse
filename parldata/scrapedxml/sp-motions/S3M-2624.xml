 *S3M-2624 Kenneth Gibson: Scottish Crime Levels Hit a 25-Year Low—That the Parliament congratulates the police, the Scottish Government, neighbourhood watch groups, community organisations and individuals who have contributed to Scotland having its lowest reported crime figures in more than a quarter of a century and believes that increased police numbers, tackling our booze and blade culture, the breaking up of organised crime gangs, additional prison places, the ending of automatic, unconditional early release and the move towards securing earlier guilty pleas will all go a long way to making our streets and communities safer while reducing the fear of crime that blights so many lives.
