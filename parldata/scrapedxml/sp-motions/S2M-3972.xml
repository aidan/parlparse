*S2M-3972 Mr Ted Brocklebank: Anstruther’s Fence Collective—That the Parliament welcomes the success of St Andrews’ singer/songwriter, KT Tunstall, who was named Best Female Solo Artist at the 2006 Brit Awards; notes that KT Tunstall is a former member of Anstruther’s hugely successful Fence Collective, a group of about 30 mainly East Neuk of Fife-based musicians which includes HMS Ginafore, the Lone Pigeon, Unpoc, Pip Dylan and James Yorkston; congratulates the work of founder, Kenny Anderson, also known as King Creosote, in establishing such a thriving creative community in the East Neuk, and supports his belief that "if Fence is about anything, it’s that you don’t have to be a star to make music. And that you can do it yourself" and that Fence’s successes will be an inspiration to young musicians across Scotland.
