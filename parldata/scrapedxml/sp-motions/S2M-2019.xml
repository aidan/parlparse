*S2M-2019# Chris Ballance: Hollybush House Appeal—That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should support the mental health charity Combat Stress’s funding appeal for new accommodation in Hollybush House, Ayr, Scotland’s only centre for combat-related stress, in order to meet the requirements of the Regulation of Care (Scotland) Act 2001; notes that current Executive funding is only £54,000 over the next three years, and believes that increased funding should be allocated as a mark of support and respect for Scottish troops in active service, in recognition of the anticipated increase in demand for mental health services amongst servicemen and women as a result of the current conflict and in order to demonstrate that the First Minister’s support for Scottish troops is more than just words.
