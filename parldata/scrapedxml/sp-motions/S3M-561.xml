*S3M-561 Kenneth Gibson: Alcohol and Pregnancy: A Dangerous Cocktail—That the Parliament is aware of the dangerous impact of alcohol on pregnancy, with miscarriage, stillbirth and pre-term delivery among many possible effects; welcomes the recent publication of the British Medical Association (BMA) report, Foetal Alcohol Spectrum Disorders, A Guide for Healthcare Professionals; notes that foetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD) is a severe condition which impairs brain functions and can lead to physical abnormalities among children; supports BMA recommendations for further research into FASD; believes that the Scottish Government should consider the implementation of guidance and training of healthcare professionals on the prevention, diagnosis and management of FASD at the earliest practical opportunity; is aware that six out of 10 mothers drink alcohol while pregnant, many of whom are unaware of the danger to their unborn child, and therefore asks the Scottish Government to raise public awareness of this issue and to provide clear health advice that alcohol should not be consumed during pregnancy, while ensuring that any revision of guidance on alcohol consumption should contain specific advice on the risk of FASD and other side effects in pregnancy.
