*S2M-1041# Helen Eadie: Tribute to the Women of Mining Communities-That the Parliament commemorates the struggle throughout the ages of all mining communities across the world and, in particular, pays tribute during International Women's Week to the women who have supported their menfolk in times of great adversity and congratulates the women of our country who remained steadfast during the mining strike of 1984, whose suffering and strife has been highlighted in the media during this past week in programmes that remind us of the darkest years of the Conservative Government and the brutal decimation of the coal mining industry by Ian MacGregor and Margaret Thatcher.
