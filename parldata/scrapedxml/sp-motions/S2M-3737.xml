 *S2M-3737 Frances Curran: Tackling Child Obesity—That the Parliament is shocked by the new figures indicating that one third of children in Scotland are overweight; notes that the figures are constantly increasing; believes that free healthy school meals for all of Scotland’s children would be a major weapon in the battle to promote healthy eating and to establish healthy eating habits from a young age; notes that time is not on our side and that Finland implemented this policy over 20 years ago and saw huge health improvements within a generation, and considers that Scotland has no time to lose.
