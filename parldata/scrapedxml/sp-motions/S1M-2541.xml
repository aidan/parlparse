 *S1M-2541 Nicola Sturgeon: West of Scotland Cancer Servicesâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern recent developments at the Beatson Oncology Centre and the inevitable impact on cancer services in the West of Scotland; welcomes the removal of the Beatson Oncology Centre from the management of North Glasgow University Hospitals NHS Trust, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to now set out in detail what action will be taken to prevent further staff resignations, attract suitably qualified consultants to fill new and vacant posts, ensure temporary staff cover to avoid a rationalisation of cancer services such as the cancellation of clinics, and significantly shorten the timescale for the construction of the new Beatson Oncology Centre at Gartnavel Hospital.
