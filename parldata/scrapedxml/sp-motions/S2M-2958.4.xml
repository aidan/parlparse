 * S2M-2958.4 Patrick Harvie: Sexual Health—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2958) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, insert at end “recognises that there is a need both for clinical services and for prevention work which enables individuals to take greater control of their own sexual health and that both elements must be delivered in ways which recognise the diversity of the population and respect their equal rights to information and services; is concerned, therefore, by the decision by NHS Greater Glasgow to cut the funding to Caledonia Youth’s Glasgow branch, which will lead to the closure of a service with a record of working to address the sexual health needs of excluded young people, and calls on the Executive to work with NHS boards to ensure that existing services are maintained and improved upon wherever possible.” Supported by: Eleanor Scott* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
