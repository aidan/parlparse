*S2M-474 Susan Deacon: Horse Racing Industry in Scotland—That the Parliament recognises the significant contribution that the horse racing industry makes to the economy, generating up to £125 million and providing the equivalent of 1700 full-time jobs; commends the success of the racing industry in continuing to expand and develop, recognising its contribution to local economies and tourism; notes that there is widespread concern regarding the potential implications of the proposed Office of Fair Trading (OFT) rule 14 notice on the deregulation of the British horse racing industry and, in particular, on its likely impact on Scotland’s five racecourses, Ayr, Hamilton Park, Kelso, Musselburgh and Perth, each of which is independently owned and managed with profits generated ploughed back into the sport for long-term growth, and considers that the Scottish Executive should work with representatives of the racing industry to identify opportunities to promote and develop the industry and to explore the possible implications of the OFT ruling. Supported by: Mr John Home Robertson*, Michael McMahon*
