*S2M-3543.2 Frances Curran: Energy Policyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-3543) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from "considers" to end and insert "condemns the containing existence of fuel poverty; considers it to be a damning indictment of the short-sighted energy policy pursued by the Scottish Executive; calls on the Executive to demand total control over Scottish energy policy from the Westminster Government, and further calls on the Executive to develop an energy policy based on a publicly owned and publicly accountable energy company, that closes forever all nuclear power stations that invests in and develops all forms of renewable energy which will generate 50 per cent of our electricity by 2020 and sets meaningful targets for other energy generations, that invests in upgrading the national grid and that properly builds and maintains buildings so that they achieve greater energy efficiency."
