*S2M-5372 Cathy Peattie: Agency Workers—That the Parliament notes with concern the growing number of jobs in Scotland, over 130,000, that are considered temporary and are mainly filled by agency workers; believes that these jobs are among the most precarious and vulnerable in the labour market, with pay and employment rights generally inferior to those of permanent employees, frequently excluding workers from maternity and paternity leave, the right to paid notice on the termination of employment and the right to claim unfair dismissal, and further believes that such a situation is unacceptable in modern society and that the Scottish Executive should support the introduction of the Directive on temporary agency workers in Europe and the introduction of legislation at UK level to establish the principle of pay and conditions for agency workers being equal to those of workers who are permanently employed.
