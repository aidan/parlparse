 *S1M-2839 Mary Scanlon: Community Care—That the Parliament notes the unequal funding support between local authority and independently run care homes; regrets the exceptionally high levels of delayed discharge within Scotland’s hospitals; believes that the action plan to tackle delayed discharge will not solve the problem until health and social work budgets are unified, and urges the Scottish Executive to implement the recommendation of the Royal Commission chaired by Sir Stewart Sutherland to unify these budgets within a single organisation and put in place systems to ensure that funds allocated for community care are actually spent on such services.
