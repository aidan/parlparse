 *S2M-4406 Ms Sandra White: Sex Trafficking and the World Cup—That the Parliament deplores the active promotion of prostitution during the FIFA World Cup to be held in Germany; notes that Germany is the possible end destination of an estimated 40,000 trafficked victims; recognises that sex trafficking is often linked with organized crime, drugs and other illegal activities; demonstrates its commitment to abolishing this practice by encouraging Germany’s Chancellor, Angela Merkel, to initiate legislation targeted at those illegally trafficking women and children, and denounces this new form of slavery as demeaning and objectifying women, which should have no place in our modern world.
