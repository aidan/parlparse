*S3M-3436 Bill Wilson: Venezuela’s Progress Towards Eliminating Poverty—That the Parliament notes the recent report by the Center for Economic and Policy Research that records a significant decline in poverty in Venezuela over the last 10 years as measured by multiple criteria, one aspect of which is a decline in extreme poverty of 72%; also notes that most of Venezuela’s economic growth has been in the non-oil sector of the economy, that the private sector has grown faster than the public sector, that employment and access to healthcare and education have substantially improved, that total public debt has fallen from 30.7 to 14.3% of GDP and foreign public debt from 25.6 to 9.8% of GDP; further notes that Venezuela holds foreign exchange reserves equivalent to 25% of its GDP and considers that it is therefore well placed to weather a period of low oil prices and the global economic downturn; congratulates Venezuela on these successes, and calls on western governments to learn from the approach of Venezuela under the leadership of Hugo Chávez Frías and for the western media to acknowledge these facts and present a fair and balanced picture of that country and its government.
