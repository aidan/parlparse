* S3M-6153 Jackie Baillie: Garshake and Gartocharn Nurseriesâ€”That the Parliament calls on SNP-led West Dunbartonshire Council to reconsider its plans to close Garshake and Gartocharn nurseries from August 2010 as part of a programme of cost savings; believes that the alternative suggestion made by the council of privatisation is wholly unacceptable; further believes that both nurseries provide vital services for local parents and help to sustain working families; considers this another blow to parents with young children after the council imposed extra charges of almost 30% per week on nursery places, and calls on the Scottish Government to intervene in order that West Dunbartonshire Council sees sense and maintains nursery provision at Garshake and Gartocharn.
