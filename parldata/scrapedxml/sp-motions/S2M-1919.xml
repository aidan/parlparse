*S2M-1919 Tommy Sheridan: Best Wishes to Fidelâ€”That the Parliament sends its best wishes for a speedy recovery to the Cuban President, Fidel Castro, in respect of his recent fall in Havana and recognises the enormously positive role that he has played over the last 45 years in turning his country from a brutal tyranny into an island that prioritises the health and education of its citizens and the export of peace and human solidarity across the world.
