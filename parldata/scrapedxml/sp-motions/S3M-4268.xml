*S3M-4268# Stuart McMillan: Don’t Jeopardise 126 Years of Cultural Heritage—That the Parliament notes with concern that the future of the Strathclyde Police Pipe Band has been put in jeopardy; notes that the pipe band, whose origins date back to 1883, was set up by public request and was endorsed by an Act of Parliament; acknowledges that the pipe band enhances the reputation and prestige of Strathclyde Police worldwide while also playing a significant role in community engagement at local level; further notes that the band has been a regular feature at the five major events of the pipe band calendar, namely the Scottish, British, European and world championships, as well as the Cowal Highland Gathering; notes the lack of investment in Strathclyde Police Pipe Band, and wishes to ensure that the Strathclyde Police Pipe Band continues and that 126 years of cultural heritage are not jeopardised.
