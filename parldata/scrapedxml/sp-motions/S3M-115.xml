*S3M-115 Bill Wilson: Accurate Figures for the Scottish Electorate—That the Parliament notes that, during the 2007 Scottish parliamentary elections, the Scottish electorate was inundated with widely varying estimates of the present state of the Scottish economy; further notes that the differences in the estimates of the Scottish economic balance varied from a positive balance to an incredible £11 billion overdraft; considers that during that election campaign a series of discrepancies in the Government Expenditure and Revenue in Scotland (GERS) report, coupled with wide margins of error, resulted in an uncertainty as to the precise figures; further considers that, for democracy to function effectively, the electorate must be accurately informed and that the present failure of statistical reporting has a negative impact on Scottish democracy, and believes that, in the interests of democracy, it is therefore vital that the Scottish government should place itself in the position of being able to provide accurate figures to the Scottish electorate, that these figures should inform the Scottish electorate both as to Scotland’s contribution to the UK exchequer and to Scotland’s share of UK expenditure, and that these figures should account for invisible expenditure within Scotland and the United Kingdom as a whole.
