*S2M-2127 Margaret Smith: Public Liability Insurance and Community Organisations—That the Parliament notes with concern the massive increase in the cost of public liability insurance over the last three years and the negative impact that this is having on traditional community events throughout the country; notes that, in one case in Edinburgh, an insurance quote of £14,500 was given to the Corstorphine Fair from the same company that quoted just £1,000 two years ago; recognises that the cost of insurance is now jeopardising the future of a number of fundraising and community events, including Christmas events, and rejects the main excuse put forward by insurance companies that the increased premiums are required because of the rise of international terrorism, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to look into this issue as a matter of urgency to ensure that these events, which are so important to local communities, are able to continue. Supported by: Alex Fergusson*, Mr Kenneth Macintosh*, Mike Pringle*, Nora Radcliffe*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Robin Harper*, Mark Ballard*, Robert Brown*, Stewart Stevenson*, Jeremy Purvis*
