*S3M-1574 Iain Smith: Scott’s Porage Oats Green Energy—That the Parliament congratulates the decision of Quaker to invest £6 million pounds in a combined heat and power biomass boiler at Uthrogle Mills, Cupar, home of the world famous Scott’s Porage Oats; notes that the boiler will use oat husks, a waste product from processing oats at the mill, making it carbon neutral, reducing direct carbon emissions by 9,000 tonnes and reducing transport of waste oat husks by 170,000 miles a year, equivalent to a further 600 tonnes of carbon emissions, and urges other businesses throughout Scotland to follow the lead of Quaker by examining how to cut waste and carbon emissions in their processes.
