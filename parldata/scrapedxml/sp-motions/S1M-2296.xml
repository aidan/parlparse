 *S1M-2296# Ms Sandra White: Glasgow Housing Stock Transfer—That the Parliament notes the continuing uncertainty over the proposals for the wholesale transfer of Glasgow City Council’s housing stock; further notes the continuing uncertainty over the date of the ballot of tenants on the housing stock transfer proposals, and believes that in order to remove the uncertainty and to assist the tenants of Glasgow City Council to make a balanced decision based on the merits of the housing stock transfer proposal Her Majesty's Government should immediately write off Glasgow’s housing debt and the Scottish Executive should make available resources to improve Glasgow’s housing stock. Supported by: Mr Kenneth Gibson*
