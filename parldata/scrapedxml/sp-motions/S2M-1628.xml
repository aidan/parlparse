 * S2M-1628 Colin Fox:Congratulations to the Edinburgh People’s Festival 2004—That the Parliament extends its warmest congratulations to all those who participated in the 2004 Edinburgh People’s Festival, making it the most successful yet; notes that, over the week, more than 1,000 people attended events at the Simpsons maternity unit, HM Prison Saughton, Portobello Town Hall, Inch Park, Gilmerton Athletic Boxing Club, community facilities and working men’s clubs across Edinburgh; further notes that, thanks to the generosity of the Edinburgh trades union movement, ticket prices for shows were just £2.00 and, indeed, many attractions were completely free; supports the aim of the People’s Festival of including those who, for various reasons, feel excluded by the world’s greatest arts festival; welcomes the diverse programme of events that was presented, including classical, rock, folk and world music, theatre and ceilidh, film and stand-up comedy, vigorous debate and leisurely concerts in the park, and wishes the Edinburgh People’s Festival continued success for the future.
