*S1M-1373.3 Tommy Sheridan: Renewing Local Government Finance—As an amendment to motion (S1M-1373) in the name of Angus MacKay, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "believes that improvements in local government financing can only be delivered on the basis of significantly increased resources dedicated to improving the provision of services and jobs throughout each local authority area and that, although long-term budgeting would be welcome in the context of a significantly improved resource base, the council tax is not sustainable or acceptable as a continued form of raising local government revenue; further believes that the council tax is an unfair, complex and increasingly unacceptable system of taxation, and therefore resolves to scrap the council tax in favour of the Scottish Service Tax which is based on an individual’s ability to pay and would not only generate more resources for local government but would be significantly fairer, less complex and more efficient, thus laying the basis for long term stability within local government and improved services for the citizens of Scotland."
