*S3M-4989 John Park: A Fair Pay Deal for Fife Council’s Lowest Earners—That the Parliament welcomes calls for Fife Council’s top earners’ pay to be frozen immediately for three years instead of a pay freeze across the council workforce, which would hit the lowest earners the hardest; notes the current disparity in salaries within Fife Council, where last year the chief executive earned nearly £150,000 while the median salary for full-time staff was £22,682; further notes with alarm a persisting pay gap in Fife Council whereby last year the median salary for full-time male staff was £25,329 while for full-time female staff it was only £18,541; is concerned that, while frontline staff are in their third year of a pay freeze due to single status, chief officers have a three-year pay deal worth a 2.5% increase in each year that has seen the chief executive receive a rise this year of £3,657 and executive directors an increase of £2,655, and urges Fife Council to ensure that, at this time, the needs of its lowest earners are put first in any pay-related savings measures, considering that the impact of a three-year pay freeze for its lowest earners would mean considerable hardship, whereas for its chief officers the impact would hardly be felt, if at all.
