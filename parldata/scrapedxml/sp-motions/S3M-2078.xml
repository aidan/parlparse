*S3M-2078 Bob Doris: Learning the Lessons of Manchester—That the Parliament believes that the overwhelming majority of football supporters who visited Manchester for the UEFA Cup Final between Glasgow Rangers and Zenit St Petersburg were impeccably behaved, that any issues in relation to the planning and management of the cup final provided no excuse for a mindless minority of individuals who do not represent Glasgow Rangers Football Club and that the deeply regrettable events in Manchester should be used as an opportunity to reduce the likelihood of such scenes ever happening again; calls on the Scottish Government to take the lead in helping to co-ordinate efforts to ensure that lessons are learned and that all stakeholders, including the Scottish and UK governments, local authorities, football clubs and the police, work closely together on such matters, and further believes that where legislative changes may be necessary, such as in the case of ensuring that football banning orders handed out in England can be enforced in Scotland, such changes are implemented as soon as possible.
