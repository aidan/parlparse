*S2M-3168 Christine Grahame: Sculpture for Women of Suffrage—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive’s decision to commission a sculpture in recognition of the achievements of women of suffrage and other women in Scotland who have contributed to votes for women and the advancement of democracy generally, particularly in this Parliament with some 40% representation of women as MSPs, and considers that this recognition is long overdue and may give inspiration to women elsewhere who still struggle for these rights.
