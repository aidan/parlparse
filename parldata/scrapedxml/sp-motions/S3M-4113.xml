*S3M-4113 Patrick Harvie: European Resolution on Depleted Uranium Weapons—That the Parliament acknowledges the European Parliament’s resolution on "Depleted uranium weapons and their effect on human health and the environment - towards a global ban on the use of such weapons"; recognises the serious health concerns about the use of depleted uranium weapons on both military personnel and civilians, concerns that are widely acknowledged by many including the UN General Assembly; further recognises the serious environmental hazards posed by depleted uranium such as the contamination of soil and groundwater, and strongly urges the Scottish Government to offer its moral and, where appropriate, practical support for a global ban on the use of depleted uranium weapons.
