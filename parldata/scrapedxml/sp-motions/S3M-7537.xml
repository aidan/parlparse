*S3M-7537 Christina McKelvie: Every Single Woman, Equal Treatment for Women Seeking Asylum—That the Parliament commends the Govan and Craigton Integration Network on the launch of its postcard campaign, which asks the UK Government to provide comparable standards of treatment and support for asylum-seeking women who have been subjected to domestic and sexual violence with that provided for women settled in the United Kingdom; notes that the artwork on the postcards has been created by refugee and asylum-seeker women; considers that it is unacceptable that women seeking asylum who have been victims of rape and domestic abuse, who are pregnant or who are in prison are denied the same level of care and treatment that is provided to other women; further believes that strategies to end violence against women should apply to all women, including asylum seekers, and supports Govan and Craigton Integration Network’s efforts to secure this outcome.
