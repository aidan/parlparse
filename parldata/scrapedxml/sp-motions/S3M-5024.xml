*S3M-5024 Sandra White: Concern over Asylum Process Changes—That the Parliament expresses concern over the UK Government’s announced changes to the asylum process, which will see those making an initial asylum application in Scotland forced to travel over 400 miles to the UK Border Agency Asylum Screening Unit in Croydon; considers that this will result in delays in vital support for asylum seekers; expresses further concern that these changes have been introduced without prior consultation with groups such as the Scottish Refugee Council, which believes that the changes will lead to further stress, trauma and worsened poverty for those seeking asylum, and urges the UK Government to reconsider the introduction of these changes.
