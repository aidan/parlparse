 *S3M-2448 Jackson Carlaw: North Ayrshire Councillors Back Hunterston C—That the Parliament congratulates North Ayrshire councillors on passing Councillor Robert Barr’s motion calling on the Scottish Government to give the UK Government and British Energy every support should they commit to build a Hunterston C nuclear power station; further notes that a cross-party alliance of North Ayrshire councillors recognised that such a move would benefit the local economy, provide secure energy, keep carbon emissions down and assist in the battle against fuel poverty, and calls on the Scottish Government to make clear that it will heed this call for common sense from North Ayrshire councillors at the first available opportunity.
