 *S1M-2088# Irene McGugan: Waste Incinerators—That the Parliament notes with concern that at least five large new incinerators are being planned for siting around Scotland, despite the growing evidence that they may frequently emit a cocktail of toxic chemicals which breach legal pollution limits and raise health concerns; further notes that the defect ridden Baldovie incinerator in Dundee reported 18 separate breaches of safety limits within a five week period earlier this year, which more than justifies the concerns of communities in Aberdeen about the planned Altens incinerator; is concerned that although 60% of the waste produced in Scotland is biodegradable, only 6.6% of it was recycled last year, thereby placing Scotland at the bottom of the European recycling league; commends the first area waste plan in Scotland which opts for the recycling of waste rather than the burning of it, and believes that the Scottish Executive should implement policies which promote a resource efficient, recycling society.
