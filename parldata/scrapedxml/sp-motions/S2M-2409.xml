 * S2M-2409 Carolyn Leckie:Justice and Apology for the Conlon and Maguire Families—That the Parliament welcomes the visit to the House of Commons on 9 February 2005 by Gerry Conlon and other members of the Conlon and Maguire families, who were victims of one of Britain’s most appalling miscarriages of justice and were wrongfully imprisoned for terms of up to 15 years for crimes they had no part in; notes that Guiseppe Conlon, father of Gerry Conlon, died in prison while serving a sentence for a crime he did not commit; considers that the public apology hoped for by the families from the UK Government for this terrible injustice is long overdue; notes with grave concern that, despite the overturning of all the sentences on the Conlon and Maguire families in 1989 and 1991, no police officers or other officials involved in this injustice have ever been prosecuted for their part in it, nor has the UK Government officially recognised that they were all innocent, and believes that the UK Government should issue a full apology to all, that agreement should be reached with all the families on appropriate financial compensation and that justice should be seen to be done for the injustice they suffered.
