*S1M-1091.1 Kay Ullrich: Modernisation in the NHS-As an amendment to motion (S1M-1091) in the name of Susan Deacon, leave out from first "Scottish" to end and insert "failure of the Scottish Executive to tackle the chronic problems which currently exist in the health service in Scotland; calls upon the First Minister to take immediate action to address the situation; condemns the mismanagement and inaction on the part of the Executive, and demands new and imaginative methods of ensuring that the NHS in Scotland is run on the basis of patient need and not political expediency."
