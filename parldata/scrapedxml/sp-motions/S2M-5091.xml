 *S2M-5091 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Polish Right to Free, Safe Abortionâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the current proposals to change the constitution of the Republic of Poland, with the result that abortion will become illegal in almost every situation; notes that this ban, if it goes ahead, will be in violation of the rights of women to planned parenthood and is at variance with human rights and European standards; recognises that any ban on abortion is essentially ineffective as independent research indicates that the number of illegal abortions is anything from 80,000 to 200,000; further notes that backstreet abortions in Poland are big business and that abortion is available for 2,000 to 3,000 zlotys (347 to 520 pounds sterling) in private surgeries while the tablet RU-486 is also available on the black market; further notes that both are outwith the income of many ordinary women; acknowledges that the increasing number of cases of abandoned babies is clearly a result of the law which forces women to give birth, who for personal or economic reasons cannot decide to have a child; congratulates the people of Poland who are standing up to oppose this change, and calls on the Scottish Executive to also offer messages of support to the demonstrators and to urge the Polish government to respect the rights of women to free, safe abortion.
