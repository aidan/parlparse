*S2M-3560 Mr Mark Ruskell: Stirling Students’ Support for Palestinian Right to Education Campaign—That the Parliament notes the continued occupation of Palestine by Israel and the constraints imposed by Israel upon the right to education for Palestinians; congratulates the University of Stirling Students’ Association on its recent decision to support the Palestinian Birzeit University students’ right to education campaign; further believes that there will only be peace in Palestine when there is justice for Palestinians; applauds the action of the Stirling student body in publicly expressing links of solidarity with Palestinian students in their time of need, through building a bridge of friendship between the students of Stirling and Birzeit universities, and calls on the University of Stirling to follow the students’ lead by exploring the opportunity for establishing a formal twinning relationship with Birzeit University.
