 *S2M-2172 Christine Grahame: Strategies Against Poverty—That the Parliament notes the recent report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF), Strategies against poverty, published on 13 December 2004, which makes clear the link between deprivation and related problems such as drug cultures, crime and family breakdown; recognises the need to focus greater resources and energy on eradicating poverty from our communities; notes that the JRF report argues that only a "modest share of economic growth would be needed to raise the poorest people in our society above the poverty threshold"; further notes the positive conclusion of the JRF, that real progress is possible to eradicate poverty "provided the political will exists", and calls on the Minister for Communities to back his commitment to "eradicating child poverty" with a firm action plan which incorporates the key recommendations and conclusions of the JRF report.
