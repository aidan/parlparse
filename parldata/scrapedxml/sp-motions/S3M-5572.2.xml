*S3M-5572.2 Ross Finnie: Prescription Charges and NHS Spending Priorities with Particular Reference to Health Visitors—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5572) in the name of Mary Scanlon, leave out from "the money" to end and insert "it is unjustifiable for the Scottish Government to continue to make consultants’ distinction and clinical excellence awards in 2010-11 including under its new Scottish Clinical Leadership and Excellence Awards scheme to be introduced on 1 April 2010, and further believes that the money saved from both of these measures would be better spent on other priorities."
