*S1M-3099# Pauline McNeill: Funding Mismatch for Local Authorities-That the Parliament notes the erosion of grant income resulting in a severe funding mismatch for six local authorities, including Glasgow City Council, as identified in a specially commissioned report by Professor Midwinter of Strathclyde University; further notes that the mismatch occurred as a direct result of local government reorganisation in 1996 following which grant income fell 4.6% for these local authorities against a Scottish average drop of 1.2%; expresses concern at the direct affect that these budgetary restraints have had on council tax payers with a 20% increase in the affected authorities against a Scottish average of 16%; recognises that Glasgow City Council and the other five councils have since operated at a financial disadvantage; supports the call of the six local authorities and Professor Midwinter for restoration of £50 million, £32 million going to Glasgow, and considers that the Scottish Executive should rectify this mismatch immediately and ensure equitable distribution of future grant increases.
