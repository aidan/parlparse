*S3M-1311 Jamie Hepburn: Launch of the Automotrice Grande Vitesse—That the Parliament notes the launch of the Automotrice Grande Vitesse, a new generation high-speed train, which will be used on the rapidly developing European high-speed rail network; believes that such progress on mainland Europe leaves the UK rail network at risk of falling even further behind technological developments and consequently facing greater difficulty in achieving integration; welcomes new initiatives by the Scottish Government to improve Scotland’s rail infrastructure, and further believes that the people of Scotland will only achieve the 21st-century high speed rail network that they need and deserve once the Parliament has all the powers necessary to bring this about.
