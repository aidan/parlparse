 * S2M-2651 Alex Johnstone: Meeting Scotland’s Future Energy Needs—That the Parliament welcomes and supports the conclusions and recommendations of the House of Commons Scottish Affairs Committee’s report, “Meeting Scotland’s Future Energy Needs”; agrees that it is “vital that decisions are taken now to obviate the possibility of, quite literally, the lights going out in Scotland in the foreseeable future”, and further agrees that it is unwise to assume that emerging technologies can meet a quarter of the renewable proportion of Scotland’s energy needs and that, if the Executive is serious about tackling climate change and securing our energy supply, it must make a commitment to nuclear power in Scotland for the long term.
