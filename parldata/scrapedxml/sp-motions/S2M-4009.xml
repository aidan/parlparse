*S2M-4009 Ms Sandra White: British and American Nuclear Testing—That the Parliament utterly condemns the nuclear test, "Krakatau", carried out jointly by the British and American governments in Nevada on 23 February 2006; understands that the results could be used to develop further nuclear capabilities; recognises that other countries are coming under unwarranted pressure not to expand their nuclear capability, and suggests that this blatant hypocrisy in no way helps to develop a mature and sensible debate on weapons of mass destruction at this critical time.
