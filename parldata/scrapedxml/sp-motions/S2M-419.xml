*S2M-419 Mike Pringle: Hearts FC and its Welcome to Bosnian Refugees-That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Hearts FC to give free tickets to Bosnian refugees living in Edinburgh for the game between Hearts and NK Zeljeznicar; further welcomes the opportunity refugees had to be involved in an event in their community and meet the football players; congratulates the Community Help and Advice Initiative charity for their work with refugees, and calls on Scottish football clubs to make the most of similar opportunities for involving members of the local community when playing European ties.
