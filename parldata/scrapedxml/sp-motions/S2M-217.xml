*S2M-217 Richard Lochhead: Freedom to Express Scottish Identityâ€”That the Parliament notes with dismay that the University of Aberdeen Careers Advisory Service advises students that, when applying for jobs, they should define themselves as "British" rather than "Scottish" in order to enhance their employment prospects; believes that this advice is misplaced and symptomatic of the Scottish cringe which has held Scotland back for decades and undermines the confidence of young Scots; calls on any advice providers to recognise that increasing numbers of Scots view themselves as Scottish first and foremost and welcomes this increasing self-confidence, and believes that, in the unlikely event that any employer were to downgrade applicants because they took pride in their Scottish identity, such an action would be utterly foolish and counterproductive.
