 *S3M-5107 Sandra White: Assurances Sought over Future of RBS Insurance Workers—That the Parliament notes that plans for a sell-off of the Royal Bank of Scotland’s (RBS) insurance division as part of a wider process of restructuring at the bank may have a direct impact on jobs in the sector in Scotland and particularly in Glasgow, where around 1,600 jobs are based; welcomes ongoing discussions to ensure that both jobs and headquarter functions are maintained in Scotland, and seeks assurances from those involved in the proposed sell-off of the RBS insurance division that any final decision will, as a priority, protect the future of the workforce.
