*S3M-1031 Tricia Marwick: MS Society’s Putting the Pieces Together Campaign—That the Parliament commends Multiple Sclerosis Society Scotland’s "Putting the Pieces Together" campaign to raise awareness of the impact of multiple sclerosis on people’s lives; notes that it is estimated that around 10,500 people in Scotland have MS, the highest incidence anywhere in the world, and that women between the ages of 20 and 40 are most likely to be diagnosed with the condition; further notes that, despite being the most commonly diagnosed neurological condition among young adults in Scotland, MS remains a largely unknown or misunderstood condition, and calls on the Scottish Government to develop its support for people with MS and, in particular, to ensure that the MS Register is established as soon as possible in order to provide a fuller picture of the condition in Scotland.
