*S1M-3467 Mr Lloyd Quinan: Autism Services for Adultsâ€”That the Parliament recognises, in the light of the inquiry into the suicide and unlawful killing of a single mother and her 11-year-old autistic son in County Durham last year, that there is a desperate need for improved and integrated services for adolescents with an autistic spectrum disorder and their families; further recognises that parents are anxious about the future as they age and as the necessary services do not exist to replace their care of their children; notes that there is now a far greater number of adults with autistic spectrum disorders than there are children, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to take action to challenge the misconception that autism is a condition that only affects children by providing necessary and much-needed health, educational and employment services to ensure these people are able to reach their potential in adulthood.
