*S2M-5506 Mark Ballard: Fair TV Licensing Rules for Students—That the Parliament notes that hotels are required to pay for one television licence for their first 15 rooms and one for each additional five rooms, but that students in halls are required to pay for one per room and that a family home is required to pay for one licence while many student flats have to pay for one per television; further notes that the Edinburgh students’ Advice Place calculates that the average student at Edinburgh accrues £100 of debt per week; notes that the Edinburgh University Students Association has launched a campaign for fair TV licensing rules for students, and calls on the Westminster Parliament to review this policy at the next possible opportunity.
