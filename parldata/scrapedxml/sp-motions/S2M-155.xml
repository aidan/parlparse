*S2M-155 Rosie Kane: Free School Meals Policy in Wales—That the Parliament congratulates the National Assembly for Wales on introducing free school breakfasts to all primary school children in Wales before the end of its second term; commends the initiative of the Labour Party in Wales in bringing this policy onto the legislative agenda and recommends that Labour Party members of the Parliament look at the Welsh Labour official press briefing which answered the question of why free school meals should be provided by stating "to help tackle poverty and because the costs involved in setting up a bureaucratic system to collect money, account for it, follow payments up if not made, etc. would eat into the potential revenue as to make it not worth collecting. By not confining the scheme to those entitled to free school meals we avoid the problem of stigma with very young children."
