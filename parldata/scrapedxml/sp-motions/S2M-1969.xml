*S2M-1969 Christine Grahame: "Wear a Hat Day" (and possibly gloves, coat and scarf)—That the Parliament notes and congratulates Age Concern on its initiative, Wear a Hat Day, on 3 December 2004 to raise funds to publicise, and raise the profile of, the devastating impact of cold weather on the health and well-being of older people; recognises that hypothermia is a silent killer and that older people may not realise how cold they have become until it is too late; while applauding this initiative in fighting the freeze, expresses anger that it is necessary in an energy-rich nation such as Scotland, where the predicted figures for admissions to hospital from hypothermia for the current year for people aged 65 and upwards is 115, the figures for excess winter mortality in the year 2002-03 were 2510, 37% of single pension households, comprising 128,000 households, are classed as fuel poor and Scotland falls well behind the Scandinavian nations in ensuring that winter deaths are minimised; notes the substantial impact rising fuel prices have on those on a fixed income such as a pension, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to enter into discussions with Her Majesty’s Government with regard to abolishing the means-tested pension credit which 48% of those entitled to claim in Scotland do not claim and which, in any event, is unjust, with a view to providing a pension that will bring an end to pensioner fuel poverty and make "wear a hat" days superfluous.
