 *S3M-1283 Mary Scanlon: Congratulations to Buckie Community High School—That the Parliament congratulates the staff and pupils of Buckie Community High School on their efforts to become one of the greenest schools in the country; notes it is one of only 100 schools from across the whole country to be selected to install rooftop solar panels through the Co-operative Group’s £1 million Green Energy for Schools scheme; further notes that a monitor will be installed to display the amount of electricity generated and CO2 emissions being saved, and recognises that the panels will reduce the school’s reliance on fossil fuels at a time when costs are rising and will also support course work in subjects such as geography and science.
