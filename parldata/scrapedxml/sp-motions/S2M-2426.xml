 * S2M-2426# Mr Brian Monteith:Resources to Police Boards—That the Parliament recognises the vital role that the police play within Scottish communities; believes that it is vital that Scotland’s police forces are adequately resourced to ensure maximum protection to the public; acknowledges that Scottish police boards have very little time to brief and consult constituent local authorities before finalising the budget for their police force area; agrees that it is vital that figures provided by the Scottish Executive with regard to local authority grants are as accurate as possible to aid this process; therefore notes with concern that there were errors in the detail of local authority funding announced by the Executive on 8 December 2004 which have resulted in uncertainty facing many police boards across Scotland with regard to grant support for police loan charges and common police services; is concerned that some local authorities have had to source additional funding, such as Scottish Borders which has had to find an additional £650,000 from its already-agreed budget allocations, and therefore considers that the Executive should engage urgently with our police boards to resolve any problems and to ensure that such mistakes are not repeated in the future.
