*S3M-1843 Robert Brown: Glasgow Housing Association and Second Stage Transfers—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Stock Valuation Study on Secondary Stock Transfer by Glasgow Housing Association (GHA), produced by Mazars LLP; notes that second stage transfers have been publicly stated to be a priority for GHA and the Scottish Government; notes that the Mazars report confirms criticisms of the valuation methodology used by GHA, particularly the failure to disaggregate entire cost categories, contingency costs, management costs or central overhead costs and the failure to account for the reduced and delayed call on GHA’s private finance facility; notes that these valuation issues appear to compromise the principle of financial neutrality and to render individual stock transfers less viable, and calls on the Scottish Government to facilitate discussion and mediation between GHA and the relevant local housing organisations to ensure that second stage transfers proceed speedily and equitably in the interests of all tenants.
