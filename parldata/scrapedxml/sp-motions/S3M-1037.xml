*S3M-1037 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Scottish SPCA—That the Parliament applauds the determination and commitment of the Scottish SPCA (SSPCA) in its difficult work to reduce animal suffering and encourage responsible pet ownership; notes the vastly increased pressure on SSPCA resources over the festive period due to the rise in the number of unwanted and abandoned animals; notes that between November 2006 and February 2007 the SSPCA received 802 calls from people wanting them to take their pets; regrets that the staff themselves are often subjected to abusive phone calls for implementing their policy of restricting the re-homing of puppies and kittens from animal welfare centres until after the Christmas period, and supports its seasonal campaign to end the impulsive buying of pets for Christmas presents which often results in unwanted, abused and neglected animals in the New Year.
