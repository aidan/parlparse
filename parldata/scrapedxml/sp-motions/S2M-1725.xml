*S2M-1725# Bristow Muldoon: St John’s Hospital in Livingston—That the Parliament believes that it is not in the best interests of the people of Lothian that, with effect from 27 September 2004, NHS Lothian intends to remove emergency and major general surgery from St John’s Hospital, in spite of it being a modern hospital with an excellent clinical record and a recently-expanded accident and emergency department; further believes that it is outrageous that NHS Lothian made a decision to remove this service and trauma orthopaedic surgery without full public consultation or ministerial approval, and considers that the Minister for Health and Community Care should urgently intervene and require that the emergency surgical services are properly resourced to sustain the services at St John’s. Supported by: Mr Kenny MacAskill*
