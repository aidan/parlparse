*S1M-3174 Christine Grahame: Care Provision for Elderly People in Dunbar—That the Parliament notes with concern the reduction of care provision for elderly people in Dunbar and, in particular, the reduction in the number of beds at Belhaven Hospital which may result in frail elderly people being transferred to facilities in Edinburgh, distant from family, friends and familiar surroundings; further notes the imminent closure of the Church of Scotland respite day care centre at the Old Manse, reducing the provision of respite relief for carers; is concerned by the distress that this will cause frail elderly people and their carers, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive as a matter of urgency to correct the failure to provide locally by providing adequate resources in order to ensure that the elderly in Dunbar and, indeed, elsewhere in East Lothian, can remain in their failing years in their home locality, that they are treated with the dignity and consideration they have earned and that their carers, families and friends are given practical support. Supported by: Mr Adam Ingram*, Mr Kenneth Gibson*, Fiona Hyslop*
