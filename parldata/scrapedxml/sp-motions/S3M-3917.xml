 *S3M-3917 Patricia Ferguson: Proposed School Closures by Glasgow City Councilâ€”That the Parliament applauds the Save Our Schools campaign mounted by the parents of the five schools proposed for closure in the Glasgow Maryhill constituency; acknowledges the detrimental impact that such closures would have on local communities throughout the area; considers the arguments against closure to be compelling and well made, and hopes that, even at this late stage in the process, those arguments will prevail at the council meeting on 23 April 2009. Supported by: Bill Butler*, Elaine Smith*, Kenneth Gibson*, Robert Brown*
