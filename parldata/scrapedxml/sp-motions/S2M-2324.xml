 * S2M-2324 Pauline McNeill:Kenny Richey Reprieve—That the Parliament congratulates Kenny Richey on having his murder conviction and sentence overturned after 18 years on death row in the United States; notes that the ruling of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit that Richey must be retried within 90 days or freed came only two days before the 18th anniversary of his incarceration at Mansfield Correctional Institution following his conviction for arson and murder in 1986 and his sentence to death on 27 January 1987; further notes that, although his case has been overturned on a technicality, Kenny Richey has always maintained his innocence and has been prepared to be executed rather than make a false confession; acknowledges the campaigning efforts, spearheaded by Amnesty International, in raising the public profile of this injustice, claiming it was one of the most compelling cases of apparent innocence that human rights campaigners have ever come across; welcomes the support of the British government and cross-party support of many MSPs in signing an amicus curiae and petitions; further welcomes the support that the campaign has received from the European Parliament, Pope John Paul II and the former Archbishop of Canterbury, and considers that MSPs and campaigners should keep up the pressure to support the campaign as the State of Ohio may continue with appeal proceedings against this decision within 14 days or set a date for a retrial within 90 days.
