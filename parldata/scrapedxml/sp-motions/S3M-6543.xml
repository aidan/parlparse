 *S3M-6543 Bill Kidd: Lib Dems Nuclear Self-destruction—That the Parliament expresses disappointment at the decision by the Liberal Democrat Party to vote against an amendment to the strategic defence and security review, which would have seen the Trident nuclear weapons system included in it; notes that The Coalition: our programme for government published by the UK Government explicitly stated that "the renewal of Trident should be scrutinised to ensure value for money" and that "the Liberal Democrats will continue to make the case for alternatives"; further notes that the Scottish Parliament voted against a replacement for Trident, and believes that any meaningful debate on the future of defence needs and expenditure should include a review of the need for the Trident nuclear weapons system. Supported by: Alasdair Allan*, Brian Adam*, Bill Butler*, Kenneth Gibson*, Sandra White*, Patrick Harvie*, Willie Coffey*, Bill Wilson*, Anne McLaughlin*, Aileen Campbell*
