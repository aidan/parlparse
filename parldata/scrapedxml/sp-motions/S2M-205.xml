 *S2M-205 Mr Ted Brocklebank: Proposed EU Council Regulation on Recovery of Cod Stocksâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal for an EU Council regulation establishing measures for the recovery of cod stocks; expresses disquiet at the leakage of information from the EU commissioner responsible for agriculture, rural development and fisheries, Franz Fischler, which appears to seek to undermine the current recovery measures, and notes with concern the provisional information emanating from the International Council for Exploration of the Sea on the state of cod stocks in the North Sea, and elsewhere, and the possible serious effect that this might have on the future catching effort.
