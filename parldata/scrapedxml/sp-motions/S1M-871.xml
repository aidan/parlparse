*S1M-871# Michael Russell: Shirley McKie and the Scottish Criminal Records Office—That the Parliament notes the prosecution of Shirley McKie for perjury arising out of a Strathclyde Police investigation, the complete vindication of Shirley McKie following trial, and the body of evidence collated by BBC Frontline Scotland which proves, with the involvement of leading international fingerprint experts, that the fingerprint evidence led at her case was false; regrets that there has yet to be any attempt to apologise to, or secure financial restitution for, Shirley McKie despite her great personal suffering and the loss of her career in Strathclyde Police; expresses concern that the fingerprint officers from the Scottish Criminal Record Office (SCRO) involved in her case have not been suspended and that no full and independent investigation has been ordered by the Scottish Executive into the actions of either Strathclyde Police or SCRO, and considers that the Scottish Executive should accept the implications of the McKie case which must include such investigations as well as a complete re-examination of criminal prosecutions involving fingerprint identification from SCRO and those officers.
