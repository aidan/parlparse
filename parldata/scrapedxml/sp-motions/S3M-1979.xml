*S3M-1979 Margaret Smith: Edinburgh Zoo Bid for Giant Pandasâ€”That the Parliament recognises the work of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland in securing a pair of breeding giant pandas, which will be located at Edinburgh Zoo; notes that the zoo already has an impressive track record on worldwide conservation and habitat management; appreciates that these pandas will be an important part of the extended captive breeding, research and educational programme operated in China; acknowledges the contribution that captive breeding makes to our understanding of the species, to its gene pool and to a diverse and sustainable panda population, and calls on the zoo to work together with the City of Edinburgh Council and other key partners to discuss and address any local or city-wide impacts and any animal welfare issues involved in bringing pandas to the zoo.
