*S2M-5230 Shiona Baird: Launch of University of Dundee’s UNESCO Centre for Water, Law, Policy and Science—That the Parliament congratulates the University of Dundee on the formal launch in Brussels on 28 November 2006 of its pioneering UNESCO Centre for Water Law, Policy and Science, which is the first centre in the world dedicated to developing legal frameworks to help address the pressing problems related to the management of the world’s water resources; applauds the work to date of the Dundee centre, which is already engaged in developing frameworks for the effective management of water resources, training a new generation of water leaders and linking scientists, policymakers and lawyers in projects around the world in order to ensure that all the world’s people have fair and equitable access to water, and recognises the significant achievement of Dundee in securing the first UNESCO centre in the United Kingdom, which confirms its place at the cutting edge of policy development and its invaluable practical contribution to tackling what is likely to be one of the greatest challenges of the next century, namely the need to share equitably the most important resource - water.
