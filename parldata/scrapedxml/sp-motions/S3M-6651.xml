*S3M-6651 Mike Pringle: Live-N-Learn—That the Parliament commends the innovative and unique work of the Live-N-Learn training provider based in Edinburgh South; considers that this company has raised the confidence of thousands of young people by designing fun, interactive workshops that deliver the message that success comes from hard work, effort, resilience and taking personal responsibility; further notes that Live-N-Learn’s work using up-to-date interactive technology has been embraced by schools throughout every local authority, and observes that Live-N-Learn’s message reflects the recent extensive research by Professor Carol Dweck on mindsets, which is an approach endorsed by Dr Carol Craig at the Centre for Confidence and Well-being.
