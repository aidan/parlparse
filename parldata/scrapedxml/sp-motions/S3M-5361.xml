*S3M-5361 Claire Baker: 11 December 2009, Day of Action on Student Hardship—That the Parliament supports the National Union of Students in its efforts to highlight student hardship through a national day of action on the 11 December 2009; notes the events and action organised by student associations at universities and colleges across Scotland, including associations at Edinburgh Napier University, the University of Edinburgh, Inverness UHI College, James Watt College, Glasgow Metropolitan College, the Univeristy of Aberdeen and Aberdeen College, undertaking such activities as writing letters and petitions at the University of Stirling and a petition to Alex Salmond MSP from Banff and Buchan College; believes that this action signals that hardship remains a significant issue for students in Scotland; considers that the Scottish Government has broken its promise to dump the debt; believes that student hardship is a key factor in forcing students from lower-income backgrounds into commercial debt, to spend more than the guideline number of hours in part-time work recommended by the Cubie report or to drop out of their studies altogether; considers that opposition parties have been successful in directing the £30 million made available by the Scottish Government for student support toward putting more pounds in student pockets; remains concerned that, despite these efforts, poorer students still receive less financial support than those in the rest of the UK, and urges the Scottish Government to address this inequality.
