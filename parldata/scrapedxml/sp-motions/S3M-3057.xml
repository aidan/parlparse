*S3M-3057 Liam McArthur: Scots Trad Music Awards—That the Parliament congratulates all the winners of the Scots Trad Music Awards 2008; notes that the keen competition for each of the awards is a clear sign of the strength in depth of traditional music across Scotland; particularly notes that Orkney musicians have once again come to the fore with three winners, Kris Drever as Instrumentalist of the Year, The Chair as Scottish Folk Band of the Year and Jeana Leslie and Siobhan Miller as the Up and Coming Artists of the Year; believes that this is a fair reflection of Orkney’s strength in the field of traditional music, with both established and young musicians maintaining and building Orkney’s musical reputation; looks forward to next year’s Orkney Folk Festival, and recommends that visitors from across Scotland and around the world visit Orkney to hear for themselves the music played on the islands where it has its roots.
