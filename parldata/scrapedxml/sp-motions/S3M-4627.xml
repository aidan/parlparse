*S3M-4627 Claire Baker: Student Hardship Crisis in Scotland—That the Parliament expresses deep concern at new statistics on the levels of student hardship at colleges and universities in Scotland; notes that the report, Higher and Further Education Students’ Income, Expenditure and Debt in Scotland 2007-08, finds a 60% increase in students’ reliance on credit card and bank loan borrowing among higher education students and a huge increase of 334% among college students over the last three years; further notes findings that 38% of higher education and 40% of college students have considered dropping out, with financial considerations cited as the largest reason, and that many students have gone without food, heating, books for study and prescriptions or medicines because of a shortage of money; expresses concern that this research took place before the economic downturn hit students in Scotland; believes it is further proof that increasing money in students’ pockets must at this stage take precedent over reducing graduate debt; highlights the calls from student leaders across Scotland for increased availability of student loans from the Scottish Government, and calls on the Scottish Government to use existing resources to implement the main opposition parties’ action plan to tackle student hardship by providing a £500 increase in grants and a £7,000 minimum income for the poorest students, a £200 increase in support for all students and nearly £2 million additional investment in childcare and hardship funds.
