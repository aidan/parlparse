*S2M-3388 Rosie Kane: Population Deficit and Glasgow School Closures—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Executive for all and any initiatives it takes to reverse the skills and population deficit in Scotland; recognises that a dwindling population is an economic time bomb which threatens health, education, social work and many other essential services which the people of Scotland will surely always rely on; looks forward to toasting the success of the Executive in this extremely important challenge; expresses concern that if the Executive is successful there will not be enough schools in Glasgow to educate its growing young population if Glasgow City Council proceeds with its current plans to cut back on and close schools throughout the city; notes that this includes 51 primaries, 22 pre-five centres, four special educational needs units and one bilingual support unit, and finally is concerned that this measure shows little confidence on the part of Labour-led Glasgow City Council in the success of the Executive’s initiatives.
