*S3M-4693 Mike Pringle: Cash Boost for Telecare Services—That the Parliament welcomes the City of Edinburgh Council’s massive £1 million home care boost to increase funding for its Telecare programme now being extended across Edinburgh, which will allow vulnerable and older people to remain independent in their own homes, reduce the need for long-term care or hospital admission and save an estimated 3,000 hospital bed days and 3,000 care home days per year, while also expanding the Telecare programme to offer increased support to domestic abuse sufferers and disability groups.
