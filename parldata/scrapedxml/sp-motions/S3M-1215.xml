*S3M-1215 Willie Coffey: Commemoration by Royal Mail of the 250th Anniversary of the Birth of Robert Burns—That the Parliament recognises the outstanding life and work of Scotland’s bard, Robert Burns; notes that the man, born in Ayrshire on 25 January 1759 to a Kincardineshire father and an Ayrshire mother, combined his inheritance of Scotland’s strong oral and musical traditions with a wide-ranging but restricted formal education; recognises his emergence as a poet through the publication of the Kilmarnock Edition of his poems on 31 July 1786 as a milestone in the development of Scottish culture; notes that, following his death in Dumfries on 21 July 1796, Burns was widely recognised as Scotland’s bard, a position he has commanded ever since; acknowledges that, through works such as A Man’s A Man for a’ That and Auld Lang Syne, Burns’ reputation and influence has spread across the globe, and calls on the Royal Mail to mark the 250th anniversary of the birth of Robert Burns through the issuing of suitable commemorative stamps.
