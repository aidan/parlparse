*S3M-718 Mary Scanlon: British Heart Foundation Scotland’s Heart 2 Heart Appeal—That the Parliament supports the ongoing British Heart Foundation (BHF) Scotland’s Heart 2 Heart appeal to raise £500,000 to provide specialist heart failure nurses for the Highlands and encourages MSPs and the public to do all they can to support it; is aware that heart failure is a serious and debilitating condition, for which there is no cure, affecting around 100,000 people across Scotland; notes that SIGN guideline 95 on the management of chronic heart failure recommends the provision of home-based specialist nurse-led services, which have been shown to reduce unnecessary rehospitalisation for seriously ill patients, as well as cutting premature mortality; believes that every patient experiencing heart failure who requires access to a community-based specialist heart failure nursing service should receive it, and urges NHS boards, the Scottish Government and charities like BHF Scotland to continue to work together on its provision, especially on ensuring that sustainable and viable funding for this crucial service in every part of the country is secured for the future.
