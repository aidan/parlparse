 *S2M-2122 Mr Adam Ingram: Prescribing Anti-Depressants—That the Parliament acknowledges the warnings from the medical profession, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency and the National Institute of Clinical Excellence regarding the rise in the prescribing of anti-depressants and, in particular, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and their safety; notes that, whilst medication has a role to play for some patients, other non-pharmacological therapies must be made widely available to offer both patients and GPs alternative methods of treatment, and calls on the Scottish Executive to commit itself to increase both the standard and availability of non-pharmacological treatment.
