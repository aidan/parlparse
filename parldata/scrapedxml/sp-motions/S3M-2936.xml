*S3M-2936 Kenneth Gibson: Ban Tobacco Vending Machines—That the Parliament welcomes the British Heart Foundation’s campaign for a ban on tobacco sold from vending machines across the United Kingdom; notes that one in 10 under-age smokers in Scotland regularly buys tobacco illegally from vending machines and that this proportion could increase following the rise in the minimum legal age for purchase of tobacco; warmly welcomes the developments on tobacco control in recent years in Scotland, including the particular focus on young people in the Smoking Prevention Action Plan, and urges the Scottish Government to continue to lead the way in the United Kingdom on tobacco control by legislating for an outright ban on the sale of tobacco from vending machines in the forthcoming Health Bill.
