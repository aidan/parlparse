*S2M-3981&lt;&gt; Margaret Mitchell: Scottish Family Business Association—That the Parliament welcomes and supports the Scottish Family Business Association, a non-profit solutions-focused organisation set up by and for family businesses, launched on 21 February 2006; notes that almost 70% of Scottish businesses describe themselves as family businesses; recognises the significant contribution indigenous family business in Lanarkshire, Falkirk, Ayrshire and the rest of Scotland makes to the Scottish economy, generating roughly half of the GDP created by private enterprise; acknowledges that 50% of the private sector workforce in Scotland is employed by family businesses; further notes that family-run businesses face many tough challenges, including succession, inheritance, non-family involvement and improving family communication, and believes that the Scottish Executive should work with the Scottish Family Business Association in an effort to ensure that all family businesses in Scotland achieve the same success and sustainability as Scotland’s best known family-run firms. Supported by: Alex Johnstone*, Brian Adam*, Mrs Nanette Milne*, Eleanor Scott*, Mr Jamie McGrigor*
