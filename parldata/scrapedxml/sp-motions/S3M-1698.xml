*S3M-1698 Bob Doris: Moving Forward with Free School Meals—That the Parliament welcomes the partnership between the Scottish Government and five local authority areas that are participating in the pilot scheme for the provision of free and nutritious school meals to all children in P1, P2 and P3; notes that this pro-health and anti-poverty pilot ends in summer 2008 and that it will be evaluated in 2009 with the hope that all P1, P2 and P3 pupils across Scotland will receive these from August 2010, as outlined in the Scottish Government’s concordat with local authorities; further notes that sections of the Education (Scotland) Act 1980 have been disapplied until the end of June 2008 through a statutory instrument passed by the Parliament in order to allow local authorities to provide free and nutritious school meals; calls on the Scottish Government to use section 57 of the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 to allow any local authority that wishes to provide such meals to all children in P1, P2 and P3 to do so before August 2010 and hopes that local authorities, particularly those involved in the pilot which is coming to an end, would use such freedom to look seriously at continuing to provide free and nutritious school meals in the school year 2008-09 rather than waiting until August 2010.
