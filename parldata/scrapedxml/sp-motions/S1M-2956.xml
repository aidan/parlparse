*S1M-2956# Dennis Canavan: Dystoniaâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the Dystonia Society for its efforts in raising awareness of this little-known but severely debilitating neurological disorder which can cause involuntary sustained and painful muscle spasms in various parts of the body; is concerned that, according to the Dystonia Society, there are at least 38,000 sufferers in the UK who sometimes have to wait years for a correct diagnosis due to a lack of awareness on the part of General Practitioners (GPs); is further concerned about the lack of appropriate genetic testing and neurosurgical treatment options in Scotland; calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that adequate information is given to GPs so that a correct and timeous diagnosis can be made and to provide resources for research into the causes of Dystonia, and calls for the provision of specialist nurses, physiotherapists, counsellors and a regional co-ordinator for Scotland.
