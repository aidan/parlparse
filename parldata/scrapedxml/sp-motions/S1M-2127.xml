 *S1M-2127# Roseanna Cunningham: Training and Care Assistants in Perth and Kinross Schools—That the Parliament recognises the value and importance of work done in schools by training and care assistants; notes the commitment expressed in Perth and Kinross Council’s revenue and capital budget for 2001-2002 to "a policy of integrating children and young people who have special educational needs within local schools wherever possible and educationally desirable" and the pledge that "provision is made for these children and young people within mainstream and designated nursery places, nursery schools, supported places in primary and secondary schools and special schools"; deplores the decision that has been taken by Perth and Kinross Council to reduce both the number of individual training and care assistants in schools and the number of hours provided; expresses its concern at the distress that has been caused to pupils, parents and staff in Perth and Kinross by the actions of the Labour/Tory/Liberal alliance who form the administration on Perth and Kinross Council, and believes that the administration should, as a matter of urgency, reverse its decision.
