*S3M-7934 Kenneth Gibson: Children of Alcoholics Week—That the Parliament recognises the importance of the forthcoming Children of Alcoholics Week, which in 2011 will take place from 13 to 19 February; believes that this international campaign plays a vital role in raising awareness of the problems faced by children of an alcohol-dependent parent or parents and in letting them know that there is support available; acknowledges the assistance available through calling the National Association for Children of Alcoholics helpline on 0800 358 3456; considers that living in an alcohol-dependent environment can have major implications for the development of a child and can often lead to psychological complications in later life; believes that this week is important and welcomes its rising profile, which now enjoys support from a number of celebrities including Marco Pierre White, Tony Adams and Elle Macpherson, and further believes that this issue affects too many young people and that members should work with the National Association for Children of Alcoholics in tackling it.
