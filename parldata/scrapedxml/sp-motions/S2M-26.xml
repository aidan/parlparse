*S2M-26 Tommy Sheridan: Bed Shortages in Glasgow Hospitals—That the Parliament notes the survey conducted by Greater Glasgow Health Council which exposed the unacceptable delays that citizens in Glasgow are forced to endure as a direct result of hospital bed shortages throughout the city; further notes that the examples highlighted in the survey included an 81-year-old man kept waiting in the accident and emergency department for five hours for access to a bed after treatment at Glasgow Royal Infirmary and a 91-year-old women kept waiting for four hours for a bed after treatment at Glasgow’s Southern General Hospital; believes that records to detail every person’s visit to an accident and emergency department in Glasgow and across Scotland must be introduced immediately and that no reduction in overnight or acute beds can be afforded in Glasgow without an emergency investigation of the bed shortage problem, and therefore calls for all plans to reduce the availability of acute and overnight beds at the Stobhill and Victoria hospitals to be halted immediately pending an emergency short-term investigation of the number of acute beds required in the city.
