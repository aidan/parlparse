*S1M-961 Michael Russell: Parthenon Marbles-That the Parliament notes the latest request by the Greek Government for the return of the Parthenon Marbles, which were unlawfully taken from Turkish-occupied Athens almost 200 years ago and which are now held by the British Museum in London; rejects claims by the British Museum that they can look after them more effectively than the people of Greece, these being both patronising and also undermined by recent evidence of defective cleaning work carried out by the Museum on the Marbles; believes that, just as the Scots have received back the Stone of Destiny, so the people of Greece have a right to receive back one of their most important artistic and cultural treasures, and calls upon Her Majesty's Government to return the Marbles to their rightful home in Greece.
