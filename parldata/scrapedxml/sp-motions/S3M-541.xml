*S3M-541 Bill Kidd: Tackling Aircraft Emissions—That the Parliament believes that in order to tackle the issue of aircraft emissions, rather than simply introducing further taxes for travellers, other measures must be developed and that, in a co-ordinated approach to air travel and climate change, such measures should be applied to private and cargo flights, should require airlines to replace aircraft with greener, more efficient, planes within a set timescale and should reform the air passenger duty tax to directly tax the level of aircraft emissions and encourage people by means of incentive to use aircraft that create fewer emissions.
