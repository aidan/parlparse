*S2M-5024 Carolyn Leckie: Time for the Right to Abortion—That the Parliament recognises the national pro-choice week of action, currently taking place; is appalled that, according to the World Health Organisation, 200 women per day die from unsafe abortions; expresses concern that a woman’s right to control her own fertility and destiny is still not a right enshrined in law in Scotland or the United Kingdom; condemns the US Government’s attacks on women’s access to abortion at home and internationally; believes that the current legal framework embeds inequality of women; believes that women are entitled to access quick, safe, supported, non-judgemental and informed abortion services within the NHS when that is what they have chosen, which would reduce the stress of the whole situation, and further believes that the requirement to have the permission of two doctors in order to obtain an abortion should be abolished. Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Patrick Harvie*, Tommy Sheridan*
