*S2M-1612# Carolyn Leckie: Assault on Fire Brigades Union—That the Parliament regrets that the fire service employers have withdrawn from the agreed settlement reached with the Fire Brigades Union (FBU); notes that COSLA has the funding to implement the agreement in full and was willing to do so; believes that Her Majesty’s Government is preparing and inciting a showdown with the FBU with the intention of breaking its organisation and strength; notes the takeover of the fire brigades’ training college by the armed forces in Moreton-in-Marsh, England; notes that members of the armed forces continue to be misused, overstretched and lack basic equipment in deployments and occupations, including Iraq, where the basis on which Her Majesty’s Government went to war has been shown to be false as there were no weapons of mass destruction; believes that the preparation of the armed forces for industrial action by the FBU is a further misuse, setting men and women from similar backgrounds against each other due to the deliberate failure of Her Majesty’s Government to implement an agreed settlement with the FBU; believes that the Scottish Executive and COSLA are in a position to pressurise Her Majesty’s Government by making clear their intention to implement the agreement, averting any further industrial action or misuse of armed forces, and therefore considers that it is incumbent on both parties to do so with the utmost urgency.
