*S3M-3627 Liam McArthur: Congratulations to Essential Scottish Opera—That the Parliament congratulates Scottish Opera on its successful annual tour of opera morsels, Essential Scottish Opera; welcomes these efforts to bring live opera to venues across the country, including Bathgate, Girvan, Broughton, Lochgelly, Banchory, Birnam, Ballachulish, Isle of Mull, Ardfern, Isle of Skye, Gairloch, Calshmore, Sanday (Orkney), Strathpeffer and Boat of Garten; believes that this initiative provides an excellent opportunity for local communities across Scotland to enjoy opera in a relaxed and informal setting, while also ensuring that up-and-coming singers and musicians benefit from the chance to perform live in very intimate venues; notes that the performance in Sanday Community School has drawn favourable comparisons with the legendary school production of Oklahoma in 1981, and wishes Essential Scottish Opera success with future tours of this type.
