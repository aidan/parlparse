*S3M-6533 David Whitton: Kirkintilloch Walkers are Welcome—That the Parliament congratulates Penny Sinclair for single-handedly winning Kirkintilloch’s recognition as one of the 45 Walkers are Welcome towns thus far in the United Kingdom; notes that Penny collected over 600 signatures of support from the community, got the backing of East Dunbartonshire Council and formed a steering group to drive the scheme forward, and considers that, with the canal, the railway walkway, the Campsies and Campsie Glen in and around Kirkintilloch, recognition as a Walkers are Welcome town will increase visitor numbers and encourage locals to take advantage of the scenery on their doorstep. Supported by: Hugh O’Donnell*, Helen Eadie*, Des McNulty*, John Wilson*, Mary Mulligan*, James Kelly*, Jackie Baillie*, Karen Whitefield*, Hugh Henry*, Elaine Smith*, Cathy Peattie*, Bill Kidd*
