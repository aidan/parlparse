*S3M-6624 Dr Richard Simpson: Scottish Rugby Success—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish rugby team and coaches for their unparalleled success in Argentina, winning both tests against the Argentinians; notes that, in achieving this, the team played in differing weather conditions that fully tested its capacity to respond; further notes that Scotland has now won three consecutive away test matches for the first time in over 25 years, and hopes that this success will encourage many more people to take up rugby thus ensuring the continuing restoration of Scotland’s place in the rugby world.
