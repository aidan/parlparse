*S2M-5135 Mr Mark Ruskell: UN Climate Talks in Nairobi, November 2007â€”That the Parliament welcomes the meeting of signatories to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change taking place in Nairobi, Kenya, to discuss a successor treaty to the Kyoto Protocol which will expire in its current form in 2012; notes that this is the 12th set of UN climate talks since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit but that global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, and calls on the Scottish Executive to use all channels, including with the UK Government, to demand that the parties agree a new UN treaty to set binding targets for a cut in global atmospheric carbon emissions of 90% by 2050 to stave off the worst effects of climate change, that a new treaty must be based on the principle of "contraction and convergence" under which richer nations most responsible for greenhouse gas emissions have the greatest responsibility to reduce them, that the Kyoto Protocol is expanded to include aviation and shipping and that all industrialised countries sign the treaty, particularly the United States of America.
