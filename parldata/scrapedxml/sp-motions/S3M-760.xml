*S3M-760 George Foulkes: Put Your Money Where Your Mouth Was—That the Parliament agrees with Kenny MacAskill MSP that Edinburgh should be fully recognised and funded for the cost of being a capital city; echoes Nicola Sturgeon MSP’s remarks in 2004 that the additional £600,000 given to Lothian and Borders Police was "not enough to cover the cost of policing the Parliament and special events"; supports the view held by John Swinney MSP that "Hardly a week goes by without Edinburgh seeing a major event or high profile visit. From President Putin to members of the Royal Family, Lothian and Borders has to cope with Capital City duties", and believes that Edinburgh should be given the resources appropriate to its capital city status.
