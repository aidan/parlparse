*S1M-2540 Trish Godman: Career Opportunities in the Scottish Maritime Industry—That the Parliament warmly commends the crew of the Caledonian MacBrayne ferry "Caledonian Isles", their shorebased colleagues and members of the Glasgow and West of Scotland Maritime Careers Group for their active participation in recent promotional events designed to raise schoolchildren’s awareness of career opportunities in the Scottish maritime industry and believes that such recruitment initiatives will be of considerable importance to the industry and to Scottish school leavers who are keen to engage in satisfying and worthwhile careers both afloat and ashore.
