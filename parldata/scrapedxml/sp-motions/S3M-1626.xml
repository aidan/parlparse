*S3M-1626# Angela Constance: No Recourse No Safety—That the Parliament notes the publication of No Recourse No Safety: The Government’s Failure to Protect Women from Violence, a report by Amnesty International and the Southall Black Sisters; is disturbed by the evidence that not having recourse to public funds prevents women with insecure immigration status from accessing the benefits they need to claim refuge, effectively trapping women in violence or destitution; welcomes the Scottish Government’s ongoing commitment to tackling violence against women, continuing the good work commenced by the previous Scottish administration; acknowledges the pivotal contribution of local services such as the West Lothian Council Domestic Abuse Service which provides a service to women from a minority population; notes that not having recourse to public funds affects women who have valid visas as spouses, students, visitors and workers and those who are classed as "overstayers" in addition to victims of trafficking; acknowledges that organisations such as West Lothian Women’s Aid are accommodating and assisting women with no recourse to public funds, and commends the recommendations of No Recourse No Safety, in particular the need for the Scottish Government to put in place emergency funding while a permanent solution from the UK Government is sought, namely exempting women fleeing violence from the no recourse to public funds requirement.
