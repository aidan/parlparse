 *S3M-1644 Jamie Hepburn: Scottish Action Against Council Tax—That the Parliament welcomes the support of the Scottish Action Against Council Tax campaign for the Scottish Government’s consultation on local income tax; notes that the campaign believes that a local income tax Bill "should not be turned into a political football" and that "obstructing the introduction of a local income tax shows contempt for the wishes of the Scottish people", and calls on members from all parties to respect the campaign’s appeal "to all fair minded political parties and MSPs not to let Scotland down in this respect".
