*S2M-5094 Mr David Davidson: 30 Years of Oil Exploration and Production in the North Seaâ€”That the Parliament notes the 30th anniversary of the first oil being taken from the North Sea; welcomes the contribution that the oil and gas sector has made to the economy of the north east of Scotland and in making Aberdeen the oil capital of Europe; further notes the challenges facing the sector as it builds on this experience and looks to the future, diversifying and developing new markets in renewable energy to enable Aberdeen to become the energy capital of the world, and recognises that the sector has many future years of development which will require more young people to acquire skills to enjoy a productive future in the industry and Scottish universities and colleges to provide the required education and training, suitably supported by the Scottish Executive.
