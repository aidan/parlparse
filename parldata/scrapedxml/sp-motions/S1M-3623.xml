*S1M-3623# Mr Duncan Hamilton: Glasgow to Barra Air Link Public Service Obligation-That the Parliament notes with concern the decision to award a public service obligation order to the Glasgow to Barra air link for one year only; recognises that such orders are normally awarded for three years; further recognises the concern felt in Barra that this constitutes a major threat to the long-term future of the air service which, in turn, could engender more social and economic decline in an area already affected by depopulation, and believes that the Scottish Executive should reinstate the order for three years.
