*S2M-2276# Trish Godman: The Future of Clydeside Shipyards—That the Parliament offers its compliments to the managements, workforces and trade union representatives of the shipyards of lower and upper Clyde who, over and beyond the superb ships they build, work so hard and in a spirit of co-operation to ensure that their maritime industry continues as a viable and important element of the local economies; believes that it is essential that the fine skills, employed in the yards, should be maintained and enhanced by sound apprenticeship schemes, and considers that the Scottish Executive should do everything in its power, on its own account and in co-operation with the appropriate UK ministers, to assist our Clydeside yards to secure vessel orders.
