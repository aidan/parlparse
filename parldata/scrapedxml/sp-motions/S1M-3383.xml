*S1M-3383# Ms Sandra White: Government Campaign to Run Down Glasgow—That the Parliament congratulates the Glasgow Evening Times for its excellent exposé of Her Majesty’s Government’s 25-year campaign to run down Glasgow; notes with concern that official documents provide evidence of official efforts to keep new industry and jobs out of Glasgow, move existing firms and jobs from Glasgow and drive Glasgow citizens into new towns; further notes with concern that the Evening Times’ report suggests that Glasgow is still the victim of institutionalised bias, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should consider urgently measures to halt any continuing anti-Glasgow bias and adopt policies and provide investment which will end Glasgow’s decline and aid its regeneration.
