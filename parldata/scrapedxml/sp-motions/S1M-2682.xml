*S1M-2682 Trish Godman: The Co-op and Labelling in Braille-That the Parliament commends the Co-operative Society (Co-op) on the introduction of labelling in braille for products sold in its retail stores and shops; believes that this initiative will be welcomed by blind and partially-sighted customers of the Co-op, and urges other large retailers to follow the example set by the Co-op in providing this kind of assistance to such members of the community, whose needs are too often ignored.
