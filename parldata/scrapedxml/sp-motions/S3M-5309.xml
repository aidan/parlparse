*S3M-5309 Hugh Henry: Usdaw Freedom from Fear Campaignâ€”That the Parliament is shocked and horrified that there has been a 78% increase in violence and abuse against Scottish shopworkers over the last three years, according to Retailers Against Crime; believes that further measures need to be taken to deter violence against shopworkers and other workers delivering a service to the public; welcomes the Freedom From Fear campaign organised by the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw), which seeks to make shops and shopping areas safer for staff and customers; recognises that the sale of age-restricted products, especially alcohol, is a frequent flashpoint for verbal abuse, threats and violence against shopworkers; further recognises the difficulties that shopworkers have policing age-restricted sales and how that can leave them vulnerable, isolated and under threat of prosecution when mistakes are made; calls on the Scottish Government to run high-profile campaigns that support the Think 25 policy and highlight to youngsters that it is an offence to attempt to buy alcohol under age, and further calls on the Scottish Government to work with retailers, police and local authorities on strategies to prevent under-age sales and not simply to rely on sting operations, which seek to prosecute shopworkers.
