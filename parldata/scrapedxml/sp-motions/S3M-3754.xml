*S3M-3754 Bill Kidd: Scotland’s Winning Ticket—That the Parliament welcomes calls by the Scottish Government for the UK Government to endorse a National Lottery scratchcard to help establish a £150 million fund for the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow; considers that such a move would provide much-needed funds after £150 million was diverted from the community and voluntary sector in Scotland to pay for the Olympic Games in London, and believes that a significant sum of money has been raised for the Olympic Games through dedicated National Lottery scratchcards and that the same level of support should be afforded by the UK Government to the 2014 Commonwealth Games in Glasgow to encourage and inspire people in Glasgow and across Scotland to live healthier and more active lives.
