 *S3M-4769 Stewart Maxwell: Addition of Folic Acid to Wheat and Grain Products—That the Parliament notes with sadness the sudden rise in babies born in Scotland with neural tube defects; recognises that folic acid supplements reduce the incidence of babies born with neural tube defects; further recognises that the neural tube forms in the first 28 days of pregnancy and in the case of unplanned pregnancies the neural tube has formed before a woman is aware that she is pregnant; notes that an estimated 50% of pregnancies are unplanned; further notes that the incidence of neural tube defects in Canada dropped by at least 54% after grain products were fortified with folic acid, and therefore supports the addition of folic acid to flour and other grain products sold in Scotland in order to reduce dramatically the number of children born in Scotland who suffer from neural tube defects. Supported by: Mike Pringle*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Hugh Henry*, Ian McKee*, Rob Gibson*, Brian Adam*
