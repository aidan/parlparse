*S1M-3147 John Scott: Suez Medal—That the Parliament acknowledges the contribution made by British Servicemen during the Suez emergency from 1951 to 1954, notes with concern that, despite many representations over the years, no award has been made of a "Suez Medal" for those who served at that time, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty’s Government to invite the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals to ensure that due recognition is given to this group of servicemen, many of whom served in Scottish regiments.
