 *S1M-3255 Shona Robison: William Topaz McGonagall—That the Parliament pays tribute to the life and work of William Topaz McGonagall, known as the "world’s worst poet", on the anniversary of his death 100 years ago; recognises that despite his lack of poetic talent he had a great passion for poetry and for his adopted city of Dundee, and hopes that public interest in his life and work will increase in this important year and that, love or loathe his poetry, he is given due recognition as one of the great Scottish eccentrics of the last century.
