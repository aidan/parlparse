*S2M-1680 Robin Harper: "Beachwatch" Survey and Beach Clean Weekend on 18 and 19 September 2004—That the Parliament welcomes and supports the Marine Conservation Society’s annual "Beachwatch" survey and beach clean-up scheduled for 18 and 19 September 2004; notes that it contributes to the International Coastal Clean-up taking place in over 90 countries coinciding with the United Nations Environment Programme’s "Clean Up the World" Weekend and commends the fact that over 40 community groups have registered to participate; notes that this annual voluntary operation continues to constitute the single most comprehensive snapshot of the degree of littering on Scotland’s beaches; further notes with concern that the 2003 survey results showed a 29% increase in the number of litter items recorded per kilometre surveyed compared with 2002 or 99% since 1994 and, while commending the Marine Conservation Society’s proven example of working successfully in partnership with Firth Forums and other groups, notes that the Scottish Coastal Strategy recognises that there are important benefits to be gained by co-ordinated working through adoption of a marine litter strategy for Scotland, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to take a firm lead following its recognition of beaches as a national resource and its commitment to consult on the best strategy for protecting and enhancing all of Scotland’s coastline.
