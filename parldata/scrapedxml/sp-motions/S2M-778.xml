*S2M-778# Christine Grahame: Borders Tourist Board Hospitality Assured Award-That the Parliament notes that Borders Tourist Board was the first regional tourism organisation in the UK to achieve an award under the national Hospitality Assured Scheme promoted by the British Hospitality Organisation, benchmarking it against some of the top hospitality companies; further notes that its 2003 summer promotional campaign generated a 59% conversion from enquiry to booking; congratulates it on its successful "dog friendly" campaign; notes, however, that in the Scott Wilson feasibility study into the reinstatement of the Waverley Line scant analysis was undertaken of the impact of reinstatement on the tourism industry, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive, in its consideration of the business case for the Waverley Line, should give due regard to the real potential for tourism, building on the efforts of this award-winning board.
