*S3M-8178 Ian McKee: Nuclear Power—That the Parliament expresses deep concern at the radioactive leaks from Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant following the recent earthquakes and tsunami that have devastated the region; believes that Fukushima demonstrates that, even in the world’s most technologically and scientifically advanced nations, it is impossible to guarantee safety in the running of atomic plants; welcomes the news that, following the Fukushima incident, the Swiss Government has suspended plans to build and replace nuclear plants and that German Chancellor Angela Merkel has announced a three-month suspension of a law aimed at prolonging the activity of old nuclear plants; further welcomes the emergency meeting that has been called by the EU energy commissioner to discuss the possible application of EU-wide stress tests for the 143 nuclear reactors currently operating in EU territory and to debate the wider issue of nuclear security in Europe; endorses the SNP government’s position that Scotland, which it considers to be a world leader in green, clean, reliable renewable energy, does not require nuclear power, and challenges the other political parties in Scotland and across the United Kingdom to unite on the issue by adopting a similar stance.
