*S3M-258 Malcolm Chisholm: Industrial Action, NCP Edinburgh—That the Parliament notes that parking attendants in City of Edinburgh Council, contracted by NCP and members of the T&amp;G section of Unite, have democratically voted to take industrial action to highlight their fight for a living wage; acknowledges that these workers currently earn below £12,000 per annum and have rejected a paltry increase of roughly 30 pence per hour; supports the workers’ demand for £14,000 per annum rising to £18,000 over five years, reflecting a living wage for many members and their families struggling to manage the cost of living in Scotland’s most expensive city; recognises that parking attendants in Glasgow City Council earn £18,000 per annum; deplores the actions of NCP which is drafting in non-union labour from England to break the strike, and calls on NCP to renegotiate with the T&amp;G section of Unite and grant the workers’ modest pay demands.
