 *S3M-3837 Joe FitzPatrick: SNP Dundee City Council—That the Parliament congratulates Dundee City Council’s new SNP administration; notes that, with 14 councillors, the SNP is the largest elected group on the council and, with the SNP administration, Dundee City Council will finally reflect the will of the electorate; also congratulates SNP Councillor Craig Melville whose recent victory in the Maryfield by-election, where the SNP increased its share of the vote to 48%, was instrumental in the transition of power; looks forward to a new era for Dundee, and welcomes the fact that, with an SNP administration, Dundee is now in a great state.
