*S2M-4340 Frances Curran: James Watt College, Greenock—That the Parliament is both shocked and appalled that the Principal and the Board of James Watt College in Greenock have breached the terms of collective agreements with the teaching trade union, the Educational Institute of Scotland (EIS), have issued 90-day redundancy notices to the entire academic staff and have announced the intention to make one-in-five of all academic staff redundant, whereby only those who sign new contracts with much worse terms and conditions will be re-employed; congratulates EIS members at the college who have voted by 94% in favour of industrial action; calls for solidarity in support of their strike action; believes that the college board has taken this unilateral action not to deal with a financial deficit but to make a profit of £2 million next year; further believes that this is irresponsible management of public money, and calls for the immediate withdrawal of the redundancy notices and the resumption of negotiations with the EIS representatives.
