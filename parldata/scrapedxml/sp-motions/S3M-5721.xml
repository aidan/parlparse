 *S3M-5721 Jamie Hepburn: UK Government Continues to Privatise the Skies—That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement by the UK Government that the Soteria Consortium is the preferred bidder for the £6 billion privatisation of the UK search and rescue helicopter operations; further notes that, in addition to private companies Thales UK and CHC, another member of the consortium is the Royal Bank of Scotland, a company that is 84% owned by the taxpayer, which can be considered to represent further recycling of funds from the public purse to the private sector; believes there to be a certain irony in the announcement of the privatisation being made by Labour MP and Minister for Defence Equipment and Support, Quentin Davies, a former Conservative MP, as the decision represents the continuation of privatisation programmes begun under the Conservatives, as well as New Labour’s privatisation of the skies having previously sold off air traffic control services, and calls on the UK Government not to sign any deal for this privatisation before the UK general election and for full transparency about the decision-making process so far in order to ensure that commercial interests and the need to deliver profits for shareholders does not outweigh public safety and the reliability of the search and rescue helicopter service.
