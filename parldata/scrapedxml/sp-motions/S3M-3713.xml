 S3M-3713 Robin Harper: Designing Living Streets for All—That the Parliament notes the Scottish Government Designing Streets consultation; considers that the proposed new policy should revolutionise the design of new residential streets and high streets; particularly welcomes the commitment in the document to the prioritisation of pedestrians and cyclists and the presumption that new residential streets should be designed to keep vehicles to a maximum speed of 20 mph; welcomes the aim for this to become statutory guidance; believes that it is particularly appropriate for this guidance to be launched in 2009, the 80th anniversary of the launch of the Pedestrians Association, now Living Streets, which successfully lobbied for key historic developments such as driving tests, pedestrian crossings and 30 mph speed limits; encourages all those individuals and organisations with an interest in creating better streets for all to respond by the consultation deadline of 23 March 2009, and calls on the Scottish Government and local authorities to encourage active travel in local streets and neighbourhoods to help tackle health problems related to inactivity, cut climate change emissions, stimulate local economic activity and improve quality of life.
