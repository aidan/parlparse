*S3M-7844 Hugh O’Donnell: Murder on the West Bank?—That the Parliament condemns the recent attack by Israeli colonists on the villages of Saffa and Beit Ommar in the West Bank; is deeply concerned by the shooting of Yousef Fakhri Ikhlayl, a 17-year-old youth from Beit Ommar, nearby in the southern West Bank, leaving him critically injured; notes that doctors have announced that Yousef is currently brain-dead in a Hebron hospital; believes that there must be a full independent investigation into this shooting, and calls on the government of the occupying force to ensure that the perpetrator is brought to justice.
