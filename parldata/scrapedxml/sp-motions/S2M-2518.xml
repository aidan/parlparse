*S2M-2518 Mark Ballard: Publication of Scotland 2020—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of Scotland 2020 by Demos and the Scottish Book Trust; notes that the authors conclude that national pessimism and negativity is stifling Scotland; notes chapter 21 that highlights the inadequacy of GDP as a measure of a nation’s progress and outlines the damage caused by the "obsession" with GDP and "growth fetishism"; acknowledges that economic growth alone cannot create the optimum conditions for a thriving and sustainable Scotland, and urges the Scottish Executive to adopt alternatives to GDP that will strengthen civil society, social well-being and active citizenship.
