*S2M-3713 Pauline McNeill: Job Losses in Scottish Newspapersâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the plans for cuts across their range of newspapers by Trinity Mirror plc; notes that whilst their advertising levels have dropped they recently announced a 20% rise in profits; wishes to show support for the position of the National Union of Journalists, who oppose further cuts in editorial budgets, and recognises that daily and weekly newspapers are the lifeblood of the community and that it wishes to remind Trinity Mirror plc that there are responsibilities attached to owning newspapers.
