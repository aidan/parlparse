*S3M-3896 Aileen Campbell: Historic Discovery by Biggar Archaeology Groupâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Biggar Archaeology Group on its discovery of the oldest human settlement found in Scotland, at Howburn Farm near Elsrickle; notes that the flint tools discovered date to around 12,000 BC or 14,000 years ago and provide evidence of human settlement in Scotland at a time when the North Sea was dry land and humans were travelling from what is now northern Europe; further notes that the general public is being invited to participate in the Big Biggar Dig, starting on 2 May 2009, to carry out further excavations on the site, and wishes the Biggar Archaeology Group every success for the future following this historic development.
