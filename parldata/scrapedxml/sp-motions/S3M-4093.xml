 *S3M-4093 Ian McKee: Scottish Pupils Studying Modern Languages—That the Parliament welcomes the rising number of pupils studying modern languages at both higher and advanced higher levels in Scotland with advanced higher pupils increasing by 20% from 655 in 2007 to 820 in 2008; observes that, while numbers of pupils studying German have fallen, those studying higher Spanish have increased to 1,327 in 2008, compared to only 874 10 years ago, and that, although Latin has dropped in popularity, Gaelic has increased by over one third over the last 10 years; believes that these trends of popularity not only demonstrate more choice available to students but also that pupils have the capacity to learn a language that they believe suits them best; further notes that local authorities are using different ways to increase access to higher and advanced higher courses, including promoting collaborative arrangements between schools and the use of new technology that provides access to a range of higher and advanced higher courses, and that these approaches are enabling more pupils to study a wider range of subjects than ever before; firmly believes that modern languages are key to creating a more successful Scotland with opportunities for all to flourish through increasing sustainable growth and giving young people the opportunity to study and work in any EU Member State, and welcomes the Scottish Government’s proposals through the Curriculum for Excellence to reinforce the expectation that schools will offer a modern language by no later than primary six and deliver exciting, engaging and relevant language learning.
