*S1M-2016 Dr Richard Simpson: National Transplant Week—That the Parliament pledges its support for National Transplant Week from 15 to 22 July 2001; acknowledges the collaboration between the Scottish Transplant Co-ordinators Network, the National Kidney Research Fund in Scotland and the Scottish Executive Health Department to publicise National Transplant Week; recognises that there are over 450 people in Scotland on the active transplant waiting list and that last year over 160 Scottish lives were saved or markedly improved by a transplant; notes that over the next decade the number of people developing kidney failure in Scotland is expected to rise steeply and that the shortfall between people awaiting a kidney and the supply of kidneys available for transplantation will increase each year; accepts that, where feasible, transplantation is the most cost-effective solution for suitable patients with end-stage renal failure, and calls upon MSPs to assist this collaboration by promoting positive messages about organ donation and National Transplant Week and encouraging more people to carry a donor card and to join the NHS Organ Donor Register.
