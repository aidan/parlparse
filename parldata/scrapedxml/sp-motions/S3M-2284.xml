 *S3M-2284 Bill Kidd: Nuclear "Popcorning"â€”That the Parliament notes with concern the risk of nuclear weapon "popcorning" whereby there can be a significant nuclear yield if a series of nuclear warheads exploded by accident; further notes the potential of this risk with respect to Trident submarines, each of which carries around 14 missiles containing high explosive as well as 48 nuclear warheads, and calls on the UK Government to eliminate this risk by the removal and decommissioning of all Trident submarines and its weapons of mass destruction.
