*S3M-2565# Joe FitzPatrick: Friendly Football—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision of the Scottish Football Association (SFA) to withdraw its referees from the Dundee Saturday Morning Friendly League due to its lack of affiliation; recognises that this decision has ramifications for friendly leagues across Scotland, which now face an uncertain future; notes with further concern that this decision has threatened the viability of a league which has for 15 years proved to be a resounding success based on the principles of fair and friendly play; recognises the value of this league not only in raising money for local charities but also as income for Dundee City Council in pitch and facilities fees; believes that the approach taken by the SFA whereby registered referees can participate in any other non-affiliated league except this one is inconsistent and simply unfair, and applauds the organisers of the Dundee Saturday Morning Friendly League for their drive and determination to make sure the league continues in spite of the SFA’s position.
