 *S2M-5532 Donald Gorrie: Shadow Round for European Funding—That the Parliament expresses concern that over 50 small voluntary sector organisations are being excluded from applying to the recently announced shadow round for European funding in the current year because an arbitrary £200,000 minimum project size has been introduced by ministers; believes that this decision is contrary to the stated policies of the Scottish Executive to encourage and develop the voluntary sector, and asks the Executive to reconsider the decision.
