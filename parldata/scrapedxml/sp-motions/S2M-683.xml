*S2M-683# Robin Harper: Outdoor Education-That the Parliament regrets that there is no national programme for outdoor education in Scotland; notes that programmes for outdoor education vary greatly from council to council; further notes that schools within the separate councils lack uniformity in implementing outdoor education programmes and regrets that children are not receiving equal access to the opportunities and advantages provided by outdoor education; regrets that financial factors, socio-economic factors and lack of access to facilities all serve as barriers to outdoor education; regrets that the lack of a requirement for outdoor education to be taught in schools has led to a serious decline in the number of outdoor education teachers employed in Scotland; regrets that, despite the General Teaching Council's recommendation in 2000, there is still no national teaching qualification in outdoor education; regrets that there is no Her Majesty's Inspector of Schools with specific expertise in, or responsibility for, outdoor education; regrets that primary teachers and geography teachers receive minimal training in outdoor education; further regrets that there is a decline in the number of biology students on outdoor environmental studies courses, and considers that the Scottish Executive should set up a short life working group to report before June 2004 on all these issues.
