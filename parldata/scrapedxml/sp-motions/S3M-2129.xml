 *S3M-2129 Christine Grahame: Lancastria Remembered—That the Parliament acknowledges the endurance of survivors and the ultimate loss of the 4,000 victims of Britain’s worst ever maritime disaster when the Clyde-built troopship, Lancastria, was attacked and sunk off the French coast on 17 June 1940; recognises that the presentation of commemorative medals to survivors and to relatives of victims and survivors of this incident in the Parliament on Thursday 12 June 2008 is official Scottish Government recognition of both those who died and those who survived sustained attack in the sea from enemy fire, and welcomes the fact that, finally, this tragedy is being properly commemorated and honoured after decades of official censorship and silence. Supported by: Joe FitzPatrick*, Bill Kidd*, Ian McKee*, Christina McKelvie*, Bashir Ahmad*, Alex Neil*, Aileen Campbell*, Willie Coffey*, Jamie Hepburn*, Jim Hume*, Gil Paterson*, Christopher Harvie*, Brian Adam*, Elizabeth Smith*, Bill Wilson*, Elaine Murray*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Alasdair Allan*, Stuart McMillan*, Andrew Welsh*, John Lamont*, John Park*, Nanette Milne*, Angela Constance*, Nigel Don*, Kenneth Gibson*
