 *S3M-5885.1 Johann Lamont: Kinship Care Allowance Cuts—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5885) in the name of Christopher Harvie, leave out from "notes" to end and insert "further considers, however, that the concordat commitment to ensure that all kinship carers of looked-after children in Scotland are paid the recommended allowance for foster carers within the lifetime of the Parliament has been dropped by the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning, despite the commitments given in the chamber by the First Minister on 27 September 2007 and the Minister for Children and Early Years on 11 December 2008; believes that, while broken promises have become the hallmark of the current SNP administration, this is particularly regrettable given that it concerns some of Scotland’s most vulnerable children and their carers, many of whom are older people, and calls on government at every level to work together to secure the best outcome for children being looked after by kinship carers."
