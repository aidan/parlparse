*S3M-855 Helen Eadie: Fife Council Social Work Cuts—That the Parliament welcomes the Minister for Public Health’s statement that the delays to discharges from hospital beds in Fife are at an unacceptably high level; notes that these delays follow the policy decision of the SNP/Liberal Democrat-controlled Fife Council to make cuts amounting to £600,000 to its social services budget; further welcomes the fact that the minister has arranged for additional non-recurring funding for the remainder of the financial year to address the situation confronting Fife Council’s social work services; deplores the fact that the new policy cuts introduced in June 2007 by council leaders did not properly evaluate the impact that their policy would have on the oldest, frailest and most vulnerable people in Fife; calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that a policy-proofing process is put in place to protect against the recurrence ever again of the appalling situation that resulted in one Fife individual being denied a care package that would have enabled him to die at home in dignity surrounded by those who cared for him most; finally applauds the initiative of the former Labour-controlled Fife Council which first piloted work on benefits checks in November 2005, following which a report to committee highlighted that an additional £1,018,628 benefit income was generated on behalf of those most vulnerable in our community through the stalwart work of Labour councillors and officials in Fife prior to the elections in May 2007, and regrets that Jim Tolson MSP and other Liberal Democrat parliamentarians are trying to rewrite history.
