*S2M-4972 Tommy Sheridan: Glasgow - Health Deprived City—That the Parliament expresses grave concern over the recent publication of Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation 2006: General Report which states that Glasgow City contains over one third, 35%, of the 15% most health-deprived data zones in Scotland; notes also that, within local authority areas, almost half of Glasgow’s data zones are in the 15% most health-deprived data zones; further notes with great concern that the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area, which is the largest NHS board area, contains almost 50% of the 15% most health-deprived data zones, and urges the Scottish Executive to address the situation as a matter of urgency and acknowledge that these figures are an indicator that Glasgow citizens are still suffering from multiple deprivation.
