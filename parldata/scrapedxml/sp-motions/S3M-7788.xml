*S3M-7788 Bill Wilson: Decriminalise the Chewing of Coca Leaves—That the Parliament urges the UK Government to support the Bolivian Government’s proposed amendment to the 1961 UN Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs that would decriminalise the practice of chewing coca leaves; notes that this practice has been a fundamental part of Bolivian culture for thousands of years and has deep religious significance among indigenous peoples; further notes that the ban on the chewing of coca leaves was based on a 1950 report based on evidence described by the Washington Office on Latin America and the Transnational Institute as unscientific and blatantly racist, and believes that this ban has had no effect on the processing of coca leaves to produce cocaine.
