 *S3M-4977 Sandra White: UN Human Development Report—That the Parliament notes the publication of the United Nations Human Development Report 2009, which aims to measure a country’s success in terms of creating an environment in which people can develop their full potential and lead productive, creative lives in accordance with their needs and interests rather than simply a narrower measurement of its wealth; further notes that Norway was ranked as the best place in the world to live; considers that this was due greatly to the discovery of offshore gas and oil in the late 1960s and the subsequent establishment of the Norwegian oil fund, and believes that these results add further weight to the argument for the establishment of a Scottish oil fund.
