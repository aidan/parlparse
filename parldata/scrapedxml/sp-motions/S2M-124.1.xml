 *S2M-124.1 Mark Ballard: Europe—As an amendment to motion (S2M-124) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from "; considers" to end and insert "which has led to serious decline in fish stocks and risks permanent damage to marine biodiversity; considers that the terms of the final draft constitution should be subject to the approval of the Scottish people in a referendum prior to ratification; regrets that the Chancellor of the Exchequer's tests in relation to the euro did not address either social impact or the risks to policies promoting sustainability, if public spending is subjected to the Growth and Stability Pact of the European Central Bank; believes that the decision by Her Majesty’s Government to delay entry to the single currency was in Scotland’s best economic, social and environmental interests, but further believes that Scotland’s interests would best be represented in the European Union as an independent member state."
