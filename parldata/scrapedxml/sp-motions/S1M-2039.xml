*S1M-2039# Alex Neil: Bank Arrestments—That the Parliament notes the content of Citizens Advice Scotland’s recent report Frozen Money – Bank Arrestments; further notes that bank arrestments are the most common form of diligence in Scotland and that bank arrestments can be as harsh and in some cases harsher than poindings and warrant sales; is concerned that, unlike earnings arrestments, a minimum sum of money for the debtor to live on is not protected from a bank arrestment; is further concerned that protected payments such as benefits, redundancy payments and pensions are not exempt from the application of bank arrestments and that many arrestments are enacted without warning; notes with alarm that the overall impact of such bank arrestments is financial hardship, particularly for families with children; fears that the abolition of poindings and warrant sales in December 2002 will increase the use of bank arrestments as a diligence, and believes that the Scottish Executive should address the problems in the law relating to bank arrestment before this date.
