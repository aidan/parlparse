*S2M-3043 Christine Grahame: Hot Air at Holyrood—That the Parliament urges the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to address the temperature in the Parliament building, in particular, within the MSP rooms and the Chamber, without further delay, as staff both of the Parliament and MSPs, are being required to work in conditions that are outwith the recommendations of the Chartered Institute of Building Services Engineers, namely 21º to 23ºC in winter and 22º to 24ºC in summer, while the prevailing internal temperature is on a par with Rio de Janeiro or Tenerife and regards the guidance from Facilities Management that windows should be opened, which they are so far as mechanically possible, as a wholly inadequate and unacceptable response. Supported by: Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Bill Aitken*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Dennis Canavan*
