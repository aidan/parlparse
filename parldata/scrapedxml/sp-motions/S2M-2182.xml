*S2M-2182# George Lyon: Campbeltown Hospital—That the Parliament notes with concern that NHS Argyll &amp; Clyde has shut the assessment ward at Campbeltown Hospital with no public consultation and no alternative provision in place; further notes that the board is cutting primary care budgets in Argyll and Bute, despite the fact that the primary care sector in Argyll and Bute has not overspent, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should intervene and press the board to suspend the closure until proper public consultation is carried out and alternative provision supported by the community is put in place and that the board should refocus its cost recovery plan on the areas that have been consistently overspending in the past.
