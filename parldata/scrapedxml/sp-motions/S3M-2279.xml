*S3M-2279 Sarah Boyack: Friends of the Earth Scotland Launches Big Ask Scotland Campaign with Radiohead—That the Parliament welcomes the launch at Radiohead’s Glasgow Green gig on 27 June 2008 of Friends of the Earth Scotland’s Big Ask Scotland campaign for a strong Scottish Climate Change Bill; notes that the gig is part of Radiohead’s carbon-conscious European tour which has aimed to reduce its environmental impact as much as possible; notes that Radiohead is also supporting the Big Ask Europe which aims for continent-wide action on climate change; further notes that the Big Ask Scotland demands that (a) the Scottish Bill must cover all greenhouse gas emissions, including those from international aviation and shipping, and include the basket of greenhouse gases, not merely carbon dioxide, (b) there must be a scientifically-based limit placed on total emissions every year between now and 2050, not merely an end-point 80% reduction target, and (c) the Scottish Government should establish a Climate Super Fund, which will reward public bodies that reduce their emissions in line with targets and fine bodies that fail to do so, and wishes Friends of the Earth Scotland every success in its campaign.
