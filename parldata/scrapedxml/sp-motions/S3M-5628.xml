*S3M-5628 Aileen Campbell: Lanarkshire Farmers’ Market Comes to Biggar—That the Parliament welcomes the news that the Lanarkshire Farmers’ Market, which visits various towns across South Lanarkshire on a rotating basis, will come to Biggar on four occasions in 2010 following the successful application of Lanarkshire Farmers’ Markets Limited for a licence that will allow an indoor market in Biggar Municipal Hall; believes that this will complement the wide range of fresh local produce already available in shops on Biggar’s High Street and help to attract additional business and visitors to the town as well as promoting healthy eating and reducing the carbon footprint of the area’s diet, and wishes everyone involved in the farmers’ market continued success both in Biggar and across South Lanarkshire. Supported by: Bob Doris*, Stuart McMillan*
