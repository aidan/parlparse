 *S3M-4372 Ian McKee: Currie High School win Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy 2009—That the Parliament congratulates Currie Community High School for coming joint first at the UK Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy 2009 and for being the only Scottish school to be shortlisted for the final stage of the competition in the schools award category; notes that the school has taken strides in reducing energy use over the past 10 years and that it was the first school in Edinburgh to install a wind turbine and a solar thermal system with financial support from the City of Edinburgh Council; further notes that the school’s commitment to sustainable energy is shown by the school building having low-energy lighting, sealed windows and replacement doors to reduce heat loss, solar thermal panels to heat the school swimming pool and by the school switching off the boiler for several months of the year; further congratulates the school for making green issues a priority in the curriculum through the Education for Sustainable Development course and by teaching the advantages and disadvantages of various sources of energy, and believes that the school’s achievements are an inspiration to schools throughout Scotland.
