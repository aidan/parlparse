*S1M-3302 Robin Harper: Scottish Law Commission Report on Title to Sue for Non-Patrimonial Loss—That the Parliament notes the publication of the Scottish Law Commission report, Title to Sue for Non-Patrimonial Loss; further notes that the reprt identifies that family structures found in contemporary Scotland differ greatly from those found in 1976 when current legislation covering non-patrimonial loss came into force and that the exclusion of same-sex couples and siblings from those entitled to claim damages for non-patrimonial loss under the Damages (Scotland) Act 1976 highlights this difference, and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward legislation as a matter of urgency in order to fully adopt the report’s recommendations.
