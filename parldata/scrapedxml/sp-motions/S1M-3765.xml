*S1M-3765# Nicola Sturgeon: Removal of Thimerosal in Vaccines-That the Parliament notes with concern that thirteen vaccines currently available in the United Kingdom, including four that are administered to children, contain thimerosal, a compound 50% comprised of ethyl mercury and already banned in the United States of America; further notes the fears of a link between thimerosal and conditions such as autism and Alzheimer's disease, and considers that the Scottish Executive should take steps to eradicate thimerosal from vaccines available in Scotland and, in the meantime, inform the public about the availability of vaccines that do not contain thimerosal.
