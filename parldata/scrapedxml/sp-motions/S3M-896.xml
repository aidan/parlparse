 *S3M-896 Bill Wilson: The Folly of a Database State—That the Parliament notes the loss by HM Revenue and Customs of the personal details of approximately 25 million UK citizens, more than 40% of the population; notes that the UK Cabinet wishes to further expand the database state by establishing a national identity register, and is of the opinion that not only would such a development infringe civil liberties and have little or no beneficial effect with respect to crime or terrorism but would, as the loss of 25 million personal details demonstrates, amount to an act of arrant folly and possibly increase the risks to which UK citizens are exposed.
