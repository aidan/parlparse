*S3M-1868 Dr Richard Simpson: International Nurses Day 2008—That the Parliament celebrates International Nurses Day on 12 May, which marks Florence Nightingale’s birthday; recognises the invaluable role that nurses have played throughout the 60-year history of the NHS in Scotland, one that has changed beyond recognition since the days of Florence Nightingale and is now even more important, and believes that it is more important than ever that the Scottish Government undertakes effective workforce planning to meet probable future shortages, especially in mental health nursing.
