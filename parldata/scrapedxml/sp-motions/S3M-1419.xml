*S3M-1419 Cathie Craigie: Fair Trade is the Answer—That the Parliament congratulates Whitelees Primary School, in Abronhill, Cumbernauld, for its commitment and enthusiasm in promoting fair trade in its community and bringing Cumbernauld closer to being established as a Fairtrade Town; applauds the work of Whitelees Enterprise Team in identifying the need to widen awareness of fair trade products with the objective of "promoting and supporting the work of the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund and Fair Trade by raising awareness of the exploitation of poor people globally, promoting and embracing global citizenship, valuing diversity and engendering a real sense of community which stretches across the world"; recognises the importance and opportunity from the release of "Fair Trade is the Answer", a CD with music and lyrics written and performed by the pupils of Whitelees School of Rock and Primary 7; shows appreciation to the staff and students at Cumbernauld College for their support and technical expertise in producing the CD; welcomes the partnership approach adopted by the school and its ability to engage with outside organisations to benefit and enhance pupils’ educational experience; welcomes the team’s commitment to spreading its message across the United Kingdom and, through links with Cumbernauld’s twin town, Bron in France, taking the message beyond our shores; acknowledges that all money raised from the sale of the CD will go to support fair trade and encourages every school in Scotland to purchase a CD in support of fair trade and the message of global citizenship that it contains, and looks forward to Scotland earning fairtrade status.
