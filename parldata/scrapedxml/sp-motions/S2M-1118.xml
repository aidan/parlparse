 *S2M-1118# Fergus Ewing: Massacre of Glenfeshie-That the Parliament notes with concern the mass slaughter of deer at Glenfeshie, instigated by the Deer Commission for Scotland; believes that, whilst culling deer is necessary to control numbers, deer fencing is necessary in order to protect forestry and the removal, or non-provision of, deer fencing has contributed substantially to the present situation; further believes that the Deer Commission may intend to carry out further mass slaughter of deer out of season and at various locations in Scotland; considers that the Scottish Executive should meet representatives of the Scottish Gamekeepers Association to hear its concerns regarding the massacre of Glenfeshie and regarding the measures that should be taken in order to secure proper management of both deer and forestry, and, in the meantime, considers that there should be a moratorium on any further mass slaughter of deer in Scotland.
