*S3M-8131 Sandra White: Welcome Modernisation of Glasgow Subway System—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the Scottish Government that it is to make a substantial capital contribution to support Strathclyde Partnership for Transport’s (SPT) modernisation proposals for Glasgow’s subway; believes that, while the proposed modernisation will bring about material benefits in the form of new trains, new automated signals, refurbished stations with improved accessibility and smartcard ticketing, any funding must be made on the condition of improved opening hours to reflect the needs of passengers, and calls on SPT to set out in detail how this will be achieved.
