 *S2M-553# Nicola Sturgeon: European Parliament Seat Numbers-That the Parliament notes the reduction of UK seats in the European Parliament from 87 to 78 to accommodate enlargement of the EU; welcomes the accession of 10 new countries in 2004; believes, however, that Scotland, with no seat on the Council of Europe, no Commissioners and fewer MEPs than comparably-sized independent member states, has little enough influence in the EU, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should resist the reduction in Scotland's MEPs from eight to seven. Supported by: Bruce Crawford*, Linda Fabiani*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*
