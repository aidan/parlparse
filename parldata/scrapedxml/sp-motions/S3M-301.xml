*S3M-301 Bill Kidd: Human Rights Situation in Romanian State Institutionsâ€”That the Parliament notes recent reports by UNICEF, the European Commission, the Romanian Centre for Legal Resources and Inclusion Romania on the ongoing mistreatment of people with intellectual disabilities held in Romanian state institutions, including the lack of adequate care and treatment, abusive physical restraint, unsanitary bedding and the lack of adequate food and clothing; believes that this amounts to a fundamental abuse of the human rights of those who are institutionalised, and calls on the Romanian Government to stop immediately the human rights abuses of people with intellectual disabilities, for the creation of an independent body to continuously monitor the human rights situation in Romanian state institutions and for the acceleration of the de-institutionalisation process and development of community-based services.
