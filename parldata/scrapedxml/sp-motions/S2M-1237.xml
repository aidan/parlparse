*S2M-1237# Mark Ballard: Thrive Scotland Exhibition-That the Parliament welcomes the exhibition being held by the national horticultural charity, Thrive Scotland, in the Parliament foyer from 14 June 2004; recognises that Thrive exists to enable disadvantaged, disabled and older people to participate fully in the social and economic life of the community and that it supports a network of specialist projects that run programmes of horticultural activity for training and employment, therapy and health, and commends Thrive Scotland for its commitment to the needs of some of those who are most disadvantaged in the community, particularly people with mental health problems, learning difficulties, ex-offenders, substance abusers, people with physical health difficulties and the very old.
