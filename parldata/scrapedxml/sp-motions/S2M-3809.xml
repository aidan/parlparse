*S2M-3809 Sarah Boyack: Scotland’s Ecological Footprint—That the Parliament acknowledges the value of the ecological footprint as a resource management tool that is easily understood and can help guide us to reduce our impact on the planet; notes that the size of Scotland’s ecological footprint currently represents Scotland as using and polluting much more than our fair share of the global environment and that, if everyone on the planet consumed and polluted at this rate, we would need three planets to sustain us; therefore welcomes the Scottish Executive’s commitment to reduce Scotland’s ecological footprint and to use the footprint as a key tool for communicating and delivering sustainable development; further welcomes the first ecological footprint exercise by the Parliament and commends Scotland’s Global Footprint Project, involving the local authorities in North Lanarkshire, Aberdeen City and Aberdeenshire, for leading the way in the United Kingdom by using the footprint to reduce their global environmental impacts; looks forward to all local authority area results being published in spring 2006, and encourages everyone to calculate their own footprint at www.scotlandsfootprint.org and set out to reduce it.
