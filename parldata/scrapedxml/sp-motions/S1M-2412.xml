 *S1M-2412 David McLetchie: Conduct of the First Minister—That the Parliament notes the principles set out in the Report of the Consultative Steering Group and the Scottish Ministerial Code which require Ministers to be as open as possible with the Parliament and the public about their decisions and actions and to be accountable for them to the Scottish people; regrets that the First Minister has failed to observe the spirit of these principles in respect of the misuse of public funds in relation to the use of his Parliamentary constituency office in Glenrothes; views with profound concern the belated disclosure of the financial transactions related to said office involving receipt of rentals by Henry McLeish of £36,122 which sums were retained by him and not accounted for by him to the Fees Office of the House of Commons; believes that said sum should be paid back in full by the First Minister; deplores the lack of candour and transparency exhibited by the First Minister in relation to this matter, which has lost him the confidence of the people of Scotland, and calls upon him to resign.
