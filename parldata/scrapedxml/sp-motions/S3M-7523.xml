*S3M-7523 Ken Macintosh: Action for Sick Children in Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the work of Action for Sick Children (Scotland) in raising awareness of the needs and rights of ill children and young people; calls on all children and young people’s healthcare rights to be upheld in line with the European Association for Children in Hospital Charter; recognises the need to empower and support young people to take responsibility for their own health and management of their chronic condition; shares the belief that every sick child or young person has the right of equal access to education whenever they are well enough to learn, regardless of where they live; expresses concern at the reported wide variation in educational support that is available to children in hospitals and asks ministers to collect and collate information nationally on where and when hospital teaching is provided and on how many days a child has to be off sick before a teacher starts helping them at home, and, in light of this, calls on the Scottish Government to review the national guidance on absence due to ill health.
