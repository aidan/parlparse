*S1M-2723 Mr Brian Monteith: Burdens on the Scotch Whisky Industry—That the Parliament notes with concern Her Majesty’s Government’s decision to apply strip stamps to Scotch Whisky products, but not to wine or beer, in an attempt to curb fraud; believes that the case for such strip stamps is not yet proven as they are costly and relatively easy to forge, as found in the USA and Greece where they have been abolished, and believes that the Scottish Executive should work with the Scotch whisky industry to avoid such additional burdens being placed on our whisky industry, for example by taking advantage of the exemption from the EU’s Water Framework Directive. Supported by: Mr Jamie McGrigor*
