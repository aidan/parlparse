 *S2M-1283# Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Recognition of Skin Disease as a Chronic Condition-That the Parliament notes that skin diseases are disfiguring and highly distressing with one-in-four of the Scottish population affected by skin diseases that would benefit from medical treatment; further notes with concern that skin diseases are one of the main reasons for an individual being certified as unfit to work and impact directly on a child's ability to attend school, while accounting for 15% of primary care consultations and 7% of all referrals to hospital out-patient clinics; welcomes the Scottish Innovation and Redesign Collaborative for Dermatology under the auspices of the Centre for Change and Innovation as the first step in the process of giving dermatological services the priority they deserve, and considers that the Scottish Executive should, as the next step, recognise skin diseases as chronic conditions, thereby giving skin conditions and those individuals affected by them the priority and treatment they deserve by assisting them with prescription charges and making access to the most efficacious drugs easier.
