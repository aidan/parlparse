*S1M-3591 Ms Margo MacDonald: Comments by Holyrood Project Director on the Parliament Building-That the Parliament notes the opinion attributed in The Herald magazine on 16 November 2002 to the Holyrood Project Director that "negotiating" with the MSPs elected in May 1999 over a parliament building designed to meet their requirements would have been likely to result in the site for the new parliament still being undetermined in November 2002; records its confidence in its ability to reach democratic decisions on projects or policies which, constitutionally, are executed by officials of either the Scottish Executive or the Parliament and which, in the course of such a process, may be the subject of private, professional exchanges between elected ministers and MSPs but should never be the subject of public pronouncement on the part of officials whether in relation to the credibility or value of the project or policy or the abilities of those elected MSPs responsible for it, and questions whether the Holyrood Project Director is a fit person to execute Parliament's directives given her publicly expressed lack of trust in the collective judgement of MSPs.
