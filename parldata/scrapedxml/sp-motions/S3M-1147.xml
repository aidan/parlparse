*S3M-1147 Helen Eadie: Eastern European Slavic Centre—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Bulgarian Association on its work towards the establishment of a Slavic cultural centre in the east of Scotland; notes that the new centre will help to promote sharing of knowledge and understanding between the people of Scotland, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Moldova; recognises the challenges that eastern Europeans face when settling in Scotland either on a temporary or permanent basis and hopes that both local and central government and the appropriate agencies will do everything possible in support; further notes that 30,000 British people have now bought property in Bulgaria and that constituents across Scotland, like Betty and Bill Miller of Dalgety Bay, stay, like many other pensioners, from March to September where their pensions enable them to enjoy a lifestyle which they treasure in the summer sunshine in a country that has so many similarities to Scotland in its geography and friendliness and opportunities for celebrating our growth in knowledge of this country, that was for too long behind the Iron Curtain, and its people; and celebrates the fact that many of the people arriving from these countries bring key skills, talents and professionalism such as Nikolai Zhelev, the honorary consul for Bulgaria in Scotland and also professor of contemporary science and medicine, with his work incorporating new developments in cancer medicine at the University of Abertay, Dundee, who is one of the driving forces behind establishing the Slavic cultural centre in the east of Scotland.
