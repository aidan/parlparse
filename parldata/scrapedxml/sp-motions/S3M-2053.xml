*S3M-2053 John Farquhar Munro: Reporter Excludes Evidence at Substation Expansion Hearing—That the Parliament condemns the decision by the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters Unit to deny objectors to the expansion of the electricity substation at Wester Balblair the right to submit evidence about the damaging heath effects of electromagnetic radiation emitted from electricity substations; believes that this not only calls into question the validity of the inquiry but also undermines the Wester Balblair community which has a right to have its point of view heard; considers that dismissing the community’s view out of hand reinforces the public scepticism about the whole project, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review the decision of the Reporter with a view to giving the community a fair hearing.
