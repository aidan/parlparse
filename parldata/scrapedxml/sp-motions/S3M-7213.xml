*S3M-7213 Christina McKelvie: Rescue of Chilean Miners—That the Parliament shares the joy and relief of Chile and the world at the successful rescue of all 33 miners trapped underground for more than two months in the San José mine; has been humbled and inspired by what it sees as the extraordinary courage, stoicism and solidarity shown by "los 33" in the face of adversity; is moved by what it believes to be the patient vigil of their loved ones waiting in Camp Hope; pays tribute to everyone involved in mounting what it considers a highly complex and technically advanced rescue operation; recognises that their return to the surface is only the start of the miners’ recovery and readjustment, and, with the Scottish people, joins the nations of the world in sending good wishes to all the miners and their families.
