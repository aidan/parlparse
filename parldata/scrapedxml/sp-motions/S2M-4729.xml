 *S2M-4729 Mr Jim Wallace: Dennis Head Old Beacon, North Ronaldsay—That the Parliament welcomes the success of the Dennis Head Old Beacon, North Ronaldsay, in winning the Scottish leg of the competition to win the BBC Restoration Village 2006 prize fund; congratulates the North Ronaldsay Trust and the North Ronaldsay community on their success against worthy opposition; recognises the importance of the beacon as only the third lighthouse constructed by the Commissioners of Northern Lighthouses and that it was designed by Thomas Smith with the assistance of his stepson Robert Stevenson, the first of four generations of Stevensons who designed most of Scotland’s lighthouses and won international recognition for their engineering achievements, and calls for widespread support, from Scotland and beyond, for the North Ronaldsay community when the Dennis Head Old Beacon competes against opposition from across the United Kingdom in the BBC Restoration Village 2006 final. Supported by: John Swinburne*, Robin Harper*, Margaret Smith*, Mike Pringle*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Eleanor Scott*, Ms Maureen Watt*, Rob Gibson*, Nora Radcliffe*, Shiona Baird*, Pauline McNeill*, Dave Petrie*
