 *S3M-4730 Bill Kidd: Dumbarton Road Corridor Environment Trust Waste Collection Scheme—That the Parliament commends the work being carried out by the Dumbarton Road Corridor Environment Trust, a Scottish charity based in the Yoker, Scotstoun and Whiteinch areas of Glasgow, which in May 2009 launched a food waste collection scheme for the residents of the Kingsway high-rise flats in Scotstounhill; notes that this pioneering scheme sees the conversion of residents’ food waste to compost that can then be used for other purposes, and believes that this scheme provides an excellent example for other community groups across Scotland that seek to develop and implement initiatives that promote environmental sustainability in the local area.
