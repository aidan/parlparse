*S2M-13# Murdo Fraser: A9—That the Parliament recognises the dangers of the A9 trunk road between Perth and Inverness and, in particular, the confusion to motorists caused by switching between dual and single carriageway, which adds to the accident statistics; notes the support of Tayside Police for the dualling of the A9 in its entirety with improved junctions and adequate rest areas in the interests of road safety; further notes the increase in traffic year-on-year on the A9, which has been assisted by economic growth in the Inverness area, and therefore supports the calls from local campaigners for the Scottish Executive to make a commitment to a programme of dualling the A9 between Perth and Inverness.
