*S3M-2263 Pauline McNeill: 25 Years On and Glasgow’s Still Miles Better—That the Parliament commemorates the 25th anniversary of the launch in 1983 of the Glasgow’s Miles Better campaign which combined a Mr Men cartoon character and a piece of grammar known as a null comparative to transform the image of Scotland’s biggest and friendliest city and symbolised the beginning of Glasgow’s revival as a leading world city, and particularly notes the contributions of the late John Struthers, creator of the campaign, Harry Diamond, then head of PR at City of Glasgow Council and former Lord Provost Michael Kelly who led promotion of the slogan around the world and who famously arranged for Her Majesty the Queen to be pictured with the Miles Better banner on the balcony of Glasgow City Chambers. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Bob Doris*, Hugh Henry*
