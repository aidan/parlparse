*S1M-2106 Mr Mike Rumbles: Arbuthnott Formula and Funding of Grampian Health Board—That the Parliament notes with concern the current financial pressure facing Grampian Health Board and the consequences this will have for health services in the region; notes that Grampian has the lowest per capita health funding in Scotland and is concerned that this will continue to be the position in 2004; believes that this situation is a result of the inadequacy of the Arbuthnott formula at identifying the financial needs of health boards with large rural populations, and therefore believes that the operation of the formula should be reviewed to ensure that finance is allocated on a basis that will give both rural and urban populations the same standard of health care.
