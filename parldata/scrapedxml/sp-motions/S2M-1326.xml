 *S2M-1326 David McLetchie: Health Issues-That the Parliament notes that, despite a substantial increase in funding for the NHS in Scotland, services for patients have not improved over the last five years with fewer in-patient, day case and out-patient treatments occurring and more patients waiting longer for treatment; notes that, despite the best efforts of NHS staff, the current monolithic, centrally-run system of providing healthcare is not delivering the results our people are entitled to expect; recognises that fundamental reform is needed of the NHS in Scotland to achieve the standards of many other health services in European countries and to provide value for money for our taxpayers, and calls on the Scottish Executive to give patients genuine choice over the treatment they receive, establish foundation hospitals within NHSScotland and promote the development of the independent sector.
