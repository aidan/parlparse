*S2M-3164 Carolyn Leckie: Solidarity With Gate Gourmet Workers—That the Parliament is appalled at the actions of Gate Gourmet, who summarily sacked 800 people, mostly women and all low paid; believes that the company displayed the worst example of big business putting profit before people; condemns its callous treatment of its workers; further believes that all the sacked workers should be reinstated immediately without loss of pay and that the company should conduct meaningful discussions with the trade unions; sends solidarity to all the sacked workers, their families, supporters and trade union colleagues; congratulates the workers based at Heathrow airport for their solidarity action; believes that the subsequent disruption was a direct result of the actions of Gate Gourmet and that that is where the blame should be placed; regrets that such solidarity action is illegal only because Thatcher’s anti-union laws are still on the statute book eight years after Labour came into power, and considers that these laws give a stacked deck of cards to already powerful corporate bullies and should be abolished.
