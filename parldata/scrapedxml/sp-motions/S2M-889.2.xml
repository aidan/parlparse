*S2M-889.2 Colin Fox: The Future of Scottish Football-As an amendment to motion (S2M-889) in the name of Mr Kenny MacAskill, leave out from "sympathises" to end and insert "; notes the experience of successful club teams such as Barcelona that are mutually owned and elect their own board of directors to run the club; further notes that some clubs in the English Nationwide League have already chosen this path by setting up supporters' trusts, and believes that public funding should be made available to allow for wider community involvement in the clubs and to co-ordinate the game across Scotland."
