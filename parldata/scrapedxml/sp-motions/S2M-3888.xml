*S2M-3888 Brian Adam: Aberdeen’s Eroding Golden Sands—That the Parliament condemns the Scottish Executive for rejecting a £10 million sea defence scheme for Aberdeen and replacing it with a £2.57 million plan and believes that the Executive should rethink its decision on this issue in order that Aberdeen can continue to be known as the silver city with the golden sands, rather than as the granite city with the boulder-strewn beach.
