 *S3M-8000 Pauline McNeill: Concern over Cuts at the University of Glasgow—That the Parliament expresses grave concern over the cuts that the University of Glasgow has proposed in a number of departments, including Scotland’s only school of Slavonic studies and the key department of Adult and Continuing Education, which, it considers has been critical in widening access to the University of Glasgow; believes that these cuts are being proposed as a consequence of the 8% cut to higher education funding outlined by the Scottish Government; supports the staff, students and trade unions in their campaign against the proposals; notes with concern trade union fears that the consultation process has thus far lacked appropriate inclusion and transparency, and calls on the Scottish Government to intervene to ensure that a meaningful consultation process takes place in an attempt to safeguard what it considers the valuable, and in some cases unique, departments that have been singled out for closure.
