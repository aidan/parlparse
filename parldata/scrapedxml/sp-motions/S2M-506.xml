*S2M-506 Rosie Kane: Support for David Amess MP's Early Day Motion on Asylum Seekers and the Right to Work-That the Parliament congratulates David Amess, MP for Southend West, who has laid an Early Day Motion (EDM) before the Houses of Parliament regretting Her Majesty's Government's decision to deny the right to work to asylum seekers, the right to apply for permission to work having been withdrawn from asylum seekers on 23 July 2002; supports the EDM which states, "That this House regrets the decision in 2002 by the Secretary of State for the Home Department to prevent asylum seekers from working while their applications for residency are under consideration; urges the Home Secretary to reconsider that decision; recognises that issuing temporary work permits would reduce the temptation to work illegally, and believes that allowing asylum seekers to contribute to the British economy would reduce tensions within the local communities where they are located", and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to Her Majesty's Government to reverse its decision of 23 July 2002 and allow asylum seekers throughout the UK to seek work while waiting for their claims to be considered. Supported by: Tommy Sheridan*, Carolyn Leckie*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*
