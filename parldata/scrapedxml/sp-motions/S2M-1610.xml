*S2M-1610 Mr Mark Ruskell: Climate Change—That the Parliament notes the House of Commons Environmental Audit Committee’s report Budget 2004 and Energy which concludes that action on climate change is "seriously off course"; notes the likelihood of failure in achieving UK carbon emission reduction targets and the complete absence of any targets in Scotland; recognises with growing concern the damage that climate change is inflicting on Scotland’s people, environment and economy; is appalled that Scotland lags behind the rest of the United Kingdom in reducing emissions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to "climate-proof" all spending and policy decisions and, in particular, to address the growing pollution from rising traffic levels and the Executive’s massive road building plans which are making the situation worse.
