*S2M-4978 Brian Adam: Plight of Farepak Customers—That the Parliament notes and condemns the actions of the Farepak Christmas hamper firm in continuing to accept money from customers, despite its precarious financial position; expresses concern for those customers who will not be able to retrieve all of their lost savings; urges agents and customers of Farepak to lodge their claims for compensation with the firm’s administrators, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to the UK Government to tighten up consumer protection measures so that this cannot happen again.
