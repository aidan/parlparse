*S3M-1610# Alison McInnes: Young Drivers - Reducing the Death Toll—That the Parliament notes with concern that one in three fatal road accidents in Scotland last year involved young people under the age of 25 and that three quarters of those crashes happened on rural roads; notes that this is particularly true in the Grampian region where 40% of fatalities were young drivers and so welcomes The Press and Journal’s Young Driver of the Year competition; further welcomes the competition entrants’ innovative recommendations on how the death toll on the roads could be reduced, and considers that all these recommendations should be examined in detail to see which proposals could be taken forward to improve the safety of young drivers in Scotland. Supported by: Nanette Milne*, Mike Pringle*, Jim Tolson*, Kenneth Gibson*, Elizabeth Smith*, Mike Rumbles*, Sandra White*, Jim Hume*, Bill Kidd*, Brian Adam*
