*S1M-3487# Pauline McNeill: Human Traffickingâ€”That the Parliament expresses deep concern over international human trafficking for sexual exploitation; notes that Anti-Slavery International reports that human trafficking in children and women from Eastern Europe, China and Africa is spreading to Scotland through organised crime networks; condemns this practice as modern-day slave trade involving abduction, deception, blackmail, threats of violence and debt bonding; further notes that this deplorable trade forces vulnerable women and children to work as prostitutes for little or no money, fearing that co-operating with the authorities could result in reprisals against them or their families and deportation; congratulates ECPAT, Anti-Slavery International and the National Criminal Intelligence Service, who have investigated, tracked and exposed human trafficking; welcomes the UN protocol on human trafficking, the draft European Union framework decision on combating trafficking in human beings which, when finalised, will compel all member states to incorporate trafficking legislation into domestic law within two years, the prohibition of trafficking for sexual exploitation in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Bill, and the Scottish Executive's plans to introduce amendments at stage 2 of the Criminal Justice (Scotland) Bill in order to make trafficking of human beings both into and around Scotland a criminal offence, and believes that the matter should be fully debated and that legislative proposals to prohibit trafficking, introduce stiffer sentences for trafficking children and make provisions for the care and protection of victims of trafficking and their families, should be brought forward for its consideration.
