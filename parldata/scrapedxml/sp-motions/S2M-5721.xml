*S2M-5721 Cathy Peattie: Future of the Digital Spectrum—That the Parliament notes the proposals for the disposal of the digital spectrum, largely by sale to the highest bidder, when it is released as a result of the cessation of analogue television; is concerned about the inadequacy of proposed safeguards regarding its future use; notes that, among the potential uses of this digital dividend, there are many which have significant implications for devolved issues, particularly for the cultural content of programming, for news coverage of Scottish current affairs, for Scottish creative industries and for other aspects of the Scottish economy; further notes that there is great potential for use of the digital spectrum at a more localised level, and believes that the digital dividend should be used to strengthen and extend the public service use of the spectrum by ensuring that capacity is reserved on digital multiplexes throughout Scotland to enable the growth of local and new Scottish television channels. Supported by: Malcolm Chisholm* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
