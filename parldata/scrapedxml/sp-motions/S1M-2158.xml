 *S1M-2158# Tavish Scott: Highlands and Islands Lifeline Air Links—That the Parliament recognises the vital importance to the social and economic wellbeing of the Highlands and Islands of the air services both within the area and linking the area to London and to Scotland’s hub airports; notes the potential to protect and support such services by the imposition of public service obligations, as already imposed on services to Campbeltown, Barra and Tiree; further notes the imposition by the French Government of public service obligations on 30% of air routes into Paris Orly, and believes that the Scottish Executive should extend the use of public service obligations to other lifeline air routes to and within the Highlands and Islands and should use its strategic ownership of Highlands and Islands Airports Ltd to help airlines provide better and more affordable services.
