 *S3M-6350.3 Robert Brown: Protection for Workersâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-6350) in the name of Hugh Henry, insert at end "; recognises that attacks on public sector workers are treated with gravity under existing law, and believes that effective prosecution through the courts of such offences and the further development of non-legislative measures, including evidence sharing and partnership working, are an appropriate response to violence against workers delivering a public service."
