 *S2M-2128# Roseanna Cunningham: Westminster Energy Bill and EC State Aid Rules—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the European Commission to launch an investigation into whether the UK Government will contravene EU competition rules in establishing a nuclear decommissioning authority which could provide subsidies of £48 billion to the nuclear industry; notes that legal opinion obtained by Greenpeace makes a case that the Westminster Energy Bill involves the establishment of a state aid scheme which enables the proposed nuclear decommissioning authority to carry out decommissioning for private, as well as state, operators from public funds and that it provides the legislative infrastructure to enable further aid to be granted to British Energy over and above that proposed by the restructuring package; recognises that the nuclear industry has, for decades, depended on direct state support while leaving a legacy of nuclear waste and vast stocks of weapons-usable plutonium, and believes that the new commission now has the opportunity to demonstrate its independence from the nuclear lobby by reaching a decision which could bring an end to the massive state subsidies enjoyed by the nuclear industry.
