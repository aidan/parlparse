 * S2M-2321 Alex Johnstone:1000th Anniversary of the Birth of Macbeth and Connections with Lumphanan, Aberdeenshire—That the Parliament notes that 2005 is the 1000th anniversary of the birth of Macbeth, King of Scotland from 1040 to 1057; regrets that Macbeth is misportrayed in the Shakespeare play of that name when in fact he was a successful Scottish King; notes the historic connections that Macbeth had with a number of locations in Scotland, including Lumphanan in Aberdeenshire, where he met his death at the Battle of Lumphanan in 1057, and is of the opinion that marking this 1000th anniversary would both boost understanding of this historic period and increase awareness, especially among tourists, of locations such as Lumphanan that have ties with Macbeth.
