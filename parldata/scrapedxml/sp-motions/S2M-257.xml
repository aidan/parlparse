*S2M-257# Mrs Nanette Milne: Support for Mountain Rescue Service-That the Parliament recognises the valuable life-saving work performed by the mountain rescue service in attending an estimated 400 incidents each year; notes that each mountain rescue team receives £6,000-7,000 via local police boards, which accounts for only a fraction of the average £30,000 annual running cost of each team, and commends the fundraising work by the teams, but reflects that a tiny proportion of the £500,000,000 underspend by the Scottish Executive in 2002-03 would have equipped and maintained the teams in full for many years to come. Supported by: David Mundell*, Mr David Davidson*, Mary Scanlon*, Alex Johnstone*, Mr Jamie McGrigor*, Robin Harper*, Brian Adam*, John Swinburne*, Rosie Kane*, Mike Pringle*, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton*
