*S3M-2486♦ Cathie Craigie: Muscle Disease Awareness Week—That the Parliament recognises Muscle Disease Awareness week, taking place from 20 to 27 September 2008, during which the Muscular Dystrophy Campaign will publish a new report, Building on the Foundations: Scotland; is concerned that the report reveals that families with rare and debilitating conditions are being denied treatments that could prolong and improve their lives, particularly home ventilation and physiotherapy, and are faced with major delays in the provision of essential equipment and barriers to independent living; notes that care from a multidisciplinary team, with a lead professional or key worker to coordinate care, improves patient outcomes; welcomes the work of the Scottish Muscle Network to improve patient care in terms of quality, access and appropriateness, and hopes to achieve improved standards of care for all patients with muscular dystrophy and related neuromuscular conditions.
