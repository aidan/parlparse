 *S3M-5044 Hugh Henry: Mail Delivery Serviceâ€”That the Parliament regrets the decision by Procurement Scotland, on behalf of the Scottish Government, to remove business from Royal Mail; believes that this decision will cause further difficulties for Royal Mail in trying to sustain a public delivery service in every part of Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Government to review this decision to ensure that all such decisions taken are compatible with support for public delivery services in every community in Scotland.
