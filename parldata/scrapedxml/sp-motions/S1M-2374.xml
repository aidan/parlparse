*S1M-2374 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Close the Cattle Incinerator at Carntyne, Glasgow-That the Parliament totally opposes dead cattle being incinerated in the built-up area of Carntyne in Glasgow, under the national BSE Surveillance Scheme; believes that such an operation, involving fallen stock at official "high risk" of BSE and which involves the heads of hundreds of animals being removed and the carcasses incinerated before brain stem tests for BSE are returned from laboratories should never take place within a city; is shocked that the incinerator at Carntyne, which is in the built-up area of the East End of Glasgow, next to housing and playing fields and near schools, is undergoing tests prior to re-opening; notes that residents have already been subjected to smoke and smells which caused the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to close the burner temporarily; supports the aims of the BSE Surveillance Scheme in discovering how much BSE remains in British herds; believes that it is intolerable that part of this operation is being inflicted on Glasgow when it could be moved to an area where there is little pollution risk to people, and supports the current united efforts of East End Community Councillors, Glasgow City Councillors and MSPs from all parties who demand that the cow burner at Carntyne is closed permanently and the interests of the local people put first. Supported by: Tommy Sheridan*
