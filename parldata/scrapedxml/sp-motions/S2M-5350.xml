*S2M-5350 Donald Gorrie: Compulsory Advertisements for Charities—That the Parliament is concerned that the Scottish Executive is considering compelling charities to pay up to £500 for advertisements whenever they plan significant changes to their charitable aims; believes that such advertisements represent very bad use of a charity’s funds since very few people will read them, and further believes that making better use of the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator’s website to publicise the changes would reach more people at less cost, that charities taking out such advertisements could be open to challenge for misuse of their funds in a way that does not provide best value for money and that donors will be deterred from giving if they consider that their money will go to pay for an administrative advertisement.
