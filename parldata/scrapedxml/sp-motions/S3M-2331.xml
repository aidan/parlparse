 *S3M-2331 Mike Pringle: Congratulations to Marks &amp; Spencer on Success of Plastic Bag Charging Scheme—That the Parliament congratulates Marks &amp; Spencer (M&amp;S) on the success of its carrier bag charging scheme; notes that since its introduction in May 2008 the scheme, which charges 5p for every disposable bag issued, has succeeded in reducing the number of disposable bags used by 80% and raised significant sums for charitable urban regeneration projects, including one in Edinburgh; acknowledges that the success of the M&amp;S scheme is further evidence that a plastic bag levy is a viable option for Scotland and would be successful in significantly reducing the number of disposable bags issued by retailers, and calls on supermarkets and other retailers to follow M&amp;S’s example and introduce charging for plastic bags to further reduce plastic waste.
