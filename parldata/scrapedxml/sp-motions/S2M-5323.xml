 *S2M-5323 Christine Grahame: A Dog is for Life—That the Parliament recognises the sterling work of the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA); notes that from January to November this year a record number of 4,956 dogs were abandoned and taken into SSPCA kennels, with 324 currently in "foster care"; further notes that the SSPCA currently has no kennel space available; notes that the society is even receiving abusive calls from dog owners who, in the run-up to Christmas, seek to abandon their dogs, and therefore urges the Scottish government to support the SSPCA in its call to the public not to buy pets for Christmas presents, many of which are abandoned once the tree and the tinsel are down.
