*S3M-1757 Robert Brown: Greater Glasgow Scouts Growing—That the Parliament welcomes the increase of almost 5% this year in the membership of the Scout movement in Greater Glasgow; notes the wide opportunities for adventurous pursuits, personal development and informal learning and the contribution to civic and community responsibility offered by the Scouts; is aware that this success, and indeed all the work of the Scouts and other youth organisations, could not be achieved without the commitment of young and adult volunteers and leaders, and looks for even further success in future years.
