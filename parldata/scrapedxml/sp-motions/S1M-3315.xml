*S1M-3315 Tommy Sheridan: Pension Package for Scottish Executive Permanent Secretary-That the Parliament condemns the excessive severance payment and pension package which will be made available to the Permanent Secretary to the Scottish Executive, Sir Muir Russell on his early retirement in 2003; believes that the £150,000 lump sum and £50,000 per annum pension package for less than six years as Permanent Secretary is outrageous, insensitive to those earning a low income and an abuse of public money, and calls for a public inquiry involving representatives of the Scottish pensioners' movement, civil service trade unionists and anti-poverty groups before any payment from funds is made to Sir Muir.
