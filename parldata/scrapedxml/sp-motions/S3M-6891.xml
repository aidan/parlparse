 *S3M-6891 Liam McArthur: Ferry Duplicityâ€”That the Parliament is of the view that, while the Scottish Government has been consulting on what is considered to be its damaging cost savings proposals for the lifeline ferry service to the Northern Isles, the government must have been planning the recently announced proposal to extend by one year its pilot of Road Equivalent Tariff fares on the ferries to the Western Isles, a pilot which has exclusively channelled funds to cut fares on the Western Isles routes while the users of the ferries to the Northern Isles, the Argyll islands and on the Clyde have enjoyed no such cuts; believes that to be simultaneously planning to extend this special treatment for the Western Isles while proposing to downgrade the services to the Northern Isles is at best duplicitous, and calls on the Scottish Government to end the threat to the Northern Isles by withdrawing its cost cutting proposals, proposals that would leave Orkney and Shetland with an inadequate service on what are vital lifeline routes.
