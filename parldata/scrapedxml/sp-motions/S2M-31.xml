 *S2M-31# Ms Sandra White: Glasgow and Edinburgh Airports Investment—That the Parliament notes the response by BAA plc to Her Majesty’s Government’s consultation document, The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: A National Consultation – Scotland, which states that the upgrading of Glasgow Airport to international hub status would cost £1.1 billion, £200 million less than government estimates, and that the cost of upgrading Edinburgh Airport would be £1.3 billion, £400 million more than previous estimates; further notes the massive investment planned for airport expansion in the south east of England; expresses its support for Scottish Airports Ltd’s call on Her Majesty’s Government not to put Scotland’s long-term economical prospects at risk by opting to develop only one of the country’s main airports, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make representations to Her Majesty’s Government to ensure that the necessary investment is made available to ensure that both airports grow to their full potential.
