 *S2M-4247 Rosie Kane: Removal of the Hazizi Family Flies in the Face of the Fresh Talent Initiative—That the Parliament condemns the continued treatment, considered by many to be barbaric, of asylum seekers by the Home Office; is concerned for the well-being and safety of the Hazizi family who were "dawn raided" this morning at their home at the Red Road flats in Glasgow; is concerned for David Hazizi, aged 14, who had hoped to return to school today after the Easter break but is now extremely traumatised and is destined for detention and removal along with his sister Marita, aged 20, who has been studying mathematics and science at the University of Strathclyde but who has now been grabbed away from the final year of her degree and her hopes of becoming a maths teacher here in Scotland, and their brother Gani, aged 19, who has been taken from his partner Lisa and from his unborn child who is due in six weeks time; regrets that the Hazizi family, who have lived in the UK since May 2001, now find themselves in danger and fear, and demands that the First Minister, along with Paul Martin, MSP for the Springburn constituency, and Malcolm Chisholm, Minister for Communities, intervene immediately in the interest of attracting and holding "Fresh Talent" here in Scotland, keeping Gani with his partner and their child and allowing Marita to complete her studies and work here in Scotland.
