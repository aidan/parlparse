 S2M-2479 # Cathy Peattie: What Century is This? Campaign—That the Parliament welcomes and congratulates the Equal Opportunities Commission and the Close the Gap partnership on the launch of the What Century is This? campaign in the run-up to International Women’s Day; notes that the raison d’être for the campaign is that women still get paid 16% less than men, and considers that employers and employees and their representative organisations should support the campaign, *carry out pay audits and *develop action plans to address the persistence and challenge the injustice of this pay discrimination. Supported by: Donald Gorrie* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
