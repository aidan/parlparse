 *S2M-3660 Bruce Crawford: Forth Road Bridge Tolls—That the Parliament believes that there should be a thorough and wide-ranging consultation process on the issue of the future of tolls on the Forth Road Bridge; considers that this consultation process should not commence until the Tolled Bridges Review is completed in order for the Scottish Executive’s position on the Forth Road Bridge tolls to be set in the national context, and is disappointed at media reports that the Minister for Transport and Telecommunications appears to have pre-empted any real or meaningful consultation process by backing toll levels up to £4. Supported by: Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Fiona Hyslop*, Carolyn Leckie*, Michael Matheson*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Jim Mather*, Tricia Marwick*, Alex Neil*, Christine Grahame*, Mr John Swinney*
