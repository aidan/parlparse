*S3M-6559 Sarah Boyack: Scotland’s Pro-teams Go Live on BBC ALBA—That the Parliament congratulates Scottish Rugby and Celtic Rugby Ltd on securing a deal with BBC ALBA to provide live coverage of Scotland’s two professional rugby teams, Glasgow Warriors and Edinburgh Rugby, throughout the 2010-11 season and for the next four years; considers that this coverage will help to grow the support for rugby both on and off the pitch by making it more accessible to a wider audience across the whole of Scotland; further considers that the broadcasting of rugby has an important role to play in increasing participation in the sport thereby increasing fitness levels, promoting Scotland to a wider audience and creating a platform for greater Scottish sporting achievements, and believes that the deal clearly demonstrates to the BBC and other broadcasters in Scotland the significant appetite for coverage of Scottish rugby, being of the view that it should be available on mainstream terrestrial channels.
