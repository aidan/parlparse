*S3M-3930♦ Ross Finnie: Proposed Multi-fuel Power Station at Hunterston—That the Parliament notes the application by Ayrshire Power Limited to the Scottish Government for permission, under section 36 of the Electricity Act 1989 and deemed consent under section 57 of the Town and Country Planning (Scotland) Act 1997, to construct a multi-fuel power station at Hunterston Port, Fairlie in North Ayrshire; further notes that it is proposed that the facility would be fuelled by coal and potentially up to 15% biomass to produce up to 1,600MW of electricity per annum and would be carbon capture ready, which means that, while the facility would be designed to incorporate carbon capture and storage, it would not be installed until the technology had been shown to be technically and commercially viable, and considers that it would be beneficial if the power station operated carbon capture and storage from the outset or was able to meet an equivalent emissions performance standard by other means.
