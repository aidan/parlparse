*S2M-4890 Carolyn Leckie: Supporting the Choice to Die at Home—That the Parliament congratulates Marie Curie Cancer Care on its "Supporting the Choice to Die at Home" campaign; notes that most people would prefer, if possible, to die at home rather than in a hospital; is concerned that currently only around a quarter of cancer patients actually achieve this wish; notes that the findings of an economic report produced by Marie Curie Cancer Care show that caring for more patients at home would release funds which could be used elsewhere in the NHS; supports the objectives of the campaign which are to (1) tackle barriers that prevent people from dying at home, (2) ensure that resources are available to enable people to achieve their choice of dying at home and (3) make information available to help people choose where they would like to die, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that these aims are met and that patients secure the right to die in the environment of their choosing and to provide the resources to enable any such choice to be a genuine one.
