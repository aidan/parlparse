*S3M-777 Bashir Ahmad: Muslim Prayer Rooms in SPL Clubs—That the Parliament congratulates Scottish Premier League football clubs for setting up special prayer rooms for Muslim players and fans; believes that, in including such vital services to cater for the needs of Scotland’s Muslim population, Scotland’s football clubs are taking the initiative for other recreational and leisure facilities to follow, and hopes that other services and facilities will continue to provide for the special needs of all faith and non-faith groups in Scotland.
