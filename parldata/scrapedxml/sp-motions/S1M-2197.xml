*S1M-2197 Michael Russell: Parthenon Marbles-That the Parliament notes the recent constructive proposals by the Greek Government for the return of the Parthenon Marbles to Greece in advance of the Olympic Games to be held there in 2004, which involve putting aside the issue of ownership and instead entering into a partnership to ensure that the marbles are displayed and conserved in the best possible way; further notes that the Greek Government is willing to enter a rolling loan agreement so that other artefacts of great significance which have never before been seen in the UK can be displayed in the British Museum; regrets that Her Majesty's Government has not yet responded to these positive proposals, and hopes that Her Majesty's Government will at last recognise the justice of the Greek case and will help the Greek Government to mark the return of the Olympics to their nation with a cultural gesture of world significance.
