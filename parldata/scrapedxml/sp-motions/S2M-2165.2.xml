*S2M-2165.2 Tommy Sheridan: Proposed Defence Reviews from a Scottish Perspective—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2165) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from first "notes" to end and insert "considers that it is unacceptable for young men and women from Scotland to be committed to an illegal war based on lies and deceits; considers therefore that the votes of UK Parliaments on Iraq were tarnished; notes the sad reality that soldiers from Scotland have always suffered higher than proportional losses across the UK Army in all major conflicts, including the First and Second World Wars; believes in an independent Scotland and the unification of all Scottish soldiers into one Scottish Army unit committed to civil defence and humanitarian causes only; believes that the organisation of such a newly-unified Scottish Army should be based on the principles of accountability, earned respect and discipline and not on an out-moded hierarchical structure; believes that such a Scottish Army would be committed to civil defence and disallowed from involvement in illegal wars; further believes that the Scottish people should campaign for control of our own oil and gas resources and not allow blood to be spilled in pursuit of one country’s desire to control another country’s oil resources, and resolves to prevent the current British Army from using public labour exchanges and benefits offices, schools, colleges and training centres to mount recruitment campaigns."
