*S2M-3949 Alex Neil: Demand for a Public Inquiry into Shirley McKie Caseâ€”That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Executive has agreed to make a settlement in the compensation claim by Shirley McKie against it; considers that this issue of compensation could have been resolved much sooner following her acquittal in 1999 of having committed perjury; considers that the failure to resolve the issue in a more timely fashion has resulted in years of misery for Shirley McKie and her family; notes that, despite her acquittal in 1999, failure to resolve the issue sooner may have led to a tarnishing of her reputation; commends the McKie family for their bravery in fighting for justice, and calls for a full public inquiry into the role of the police, Scottish Criminal Records Office, the Crown Office and the Executive in this case, in particular their reason for bringing an action of perjury against Shirley McKie in the first instance and their failure to resolve the situation in a timely manner following her acquittal.
