*S1M-2564 Irene McGugan: Citizens of a Multilingual World-That the Parliament welcomes the findings in the report by the Action Group on Languages, Citizens of a Multilingual World and the supportive statements made by Jack McConnell MSP when Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs; notes however the concerns of the Scottish Association of Language Teaching and others regarding the delay in making the revised 5-14 curriculum guidance available, which has hindered progress and much needed development in modern languages in both the primary and secondary school sectors; recognises that this regrettable delay in responding to the Group's report, and the publication of Circular 3/2001, Guidance on Flexibility in the Curriculum, in advance of this response, have led to widespread speculation and misinterpretation of the principle of "entitlement" as it is described in the Group's report, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to end this uncertainty and pursue the proposals in the report by means of a strategic implementation plan without further delay and to provide local authorities and schools with the responsibility and opportunity to improve language learning throughout Scotland, so that each pupil and student is enabled to fulfil his or her potential as a citizen of this multilingual world.
