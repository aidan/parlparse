*S3M-7941 Jackie Baillie: University of Glasgow School of Nursing—That the Parliament notes with concern the University of Glasgow’s proposal to scrap its nursing course as part of a move to save £20 million over the next three years; considers that the nursing department at the University of Glasgow is outstanding and notes that the course has been rated in the top 10 of The Times Good University Guide for the last three years; further notes that NHS boards across Scotland are cutting 1,500 nursing and midwifery posts and considers that the loss of frontline posts and skills will inevitably have a detrimental impact on patient care; therefore urges the University of Glasgow to reconsider its decision, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to intervene urgently to prevent cuts to frontline NHS services.
