*S2M-3479 Christine Grahame: Jedburgh and Coldstream Cottage Hospital Closures—That the Parliament notes the announcement by NHS Borders management that the cottage hospitals at Coldstream and Jedburgh in the Scottish Borders are to close; notes that the announcement comes on the day the Minister for Health and Community Care unveiled his “vision” for NHS services across Scotland, placing a particular emphasis on the virtue of the role of community hospitals; notes that it will be extremely difficult to meet local health needs in these two Borders towns if the primary health care facilities are closed down, and asks the Scottish Executive to consider reviewing the decision by NHS Borders management as it appears to run completely contrary to the vision outlined by the minister on 27 October 2005. Supported by: Brian Adam*, Mr Adam Ingram*, Ms Sandra White*, Rob Gibson*
