*S3M-845 Mike Pringle: Congratulations to Marks &amp; Spencer on Plastic Bag Ban—That the Parliament commends Marks &amp; Spencer for its foresight in deciding to ban plastic bags; welcomes news that a recent survey conducted in London has revealed almost 60% of residents to be in favour of a ban, and believes that Scotland should follow this lead and look again at alternatives to plastic bags in the interest of preventing further damage to the environment.
