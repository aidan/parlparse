*S3M-7506♦ Des McNulty: St Margaret of Scotland Hospice—That the Parliament notes with grave concern the continuing uncertainty faced by Scotland’s largest hospice as a result of proposals to remove places for the care of older people with complex needs; considers with regret that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has failed to enter into positive and constructive discussions with the board of the St Margaret of Scotland Hospice aimed at securing the future of the hospice and the retention of what is considered its outstanding provision; believes that insufficient progress is being made toward finding a solution, and would welcome the continuation of what is considered this much-valued provision.
