*S2M-5793 Ms Sandra White: Congratulations to Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum—That the Parliament applauds Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum in Glasgow for being shortlisted for Britain’s biggest arts prize, the prestigious Gulbenkian Prize for Museums and Galleries; notes that the first prize of £100,000 will go to the museum or gallery judged to have completed the most worthy innovation in the last year; suggests that the Kelvingrove New Century Project, whereby the building and displays were brought up to 21st century standards, the number of objects on display was increased by 50% and thousands of square metres of new display space were created, would make the Kelvingrove a worthy winner; further notes that, since reopening on 11 July 2006, there have been over two million visitors, making it one of the most popular attractions in the United Kingdom, and urges all Scots to make their preference heard by voting for this national treasure through the 24-hour museum website at http://www.24hourmuseum.org.uk/nwh_gfx_en/ART43489.html. Supported by: Christine Grahame*, Patrick Harvie*, Rob Gibson*, David McLetchie*, Eleanor Scott*, Shiona Baird*, Roseanna Cunningham* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
