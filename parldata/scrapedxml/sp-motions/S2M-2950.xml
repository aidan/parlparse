 * S2M-2950 Rosie Kane: Clean Lawâ€”That the Parliament recognises the evidence in the report, Investigating Environmental Justice in Scotland: Links Between Measures of Environmental Quality and Social Deprivation, that highlights that the poor are more likely to live in an environmentally deprived area than those in less socially deprived areas; recognises that this endangers the physical, mental and emotional health of us all; further recognises that the current level of environmental degradation is unsustainable and detrimental to the entire planet, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward a clean law whereby every citizen in Scotland lives in an environment with clean land, clean air and clean water.
