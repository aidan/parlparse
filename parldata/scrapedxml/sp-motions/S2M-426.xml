*S2M-426# Christine Grahame: Hepatitis C from Contaminated Blood Products— That the Parliament recognises the valuable work of the former Health and Community Care Committee in its report on hepatitis C (17th Report 2001) and its seven recommendations; notes that the scheme proposed by the Minister for Health and Community Care with a package worth in the region of £15 million falls far short of the recommendations of the independent inquiry team chaired by Lord Ross where payments would have totalled some £89 million; further notes that the inquiry team's figure is still well below settlements elsewhere in the world; considers that the Scottish Executive's offer will be perceived as being hurtful, mean, unjust and insulting; notes that there are substantial unresolved issues regarding the probable prescribing of known infected blood products until as late as the mid 1990s; further notes that there are issues surrounding the effectiveness of the subsequent prescribing of "synthetic" Factor 8 products, and considers that the Executive should review its offer to comply with the recommendations of Lord Ross's inquiry and instigate a public inquiry now. Supported by: Ms Sandra White*, Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Brian Adam*, Mr Jim Mather*, Nicola Sturgeon*, Shona Robison*, Alasdair Morgan*, Robin Harper*, Mr Rob Gibson*, Tommy Sheridan*, Frances Curran*, Carolyn Leckie*
