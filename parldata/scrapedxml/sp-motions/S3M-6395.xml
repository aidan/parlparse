*S3M-6395Patrick Harvie:72% of Kids Want to Grow Their Own Vegâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the findings of a recent National Trust poll that indicate that children are keen to grow and eat their own food; notes that, in a UK-wide poll of a thousand 8 to 12-year-olds, 72% of children stated that they would like to have their own space to grow fruit and vegetables and that 51% would prefer to eat food that they had grown themselves over fruit and vegetables bought from a supermarket, and calls on the Scottish Government and local authorities to adopt long-term commitments to boost local food production and support the next generation in its desire for the opportunity to grow food in a fun, healthy and environmentally friendly manner and to ensure that allotments and public spaces are made widely available to all those who wish to grow their own produce.
