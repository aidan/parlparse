 *S2M-5550 Michael Matheson: Cork It Campaign - Worthy of Support—That the Parliament notes the increasing problem of underage drinking that affects many local communities across Scotland; recognises the serious health dangers to young people engaged in underage drinking and the associated social problems experienced in communities affected by it; believes that government requires an effective national strategy to reduce underage drinking and that greater inter-agency co-operation between health services, the police and local government should play an important part in tackling the problem at a local level; welcomes the Cork It! campaign, launched by the Falkirk Herald to help stop underage drinking, and recognises that such local campaigns have an important part to play in changing young people’s attitude towards alcohol.
