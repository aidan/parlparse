*S3M-6303 Dave Thompson: Will Danny Deliver?—That the Parliament notes the potential opportunities for the Highlands in the appointment of the Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey MP, Danny Alexander, as the Secretary of State for Scotland in the newly formed Conservative/Liberal Democrat government; notes the many statements from Mr Alexander since he was first elected as a Highlands MP, including demanding cancellation of Highland Council’s housing debt and lowering the rate of fuel duty for rural areas, that could now be implemented utilising his new-found power as the UK Government’s representative for Scotland on reserved matters; looks forward to his quick action on these and the many other issues that he criticised the previous UK Government for not dealing with in statements made in the House of Commons, in the Liberal Democrat manifesto and across the Highlands; considers that he should immediately seek to meet the key Liberal Democrat campaign pledges to provide greater fiscal autonomy to Scotland, implement the recommendations of the Calman Commission on Scottish Devolution on which all political parties have agreed, and ultimately abolish the Scotland Office altogether, which will save taxpayers £10 million annually.
