*S1M-3594 Pauline McNeill: Impact on Human Rights Organisations of Proposed Israeli Legislation-That the Parliament condemns the Bill tabled in the Israeli Parliament, the Knesset, on 29 October 2002 by the chair of the Israeli Government coalition, MK Zeev Boim, to secure impunity for war criminals, outlaw human rights activities, imprison human rights activists for up to ten years and destroy evidence of war crimes; notes that such a law, if passed, would forbid "the holding of investigations and writing down of results" and that any association engaging in any such activity would be liable to be disbanded, effectively closing down any action by human rights organisations to collect and then disseminate testimonies of human rights violations; expresses grave concern that such proposals would sabotage the work of Israeli human rights activists assisting international war crimes tribunals at the Hague and make illegal the courageous and conscientious actions of individual citizens of Israel, and calls on MSPs to protest in the strongest terms to members of the Knesset against these proposed violations of human rights.
