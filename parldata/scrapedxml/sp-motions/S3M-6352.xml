*S3M-6352 Robert Brown: Children and Young People with a Parent in Prison—That the Parliament welcomes the publication by Scotland’s Commissioner for Children and Young People of the report, Perspectives of Children and Young People with a Parent in Prison; notes with concern the finding that each year in Scotland as many as 16,500 children will experience the imprisonment of a parent, more than will experience parental divorce; further notes the findings that children of imprisoned parents are at a higher risk of developing behavioural, mental health and general health problems and are more likely to engage in future criminal behaviour themselves than their counterparts; recognises that children are often the innocent and overlooked victims of these criminal events and considers that they do not currently receive the necessary support to deal with such trauma; urges the Scottish Government to put in place an effective framework of support and intervention for vulnerable children affected by parental imprisonment, and encourages the Scottish Government to invest in these children now instead of storing up social problems for the future.
