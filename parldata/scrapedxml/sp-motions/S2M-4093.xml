*S2M-4093 Alex Neil: Prescription Charge Exemption for Cystic Fibrosis Sufferers—That the Parliament notes that people with cystic fibrosis currently have to pay prescription charges as the condition is not presently on the exemption list; believes that this is an anomaly caused by the fact that previously cystic fibrosis sufferers had an average life expectancy that lasted only until childhood, and therefore it was considered that there was no need to include it as a condition on the exemption list; further believes that this should now be altered to reflect the fact that the average life expectancy of someone with cystic fibrosis is now 31 years, and calls on the Scottish Executive to include the condition on the exemption list for prescription charges.
