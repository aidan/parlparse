 * S2M-2547.2 Bill Aitken:Early Years Education and Childcare—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2547) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from “working families” to end and insert “parents who choose to work; notes that both the Scottish Executive and the Scottish Parliament’s Education Committee are currently reviewing early years provision, including issues of recruitment and retention of staff and pay and conditions, and believes that parents must have the flexibility to choose the form of nursery education best suited to their family circumstances and that a nursery voucher that can be topped up represents the best way to achieve this.”
