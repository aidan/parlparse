*S2M-1654 Rosie Kane: Strathbungo Community and Network Rail’s Attack on the Community—That the Parliament condemns Network Rail for ordering the cutting down of trees around Moray Place and Darnley Road in Strathbungo on the southside of Glasgow on 6 September 2004; regrets, furthermore, that Network Rail did not inform the residents of its plans; considers that the trees are a vital part of the conservation area and that full consultation with the residents and other interested parties would have enhanced the plan, and is concerned that, not only has the environment, the landscape and the community suffered erosion, but that democracy has also been eroded as the wishes of the people have been ignored at the behest of unelected, unaccountable company bosses.
