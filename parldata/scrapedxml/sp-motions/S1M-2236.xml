*S1M-2236 Mr Jack McConnell: Effective Assessment in Scotland's Schools-That the Parliament recognises the importance of effective assessment in schools as a means of improving learning and achievement and supports the Executive's plans to create a coherent system of assessment for Scotland; further recognises that the best way to achieve this is by (a) ensuring that the monitoring and reporting of pupils' progress is done in a consistent way throughout the school years; (b) supporting teachers to make sound judgements about pupils' learning and parents to be involved with their children's development; (c) improving national monitoring of achievement in key areas, and (d) bringing together diverse approaches to record-keeping and reporting in a single, integrated framework, and supports the Executive's plans to involve stakeholders in carrying forward these proposals and to introduce a simpler, more streamlined approach which is effective and easier for teachers, parents and pupils to understand.
