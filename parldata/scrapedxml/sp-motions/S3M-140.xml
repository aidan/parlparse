 *S3M-140 Patricia Ferguson: Govan Old Parish Church—That the Parliament notes that the Church of Scotland has indicated that it has no further use for Govan Parish Church as a place of worship; recognises that this church is home to some of the most ancient Christian sculptures in Scotland and that the site itself has been a place of worship since the 6th century; further notes the central place that this building occupies in the life of the community of Govan, and calls on the Scottish Executive to work with the Church of Scotland, Glasgow City Council, Historic Scotland, the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland and all stakeholders to ensure that an appropriate alternative use is found for this important site, should the Church of Scotland decide to implement its decision.
