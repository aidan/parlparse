*S3M-5263 Margaret Curran: Eco-Flag—That the Parliament recognises the exceptional efforts of the child-led eco-committees in St Bridget’s Primary and Mount Vernon Primary schools; congratulates the two schools on their second eco-award, which has seen each school win its second eco-flag; notes that this award reflects the decision by each school to place environmental issues at the centre of the school’s ethos; commends the eco-committees for encouraging greater consideration for waste management, which is a great reflection on the values and work ethic of both teachers and pupils alike, and hopes that the achievements of St Bridget’s Primary and Mount Vernon Primary will encourage other schools throughout the community to become more green.
