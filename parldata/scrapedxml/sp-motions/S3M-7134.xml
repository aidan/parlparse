*S3M-7134 Kenneth Gibson: Gauguin—That the Parliament welcomes the opening of the latest Gauguin exhibition in London’s Tate Modern, which is scheduled to run until 16 January 2011; notes that this is the first major Gauguin exhibition in Britain for 50 years; recognises what is considered to be the huge cultural impact of this master French post-impressionist and applauds the variety and depth of the Tate Modern exhibition, which features paintings and drawings from around the world; acknowledges that Gauguin’s sumptuous, colourful images of women in Tahiti and his beautiful landscape images of Brittany in France are regarded as some of the most popular images in modern art and that they continue to inspire people of all ages and walks of life; believes that the promotion of all art forms is important and should continue to be funded, and hopes that this exhibition will soon find its way to Scotland.
