*S3M-8013 Cathie Craigie: Scottish Sensory Centreâ€”That the Parliament expresses regret at the recent decision to cease funding for the Scottish Sensory Centre (SSC) at the University of Edinburgh as of 31 March 2011; places on record its appreciation for the work of the SSC since the early 1990s in delivering training and promoting innovative practice in the specialist training of teachers of deaf children, visually impaired children and deafblind children; is concerned at the apparent lack of consultation on the decision with the SSC and wider stakeholders, and calls on the Scottish Government to confirm its future plans for the ongoing continuing professional development and mandatory training programmes for specialist teachers of sensory-impaired children in Scotland as a matter of urgency.
