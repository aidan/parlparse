*S2M-5265 Richard Baker: North East Scotland Credit Union Farepak Offer—That the Parliament congratulates North East Scotland Credit Union (NESCU) on its announcement that is willing to provide low-cost loans to everyone in Grampian who has lost money with Farepak; notes that, as with every loan it issues, NESCU will provide free life insurance to cover the loan and that it will waive its usual joining fee, required of all credit union customers, in the case of Farepak families; believes that this is a generous gesture which demonstrates the important role that credit unions can play in helping families affected by events like the Farepak collapse; urges families throughout Grampian and Scotland which have lost money with Farepak to use credit unions rather than alternative forms of moneylending, and hopes that credit unions throughout Scotland will follow NESCU’s lead and offer assistance to families affected by Farepak’s collapse.
