*S3M-2465 Jackie Baillie: Class Sizes in West Dunbartonshire—That the Parliament notes the study carried out by SNP-led West Dunbartonshire Council that has demonstrated that the SNP promise of reducing primary class sizes to 18 is undeliverable in the lifetime of this parliament in the absence of adequate funding; agrees with the statements by civil servants that "the scale of the commitment does not allow it to be delivered in the lifetime of a parliament" and "the commitment will take 8-10 years to achieve"; recognises that an extra £7 million would be required to deliver this pledge in the West Dunbartonshire area alone; considers with disappointment that the SNP has misled voters with yet another broken promise, and calls on the Scottish Government to produce a report detailing the exact costs of honouring this commitment, including the cost of extra teachers and classrooms for each local authority, how these costs will be met and a realistic timescale in which the reduction in class sizes will be achieved.
