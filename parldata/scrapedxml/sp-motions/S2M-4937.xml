 *S2M-4937 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Scotland 1, France 0—That the Parliament congratulates the Scotland football team management, coaches and players on their fantastic victory against France in the European Football Championship qualifier on 7 October 2006; believes that this victory confirms that Scotland can compete with the best in the world; supports the Scottish Football Association (SFA) in its fight to put an end to attempts that put at risk the future of a separate Scottish international football team; believes that the SFA’s refusal to participate in a United Kingdom football team at the Olympics is vital for the defence of the national team, and demands that the British Olympic Association immediately drops its attempt to create a UK football team.
