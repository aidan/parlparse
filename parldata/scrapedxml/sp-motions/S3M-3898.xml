*S3M-3898 Jackie Baillie: Charity Cycling Duo—That the Parliament congratulates Ministry of Defence workers Gary Thomson and Brian Anderson on their plans to cycle around all twelve of the premier league football clubs in Scotland for charity; notes that the two work colleagues who are raising money for the Children’s Hospice Association Scotland (CHAS) will begin their marathon trek on 13 April 2009 at Rugby Park, home of Kilmarnock Football Club, and aim to finish on 18 April 2009 at Tulloch Caledonian Stadium, home to Inverness Caledonian Thistle Football Club; welcomes the support shown by the Scottish Premier League clubs who have all agreed to donate signed memorabilia to auction for CHAS, and wishes both men good luck in their fund-raising efforts.
