*S2M-1319 Frances Curran: Renfrewshire Council Nursery Nurses-That the Parliament is appalled at the recent offer from Renfrewshire Council made to nursery nurses that would mean that some nursery nurses, with years of experience, would be working for 18 pence less per hour than currently and considers that it should be made clear that pre-five education is highly valued and that local authorities should not insult those who deliver pre-five education with such derisory offers.
