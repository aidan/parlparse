*S2M-884 Scott Barrie: Congratulations to Fife Council on Increased Recycling-That the Parliament notes the recent Audit Scotland report which shows that Fife Council recycled 5.2% of waste during 2002-03, that this is more than double the recycling rate in the previous year and that Fife Council figures show that nearly 17% of waste is currently recycled; further notes that Fife Council has instituted kerbside collections of recyclable waste with assistance from the Scottish Executive's Strategic Waste Fund; congratulates Fife Council and the people of Fife for their success in moving from a situation where barely a fiftieth of waste was recycled to one where almost a fifth is; trusts that this positive trend continues, and hopes that local authorities across Scotland will be encouraged to follow Fife's example.
