*S2M-5752 Christine Grahame: The Poverty Premium—That the Parliament expresses its deep concern that some 240,000 children live in poverty and that the poorest families pay higher prices for basic necessities such as fuel and banking as the costs incurred in purchasing such goods and services can amount to a poverty premium of around £1,000, representing some 9% of the disposable income of an average-sized family; affirms that only an independent parliament, with full powers over the economy, tax and benefits, can tackle endemic poverty, but in the meantime calls on the Scottish government, within its limited powers, to demand that the power companies and banks introduce practices which assist those on low incomes rather than punish them.
