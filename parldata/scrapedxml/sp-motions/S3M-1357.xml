*S3M-1357 Mike Pringle: Congratulations to City of Edinburgh Council—That the Parliament acknowledges the vital role that community centres play throughout Scotland both as a resource for local residents and as a means of social inclusion; commends the excellent service provided to hundreds of regular users by the staff of Burdiehouse and Southhouse Community Centre in Edinburgh despite the poor condition of their current building, and congratulates City of Edinburgh Council on its commitment to press ahead with a vital new facility despite the increased costs entailed through the withdrawal of the original developer.
