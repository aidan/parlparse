*S2M-3109 Patrick Harvie: Ten Thousand No2ID Pledges—That the Parliament congratulates No2ID campaigners for achieving their target of 10,000 pledges of support from people who state that they "will refuse to register for an ID card and will donate £10 to a legal defence fund if 10,000 other people will also make the same pledge"; recognises that this substantial number of signatories is further evidence that public support for the UK ID card scheme is falling, and encourages more members of the public and politicians to support this pledge and resist the Identity Cards Bill. Supported by: Mr Mark Ruskell*, Chris Ballance*, Mark Ballard*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Robin Harper*
