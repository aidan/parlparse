*S2M-1372 Carolyn Leckie: Money Owed to Nursery Nurses-That the Parliament notes that large numbers of nursery nurses do not receive holiday pay, despite their entitlement under the working time directive and regulations; believes that nursery nurses should have been in receipt of full holiday entitlement since 1998; condemns COSLA and individual employers for not correcting this wrong and withholding monies that nursery nurses are lawfully entitled to, and believes that COSLA should seek to ensure that local authorities reimburse nursery nurses in full for all outstanding holiday entitlement and offer a full explanation and apology for its omissions.
