 * S2M-2750 Fergus Ewing:Holyrood Project: Freedom of Information Requestâ€”That the Parliament notes that the First Minister and Permanent Secretary have received a request, dated 16 February 2005, that certain information and documentation relating to the Holyrood project be made public under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002; notes that the information should have been provided within the statutory period of 20 working days; notes that neither the Permanent Secretary nor the First Minister have complied with that deadline and are therefore in breach of the law to that extent; believes that, if they cannot lead by example, they are failing in their respective duties and that this bad example will then be followed by others subject to the law; calls on them to provide the information without further delay and to apologise for their breach of the law, and calls on the Permanent Secretary to make a personal explanation in respect of why he has permitted this delay to occur and whether there are any sanctions which may be applied to a Permanent Secretary who breaks the law.
