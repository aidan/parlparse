*S1M-3278 Ms Margo MacDonald: Classification of Cannabis-That the Parliament, recognising the change in the classification of cannabis and the potential of this change to impact on recreational drug use in Scotland, urges the Scottish Executive to appoint a Commission on Cannabis, which would monitor and research the drug's use by socio-economic, age and geographical classifications and compare its effect on public behaviour and its demands on public services with those of alcohol use.
