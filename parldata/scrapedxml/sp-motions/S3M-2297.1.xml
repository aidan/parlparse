 *S3M-2297.1 Robert Brown: Funding Boost for Science Centres—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2297) in the name of Sandra White, insert at end "but notes the irony that this motion should be circulated on the very day that the Glasgow Science Centre announced that its workforce would be cut by one-fifth as a "direct consequence" of the SNP government cutting core funding to Glasgow Science Centre by 40%, totalling over £600,000 per annum by 2010, and wonders how these savage cutbacks will encourage children to become more interested in science."
