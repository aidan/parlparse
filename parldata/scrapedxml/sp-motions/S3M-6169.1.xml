*S3M-6169.1 Gavin Brown: Transmission Chargingâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-6169) in the name of Jim Mather, leave out from "opposes" to end and insert "notes that the existing locational approach to charging electricity generators for access and use of the GB grid system was first designed prior to the development of the UK public policy objectives and targets regarding carbon emissions and renewable energy; notes that the economics of transmission charging has a number of elements and involves a significant contribution from consumers, infrastructure costs of transmission and operating costs of transmission; believes that there should be an urgent review of transmission charging methodology, taking into account all the existing public policy objectives, and further believes that a review should find a solution that does not disadvantage investment in Scotland."
