 *S3M-3711 Bill Wilson: Seizing the Assets of Economic Terrorists—That the Parliament, while disapproving of the use of the fear of terrorism to erode civil liberties and human rights, urges the UK Government to be consistent in its application of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act (2001); considers that the executive actions of those who ran Scottish and UK banks resulted in thousands of job losses and required the injection of billions of pounds of taxpayers’ money to prevent the collapse of the banking system; holds that these collective failures could be considered to be economic terrorism on an unprecedented scale and that the full weight of the law is, therefore, required to protect and recover taxpayers’ money, and, accordingly, urges the UK Government to use the powers that it has by virtue of the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act (2001) to seize the assets of these individuals.
