*S3M-3584.3 Patrick Harvie: National Planning Framework for Scotland 2 - Proposed Framework—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3584) in the name of Duncan McNeil, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "notes that the Local Government and Communities Committee’s 5th Report, 2009 (Session 3): National Planning Framework for Scotland 2: Proposed Framework (SP Paper 218), expresses no view on the inclusion of the proposed national developments; notes that the national developments proposed in the document include new coal-fired power stations, increased capacity for road traffic and provisions for increased air traffic at three Scottish airports; rejects these developments that will result in dramatic increases in greenhouse gas emissions, alongside many other forms of social and environmental impact; recognises that the designation of a national development will prevent people from objecting on the grounds of need during later stages of the planning process; notes the unanimous recommendation of the Communities Committee in its 5th Report, 2006 (Session 2): Stage 1 Report on the Planning etc. (Scotland) Bill (SP Paper 552) that the National Planning Framework should be "the subject of a debate in the Parliament on a substantive motion", and therefore considers that the Scottish Government should bring forward a further motion to the Parliament, explicitly seeking endorsement for each of the proposed national developments before the final version of the National Planning Framework is adopted by Ministers."
