 *S2M-2975 Donald Gorrie: Stage 3 of Major Bills—That the Parliament recognises the problems caused by not enough time being allocated to Stage 3 debates on major bills, resulting in important amendments not being properly debated, members not being called, or believing they will not be called and not seeking to speak, and ministers and members not being able to clarify controversial issues as promised at Stage 2, and urges the parliamentary authorities to provide enough time for full democratic scrutiny of bills at Stage 3. Supported by: Patrick Harvie*, Ms Sandra White*, Bill Butler*, George Lyon*, Alex Neil*, Mike Pringle*, Mr Kenneth Macintosh*, Dr Jean Turner*, Carolyn Leckie*, Mike Rumbles*, Christine Grahame*, Karen Whitefield*
