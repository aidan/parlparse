*S2M-2077 Linda Fabiani: Carers’ Rights Day—That the Parliament praises the valuable and vital role played by the 666,000 carers in Scotland; notes that the fourth annual Carers’ Rights Day is being held on 3 December 2004 and that Carers Scotland will be visiting the Parliament on 2 December; recognises that millions of pounds worth of carers’ benefits go unclaimed each year, and considers that the Scottish Executive should step up its activities to encourage better take-up of the allowances rightly due to carers in Scotland.
