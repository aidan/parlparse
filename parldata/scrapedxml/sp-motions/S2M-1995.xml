*S2M-1995# Jackie Baillie: Employability Programmes for Vulnerable Groups—That the Parliament notes the success of the New Futures Fund Initiative in providing early employability programmes for people who are furthest from the labour market, including those with addiction problems, the homeless and ex-offenders; acknowledges that 21% of participants entered employment, 14% entered training programmes, 12% entered further education and 10% engaged in voluntary work; notes that the funding of the initiative ends in March 2005, and considers that the Scottish Executive should put in place a long-term strategy to provide the most vulnerable adults with effective routes out of the problems they face by providing easy access to employability programmes.
