*S2M-1570 Mr Jamie McGrigor: Scotland's Regiments-That the Parliament notes with pride and admiration the professionalism of the British Army's Scottish regiments in both their historical and current roles; notes with concern reports that treasury-forced cuts in defence spending may lead to the amalgamation of all of Scotland's regiments; believes that such savage cuts would lead to severe difficulties in recruitment in Scotland; further believes that the prospect of such cuts to Britain's already stretched armed forces at a time of global insecurity when peacekeeping operations are essential is reckless; condemns any decision that would see any of Scotland's historic regiments disappear, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make clear to Her Majesty's Government the very strong opposition throughout Scotland to any such cuts to the Scottish regiments.
