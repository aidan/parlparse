 *S2M-4550.1 Mr Brian Monteith: Glasgow Airport Rail Link Bill—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4550) in the name of Margaret Jamieson, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "does not agree to the general principles of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link Bill and does not agree that the Bill should proceed as a Private Bill because the project will never attract enough passengers to justify the capital investment of £160 million and a £4 million annual subsidy, the single largest group of people using the trains by 2030 will, even after the planned significant growth of Glasgow Airport, continue to be commuters between Paisley and Glasgow, the reduction on car and taxi journeys on the M8 corridor between the airport and Glasgow city centre will peak at only 2% by 2012, 24% of airport passengers will arrive or depart when the trains are not running or are too late to be of help to them, the only direct services will be from Glasgow Central and Paisley Gilmour Street and the proposal as it stands is either an expensive commuter investment or an airport rail link on the cheap and as such could end up being an expensive "white elephant"."
