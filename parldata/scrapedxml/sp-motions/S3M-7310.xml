*S3M-7310 Sarah Boyack: Edinburgh University Settlement Declares Bankruptcy—That the Parliament notes that Edinburgh University Settlement has ceased operations after running up debts of more than £300,000; is concerned that this will result in 40 members of staff being made redundant and over 200 learners having their courses withdrawn; notes that the majority of these learners are from disadvantaged backgrounds, are disabled or have English as a second language; further notes that Edinburgh University Settlement provided these groups with a range of services including adult and community education, employment and vocational training projects and support for people coping with mental health issues, and urges support from all stakeholders involved in Edinburgh University Settlement to work to ensure that the services provided by the projects are continued to the benefit of users.
