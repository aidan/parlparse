*S3M-1777 Patrick Harvie: Progress on HPV Vaccination but Screening Still Matters—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that a vaccination programme against strains of the human papilloma virus (HPV), which cause 70% of cervical cancers, will begin in Scottish schools this year; recognises the need for a communications campaign to inform girls and their parents of the benefits of the vaccination; believes, however, that a comprehensive cervical screening programme remains very necessary and that vaccination should not be seen to undermine this need; further notes the recent worrying fall in attendance at cervical screening, especially among younger women, and calls on the Scottish Government to take further action to encourage women to attend for screening when invited and continue to build on the success of the cervical cancer screening programme in Scotland.
