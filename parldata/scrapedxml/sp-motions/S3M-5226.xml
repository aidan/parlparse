*S3M-5226 Aileen Campbell: All Wales Convention Report—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the final report of the All Wales Convention; notes that the report calls for full legislative powers to be transferred from Westminster to the National Assembly for Wales in areas where the Welsh Assembly Government already has executive responsibility; further notes that implementation of these recommendations would be subject to endorsement by the people of Wales in a referendum, recommended to be held before the next National Assembly for Wales elections in 2011, and believes that a consensus exists in Wales both in favour of the Convention’s proposals and in favour of a referendum as the correct and democratic method to bring about important constitutional change. Supported by: Bob Doris*, Anne McLaughlin*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Christina McKelvie*, Brian Adam*, Stuart McMillan*, Maureen Watt*, Sandra White*
