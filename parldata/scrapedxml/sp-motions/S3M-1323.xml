 *S3M-1323 David Stewart: Increasing Access to Insulin Pumps—That the Parliament notes the considerable benefits that insulin pumps have for diabetics to help them to manage their condition; notes with concern the current restrictive criteria for eligibility for use of insulin pumps which have contributed to insulin pump usage in Scotland being among the lowest in Western Europe, with only around 0.75% of people with Type 1 diabetes using pumps in Scotland compared with 15 to 20% in the United States of America and Germany; is concerned at the extreme regional disparity in uptake of insulin pumps across NHS boards, with only two patients receiving insulin pump therapy in NHS Ayrshire and Arran compared with 42 in NHS Tayside in the most recent figures, despite all NHS boards having received funding for access to insulin pumps; supports the campaign of Diabetes UK to increase access to insulin pumps and welcomes the review being undertaken currently by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) of the eligibility for use of pumps in the NHS, and calls for immediate action to be taken by the Scottish Government to ensure that new NICE guidance that seeks to relax access criteria is adopted swiftly in Scotland, to support all NHS boards to increase access to insulin pumps for patients with diabetes and to enable more training for health practitioners to support patients in moving to the use of pumps where it is clearly of benefit in the management of their diabetes.
