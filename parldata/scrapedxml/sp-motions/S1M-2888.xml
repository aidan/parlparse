*S1M-2888# Mr Andrew Welsh: End-of-Life Refrigerators and Freezers-That the Parliament understands that from January 2002 EC Regulation 2037/2000 requires all ozone-depleting substances to be recovered from domestic refrigerators and freezers before they are recycled or sent for disposal; notes that minimal facilities exist in Scotland for the removal of such substances and that local authorities are having to stockpile end-of-life refrigerators and freezers until adequate facilities are available, and is concerned at the Scottish Executive's lack of preparedness concerning the implementation of this legislation and its failure to ensure that adequate facilities are available for this purpose.
