 *S2M-828.1 Nicola Sturgeon: Modernising the Court System - A New Supreme Court-As an amendment to motion (S2M-828) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, leave out from "believing" to end and insert "for England and Wales; considers, however, that its creation affords an opportunity for the modernisation and repatriation of Scotland's justice system, including an end to the historic anomaly that allows civil, but not criminal, cases to be appealed to a UK court and, having established that principle, calls on the Scottish Executive to consult on whether the Inner House of the Court of Session or a higher appellate authority within Scotland should be the final court of appeal in Scottish civil cases."
