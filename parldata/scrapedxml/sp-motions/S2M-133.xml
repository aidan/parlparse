*S2M-133 Christine Grahame: National Diabetes Week: 8 to 14 June 2003-That the Parliament notes that approximately 150,000 people in Scotland have been diagnosed with diabetes; further notes that it is estimated that another 90,000 people in Scotland remain undiagnosed; recognises that diabetes accounts for about 5% of NHS costs, which equates to £320 million in Scotland annually, and that the incidence of type 1 diabetes in Scotland is 24 per 100,000 per year in the under-15 population and one of the highest incidence rates in the world; notes that early diagnosis reduces the risk of developing life-threatening complications and that 33% more people with diabetes die from coronary heart disease in Scotland each year than in the rest of the United Kingdom, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to raise public awareness of the seriousness of diabetes, thus increasing early detection, to promote screening programmes for those most at risk, to eliminate post-code variable treatment and to take as an example the life of Janet Scott, who has had insulin injections for 70 years and, as a healthy and fit 72 year old, walks 5 miles each day. Supported by: Bruce Crawford*, David Mundell*, Mr David Davidson*, Mr Adam Ingram*, John Swinburne*, Shiona Baird*, Elaine Smith*, Michael Matheson*, Eleanor Scott*, Alex Neil*, Shona Robison*, Alex Fergusson*, Brian Adam*, Mr Bruce McFee*, Carolyn Leckie*, Richard Lochhead*, Stewart Stevenson*
