S3M-3219.1 Ted Brocklebank: Clydesdale Commemorative Homecoming Banknotes—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3219) in the name of Bill Kidd, insert at end "notes with concern the comments of Alex Salmond MSP on Spanish television, as reported in the Daily Telegraph of 6 January 2009, that " … I think the argument for having strong fiscal powers, powers over revenue, powers to expand the economy within a monetary context, within a European Euro context, will prove to be a very strong one for the people of Scotland", and regrets that the Scottish National Party’s wish to see the pound replaced by the euro would signal the end of Scottish banknotes."
