*S3M-256 Patricia Ferguson: Scotland’s Representation in the European Parliament—That the Parliament notes that, following the enlargement of the European Union and the reduction in the overall number of UK Members of the European Parliament, the Electoral Commission has proposed a cut in the number of Scottish MEPs; while welcoming the new EU member states, believes that the proposed cut from seven to six MEPs would be detrimental to Scotland’s interests, and further believes that Scotland’s particular geographical circumstances and its devolved system of government suggest that Scottish representation should not be reduced as suggested and that the Electoral Commission should take these factors into account when making its recommendation to the UK Government.
