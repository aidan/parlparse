*S3M-7782 Jackie Baillie: 50 Nurses and Midwives Cut at the Vale Hospital—That the Parliament is disappointed that 50 nursing and midwifery jobs have been cut at the Vale of Leven Hospital since 2007; believes that the Vision for the Vale has cut jobs, reduced bed numbers, closed wards, removed emergency consultant cover and transferred a number of services across to the Royal Alexandra Hospital (RAH) in Paisley; understands that there is a growing desire for a north-of-the-river solution, which would see services currently delivered at the RAH being transferred to the Golden Jubilee National Hospital in Clydebank, only minutes away from the Vale of Leven Hospital, and regrets that the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing has previously rejected this option.
