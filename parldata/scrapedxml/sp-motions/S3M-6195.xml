 * S3M-6195♦ Pauline McNeill: Securing the Future of Glasgow’s Subway—That the Parliament welcomes Strathclyde Partnership for Transport’s decision to go ahead with its modernisation plan; recognises the important role that the subway plays in Glasgow’s transport infrastructure and its significance to Scotland, carrying an estimated 14 million passengers annually; notes that this will be the first major investment project for the service since the 1970s, and hopes that the proposals receive the support that they need to go ahead and that the modernisation keeps Glasgow moving into the future.
