*S2M-1581 Mr Brian Monteith: No Support for Smoking Ban-That the Parliament notes that a poll of 10,000 people conducted this year by Populus showed that 74% of those surveyed did not support a ban on smoking in pubs and bars and that 98% said that it was better to have a choice of smoking or non-smoking facilities than a complete ban; notes that an Office for National Statistics survey of July 2004 showed that 80% of those surveyed did not express support for a ban on smoking in pubs and bars; further notes that a BMRB poll undertaken in September 2003 showed that less than 17% of people agreed that smoking should be banned in pubs, clubs and restaurants and that 86% felt that the smoking situation in pubs, clubs and bars had improved over recent years; acknowledges that the majority of people are against a complete ban on smoking in pubs; believes that a complete ban on smoking in pubs would have a detrimental effect on freedom of choice in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to allow landlords to determine smoking policy in their establishments and ensure that freedom of choice for consumers to use an establishment that allows smoking is protected.
