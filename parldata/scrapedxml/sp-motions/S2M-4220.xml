S2M-4220 Shona Robison: Caledonia Youth Funding Cuts—That the Parliament notes with concern the funding cuts to Caledonia Youth in Dundee; understands that Caledonia Youth provides sexual health education and advice to Dundee’s youths and vulnerable adults; notes that in 2003-04 Dundee recorded the highest rate of teenage pregnancy at 64.4 per 1,000 against the national average of 42.4 per 1,000; recognises the excellent work carried out by the Corner Project, but believes that Dundee requires more, not fewer, services to tackle its teenage pregnancy problems; further notes that the closure of this facility will not only mean that Tayside will be losing five highly skilled professionals but that the young people who rely on this service will be missing out on much needed support, and calls on NHS Tayside to reconsider this decision.
