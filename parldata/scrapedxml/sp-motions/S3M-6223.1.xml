*S3M-6223.1 Elizabeth Smith: Changing Lives: A Confident, Competent Social Care Workforceâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-6223) in the name of Adam Ingram, insert at end "also notes that the Social Work Inspection Agency concluded that there were wide variations in the level of social care service provided by local authorities throughout Scotland and therefore calls for an independent review of social work services to identify the local authorities that need more help, and, furthermore, calls for the Scottish Government to facilitate greater use of the expertise of the voluntary sector and for greater focus from the Scottish Government on tackling the misuse of drugs and alcohol, which the Social Work Inspection Agency has identified as leading to an increase in the number of children needing to be looked after."
