 *S2M-3274.2 Iain Smith: It’s Simply Not Cricket—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3274) in the name of Christine Grahame, leave out from first "notes" to end and insert "congratulates the England cricket team for its magnificent performances over the summer which led to victory in regaining the Ashes from Australia; commends the way that both sides approached the series as a model of commitment and sportsmanship; recognises that the resurgence in cricket extends not just to England but throughout the United Kingdom; deplores the petty and narrow-minded nationalism of the terms of motion S2M-3274 as lodged, which is an insult to the thousands who play cricket in Scotland, the Scottish Cricket Team which recently qualified for the World Cup, those who hoped to see Scotland play Australia at the Grange in August, a game which sold out three months in advance, and the millions of Scots who enjoyed the recent Ashes Test on television and radio; regrets that future test cricket will not be available on free-to-view television next year; recognises the importance of physical exercise which can be achieved through ensuring that people have access to a range of sports, and therefore urges sportscotland and the Scottish Executive to continue to support the development of cricket in Scotland, particularly in our schools." Supported by: Mr Andrew Arbuckle*, Scott Barrie*, Dr Elaine Murray*, Nora Radcliffe*, Mike Pringle*, Alex Fergusson*
