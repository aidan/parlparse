 * S2M-2916 Mr Brian Monteith: Congratulations to RAF Leuchars’ 43 (Fighters) Squadron—That the Parliament congratulates RAF Leuchars’ 43 (Fighters) Squadron, “the Fighting Cocks”, on receiving the Freedom of the City of Stirling; supports Stirling Council’s decision to bestow the city’s greatest honour on an RAF squadron, which was formed in 1916 in the shadow of Stirling Castle and which saw action over France in the First World War at Dunkirk, the Battle of Britain, North Africa, in Sicily in the Second World War and in the first Gulf War; recognises the valuable contribution that the squadron makes to the local community, and hopes that the award of the Freedom of the City will confirm 43 Squadron’s position as Stirling’s Squadron.
