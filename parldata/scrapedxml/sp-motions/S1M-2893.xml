 *S1M-2893 John Farquhar Munro: The Three Chimneys Restaurant-That the Parliament offer its warm congratulations to The Three Chimneys Restaurant, Colbost, on the Isle of Skye, for being recognised by the magazine Restaurant as one of the best places in the world to eat, coming in at number 28 in its world rankings; acknowledges that the outstanding success of the restaurant has been achieved through a combination of traditional Scottish cooking, a welcoming atmosphere, and the dedication of the Spear family; notes that celebrity diners and tourists travel from all over the world to sample the quality, home-made food served at The Three Chimneys; recognises the significant impact that such a prestigious restaurant can have on the local economy; and urges the Scottish Executive, Scottish Enterprise and Visitscotland to do all within their power to raise the international profile of Scotland as a centre of excellence for food and drink, particularly in terms of the potentially lucrative niche marketing opportunity that such an image could provide.
