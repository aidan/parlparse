 *S2M-700# Mr Brian Monteith: Roads Maintenance in Stirling District-That the Parliament welcomes the research submitted in November 2003 by the AA Motoring Trust to the Parliament's Local Government and Transport Committee on roads maintenance expenditure in Scotland; notes from the research that Stirling Council spent a total of £5.1 million less on its local roads network in the period from 2001 to 2003 than it received in central government grant, in contrast to the majority of Scottish councils who spent more than they received; further notes that the council's own scrutiny group published research in February 2003 showing that £9.8 million would have been invested in local roads had the local authority and its predecessor Central Region spent their full allocation from central government over the previous six years; acknowledges that Stirling's current Labour administration has consistently rejected alternative budget proposals to spend more on roads, and believes that Stirling Council should acknowledge the extent of the problem and recognise that it needs a fundamental change in policy on this matter.
