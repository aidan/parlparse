*S3M-6879 Bill Kidd: The UK June 2010 Budget and Equality Assessments—That the Parliament expresses concern, following remarks by the Equality and Human Rights Commission that the UK Government must consider the effect of budget cuts on vulnerable groups and that "Under equality legislation, the Treasury, like all public bodies, has a legal duty to pay "due regard" to equality and consider any disproportionate impact on vulnerable groups when making decisions, including decisions about the budget", at the apparent failure by the UK Government to carry out assessments of the effects of the June 2010 Budget on vulnerable groups and considers in particular that the severe cut-backs on disability living allowance, expressly to save money rather than based on the principle of fairness, would appear to fall disproportionably heavily on disabled people as a vulnerable group.
