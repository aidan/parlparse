*S2M-2341 Colin Fox: The Life and Work of Alexander Naysmith—That the Parliament recognises the outstanding life and work of the Scottish artist, Alexander Naysmith; notes that the man, born in Edinburgh’s Grassmarket in 1758, was trained originally as a coach painter, was a gifted engineer and developed under the tutorship of Allan Ramsay to become a renowned portrait painter; notes that this friend and collaborator of Robert Burns suffered because of his strong support for a Scottish republic and his sympathies for the French and American revolutions by being blacklisted and denied work but later retrained as a landscape artist of outstanding regard, and believes that the Parliament should mark the life of Alexander Naysmith by displaying some of his work in Holyrood amongst its collection of artwork.
