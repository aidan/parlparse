*S3M-3250.3 Liam McArthur: Common Agricultural Policy Health Check—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3250) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end "notes with concern evidence of serious difficulties experienced by farmers and crofters in accessing monies under the Scotland Rural Development Programme (SRDP); recognises the Scottish Government’s commitment to review the Rural Priorities scheme, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that the review is sufficiently wide-ranging to cover all aspects of the structure of the SRDP as well as the application process for payments to resolve urgently the problems with the operation and implementation of the programme."
