*S2M-104# Dr Elaine Murray: Dumfries and Galloway Housing Partnership—That the Parliament expresses concern that Dumfries and Galloway Housing Partnership has changed its allocations policy without consultation with tenants or local councillors; believes that the operation of housing associations that have received housing stock from councils through large-scale stock transfer should be transparent; further believes, therefore, that the minutes of the boards of such housing associations should be made available to tenants’ groups and local authorities; believes that local councillors should be permitted to discuss with housing association officials the housing needs of their individual constituents, and considers that Dumfries and Galloway Housing Partnership, as the largest provider of social housing in the region, should work closely with Dumfries and Galloway Council to improve housing services in the area.
