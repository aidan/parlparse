*S3M-3568 Cathie Craigie: Operation Fleet—That the Parliament welcomes the success of Operation Fleet, by Strathclyde Police, in the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth area; notes the impressive results of Operation Fleet, including five people arrested for posing with offensive weapons on internet sites and encouraging people to join them in violent acts, 16 arrested under warrant and 21 arrested for offences such as carrying an offensive weapon and assault; welcomes the fact that no offences were detected in 228 visits to licensed premises to ensure compliance with licensing laws; notes that the success of Operation Fleet depended on partnership working, using measures between Strathclyde Police, North Lanarkshire Council and local businesses, putting into effect measures introduced in the Local Government in Scotland Act 2003 and Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004, and hopes that the current Scottish Executive continues this commitment to effective community policing by providing forces with the tools that they need to deliver stronger and safer communities.
