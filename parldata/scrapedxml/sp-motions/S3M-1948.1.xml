 *S3M-1948.1 Des McNulty: First Glasgow Fare Increases—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1948) in the name of Bob Doris, leave out from "rising fuel costs" to end and insert "the refusal of the Scottish Government to provide rebates to bus operators in line with rebates provided by the UK Government to operators in England and Wales, leaving operators in Scotland with the highest fuel costs in the UK; highlights the inconsistency of the SNP government which claims to support modal shift from cars to public transport but whose policies in practice have led to the biggest increase in bus fares for a generation and the highest increase in train fares for a decade; expresses concern that Scottish Government ministers appear to be more worried about the interests of the shareholders of FirstGroup, which announced a record increase in its operating profits of 11% to £122 million, than with passengers; believes that, with FirstGroup declaring preliminary profits of almost £152 million, there is no need to put fares up in this way and calls on FirstGroup to withdraw these unacceptable fare increases and make further representations to the Scottish Government to increase the Bus Service Operators Grant in line with the treatment of bus operators in England and Wales rather than inflict these inflation-busting fare increases on hard-pressed commuters.
