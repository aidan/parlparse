*S2M-5573 Jackie Baillie: Scottish Power Meter Madness—That the Parliament notes the increasing intransigence of Scottish Power, which has thus far refused to end the back charging of token prepayment meter customers despite condemnation by politicians from all parties; expresses concern that the regulator, Ofgem, has taken insufficient action to stop Scottish Power continuing with a practice that pushes its low income consumers into debt through no fault of their own, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry asking him to intervene with Ofgem to ensure that this practice is ended immediately.
