*S3M-5945 Dr Richard Simpson: A Step forward in Hospital and Patient Communication—That the Parliament welcomes the introduction of the 4Cs system to the State Hospital, replacing the previous complaint system by introducing the possibility of compliments, comments, concerns and complaints, which has subsequently led to a decrease in the number of complex formal complaints and an increase in more productive and proactive comments emanating from useful community meetings and suggestion boxes; commends the positive effect that this had had on patients, who now feel able to get clarity on issues without launching formal complaints; considers that this is a positive step forward in increasing the opportunities for patients to provide feedback and to communicate with hospitals, and further commends this system for more general use in the NHS and other public services.
