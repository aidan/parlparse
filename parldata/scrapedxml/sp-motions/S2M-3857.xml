*S2M-3857 Christine Grahame: Rendition Flights to Wick and Inverness Airports?—That the Parliament notes that the disclosure of documents, obtained by Amnesty International from the US Federal Aviation Administration and separately by the Danish Government, has revealed inter alia that seven alleged rendition flights operated by the CIA have been made through two Highlands airports, two at Wick and five at Inverness; further notes that following these reports the Danish Government announced on 22 August 2005 that the CIA could no longer use Danish airspace; recognises that both Wick and Inverness airports are operated by Highlands and Islands Airports Limited (HIAL), a company wholly owned by the Scottish Executive with the Scottish Ministers the sole shareholder, represented by the Minister for Transport, at one time the current Deputy First Minister, Nicol Stephen, and currently Tavish Scott MSP, and, given that ministerial relationship, calls on the Scottish Ministers to use their powers to instigate a full and thorough investigation to determine what associated documentation HIAL may, or may not, have in respect of these alleged flights. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
