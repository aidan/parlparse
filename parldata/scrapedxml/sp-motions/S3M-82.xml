*S3M-82♦ Patricia Ferguson: Re-regulation of Scotland’s Buses—That the Parliament recognises the plight of communities throughout Scotland where the lack of an accessible bus service makes hospital visits, shopping trips and other routine journeys unacceptably difficult and notes that this problem is particularly acute for elderly people and for young families; further notes that hundreds of Maryhill residents have indicated their support for the re-regulation of bus services, and considers that steps towards re-regulation should be taken as a matter of urgency.
