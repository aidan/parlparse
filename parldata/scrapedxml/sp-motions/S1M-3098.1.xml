 *S1M-3098.1 Mr Keith Harding: Scottish Fire Service of the Future—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3098) in the name of Dr Richard Simpson, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "recognises the need for a commitment to developing a fire service that is modern, effective and efficient and that will also have a specific duty to enhance community fire safety and safer streets and therefore hopes that the Scottish Executive will give careful consideration to the fire service’s response to the consultation paper The Scottish Fire Service of the Future, as it is the men and women within the fire service who put their lives at risk daily in order to protect Scotland’s communities."
