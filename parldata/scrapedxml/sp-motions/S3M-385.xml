*S3M-385 Robin Harper: Media Literacy Education in the Curriculum for Excellenceâ€”That the Parliament expresses its concern at the absence of media literacy education in proposals for the curriculum for excellence and is concerned that Scottish education is neglecting the education of pupils in understanding how the media produce messages and meaning, that pupils will not be enabled to develop the critical and creative skills necessary for informed and active citizenship and that Scottish education is missing the chance to produce a workforce, skilled in digital communication media, which can face the challenges of a globalised information economy, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that media literacy education is given a place in the new curriculum.
