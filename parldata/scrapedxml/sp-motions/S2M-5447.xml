*S2M-5447 Mr Jamie Stone: Controlled Emission Toilets on 158 Trains—That the Parliament notes with disappointment that the planned refurbishment of the Class 158 trains used on the Far North Line will not include the fitting of controlled emission toilets; further notes that this will mean the continuation of the discharge of raw sewage on to the track, with resulting heath and safety implications; believes that in 2007 rail passengers should not be welcomed to the station by the sight and smell of raw sewage, and therefore calls on Scottish Ministers and First ScotRail to use the opportunity of the planned refurbishment of the Far North Line trains to fit controlled emission toilets.
