*S3M-4671.1 James Kelly: Surviving the Recession, A Lesson from Scandinavia—As an amendment to motion (S3M-4671) in the name of Aileen Campbell, leave out from second "notes" and insert "therefore believes that this questions even further the First Minister’s economic judgment given his call in April 2007 for "light touch regulation" of banks in comparison to what he termed the UK’s "gold plated" system; further believes that the First Minister’s economic credibility was already in question following his advocacy of the Republic of Ireland and Iceland as suitable economic models for Scotland, despite the fact that the global economic downturn has resulted not just in a recession in each of those countries, but an official economic depression, and further believes that any claim by the SNP that Norway was the exclusive economic model for an independent Scotland advocated by it prior to the economic downturn would damage the party’s credibility even further."
