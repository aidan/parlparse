 *S1M-1669 Richard Lochhead: Oil and Gas Report—That the Parliament welcomes the Economic Report 2000 published by the Offshore Operators Association; notes that the report indicates increasing confidence in Scotland’s oil and gas industry, and states that capital expenditure from 2001-04 is expected to be around £12 billion with £4 billion earmarked for this year alone and that remaining reserves off Scotland’s shores may be up to 30% more than the 28 billion barrels of oil already produced; further notes that Her Majesty’s Treasury has already benefited from £170 billion in taxes since the 1970s and that a further £7.3 billion in tax is expected to be paid for 2001-02; encourages the Scottish Executive to work closely with the industry, particularly the smaller independent and often indigenous companies that are set to further develop the Scottish sector, in order to ensure that the industry continues to play a central role in the Scottish economy, and recognises that, if Scotland were independent, this would open up further opportunities to develop world leading offshore technology and related activity as well as allowing growing oil and gas revenues to assist the Scottish Parliament’s efforts to improve the quality of life for Scotland’s people.
