*S2M-1722 Colin Fox: NHS Prescription Charges—That the Parliament believes that NHS prescription charges undermine the founding principle of the NHS, namely that health treatment should be free; notes that there has been a 3,600% increase in prescription charges since 1979, that had the charge simply risen by the rate of inflation it would now be 64 pence instead of £6.40 and that income from charges represents less than 1/20th of the NHS drugs bill and less than 1/200th of total NHS income, and welcomes the decision of the National Assembly for Wales to completely abolish charges for everyone in Wales.
