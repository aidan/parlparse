*S2M-4596 Richard Lochhead: Misleading Birds Eye Advertisements—That the Parliament considers that the latest Birds Eye advertisement which suggests that frozen fish is superior to fresh fish leaves a bad taste in the mouth; believes that the company should withdraw the advertisement; further believes that the advertisement is more than likely an attempt to justify the company’s practice of using only imported frozen fish in its products; considers that the idea that frozen fish tastes better than fish freshly landed at Scottish ports is clearly ludicrous and that consumers should not be subjected to this kind of advertising, and calls on Birds Eye to be careful that it is not seen as anti-Scottish and to stop using its advertising budget to belittle Scotland’s fishing industry.
