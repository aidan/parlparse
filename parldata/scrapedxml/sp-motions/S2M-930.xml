 *S2M-930 Christine Grahame: Consumer Credit Licensing-That the Parliament notes with concern an article in the Mail on Sunday on 22 February 2004 reporting that a journalist, using his bona fide personal details, was granted a consumer credit licence permitting him, inter alia, to offer loans, offer debt counselling and arrange consolidated debt schemes after the most minimal inquiry by a trading standards officer, namely a brief telephone call confirming these personal details; notes that neither the trading standards officer nor the application form for the licence made any inquiry as to the applicant's current employment status or experience in the field; notes the Department of Trade and Industry's White Paper Fair, Clear and Competitive - The Consumer Credit Market in the 21st Century issued in December 2003 and, in particular, the section on the licensing regime on page 44 and the proposed reforms; notes that, under devolution, the fall-out from personal debt, for example bankruptcies, relationship breakdown and ill-health, all has its cost to the Scottish budget, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to make representations in the strongest terms to ensure that the loopholes so apparent in the reported example cannot be repeated and further to make urgent representations that, pending a change in the law, procedures are tightened.
