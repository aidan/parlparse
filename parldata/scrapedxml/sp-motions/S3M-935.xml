*S3M-935 Alex Neil: Small European Countries Work Better—That the Parliament notes the latest OECD figures which show that GDP per head in Norway, Ireland and Luxembourg is more than 125% above the OECD average; considers that this is further proof that small European countries are better at running their own economies and meeting the challenges of globalisation than big countries like Britain, and believes that the quicker Scotland is independent, the quicker we will be able to join our neighbours at the top of the world league.
