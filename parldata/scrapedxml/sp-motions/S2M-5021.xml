*S2M-5021 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Scotland Needs Physios—That the Parliament notes with great concern the current levels of unemployment of physiotherapist graduates in Scotland, with an estimated half of this year’s graduates unable to find employment within the NHS in Scotland; notes that people are living longer with more chronic conditions such as osteoarthritis and therefore more physiotherapists are desperately needed to help rheumatologists and orthopaedic surgeons; considers that it is a disgrace that patients are on waiting lists throughout Scotland but that newly qualified physiotherapists are unable to practise their skills to help them; notes that thousands of working days are lost due to musculoskeletal disorders every year in Scotland; recognises the value of workplace physiotherapy in the fight against work-related ill health, that prevention is better than cure and that there is also an important role for physiotherapists in communities, but that these graduates will not be able to assist any of these patients to live normal and active lives because the graduates will be unemployed physiotherapists, and considers that this is unacceptable and a significant waste of public investment in the education of these graduates. Supported by: Campbell Martin*, Tommy Sheridan*, Mark Ballard*
