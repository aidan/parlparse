*S3M-2211 Dr Richard Simpson: Handcuffing of Pregnant Women—That the Parliament notes with regret that despite the statement from the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing on 1 May 2008 that handcuffing pregnant women is "absolutely unacceptable" (Official Report c. 8177), the Scottish Prison Service and the Cabinet Secretary for Justice remain adamant that this procedure can continue in exceptional circumstances, namely potential self-harm, harm to a baby or possible danger to others; regards these as medical or psychiatric conditions, and agrees that pregnant or newly delivered offenders attending hospital from custody should be treated in the same way as other non-offenders with similar risks and should be the responsibility of obstetric, paediatric or psychiatric staff and not of the Scottish Prison Service or Reliance.
