*S3M-4097 Ian McKee: Europe Day—That the Parliament is proud to mark Europe Day on 9 May 2009, the celebration of the founding of the European Community; observes that on 9 May 1950 Robert Schuman presented his proposal on the creation of an organised Europe, indispensable to the maintenance of peaceful relations, and that this proposal, known as the Schuman Declaration, is considered to be the beginning of the creation of what is now the European Union; welcomes the EU’s success in achieving and maintaining peace in the European continent as well as becoming a promoter of peace in the world; considers that Scotland has benefited greatly from EU membership on economic, social and cultural grounds; believes that Scotland’s place is at the heart of Europe; encourages the people of Scotland to join the other peoples of Europe in celebrating our common future and common values and to engage in the European democratic process by using their votes in the European Parliament elections on 4 June 2009, and calls on public institutions across Scotland to fly the flag of the European Union to mark this day.
