*S3M-2306 Sandra White: Bright Future for Scottish Shipbuildingâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the signing of contract agreements for the two new aircraft carriers securing the future of many jobs in the Rosyth and Govan shipyards and is delighted that, despite incorrect assertions that 50,000 jobs could go and the misleading claim that the report published by the Scottish Affairs Select Committee of the House of Commons warned that the sustainability of these jobs would be put under threat by constitutional change, politicians have noted that it was the workforce and the city of Glasgow which made the case for continuing to build ships on the Clyde because they convinced government that Scotland is as competitive as Poland and yards in the far east.
