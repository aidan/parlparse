*S2M-1500 Jackie Baillie: ENABLE's 50th Anniversary-That the Parliament notes that 21 June 2004 marks the beginning of Learning Disability Week; recognises the work of all organisations that are marking this week by promoting the rights of children and adults with learning disabilities across the United Kingdom and, in particular, warmly congratulates ENABLE, Scotland's leading charity for children and adults with learning disabilities, in this, its 50th anniversary year; notes that this once small, self-help organisation has grown into a major force advancing the cause of children and adults with learning disabilities in Scotland; acknowledges that, whilst much work still needs to be done to ensure that children and adults with learning disabilities achieve full social inclusion and community participation, much has been achieved, and congratulates ENABLE on its first 50 years and wishes it every success for the future.
