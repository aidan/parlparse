*S3M-4662 Bob Doris: Welcoming Town Centre Investment—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that £40 million has been allocated in the first round of grants from the Scottish Government’s Town Centre Regeneration Fund and looks forward to the much-needed improvements that this funding will bring to the 48 successful bids and the estimated 640 jobs that will be supported; praises the wide geographical spread of successful bidders and that with almost £10 million going to successful city bids, including over £5 million for Glasgow, notes that this fund is reaching out to both urban and rural town centres; notes the real need to regenerate many of our urban community centres that lie outside city centre areas, including the project at Maryhill Burgh Halls where £1.8 million will help to create a significant community hub with a garden courtyard area, café, office space, gallery, recording studio and the creation of 75 jobs by the end of 2009; notes that the second round of bids for this year is in preparation, including one from Glasgow for the town centre area at Saracen in Possilpark, and believes that this innovative funding model can create the stimulus for new jobs and local regeneration in a way that provides exceptional value for the public purse.
