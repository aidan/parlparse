*S3M-3174.3 Robert Brown: Protecting Scotland’s Communities - The Scottish Government Offender Management Plan—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3174) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from "supports" to end and insert "welcomes the publication on 17 December 2008 of Protecting Scotland’s Communities: Fair, Fast and Flexible Justice, which sets out the Scottish Government’s strategy to deliver a coherent offender management strategy built on a robust regime of community penalties and payback and proportionate management of offenders sentenced to prison; recognises that community sentences that are completed speedily and enforced with rigour offer greater benefits to communities and individuals than short prison sentences and that their planned expansion must be adequately resourced; calls on the Scottish Government to incorporate in its offender management strategy effective action to tackle the underlying causes of crime and factors and circumstances known to have a link with offending behaviour; reaffirms the importance of judicial independence free from executive direction, and looks forward to constructive engagement with the Scottish Government on the detailed implementation of the programme."
