*S3M-6508 Mary Scanlon: Congratulations to the Glenlivet Distillery—That the Parliament welcomes the official opening of the expansion of the Glenlivet Distillery by the Duke of Rothesay on 4 June 2010; congratulates all involved with this £10 million development, which will see a 75% increase in the production capacity of the distillery, including the local suppliers from Moray and Banffshire that provided many of the components inside the new building; notes that The Glenlivet was first licensed in 1824 and is the biggest exported single malt to the United States; further notes that, every year, 45,000 people visit the Glenlivet Distillery and considers that their experience will be further enhanced by this development, with the use of glass creating an opportunity to link the distillery with its rural surroundings;also considers that the enhanced visibility allows the distillery to reconnect with its origins, the site of George Smith’s original distillery at Upper Drumin, and wishes the Glenlivet Distillery continued success in the future.
