 *S3M-3473 Rob Gibson: A Questionable Future for Nuclear Safety—That the Parliament condemns the disbanding of the Nuclear Safety Advisory Committee (NuSAC), an expert advisory committee that has been offering critical advice to Britain’s Health and Safety Executive for nearly 50 years; notes that NuSAC consisted of 19 safety experts, including scientists, academics, trade unionists and business executives, none of whom were paid; further notes that the committee’s disbanding closely followed a report that it issued in July 2008 listing a number of concerns and warnings regarding nuclear decommissioning programmes, skilled staff shortages and siting criteria for new stations; expresses alarm that NuSAC was quietly scrapped in October 2008 without an immediate replacement planned at such a vital time when nuclear new build and waste issues are so high on the public agenda, and finally calls for a successor body to be set up immediately to provide independent, expert safety advice and ensure that such critical information is easily accessible and available in the public domain.
