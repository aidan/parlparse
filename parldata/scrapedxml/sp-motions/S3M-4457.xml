*S3M-4457 Ken Macintosh: Stand Up Now for Social Work—That the Parliament expresses its support for the Stand Up Now for Social Work campaign, which recognises the vital contribution of social workers to a fair and caring society, calls on government, employers and the media to promote respect for the profession and asks for balanced coverage of social work issues, including the reporting of positive images of the care provided to some of Scotland’s most vulnerable individuals, and agrees that the vast majority of social workers are to be applauded for their efforts in difficult and challenging circumstances.
