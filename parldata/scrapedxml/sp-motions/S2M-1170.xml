 *S2M-1170# Shiona Baird: Support for Scottish Renewables-That the Parliament, while commending plans for the world's first grid-connected wave power installation, notes with dismay that, though the wave farm will use cutting-edge technology developed in Scotland by an enterprising Scottish company, it will be established in Portugal rather than Scotland; expresses, therefore, its grave concern and deep regret that Scotland is already missing an opportunity to gain the commercial advantage necessary to compete in this emerging and important market, particularly in the manufacture of wave power machines, and considers that the Scottish Executive should emulate the Portuguese Government's support mechanism to guarantee that emerging renewable energy technologies, including wave power, are, as a priority, given the support that is necessary to ensure the technical development and financial security that is needed to be able to move from research and development to full-scale and rapid commercialisation in Scotland.
