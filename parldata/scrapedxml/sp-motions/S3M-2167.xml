*S3M-2167 Margo MacDonald: UK Referendum on Alternative Provisions to Treaty of Lisbon—That the Parliament congratulates the citizens of the Republic of Ireland for its principled and determined opposition to the Treaty of Lisbon; agrees with the "NO" campaign’s rejection of a centralised bureaucracy in Brussels, and, so that this may be shown to be a pan-European objection to the provisions of the Treaty of Lisbon, and not a rejection of the EU itself, calls on Her Majesty’s Government to allow UK citizens the same opportunity to take part in the democratic development of the EU by holding a referendum on any future alternative proposals to provisions in the Treaty of Lisbon. Supported by: Alex Neil*, Bill Kidd*, Nanette Milne*
