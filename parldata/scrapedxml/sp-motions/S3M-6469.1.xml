*S3M-6469.1 Nicola Sturgeon: The NHS—As an amendment to motion (S3M-6469) in the name of Jackie Baillie, leave out from "with concern" to end and insert "the real-terms increase for the NHS budget in 2010-11 despite theprevious UKadministration cutting the Scottish Government budget by £500 million; notes the commitment by the new UK coalition government to real-terms increases in the NHS budget in future years and agrees that all resultant Barnett consequentials should be applied to the NHS in Scotland;understands that, notwithstanding the above, NHS budgets are tight as a result of Labour’s economic mismanagement and that allNHS boards require to deliver services more efficiently, but welcomes the commitment that quality of patient care will be the paramount consideration, that there will be no compulsory redundancies in the NHS and that there will be more staff in the NHS at the end of this parliamentary term than there were when Labour left office in 2007."
