*S2M-3648.1 Mike Pringle: Happy Birthday Sweet 16?—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3648) in the name of Carolyn Leckie, leave out from "charitable work" to end and insert "work providing grants to families with disabled or seriously ill children up to the age of 16 for items that are not the responsibility of a statutory agency; agrees that the stresses and strains placed on families caring for a disabled or ill child do not disappear on the young person’s 16th birthday and that the loss of this grant has a severe impact on the quality of life for these children and their families, and calls for the funding of the Family Fund to be increased in proportion to needs in Scotland to allow the organisation to extend its remit to help families with children over 16, recognising that the state should be providing far more support and resources for these vulnerable families."
