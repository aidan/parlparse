 *S2M-2782 Christine Grahame: Monaghan Mushrooms—That the Parliament notes with concern that, after one year, the Scottish Executive’s Environment and Rural Affairs Department has failed to conclude its investigation into the employment of immigrant workers at Monaghan Mushrooms at Fenton Barns in East Lothian and has apparently not yet determined which agencies are employing the immigrant workers; further notes that Donegal Creameries plc, associate company of Monaghan Mushrooms, owning 23% of its shares, has asked the Irish stock exchange to temporarily suspend its shares due to "financial irregularities", and calls on the Executive to resolve the issues raised on behalf of both local and immigrant workers at Monaghan Mushrooms as a matter of urgency. Supported by: Mr Bruce McFee*, Ms Sandra White*, Rob Gibson*, Brian Adam*
