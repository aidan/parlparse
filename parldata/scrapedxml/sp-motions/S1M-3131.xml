*S1M-3131 Roseanna Cunningham: Donation to New Labour From Mr Richard Desmond-That the Parliament deplores the acceptance by New Labour of a Â£100,000 donation from porn publisher Richard Desmond; believes that it is no coincidence that this followed approval by Her Majesty's Government for Mr Desmond's controversial purchase of Express Newspapers; notes with surprise and disappointment the remarks made by John Reid that New Labour does not exercise "moral judgment" over prospective donors; believes that Mr Desmond's titles are demeaning and degrading to women; notes the academic research proving a link between pornography and violence against women, and calls on New Labour to end its relationship with Richard Desmond and return this donation.
