*S2M-5607.3 Allan Wilson: The Environment—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5607) in the name of Richard Lochhead, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the ruling by the High Court in London regarding the UK Government consultation on energy; notes that the DTI has accepted the judgement and will consult further; believes that the way ahead for energy in Scotland is to deliver on the Scottish Executive’s energy policies; further welcomes the announcement by the Executive that it has already met its 2010 target of 18% of Scotland’s electricity from renewable energy; welcomes the Executive’s support for nine marine power projects, including one set to be the world’s largest, and its commitment to the world-leading European Marine Energy Centre (EMEC) in Orkney; notes that the achievement of the Executive’s renewable energy targets has been through a mix of renewable technologies, including the major Blacklaw windfarm constructed on a former open-cast coal site generating 140MW; notes that projects for the future include the substantial Glen Doe hydro power project, world-leading offshore wind development and significant biomass energy schemes, and believes that Scotland can achieve its future renewables targets if it is supported with determination and consistency by the Executive."
