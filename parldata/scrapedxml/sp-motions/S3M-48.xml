*S3M-48 Kenneth Gibson: Scottish Parliament Elections—That the Parliament notes the continued apathy with which a large segment of the population views elections to the Scottish Parliament and local government; believes that the plethora of electorally insignificant parties and campaign literature freely delivered by Royal Mail contributes to confusion and voter fatigue, and calls on the Scottish Executive to hold discussions with Her Majesty’s Government with a view to increasing the number of members a party must have in order to stand in elections from three to 100, ensuring that new political parties register a year or more before polling day, abolishing free delivery of election communications by Royal Mail, and introducing a deposit for each candidate standing on the regional list.
