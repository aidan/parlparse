*S2M-3684.4 Miss Annabel Goldie: Future Arrangements for Health Services in the Argyll and Clyde Area—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3684) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from first “supports” to end and insert “applauds the efforts of all clinicians and staff in NHS Argyll and Clyde, at this unsettling time, to maintain the delivery of services; expresses profound concern about the inadequate nature of the consultation process concerning the future of NHS Argyll and Clyde; believes that the consultation paper lacked both a clear analysis of the structural and financial problems facing the existing NHS board and any robust information about the implications of revised NHS board areas for acute hospital services, which the public needs to make informed choices about the options presented, and therefore calls for the necessary analysis and information to be provided for the public as a matter of urgency and for the consultation to be reopened, in order that informed decisions can be made.” Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
