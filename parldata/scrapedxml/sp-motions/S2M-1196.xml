*S2M-1196 Colin Fox: Amnesty for Poll Tax Debts-That the Parliament condemns the local authorities that have recently issued bills for poll tax debts from 14 years ago; notes that poll tax debts have long been written off as unrecoverable in England and Wales due to the statute of limitation on debt recovery after 10 years; recalls that the poll tax was introduced in Scotland one year before England and Wales, and calls on the Scottish Executive to direct local authorities to write off poll tax debts in Scotland in line with the rest of the United Kingdom.
