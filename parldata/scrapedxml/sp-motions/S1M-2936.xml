 *S1M-2936 Kay Ullrich: Dungavel Detention Centre—That the Parliament notes with concern reports on the conditions in which asylum seekers are being held at the Dungavel Detention Centre, including references made to a lack of privacy and freedom of movement, effectively creating a prison environment for the people, including young children, who are guilty of no offence; further notes with concern the reported suicide attempt at Dungavel of the Nigerian asylum seeker, Mr Dotun Adeosun, and calls on the Scottish Executive to liase with the Home Office and to encourage Her Majesty’s Government to accede to requests by human rights groups, such as the Friends of Refugees in Ayrshire, to have wider access to visit and meet asylum seekers at the centre and to provide them with support and to inspect the conditions in which detainees there are held.
