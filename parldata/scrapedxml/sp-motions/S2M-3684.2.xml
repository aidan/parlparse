*S2M-3684.2 Shona Robison: Future Arrangements for Health Services in the Argyll and Clyde Area—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3684) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from first “supports” to end and insert “regrets the failure of the Scottish Executive to direct effectively the management of Argyll and Clyde NHS Board prior to its reorganisation of December 2002 and the continuing lack of direction and support that resulted in the Executive’s decision to dissolve the board two years and five months later in May 2005 and to redraw the boundaries of the neighbouring boards to take over its responsibilities from April 2006; applauds the continued successful efforts of staff in NHS Argyll and Clyde during these difficult times to maintain comprehensive healthcare services for the people of the area; demands clear evidence that input from the public consultation on the boundary option to be adopted has been fully and objectively considered; supports NHS Highland and NHS Greater Glasgow in their task of returning services to financial balance while maintaining high standards of quality and access, and demands that the Executive provides these boards with adequate support and more effective leadership and direction that will assist them to address credibly the structural and financial problems in NHS Argyll and Clyde.”
