*S3M-2790 Bill Wilson: GDP’s Inadequacy as a Measure of Sustainable Economic Growth—That the Parliament notes and welcomes the Beyond Growth supplement in the 18 October 2008 edition of New Scientist magazine, which highlights the potential problems, both statistical and ecological, associated with using gross domestic product (GDP) as the major means of measuring sustainable economic growth; welcomes the Scottish Government’s overall purpose to focus government and public services on creating a more successful country, with opportunities for all of Scotland to flourish, through increasing sustainable economic growth and its adoption of various national outcomes, indicators of progress and targets, of which the great majority do not relate to GDP; acknowledges that the previous administration was committed to reviewing the options for additional and improved ways of measuring progress, as set out in Choosing our future, Scotland’s sustainable development strategy, and urges the Scottish Government to continue this work and broaden its methods of measuring economic progress.
