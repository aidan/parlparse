 *S3M-5636# Ian McKee: Family Nurse Partnership Programme in Lothian—That the Parliament congratulates NHS Lothian on being selected by the Scottish Government as a test site, fully funded for three years, for a Family Nurse Partnership programme, an intensive preventive programme for vulnerable first-time young parents that has a 30-year evidence base showing the potential for improvements in women’s ante-natal health, reductions in children’s injuries, greater intervals between births, increases in fathers’ involvement, increases in employment and earnings, reductions in the need for benefits, improvements in school readiness, reduced arrests and criminal behaviour in 15-year-olds and mothers and that eventually produces savings five times the amount of an initial investment; realises that one measure alone is not the entire answer to challenges in this field but a welcome start, and wishes the project every success. Supported by: Sandra White*, Aileen Campbell*, Alasdair Allan*, Kenneth Gibson*, Bill Kidd*, Angela Constance*, Elaine Smith*, Malcolm Chisholm*
