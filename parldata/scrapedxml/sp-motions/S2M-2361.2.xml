 * S2M-2361.2 Shiona Baird: The Economy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2361) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from “recognises” to end and insert “rejects the notion that Scotland’s independent economic future depends on oil; recognises that an economy founded on fossil-fuel use contributes to climate change and other environmental damage, which in turn threatens Scotland’s economic future; recognises that oil is a finite resource which future generations will not be able to depend on for economic security; further recognises that oil is valuable as a chemical resource which should be increasingly conserved for non-fuel uses; believes that building Scotland’s economy on a foundation of renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency and sustainable transport is the way to achieve real sustainability, and calls on the Scottish Executive to give priority to exploring the concept of a “just transition” policy, as advocated by Scottish trade unions, which sets out a path to transform polluting industries into sustainable enterprises.” Supported by: Mr Mark Ruskell*, Mark Ballard*
