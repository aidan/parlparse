*S2M-1150 Michael Matheson: Respite Care for Young Disabled Persons in Forth Valley-That the Parliament recognises the significant role played by Headway and the Princess Royal Trust for Carers in providing much needed assistance and support to the families of young disabled persons; notes the lack of young persons in patient rehabilitation beds within the Forth Valley area, and calls upon NHS Forth Valley to put in place a strategy to provide more dedicated services for young disabled persons, in particular for respite breaks and in-patient rehabilitation.
