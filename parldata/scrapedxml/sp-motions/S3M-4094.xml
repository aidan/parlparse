*S3M-4094 Liam McArthur: Geographical Confusion at Museums Galleries Scotland—That the Parliament notes with surprise that the spring 2009 edition of Scotland’s Museums and Galleries Quarterly, published by Museums Galleries Scotland, which rightly celebrates the opening of the Caithness Horizons museum, describes the museum as being in the "most northerly town in the UK"; is concerned that an organisation that describes itself as the "lead body for the advocacy, funding and development of over 340 museums and galleries in Scotland" should have such a flawed knowledge of the United Kingdom’s geography, and considers that, if this is indeed the geographical view of Scotland’s museums, then the ownership of the great wealth of antiquities from Orkney and Shetland currently held by the National Museum of Scotland should be transferred to the museums in Orkney and Shetland with those museums deciding which artefacts to lend to Edinburgh, rather than the other way round, as at present.
