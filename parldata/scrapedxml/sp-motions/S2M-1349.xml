*S2M-1349 Bruce Crawford: Fife's Nursery Nurses-That the Parliament notes the overwhelming rejection by Fife's nursery nurses of the final pay offer by the Labour-led Fife Council and considers that the council should seek agreement from UNISON to take the claim to ACAS with the objective of reaching an agreement as close to the East Dunbartonshire Council settlement as possible, while allowing Fife's nursery nurses to return to work and continue to deliver educational and developmental opportunities to Fife's three and four-year-olds and prepare them for success in school and life.
