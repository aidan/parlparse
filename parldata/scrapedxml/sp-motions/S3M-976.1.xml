 *S3M-976.1 Patrick Harvie: A New Agenda for Scotlandâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-976) in the name of Ms Wendy Alexander, leave out from "continue to secure the position" to end, and insert "serve the best interests of the Scottish people", and further believes that the commission should consider the widest range of constitutional options available including the status quo, further devolution of powers and independence, and suggest ways to ensure that the Scottish people have the final say over major constitutional changes, including exploration of the use of a "preferendum", which would allow Scottish voters to rank their preferred constitutional options."
