 *S3M-6769 Kenneth Gibson: Date of 2015 Scottish Parliament Election—That the Parliament is opposed to the UK Government’s plans to hold the 2015 Westminster election on the same day as the already planned Scottish Parliament election; believes that the date of 7 May 2015 was chosen by the UK Government without the Scottish Parliament or other devolved administrations being given a second thought; considers this issue a blatant disregard of the supposed respect agenda that goes against the Scottish Parliament’s own view that two distinct elections should not be held on the same day; believes that Secretary of State for Scotland Michael Moore MP’s offer to bring the 2015 election forward six months to dark, cold and probably rain-swept November is patronising at best, and believes that the 2015 Scottish Parliament election date should stand and that the UK Government should pick another date for its election.
