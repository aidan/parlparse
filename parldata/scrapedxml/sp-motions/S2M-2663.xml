 * S2M-2663 Mr Mark Ruskell: Penalisation of Cyclingâ€”That the Parliament condemns the decision by NHS Tayside to introduce cycle parking charges for staff members commuting from Fife and the wider Dundee area to Ninewells Hospital; notes that the cost of construction and maintenance of an individual car parking space is far in excess of the cost of a secure cycle parking space, and believes that the development of a vibrant cycle culture in Scotland that is capable of improving both public health and the environment requires giving incentives to cycle commuting, not penalising it.
