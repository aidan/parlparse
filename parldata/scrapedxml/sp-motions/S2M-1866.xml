 S2M-1866# Ms Sandra White: Knife Crime in Glasgowâ€”That the Parliament believes that the spiralling growth of violent knife crime in Glasgow and the west of Scotland, affecting 7,500 people in the last year, has now reached epidemic proportions; considers that treatment of knife injuries necessitates the use of high levels of resources in our overstretched health service and that, if knife crime were a publicly notifiable disease, the Scottish Executive would have instigated a public inquiry into its causes, and therefore believes that an investigation into knife crime should be instigated as a matter of urgency, that there should be an increase in beat police officers and that sanctions should be increased against those who commit such crimes.
