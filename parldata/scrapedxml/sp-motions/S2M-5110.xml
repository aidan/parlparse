*S2M-5110 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Lack of Democracy—That the Parliament condemns the situation whereby Members’ Bills face undemocratic barriers to their passage through the parliamentary system; notes with concern that more and more stringent measures are being put in place with regard to Members’ Bills thus weakening the basic democracy of the Parliament; recognises that the production of a Member’s Bill involves a considerable amount of time and public money including the cost of both parliamentary and party staff, and calls for an immediate review of the way in which Members’ Bills are supported through the parliamentary system including a review of the Standing Orders of the Parliament with regard to Members’ Bills and their progress through the Parliament.
