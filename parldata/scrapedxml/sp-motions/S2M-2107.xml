*S2M-2107# Frances Curran: Iraq War Reparations—That the Parliament notes that, in the last decade, the Iraqi people have been the victims of the brutal dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, have had UN sanctions imposed on them which claimed the lives of half a million people and have paid $18.8 billion to multi-national companies who claimed compensation for Saddam Hussein’s 1990 invasion of Kuwait; believes that the rewarding of claims for lost profits to multi-national companies, including $190,000 to Toys R Us, $18 million to Halliburton, $2.3 million to Mobil, $1.6 million to Shell and $505 million to Texaco by the United Nations, while Iraqi children starved, was obscene; further notes that, since the fall of Saddam Hussein, the impoverished people of Iraq have paid out $69.8 million to companies from their US and UK occupiers, while their own infrastructure is crumbling, and considers that these reparation payments should cease immediately.
