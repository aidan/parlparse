 *S2M-2677 Chris Ballance: Development Aid for Oil—That the Parliament notes that developing countries with economies dependent on oil extraction display poor developmental outcomes; further notes that oil contributes to climate change which could undo decades of development efforts; is concerned that the Department for International Development (DFID) supports multilateral development aid for oil extraction in developing countries through multilateral development banks and fails to assess the impact on the poor of DFID bilateral aid for the oil industry in these countries; believes that this impedes the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals and is inconsistent with UK Government policy on climate change; calls on the UK Government to phase out all bilateral and multilateral development aid for the oil industry and to assess rigorously the poverty alleviation and sustainable development impacts of overseas development aid for the oil industry until a phase-out is implemented, and further calls on the DFID to assist the UK Government’s goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions worldwide by proactively supporting sustainable renewable energy strategies through overseas development aid.
