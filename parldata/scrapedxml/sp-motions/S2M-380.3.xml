*S2M-380.3 Hugh Henry: Public Confidence in the Criminal Justice System—As an amendment to motion (S2M-380) in the name of Miss Annabel Goldie, leave out from "believes" to end and insert "welcomes the Scottish Executive’s decision to establish a judicially-led Sentencing Commission and the commitment to introduce legislation to modernise the operation of the High Court; recognises that the Scottish Executive will act on the McInnes Review and will bring forward further proposals for court reform; notes the measures being introduced that will give more support to victims and witnesses in the criminal justice system, and believes that the record number of police officers in Scotland, the substantial increase in civilian staff and the moves to release police officers for front-line duties will enhance delivery of police services in local communities."
