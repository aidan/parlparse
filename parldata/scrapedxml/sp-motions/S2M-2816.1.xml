 * S2M-2816.1 Jeremy Purvis: Borders Railway Commitment—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2816) in the name of Christine Grahame, leave out from first “which” to end and insert “welcomes the commitment of the Scottish Executive, made by the Minister for Transport on 14 March 2005, to support the construction of the Borders railway with a financial commitment of £115 million at 2002 prices, with current uprated inflation commitment of £131 million, 85% of the costs of the project; welcomes the agreed policies of the three local authorities to fund the remaining 15%, predominantly through developer contributions; further welcomes the announcement by the Executive of funding to redevelop Waverley Station; notes the concern of those supporting a Borders railway that any MSP would wish to be vainglorious by constantly attacking those preparing and funding the project and those that will be delivering the project; observes that such attacks are now as regular as the Tweedbank to Waverley services that will operate on the Borders Railway, and therefore understands why the independent leader of Scottish Borders Council believes that the current convener of the Cross-Party Group on Borders Rail is harming the project and that she should stand down.” Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
