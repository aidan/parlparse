 *S3M-6246 Robin Harper: Restrictions on Access to Books for Schools—That the Parliament urges the Scottish Government to review the present arrangements for the centralised procurement of books for school libraries on the grounds that it is considered that the arrangements will be to the severe disadvantage of small suppliers across Scotland, will restrict the range of books available, will in effect restrict the ability of schools to inspire and challenge Scotland’s young people through reading and exploring new ideas and the full range of writing that should be available to them and will diminish and restrict the freedom of thought and action of teachers and librarians across the country in a fashion not acceptable to a free society.
