 *S3M-329 Cathy Jamieson: "Trying Childhoods" Exhibition—That the Parliament commends the "Trying Childhoods" exhibition which features the artwork of 80 Scottish young people who live in households affected by alcohol and drug misuse; congratulates the Centre for Drug Misuse Research at the University of Glasgow, Glasgow School of Art, art therapist Liz Mitchell and illustrator and animator Jana Prchalova for their commitment to the young people involved; recognises the contribution that art therapy has made in giving the young people the opportunity to express themselves creatively in a safe, supportive environment; notes that an estimated 50,000 children in Scotland have a parent with a drug problem, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take forward all recommendations in Hidden Harm: Next Steps - Supporting Children - Working with Parents and ensure that the necessary resources are in place to provide support to children in drug misusing households as part of a wider strategy to tackle drug misuse in Scotland.
