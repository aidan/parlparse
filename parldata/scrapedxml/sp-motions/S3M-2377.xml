*S3M-2377 Bashir Ahmad: RNIB Tackling Ethnic Minority Sight Lossâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the work of RNIB and, in particular, its newly launched project to tackle sight loss among the ethnic minority community; recognises that people of South Asian origin are six times more likely than Caucasians to develop type 2 diabetes, which may lead to retinopathy and eventual sight loss; notes that diseases such as glaucoma are three times more prevalent among people of Afro-Caribbean and Chinese descent; believes that language can often be a barrier, as well as a lack of knowledge, to services that are available to help; applauds RNIB for taking the challenge head on, and is committed to working with RNIB to make our health service as accessible as possible to all, regardless of ethnicity.
