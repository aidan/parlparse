 *S3M-5523 Rob Gibson: Big Green Winners—That the Parliament congratulates the community group on the Isle of Eigg as one of the three winners of the Big Green Challenge, a lucrative competition created to encourage community-led carbon emission reductions; praises the Isle of Eigg team for slashing its CO2 emissions by an impressive 32% in the last year alone, making a significant impact on Scotland’s 2020 emissions reduction target of 42%; notes that the team will receive £300,000 from NESTA to continue these efforts to reduce carbon emissions, and wishes members of the team all the best in also helping other communities to learn from their experience.
