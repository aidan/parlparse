*S3M-1773 Mike Rumbles: Support for Scotland’s Pig Farmers—That the Parliament regrets the serious financial pressures faced by Scottish pig producers; notes the French Government’s aid scheme for pig farmers in financial difficulty; further notes that European Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development, Mariann Fischer Boel, has declared the French aid scheme valid under the "de minimis rule" and has given assurances that this financial aid will not place pig producers in other EU countries at a competitive disadvantage; considers that the Scottish Government must act quickly to use every lever available to it to support Scotland’s beleaguered pig industry, and calls on the Scottish Government to take note of the French example and use its short-life taskforce to examine every possible direct and indirect measure that can be used to assist struggling pig farmers, including a soft loans scheme, tackling Nitrate Vulnerable Zone regulation costs, providing greater scope for local procurement, an audit of retailer purchase and labelling of meat imported from abroad, vaccination measures and the introduction of a new on-goers scheme. Supported by: Jim Hume*, Jamie Stone*, Mike Pringle*, Tavish Scott*
