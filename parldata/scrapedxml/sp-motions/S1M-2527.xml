*S1M-2527 Tommy Sheridan: Sentencing for Breach of the Peace at Faslane Blockade—That the Parliament condemns the disgraceful three month prison sentence handed down to Jenny Gaiawyn on 29 November 2001 by Sheriff Morag Galbraith for a breach of the peace at the blockade in February 2001 of the Faslane nuclear base; considers this sentence to be an outrageous attack on this young woman’s human right to protest peacefully, which is a fundamental human right enshrined in the European Convention on Human Rights and as such should be upheld in law; further considers the sentence to be a scandalous reflection of the arbitrariness of the Scottish legal system, and calls on the Minister for Justice to set up an inquiry into the inconsistencies of sentencing in the courts, which have seen people acquitted, fined or even sentenced to a prison term for the same "crime" of breach of the peace.
