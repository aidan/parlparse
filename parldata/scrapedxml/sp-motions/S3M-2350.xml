 *S3M-2350 Sandra White: Medical Aid to Palestineâ€”That the Parliament commends and supports the efforts of Linda Willis and Khalil Al Niss to deliver personally much needed medical supplies and equipment into the Gaza Strip on behalf of the people of Scotland by driving from Edinburgh to Palestine; notes that since arriving in Egypt, the Egyptian authorities have demanded a letter from the Scottish Parliament to prove that the medicines have been donated by the Scottish people, and hopes that the authorities will allow Linda and Khalil safe passage without further delay.
