*S3M-6494 Trish Godman: National Thrombosis Week 2010—That the Parliament supports National Thrombosis Week 2010, taking place between 1 and 5 June; congratulates Lifeblood: The Thrombosis Charity for campaigning to increase awareness of thrombosis, especially in the week when the charity will be visiting five UK cities, including Glasgow, in five days, educating both students and the public; is aware of the risk to hospital inpatients of contracting deep vein thrombosis; recognises that, according to a recent Lifeblood report, more than 20% of NHS boards have no policy in place to prevent hospital-acquired thrombosis and more than 25% of NHS boards do not provide formal education to their staff about assessing a patient’s risk of developing the condition, and believes that the Scottish Government should follow the example set in England by mandating thrombosis prevention by putting in place outcome-focussed targets for the risk assessment of all hospital inpatients so as to effectively reduce the rates of death and suffering in hospital from this preventable condition. Supported by: Dr Richard Simpson*, Rhona Brankin*, Cathie Craigie*, Johann Lamont*, Patricia Ferguson*, Ms Wendy Alexander*, Margaret Curran*, Mary Scanlon*, Hugh Henry*, Elaine Murray*, Marlyn Glen*, Ross Finnie*, Mike Pringle*, Bill Butler* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
