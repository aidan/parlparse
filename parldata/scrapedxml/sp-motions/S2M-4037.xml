 *S2M-4037 Des McNulty: Action Mesothelioma—That the Parliament congratulates Clydebank Asbestos Group on organising a highly successful International Asbestos Conference in Clydebank Town Hall on 27 February 2006, attended by the South African High Commissioner, international experts and representatives from across the United Kingdom; further notes that the conference launched the British Lung Foundation’s new mesothelioma charter which demands that mesothelioma patients and families have a right to good-quality information and support from healthcare professionals, welfare benefits organisations and solicitors and calls for faster diagnosis, better treatment and care services, more funding for research and measures to prevent future asbestos exposure; welcomes the first Action Mesothelioma Day on 27 February 2006 and the start of a year-long campaign, led by the British Lung Foundation, which aims to raise awareness of mesothelioma; further notes that mesothelioma kills 2,000 people every year and that this figure is expected to grow to over 2,500 a year by 2015, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make support for mesothelioma sufferers a priority, encourage additional research into mesothelioma and ensure the rigorous enforcement of existing health and safety regulations on asbestos.
