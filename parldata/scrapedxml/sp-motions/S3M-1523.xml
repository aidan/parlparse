*S3M-1523 Michael Matheson: The Plight of Burma’s Children—That the Parliament notes with great concern a recent report in The Irrawaddy News on the poor treatment of Burmese detainees, many of them children, in Mae Sot, Thailand; recognises the plight of millions of Burmese children, who have long been subjected to starvation and maltreatment by the country’s cruel military dictatorship; laments the misfortune of those children who have attempted to escape this miserable life only to end up in situations like those described in the report, and in accord with the 1989 UN Convention on the Rights of the Child affirms the right of every child to have his or her basic needs fulfilled.
