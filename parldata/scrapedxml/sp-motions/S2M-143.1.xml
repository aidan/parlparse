 *S2M-143.1 Robin Harper: The Landfill (Scotland) Amendment Regulations 2003â€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-143) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end "but, in so doing, recognises the regrettable situation that, at present, and for the foreseeable future, landfilling remains the waste management option of choice for virtually all local authorities; laments the fact that several community recycling projects are facing financial ruin owing to the failure of promised public funding; acknowledges that current recycling targets are wholly inadequate given the potential for recycling, and requests that the Scottish Executive formally adopts the concept of "zero waste"."
