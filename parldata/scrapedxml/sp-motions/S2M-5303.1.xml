*S2M-5303.1 Mr Ted Brocklebank: Fisheriesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-5303) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "an outcome" to end and insert "urges the Minister for Environment and Rural Development to resist all attempts to reduce nephrops and cod quotas and to press for increased haddock and monkfish quotas to secure a sustainable future for our remaining fishermen and particularly for the beleaguered processing sector and for the coastal communities dependent on fish, but ultimately believes that the only solution for Scottish fishing is to bring back control and management of the industry to Scotland."
