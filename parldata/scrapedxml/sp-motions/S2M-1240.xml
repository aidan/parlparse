*S2M-1240 Chris Ballance: Chinese Army Invite to Military Tattoo-That the Parliament deplores the invitation to the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) to attend the Edinburgh Military Tattoo in view of continuing human rights abuses carried out by the Chinese Government, especially in Tibet, and calls on the organisers of the Edinburgh Military Tattoo to retract, as a matter of urgency, the invitation to the band from the PLA to perform given that the invitation will be interpreted as proof that the Scottish people do not care about, or take notice of, the continued repression of the Tibetan and the Chinese people by the PLA at the instigation of the Chinese authorities.
