*S3M-642 Patrick Harvie: Nobel Peace Prize—That the Parliament congratulates the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Al Gore for the work they have done to increase global understanding of climate change and to promote an urgent political response; welcomes the decision by the Norwegian Nobel Committee to award the Nobel Peace Prize jointly to the IPCC and Mr Gore; recognises that climate change poses an immediate and urgent threat to billions of human beings, to the earth’s biodiversity and to the world economy; commits to redoubling the effort in Scotland on reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and recognises that this will not happen by targets alone but by fundamental and lasting change in the values of our society, the operation of our economy and the nature of our politics.
