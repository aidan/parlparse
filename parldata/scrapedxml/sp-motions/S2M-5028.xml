*S2M-5028# Mrs Mary Mulligan: What Is Your Idea of Happiness?â€”That the Parliament congratulates the young people from the Chill Out Zone in Bathgate and the older people from Whitdale residential home in Whitburn for coming together to produce the DVD, "What is your idea of happiness?", which showed that, while there are many years difference in their ages, young and old share many of the same hopes and dreams and love of music and hopes that experiences such as this will bring about a greater understanding of those of a different age.
