 *S3M-3524 Gil Paterson: King Robert the Bruce’s Palace—That the Parliament hails the finding of remains indicated to have been King Robert the Bruce’s palace, lost for more than 700 years, beneath the Pillanflatt in Renton; notes that Robert the Bruce is known to have lived in Renton from 1326 until his death in 1329 but before this finding archaeologists and citizens were only able to guess where the king’s house was; highlights that the buildings on the Pillanflatt, meaning "pavilion of the great hero", are said to stretch from Dalquhurn to Dalreoch and are believed to include the king’s manor house, which had a grand hall of 100 feet, a queen’s quarter and a chapel; recognises the importance that this finding holds for Scottish heritage, and calls on Scottish citizens to embrace this discovery that has so remarkably advanced the transparency of their history, particularly during the year of Homecoming Scotland 2009.
