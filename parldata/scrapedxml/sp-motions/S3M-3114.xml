 *S3M-3114 Keith Brown: UK Pensions Blunder—That the Parliament expresses the gravest concern that pensioners retired from the armed forces, the NHS and other public service occupations have been overpaid by the UK Government’s private contractor and will now face a cut in their annual incomes; considers that this comes at the worst possible time, with the UK economy facing difficult times and low interest rates affecting pensioner savings; also considers unacceptable, if true, the unconfirmed reports of repayment notices having been sent to those who have been overpaid, and calls on the UK Government to make a categorical commitment that no repayment of these mistakenly overpaid sums will be demanded from hard-pressed pensioners for whom a UK-wide total of up to £100 million would right now be a bill too far.
