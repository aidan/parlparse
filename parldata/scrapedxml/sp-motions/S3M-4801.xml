 *S3M-4801 Pauline McNeill: Glasgow School of Art Selects Architects—That the Parliament congratulates the Glasgow School of Art on its selection of architects to design and deliver the new building on the site opposite its iconic Mackintosh Building; notes that an extensive international competition that involved over 150 submissions has led to the appointment of Steven Holl Architects, New York, and JM Architects, Glasgow, and believes that the collaboration will create a world-class building for the school, providing an inspiring environment for students and staff that will enhance the international reputation of the School, Garnethill and the city of Glasgow.
