*S1M-890.1 David McLetchie: Mike Tysonâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-890) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from first "notes" to end and insert "regrets the determination of the SNP to promote an agenda designed to wreck rather than address the issues for which the Parliament is responsible; recognises and supports the current constitutional settlement, which was endorsed by a referendum of the Scottish people and which leaves immigration policy in the hands of the Home Secretary, and accordingly notes that the Home Secretary is the proper person to take the decision on whether Mike Tyson should be allowed into this country." Supported by: Lord James Douglas-Hamilton*
