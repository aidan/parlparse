*S1M-1760 Ross Finnie: Fisheries—That the Parliament welcomes the record £27 million package for the fishing industry announced by the Deputy Minister for Rural Development on 8 March 2001; notes that the joint objective of the Executive and the industry is the conservation of fish stocks and a sustainable long-term future for the fishing industry; further notes that best scientific advice is that these objectives are most effectively achieved through a targeted decommissioning scheme and immediate technical conservation measures; welcomes further research into these practical measures intended to reduce the number of discards and protect stocks of fish, and welcomes the fact that the Executive, taking into account the view expressed by the Parliament on 8 March 2001, is engaged in continuing discussion with the fishing industry to explore a degree of re-balancing of the £27 million package of measures to address the short term needs of the industry by extending that research programme.
