*S3M-70 Helen Eadie: European Mobile Phone Charges—That the Parliament applauds the proposals to cut mobile phone charges, known as "roaming" charges, for travellers within the European Union to be put to the European Commission and the 27 EU member states; notes that the changes will result in reductions in charges of as much as 75%, affecting 150 million people across Europe; warmly welcomes the announcement that the cost of making calls is to be capped at 33p a minute in year one and at 31p in year two, with further reductions in year three and that the cost of receiving calls will similarly be reduced; believes that this will support both business and tourist travellers, and hopes that this decision will demonstrate the value and real difference that European Parliamentarians and politicians of other member states can achieve when they act collectively to bring a major impact to people locally.
