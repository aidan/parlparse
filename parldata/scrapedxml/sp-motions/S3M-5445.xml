*S3M-5445 Bill Kidd: Bankrupt Britain Goes for Bombsâ€”That the Parliament expresses concern that, despite financial penury and cuts in services, the UK Government has submitted a planning application to build a new enriched uranium facility at Aldermaston that will be used to manufacture uranium components for nuclear warheads and considers that this represents a profligate waste of public money on weapons of mass destruction at a time of worry over nuclear proliferation in other parts of the world.
