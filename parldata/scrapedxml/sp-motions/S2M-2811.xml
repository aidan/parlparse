 * S2M-2811# David McLetchie:Restriction of Primary School Intakes in Edinburgh—That the Parliament deplores the decision of the Labour administration of the City of Edinburgh Council to use the provisions of section 44(4) of the Standards in Scotland’s Schools etc. (Scotland) Act 2000 to limit primary one intakes in six schools in Edinburgh, namely Murrayburn, Trinity, Hermitage Park, the Royal High, Preston Street and St. Mary’s Leith, to allow the local authority to reduce teacher numbers and costs in future years; notes that this was not the stated intention of the Scottish Executive when the Bill was considered by the Education, Culture and Sport Committee, at which time the Minister indicated that the measure was intended to allow local authorities to maintain statutory class-size limits and avoid increases in the number of teachers or classes in future years; condemns the council’s introduction of this measure without consultation with parents, and notes that it will lead to an increase in the number of composite classes and an unnecessary restriction on parental choice.
