*S3M-3672 Bob Doris: Working in Partnership to Improve Hospital Hygiene—That the Parliament welcomes the contribution of two recent initiatives by the Scottish Government to help improve the cleanliness of hospitals in Scotland; believes that government spending of £400,000 on 250 steam cleaners for NHS boards across Scotland, with 61 steam cleaning kits to be provided in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area alone at a cost of £98,000, will allow specialised cleaning to prevent Clostridium difficile and contribute towards reducing infection rates; further welcomes the announcement by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, Nicola Sturgeon MSP, of new random hygiene inspections, which will see all acute hospitals receive one planned and one unannounced inspection in the next three years as part of the new Care Environment Inspectorate regime, and hopes that the new inspectorate will complement NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde’s Cleaning Services and Peer Public Involvement Programme, which trains volunteers to cleaning standards in its hospitals and health centres.
