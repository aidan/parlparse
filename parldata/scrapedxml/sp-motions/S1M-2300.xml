*S1M-2300# Bruce Crawford: Rosyth - Zeebrugge Ferry Serviceâ€”That the Parliament notes that the process to secure appropriate funding, including a freight facilities grant, to support a direct ferry service between Rosyth and Zeebrugge is at a crucial and sensitive stage; believes that the introduction of this service is even more vital because of the expected downturn in the Scottish economy in terms of both trade and travel impacts, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive as a matter of urgency should use all the resources and persuasive powers at its disposal to see this project through to a positive conclusion.
