*S3M-2668♦ George Foulkes: School Meals—That the Parliament recognises the need to examine the current school meals crisis in Edinburgh and across the country as a result of severely cash-strapped local authorities; questions the SNP government’s success in fulfilling its ambitions, set out in the historic concordat and single outcome agreements, to tackle childhood obesity and promote healthy eating at a time when school kitchens are closing and hot healthy school meals are being replaced with imported, pre-packed, often processed food; feels that these actions undermine the good reputation that the Parliament has achieved in securing free healthy school meals and promoting healthy living through initiatives like Hungry for Success, and further recognises the need to give every child the best possible start in life. Supported by: Sarah Boyack*, James Kelly*, Dr Richard Simpson*, Marlyn Glen*
