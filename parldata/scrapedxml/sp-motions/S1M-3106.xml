 *S1M-3106 Malcolm Chisholm: Investment and Reform in Health and Community Care—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive’s commitment to sustained investment in health; agrees that investment must be accompanied by reform that is focused on the needs and expectations of patients and service users; acknowledges the progress that has already been made by the National Waiting Times Unit and looks forward to further improvements; supports a collaborative approach to reform which involves patients, staff and the wider public; welcomes the priority attached to dealing with delayed discharge and hospital-acquired infection, and believes that improving health and tackling health inequalities in both urban and rural Scotland should be central features of the reform agenda. Supported by: Mrs Mary Mulligan*, Mr Frank McAveety*
