*S3M-4519 Margaret Mitchell: Carers Scotland’s General Practice Resource Pack—That the Parliament welcomes and supports Carers Scotland’s general practice resource pack, which is intended to provide a selection of tools and resources to help general practices identify and support carers; notes that the resource pack and notice board were developed because carers and research have identified the critical role that primary health care and, in particular, general practice plays in identifying and supporting carers, and recognises that there are 660,000 carers in Scotland who save the Scottish economy approximately £7.6 billion each year and do so at a great personal sacrifice, with carers being a third more likely to be in poor health than non-carers.
