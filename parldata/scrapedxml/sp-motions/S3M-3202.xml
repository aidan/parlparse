*S3M-3202 Nigel Don: Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs Office Closures—That the Parliament notes with concern the intention of Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to close its Peterhead office and to reduce the number of staff in its Aberdeen office; considers that the closure of the Peterhead office and the reduction of service in Aberdeen can only be of detriment to the public; further considers that this will lead to job losses at a time of economic difficulty and will do nothing to assist the local economy of the north east; also considers that Scotland is disproportionately affected by these closures, and calls on the UK Government to reconsider its approach immediately.
