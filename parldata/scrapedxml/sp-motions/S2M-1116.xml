*S2M-1116 Murdo Fraser: The Effect of Strip Stamps on the Whisky Industry-That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive's commitment to the Scotch Whisky industry as set out in A Toast to the Future - working together for Scotch whisky, particularly the Executive's commitment to a fair tax regime for the industry; notes with disappointment the announcement by Her Majesty's Government in the 2004 Budget of the introduction of tax stamps on whisky and other spirits; recognises that the compliance costs associated with the measure will introduce a heavy burden on the Scotch whisky industry, thereby adversely affecting both it and the wider Scottish economy; believes that the £3 million compensation package announced by HM Treasury is wholly inadequate, given the estimated cost to the industry of some £60 to £70 million per annum, and accordingly calls on Her Majesty's Government to reverse the decision to impose tax stamps and, failing this, to ensure that a properly-funded and comprehensive package of measures is put in place to minimise the damage caused to the industry.
