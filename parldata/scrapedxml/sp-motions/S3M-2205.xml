 *S3M-2205 George Foulkes: Protect our Nurseries—That the Parliament is aware of the City of Edinburgh Council’s plans to reorganise nursery care provision in the Craigmillar area; notes the overwhelming opposition from parents and staff affected by the plans; agrees that the reorganisation of nursery care in the Craigmillar area will have a devastating effect on local provision and mean a huge reduction in the number of nursery places available as well as the loss of dedicated nursery facilities, resources and staff; further agrees that the lack of consultation and information given to parents and staff is totally unacceptable; is aware that an emergency public meeting will be taking place on Thursday 19 June at 7pm at Craigmillar Settlement, 63 Niddrie Mains Terrace, Edinburgh; urges all members concerned to attend and join local parents in opposing the changes being introduced and demand a full and open discussion on these proposals, and views this latest cut as yet another consequence of a flawed SNP government budget and Concordat with local government. Supported by: Andy Kerr*, John Park*, Helen Eadie*, Cathy Jamieson*, David Stewart*, Jackie Baillie*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Elaine Smith*
