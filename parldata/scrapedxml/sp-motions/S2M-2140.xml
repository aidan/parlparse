*S2M-2140 Mike Pringle: Continued Arms Embargo Against China—That the Parliament congratulates the European Union (EU) on its decision not to lift its arms embargo against China; is disappointed that both Germany and France had called for the embargo to be lifted; notes that the continued embargo is a recognition by the EU of the lack of progress on human rights in China since the brutal massacre of unarmed civilians in Tiananmen Square in 1989, and calls on the UK Government to resist any further attempts within the EU to lift the embargo.
