*S2M-755 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Pregnant and Productive: An Investigation into Pregnancy Discriminationâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the first ever investigation into pregnancy discrimination which has been launched by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC); notes with concern that the EOC helpline receives more calls from women facing problems at work because of pregnancy than on any other subject; further expresses alarm that women have been demoted, disciplined or sacked simply for having a baby; strongly believes that the Scottish economy needs the skills and experience of pregnant women in the workplace and women returning from maternity leave, and calls on the Scottish Executive to act upon the findings of the investigation to put a stop to pregnancy discrimination.
