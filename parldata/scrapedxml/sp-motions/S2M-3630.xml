*S2M-3630 Eleanor Scott: Food for Life—That the Parliament commends the Soil Association’s Food for Life project for its tremendously positive work in promoting food education and school food that is 75% fresh and unprocessed, 50% locally produced and 30% organic; is delighted that the project is flourishing with schools across Scotland already taking part and many more due to join in the near future; congratulates Hurlford Primary School in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, one of the Food for Life schools, for its success in winning the Soil Association’s Food for Life School of the Year Award and believes that this is an appropriate accolade given the health benefits to children of the project; recognises the economic and social benefits of local food procurement to Scottish food producers, particularly in remote rural areas, and urges the Scottish Executive to promote Food for Life as the logical progression from the Hungry for Success and Health Promoting Schools schemes.
