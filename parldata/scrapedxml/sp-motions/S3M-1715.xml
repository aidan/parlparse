 *S3M-1715 Andy Kerr: Local Income Taxâ€”That the Parliament rejects the SNP proposals for a local income tax, noting that these proposals are neither local nor fair, that property has a role to play in our taxation system, that they would remove from local government any autonomy over raising resources locally and that they would fail to raise the resources required to fund much valued local services.
