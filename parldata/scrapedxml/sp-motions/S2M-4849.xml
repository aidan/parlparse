*S2M-4849 Frances Curran: Remarks by US Deputy Secretary of State on Pakistan—That the Parliament utterly condemns the remarks attributed to US Deputy Secretary of State, Richard Armitage, by Pakistan’s President; believes that threats to bomb Pakistan back into the stone age are offensive and dangerous, though unfortunately typical of the United States of America’s current approach to foreign policy; wishes to assure Scotland’s Pakistani community that the Scottish Parliament distances itself from such an approach to "diplomacy", and calls on the Westminster Government to do likewise.
