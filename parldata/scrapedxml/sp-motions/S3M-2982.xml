 *S3M-2982 Willie Coffey: Cadet Heather Stupart of Newmilns—That the Parliament joins Flight Lieutenant Downie and the officers and members of 327 (Kilmarnock) Squadron of the Air Cadets in acknowledging the passing of Cadet Heather Stupart of Newmilns, who died on 20 October 2008, aged 15; notes that Heather was a valued member of the squadron and was a member of the drill team that won the Glasgow and West Scotland Wing competition in 2007; further notes that, having been diagnosed in July 2007 with Ewing’s sarcoma, a rare cancer of the bone and soft tissue that affects mainly teenagers, and despite her gruelling treatment, Heather always had a smile on her face and continued to attend the squadron as often as was possible, and expresses its condolences to Heather’s parents, Nadine and John, her sisters, Emma and Rachel, and her brother, Sean, who, it is noted, has followed Heather into 327 (Kilmarnock) Squadron of the Air Cadets.
