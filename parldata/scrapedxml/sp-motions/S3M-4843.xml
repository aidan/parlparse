*S3M-4843 Angela Constance: International Democracy Day—That the Parliament recognises the importance of the UN International Day of Democracy, which is held on 15 September each year; acknowledges the value of this initiative in providing an opportunity to review the state of democracy in the world today; applauds the underlying principles that stress the need to promote democratisation, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and supports the principles underlying the United Nation’s affirmation that "while democracies share common features, there is no single model of democracy and that democracy does not belong to any country or region", and endorses the affirmation that democracy is "a universal value based systems based on the freely expressed will of people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems, and their full participation in all aspects of life".
