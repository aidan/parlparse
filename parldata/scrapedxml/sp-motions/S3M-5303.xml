*S3M-5303 Margaret Mitchell: 25th Anniversary of the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation, November 2009—That the Parliament congratulates the Women’s Sport and Fitness Foundation on reaching its 25th anniversary; notes that the foundation aims to increase the health, fitness and wellbeing of women and girls by making physical activity an integral part of their lives; further notes that the foundation seeks to do this through its campaign to make sport as appealing to women and girls as it is to men and boys, make women aware of the importance of being active and encourage women who are fit and healthy to be social and cultural role models, and therefore hopes that initiatives such as the MSP and MP health and fitness programme will raise awareness of this important work.
