 *S2M-791 Colin Fox: Potential Job Losses in Edinburgh's Financial Sector-That the Parliament is deeply concerned at the recent announcement by Abbey National that it will move over 700 jobs out of its Edinburgh-based Scottish Provident site and Standard Life's potential demutualisation; notes that these are additional to the potential job losses being considered by Lloyds TSB/Scottish Widows and reflects the huge changes in the financial sector including mergers, demutualisation, outsourcing and off-shoring jobs, and believes that the Scottish Executive should seek a meeting with representatives of the Scottish financial sector and finance trade unions to discuss the sector's corporate social responsibility and the impact these decisions have on the Scottish economy and the workers in the finance sector.
