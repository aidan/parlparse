*S3M-204.2 Nicol Stephen: Olympic Games—As an amendment to motion (S3M-204) in the name of Murdo Fraser, insert at end "including the 2012 London Olympics, but regrets that the UK Government’s insistence on using lottery funds to finance the Games will deprive grassroots sport development in Scotland of essential funding and urges the UK Government to make a commitment that no further raids will be made on lottery funds to make up any additional Olympic budget shortfall."
