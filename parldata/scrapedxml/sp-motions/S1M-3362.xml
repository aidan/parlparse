*S1M-3362# Maureen Macmillan: World Alzheimer's Day - 20 September 2002 -That the Parliament notes the on-going campaign by Alzheimer Scotland - Action on Dementia, to raise awareness about the early symptoms of dementia and, in particular, World Alzheimer's Day, which will provide a focal point of activity throughout the world; further notes that Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia; recognises the dedicated and valuable work of carers and organisations in seeking to support people with dementia, and believes that the Scottish Executive and MSPs should (a) ensure that the needs of the people with dementia are addressed by government departments and committees of the Parliament and promoted among the wider Scottish society and (b) monitor the progress of legislation in order to ensure that local authorities and the NHS are working together to recognise, assess and support people with dementia and their carers.
