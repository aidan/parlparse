*S3M-5933 Stewart Maxwell: No Free Advertising for the BNPâ€”That the Parliament believes that the British National Party (BNP) has no place in Scottish politics and completely rejects its policies; congratulates the people of Scotland for refusing to support BNP candidates at local authority, Scottish Parliament, UK and EU elections; condemns the use of images of the armed forces by the BNP, which it considers to be an attempt to win votes at recent elections; welcomes reports that some local authorities have outlawed election posters on lamp posts and other street furniture; calls on other local authorities to do the same without delay, and believes that such action will deny the BNP an opportunity at the forthcoming UK general election to spread what many consider to be its unwelcome message by giving the public a distorted view of its levels of support.
