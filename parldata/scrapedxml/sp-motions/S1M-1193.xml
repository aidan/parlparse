*S1M-1193 Mr Keith Harding: Local Government Strike Action—That the Parliament expresses its concern over the continued strike action due to a dispute over pay affecting local government services and notes that enough money would be available to meet wage demands if Her Majesty’s Government had not abolished advance corporation tax credit for pension funds in July 1997, a change which is costing Scottish councils £20.5 million each year, and if Scottish local authorities were to improve their council tax collection rates so that they were on a par with their counterparts south of the border, which would generate an extra £70 million each year.
