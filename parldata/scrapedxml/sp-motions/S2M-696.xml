 *S2M-696 Carolyn Leckie: Sodexho Contract; Solidarity with Public Sector Workers in British Columbia-That the Parliament is concerned at the practices of Sodexho in tendering for and running contracted-out public services in British Columbia in the context of a neo-liberal provincial government that is abolishing collective agreements, privatising public sector jobs and sacking thousands of public sector workers, pushing through anti-trade union legislation and employment laws that remove all forms of protection including transfer (succession) rights and allowing multi-nationals like Sodexho to employ whole new workforces on less than half their previous pay, equivalent to that which ancillary health workers earned 30 years ago, with no benefits, exploit women and immigrant workers particularly and ride roughshod over the rights of workers to organise in trade unions; believes that these practices, and those already evident in Scotland in contracts like those at Glasgow Royal Infirmary, show that Sodexho is not the sort of company that the Scottish Parliament should be associated with, and considers that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body should review the current contract with Sodexho and take steps to bring that contract in-house as soon as is practicably possible, whilst guaranteeing and securing the employment at the Parliament of all current Sodexho employees.
