*S2M-246 Rosie Kane: Deportation of the Ay Family—That the Parliament is appalled at the persistent attempts of Her Majesty’s Government to prevent the Ay family, currently imprisoned at Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre, from receiving asylum in Britain and, in particular, deplores the House of Lords’ refusal on 31 July 2003 of the Ay family’s last appeal which, if not overturned, will mean the deportation of Mrs Ay and her four children to Germany and their return from there to Turkey where they will almost certainly face imprisonment and possible death; supports the Ay family’s lawyer’s attempts to lodge an asylum application on behalf of the Ay children so that they can be saved from deportation, and calls urgently on the Home Office not to remove these children from Scotland until their asylum application has been processed in the proper way.
