*S2M-3288 Mr Brian Monteith: Stop the Pigeon—That the Parliament notes the decision of the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body (SPCB) to deal with the ongoing problem of pigeon guano affecting the Holyrood complex; notes that the problem of pigeons extends to birds entering MSPs’ offices through the natural ventilation system resulting in some windows being closed and temperatures rising; considers that Billy Connolly’s description of the MSP office block as a "doo-cot" is becoming all too accurate; understands the need to take action to counter any potential health risks from pigeon waste; believes that traditional methods may be both cheaper, less visually distracting and more effective in dealing with the problems of pigeons than the netting proposed by the SPCB, and calls on the SPCB to investigate the use of a hawker to scare pigeons away from the buildings.
