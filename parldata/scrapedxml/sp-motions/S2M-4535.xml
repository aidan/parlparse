 *S2M-4535 Karen Whitefield: Diabetes and Diet—That the Parliament congratulates the Co-operative (Co-op) Group of food stores and pharmacies on its decision to stop selling so-called "diabetic" products such as jams, marmalade, squash drinks and preserves; recognises that this has been done on the basis that the Co-op Group, in consultation with Diabetes UK, has concluded that healthy eating advice for people with diabetes is the same as for the rest of the population and that there is, therefore, no need to have "diabetic" chocolate, jams and similar products which can serve to confuse healthy eating messages; urges other companies to follow the Co-op Group’s lead; agrees with Diabetes UK and the Co-op Group that people with diabetes should be focussing on a balanced diet that is lower in fat, sugar and salt and contains plenty of fruit and vegetables; recognises that the Scottish Executive’s Healthy Living campaign is key to making this happen, and furthermore commends the launch by Diabetes UK of an interactive section on its website which will help people look at their typical shopping basket and find out what they are doing right and what they should change. Supported by: Donald Gorrie* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
