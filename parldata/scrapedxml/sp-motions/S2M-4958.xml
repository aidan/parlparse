*S2M-4958 Tommy Sheridan: Local Meat for Glasgow—That the Parliament notes that Glasgow City Council’s meat contract, worth an estimated £508,000 annually, is currently out to tender; recognises that food miles now account for nearly 30% of goods transported on our roads and that this travel adds substantially to the carbon dioxide emissions that are contributing to climate change; notes that a recent report by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs states that food miles rose by 15% between 1992 and 2002; accordingly calls on Glasgow City Council to ensure that meat purchased has been sourced locally and organically reared, and further calls on all local authorities to source locally produced organic meat to reduce environmental costs. Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Chris Ballance*
