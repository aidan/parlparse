*S2M-1441# Mark Ballard: Urgent Action for the Dove Centre, Edinburgh-That the Parliament notes the excellent work of the Dove Centre in Edinburgh in providing a community transport service in West Edinburgh, providing a service forum for older people, promoting the West Edinburgh Canal Society and helping to achieve a City for All Ages; further notes the decision of the Edinburgh Capital City Partnership to award the Dove Centre £32,000 social inclusion funding; further notes the Community Planning Partnership's recommendation that the funding arrangements for the Dove Centre be reconsidered in light of the centre's promotion of social inclusion for older people and especially community transport focused on older people; believes that this reconsideration is a matter of urgency given the imminent departure of the co-ordinator and the end of transport provision for vulnerable older people due to lack of funds, and considers that all concerned agencies should help guarantee the future of this project.
