*S2M-2072# Fergus Ewing: Lifting the Over Thirty Months Scheme—That the Parliament notes that the Over Thirty Months Scheme (OTMS) was introduced around eight years ago to protect the public against the potential risk that humans consuming beef which is over 30 months might contract CJD via BSE-infected beef; acknowledges that the Food Standards Agency (FSA), which was set up in order to provide an independent source of scientific advice on food safety, recommended in July 2003 that the scheme be scrapped and the ban lifted and replaced by a two-stage process, involving testing of animals for BSE, advice which was reaffirmed in July 2004; expresses concern that the FSA’s advice has not been acted upon by the UK Government and devolved ministers; understands that the cost of the OTMS exceeds £400 million a year, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should lift the ban as soon as practically possible in order that public money can be used directly for the health service or other priorities, and not be wasted on a scheme which is, according to the official food safety watchdog, no longer justified.
