 *S3M-4086 Pauline McNeill: Newspaper Public Notices—That the Parliament notes with concern the Scottish Government’s intention to put an end to advertising public notices in newspapers; believes that this will adversely affect many local newspapers as it will amount to a loss of approximately £10 million in advertising revenue at a time when the industry is at its most vulnerable and crucially that this will mean that public notices are less accessible to the general public; also notes that not everyone has access to the internet, with only 44% of people in Glasgow having access to the internet compared to the national Scottish average of 64%, that this proposed change will reduce the access that people have to key announcements that affect their community and that it is therefore a backward step for the democratic process, and calls on the Scottish Government to review this decision and ensure that there is no diminution in the accessibility of public notices. Supported by: Elaine Smith*, Rhona Brankin*, Ms Wendy Alexander*, David Whitton*, Mary Mulligan*, Patricia Ferguson*, Andy Kerr*, Mr Frank McAveety*, James Kelly*, Cathy Jamieson*, Robin Harper*, Elaine Murray*, Dr Richard Simpson*, John Park*, Cathie Craigie*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Cathy Peattie*, Jackie Baillie*, Helen Eadie*
