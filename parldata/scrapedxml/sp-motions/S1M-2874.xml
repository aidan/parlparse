 *S1M-2874# Bristow Muldoon: Drugs and Driving—That the Parliament expresses concern about the number of lives lost in road traffic crashes that may have been caused by people driving whilst under the influence of legal and illegal drugs; recognises that, in law, driving while unfit through drugs is an offence; notes that Transport Research Laboratory tests demonstrated a significant increase between the 1980s and 1990s in the percentage of people testing positive for illegal drugs who have been involved in fatal collisions; welcomes the launch by the British Medical Association of its web resource on research that has been undertaken and is currently in progress; considers that there should be speedier and more specific and co-ordinated research in order that appropriate and conclusive drug testing devices can be introduced, and believes that there should be a Scottish campaign in order to educate the public that the side effects of illegal and certain prescribed drugs can affect their ability to drive.
