*S2M-3254 Sarah Boyack: Support for Unionlink Pilot Scheme—That the Parliament recognises that the majority of Scottish students in higher and further education undertake some form of paid part-time work during their period of study and that, whilst the majority find their job beneficial both financially and in terms of experience, a significant minority experiences problems in the workplace or with work-study balance; further notes that due to the temporary and sometimes casual nature of their employment most students do not join a trade union; welcomes, therefore, the joint initiative between the Scottish Trades Unions Congress and the National Union of Students to pilot Unionlink, a free advice and support service for working students in Edinburgh, and encourages as many students as possible to take advantage of this pilot scheme so that it can be rolled out across Scotland.
