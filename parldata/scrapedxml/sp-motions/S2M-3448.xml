S2M-3448&lt;&gt; Mr Jamie Stone: Economic Opportunity of Biofuels—That the Parliament supports the production of biofuels, including ethanol, biodiesel and vegetable-based oils, both as a boost to the economy and in keeping with obligations to the Kyoto Protocol; believes that biofuel production would also benefit farmers, particularly in areas such as the Highlands; recognises that green fuels are being used already in Sweden, the United States of America, Brazil and other countries, to the success of their agricultural economies, and considers that the Scottish Executive should continue to stimulate new renewable fuels projects through grants and petitioning Her Majesty’s Government to reduce taxation on all biofuels.
