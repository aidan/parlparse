*S3M-7681♦ John Scott: Save the River Doon—That the Parliament notes the application made by Scottish Power to reduce by 27% the water flow in the River Doon; expresses its concern at the potentially adverse effect that such a reduction in water flow would have on the ecology of the river, on the tourist economy of Ayrshire and Scotland to which the river contributes and on the quality of bathing waters around Ayr; considers that the River Doon has an iconic place in the culture of Scotland, particularly through the works of Robert Burns, and does not believe that the water flow in the river should be reduced.
