*S2M-5253 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Bhopal—That the Parliament notes the 22nd anniversary of the disaster at Bhopal which took place on 2 and 3 December 1984; calls on Dow to ensure that its wholly owned subsidiary, Union Carbide, along with ex-Chairman Warren Anderson, end their 13-year evasion of criminal proceedings in Bhopal and face trial; calls for Dow to assume responsibility for the long-term effects of Union Carbide’s gases and to provide long-term health care for the victims and those as yet unborn who may be affected; calls for Dow to clean up Union Carbide’s heavily contaminated factory site in Bhopal and provide safe drinking water for communities whose wells have been poisoned by chemicals leaking from the factory, and further calls for Dow to provide economic and social support to people who have been incapacitated by their injuries and families which have become destitute as a result of losing their breadwinner.
