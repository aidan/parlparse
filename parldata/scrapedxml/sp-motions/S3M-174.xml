*S3M-174♦ Sandra White: Asylum Seeker Policy—That the Parliament, while recognising and praising the invaluable role played by projects designed to help asylum seekers take their first steps towards integration, employment and education, such as the Prince’s Trust ShaRed Road project which has received over £150,000 to strengthen the existing youth club in North Glasgow and set up a new youth club in South Glasgow, strongly condemns the continuing use of dawn raids, despite the expectation that the March 2006 agreement between the Home Office and the Scottish Executive would put an end to this traumatic practice and would ensure that the rights, needs and interests of children in asylum seeker families are given earlier and ongoing consideration; notes that many families like the Hazizi family, whose daughter is presently studying maths and physics at university and whose son is studying at the local secondary school where teachers have praised his positive contribution, still face an uncertain future with the threat of forced removal hanging over them; believes that the recent hunger strike by asylum seekers detained at Dungavel Immigration Removal Centre in South Lanarkshire over allegations of staff brutality and the way cases are handled is a result of the way in which the issue of asylum is dealt with, and recognises the importance of addressing this situation as a matter of urgency.
