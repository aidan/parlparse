 *S3M-4459 Stuart McMillan: Shared Surfaces and Disabled People—That the Parliament supports the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association (Guide Dogs), Inclusion Scotland, RNIB, RNID, Capability Scotland, Scottish Accessible Transport Alliance and Scottish Disability Equality Forum in calling for a moratorium on new shared surface schemes in towns and cities until the results of the research currently being carried out by the UK Government’s Department for Transport are published; recognises that in these schemes it is not possible for certain groups of vulnerable road users to use such areas independently because they cannot tell where the pavement ends and the road begins; welcomes the research that Guide Dogs has already carried out to highlight the issue and to try to find an effective solution for all disabled people, and also recognises that the Mobility and Access Committee for Scotland, in responding to the consultation, Designing Streets, requested that no new shared surface areas should be agreed by planners until the research commissioned by the Department for Transport is completed, analysed and commented on.
