 *S2M-4226 Stewart Stevenson: Thomas Blake Glover—That the Parliament recognises the esteem in which Scotsman Thomas Blake Glover is held in Japan; notes that Glover introduced the first railway locomotive to Japan, was responsible for that country’s first mechanised coal mine, and that his shipbuilding company later grew into what is today known worldwide as the Mitsubishi Corporation; wishes success to the forthcoming photographic exhibition on the life of Glover at the Museum of Scottish Lighthouses in his native Fraserburgh, and welcomes this initiative as an opportunity to build links between north-east Scotland and Japan, where Glover’s house annually attracts around two million visitors.
