*S2M-1920 Robert Brown: British Council Scotland and International Education Week—That the Parliament acknowledges the importance of international projects and activities that are taking place in schools, universities and colleges across Scotland; recognises that an international dimension in the curriculum enhances the quality, variety and relevance of education and acknowledges its contribution to the professional development of teachers, and welcomes the British Council Scotland’s information stand highlighting these activities which will be in the garden lobby of Holyrood on 16 and 17 November 2004 and the Scottish Executive’s annual international education conference in Victoria Quay on 23 November 2004, both of which are taking place during International Education Week.
