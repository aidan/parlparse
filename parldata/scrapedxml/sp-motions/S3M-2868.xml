*S3M-2868 Dr Richard Simpson: Back to a Life Stroke Campaign—That the Parliament welcomes the Back to a Life survey of stroke survivors report; calls on the Scottish Government to listen to the views of the large number of people in Scotland with communication difficulties following a stroke and who responded to the survey; recognises the impact, following a stroke, of communication difficulties on people’s lives; supports the development of more, improved and better integrated communication support services in hospitals and in communities; further supports the development of accessible public communication services throughout communities and the establishment of accurate data collection processes to better evaluate and inform local communications service planning, and calls on the Scottish Government to make a firm commitment to act on these issues in Scotland’s refreshed Coronary Heart Disease and Stroke Strategy.
