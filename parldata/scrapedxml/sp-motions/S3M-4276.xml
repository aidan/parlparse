 *S3M-4276 Christopher Harvie: Action Duchenne’s Race Against Time Campaign—That the Parliament applauds Action Duchenne’s Race Against Time Campaign and commends the charity for its excellent work in providing support for the young men who have Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), a progressive and severe muscle-wasting disease, and for promoting extensive research to find a cure for this ultimately fatal condition; notes with approval the Scottish Government’s support for the Scottish Muscle Network’s efforts to link clinicians in the five Scottish specialist centres with the voluntary sector to improve care and treatment for people with DMD and to promote participation in large-scale clinical trial studies and the Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy Registry, and expresses the hope that the Scottish Government’s forthcoming consultation with NHS boards about people with neuromuscular conditions will result in support and funding for a Scottish centre of excellence mirroring facilities in London and Newcastle, will boost neuromuscular research into DMD and will deliver internationally agreed standards of care and support throughout Scotland.
