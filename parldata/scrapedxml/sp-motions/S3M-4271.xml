*S3M-4271 Robin Harper: Moratorium on Opencast Coal—That the Parliament recognises the serious impact of opencast coal mines on communities throughout Scotland; understands the harmful effects on health and the serious disruption faced by local communities forced to live with opencast mines on their doorsteps; acknowledges that plans to expand opencast mining will blight yet more communities and are incompatible with the Scottish Government’s stated climate change targets; condemns the Scottish Government for leaving the vast majority of planning decisions concerning opencast coal mining in the hands of councils with huge vested interests in supporting the industry; accepts that Scotland should be investing more in proven renewable technologies before unproven end-of-pipe solutions, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring in a moratorium on new opencast projects and to set out a timescale for the phasing out of Scotland’s two coal-fired power stations.
