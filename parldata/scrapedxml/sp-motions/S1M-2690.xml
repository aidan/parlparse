*S1M-2690 Michael Russell: "Scottish Six" News Bulletin-That the Parliament supports a "Scottish Six" main evening BBC television news bulletin, produced and edited in Scotland rather than in London and mixing an appropriate blend of Scottish, UK and international news, similar to the excellent format of BBC Radio Scotland; notes that the Broadcasting Council for Scotland is in favour of a "Scottish Six", that 51 BBC Scotland journalists have publicly supported this important broadcasting reform and that opinion surveys show that a "Scottish Six" is supported by 69 per cent of the people of Scotland; believes that it is absurd that, in post-devolution Scotland, viewers north of the border are still subject to London-based stories about English health and education issues, which are very often misleading for a Scots audience, while Scottish health and education are ignored by the BBC's London-centric output, and expresses astonishment that Tom Harris MP should describe Scottish-based news programming as "parochial" (The Herald, 1 February 2002), regarding this as a slur on the professionalism, editorial judgement, and abilities of BBC Scotland journalists and management.
