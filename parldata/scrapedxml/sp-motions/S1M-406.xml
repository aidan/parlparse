*S1M-406 Mr Sam Galbraith: Children and Young People Looked After by Local Authorities—That the Parliament endorses the important action being taken to improve the quality of care and support for every child and young person looked after by local authorities; supports strengthening key services for those young people through extra resources to develop more integrated approaches to their needs, new performance measures to highlight actual outcomes for each child, especially those leaving care, and research to evaluate how well those looked after at home are supported, and recognises the importance of ensuring that each and every child or young person looked after by local authorities can share fully in the benefits of education, health and social justice programmes.
