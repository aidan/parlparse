 *S2M-5247 Ms Maureen Watt: Carers’ Rights Day—That the Parliament notes that the seventh annual Carers’ Rights Day will take place on 8 December 2006 and recognises the importance of such an event in raising awareness among carers of their rights and entitlements; further notes that there are over 660,000 carers in Scotland who provide unpaid care by looking after an ill, frail or disabled family member, friend or partner, saving the country £5 billion each year; congratulates Carers Scotland on its campaign to tackle ill-health, poverty and discrimination experienced by people because they are carers; notes that £70 million worth of benefits available to carers goes unclaimed each year and that this money could provide vital income as well as protecting carers’ pensions in retirement, and hopes that the work of Carers Scotland and the voluntary organisations involved in Carers’ Rights Day succeeds in highlighting the practical and financial help available to carers in Scotland in order to improve their lives and the lives of those they care for. Supported by: Nora Radcliffe*, Rob Gibson*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Mr Andrew Welsh*, Stewart Stevenson*, Mr John Swinney*, Murray Tosh*, Tricia Marwick*, Richard Lochhead*, Murdo Fraser*, Mrs Nanette Milne*, Mr Kenneth Macintosh*, Mike Rumbles*, Shona Robison*, Bruce Crawford*, Tommy Sheridan*, Fiona Hyslop*, Chris Ballance*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Robin Harper*, Mr Charlie Gordon*
