 *S3M-7521 Sandra White: Lifeline for Older People—That the Parliament notes Age Scotland’s campaign to safeguard what it considers to be vital public services that older people rely on; considers that free personal care and concessionary travel not only save money for older people but contribute towards improving their quality of life while delivering financial savings across other budget lines, and agrees with Age Scotland that, despite difficult financial times, these key public services should remain priority areas of spending for the Scottish Government.
