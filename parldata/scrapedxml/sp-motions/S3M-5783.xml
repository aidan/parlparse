* S3M-5783 Alasdair Allan: MacNeil of Barra—That the Parliament expresses its sadness at the death of Ian Roderick MacNeil of Barra, the 46th Chief of the Clan MacNeil; recognises that, as well as heading one of Scotland’s oldest clans, Ian MacNeil was an immensely kind, learned man who devoted his considerable talents to helping the community in which he was so well respected; notes that, as well as working tirelessly to safeguard the future of Kisimul Castle in Barra, he had a notable career as Professor of Law at North Western University in Chicago in the United States, gaining knowledge which he put to formidable use in defending the interests of Barra; further notes that, to his immense credit, he secured public ownership of the island itself, and expresses sympathies to his wife, Nancy, and to his children, Rory, Jenny and Sandy.
