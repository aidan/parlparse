 *S3M-4732 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Campaign for Queen’s Gallantry Medal for Ewan Williamson—That the Parliament supports the call for firefighter Ewan Williamson to be posthumously awarded the Queen’s Gallantry Medal; pays respect to the courage of the 35-year-old who died while tackling a blaze in the Balmoral Bar on Dalry Road on Sunday 12 July 2009; recognises that the brave action of Mr Williamson and his colleagues in Lothian and Borders Fire and Rescue Service helped save 20 lives that morning; salutes the bravery of all firefighters who routinely put their lives at risk to save others; welcomes the news that Mr Williamson is to be honoured at the annual International Firefighters Service of Remembrance in London, and supports the Edinburgh Evening News-backed petition to have Mr Williamson honoured with a bravery medal, which is available to sign online at www.edinburghnews.com/ewanwilliamsonpetition.
