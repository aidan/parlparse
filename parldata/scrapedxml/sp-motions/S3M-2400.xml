*S3M-2400 Ian McKee: Farming Concerns—That the Parliament notes with concern the effects of the rising input costs of feed, fuel and fertiliser on Scottish farmers; recognises that the return many farmers make does not cover the costs of production; further recognises the role that farmers play in feeding Scotland’s population, maintaining Scotland’s famous countryside and underpinning rural communities and that they contributed £2.1 billion directly to the Scottish economy in 2007, and welcomes the Scottish Government’s undertaking to meet supermarket bosses to discuss how government and retailers can work together to ensure a sustainable and profitable future for Scottish farming.
