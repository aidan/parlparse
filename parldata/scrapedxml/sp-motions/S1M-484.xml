*S1M-484# Dr Elaine Murray: Council Tax Collection: Summary Warrant Procedures—That the Parliament recognises that the current system of council tax collection by means of summary warrant procedure denies individual council tax payers the opportunity to state their case before an independent tribunal prior to enforcement proceedings being taken against them and that as a result some council tax payers are wrongly being pursued and threatened with diligence for debts that have already been paid or are not due; recommends the introduction of new methods of council tax collection and a requirement upon local authorities to prove the existence of any debt, and calls for consideration to be given to whether or not the current procedures contravene Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights.
