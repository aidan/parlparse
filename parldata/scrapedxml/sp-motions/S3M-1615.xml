 *S3M-1615 Robin Harper: Royal Scottish Academy Schools Art Competition—That the Parliament congratulates the Royal Scottish Academy, its Friends and sponsors for the inspiration provided by their work organising competitions, providing scholarships and producing teachers packs drawing on their own permanent collection as a resource; acknowledges the huge contribution that this work makes to encouraging the careers and development of Scotland’s aspiring young artists, and praises all of the young students whose work has been on display in the lobby of the Parliament and the art departments in the schools that have nurtured their talents.
