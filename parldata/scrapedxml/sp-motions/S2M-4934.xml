 *S2M-4934 Shiona Baird: Serious Gas Leakâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the "Serious Gas Leak" advertisement which appeared in national newspapers recently warning of the dangers of inaction on climate change; agrees that the only way to address the problem of climate change is to "stop the leak" by making immediate and dramatic cuts to our emissions of greenhouse gases; congratulates Oliver Postgate, creator of the Clangers, for posting the advert, which also highlights the unwillingness, or inability, of most politicians to make the unpopular, but very necessary, decisions to tackle climate change, and strongly believes that all politicians need to find the courage to tell the truth, both about the dangers of climate change and about the actions that are needed to address it, and that a cross-party consensus is required if this most vital of issues is to avoid becoming a political football.
