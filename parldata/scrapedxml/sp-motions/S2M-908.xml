*S2M-908 Tommy Sheridan: Support for the Ay Family Threatened with Imminent Deportation to Turkey-That the Parliament notes with grave concern the imminent threat to deport the Ay family from Germany to Turkey and the unusually speedy rejection of their last appeal; further notes the disappearance of Mr Ay on his return to Turkey in 2002 and the fact that he remains missing to this day; cautions the Home Office that failure to note this evidence of danger to the family could lead to their death or similar disappearance and represents a breach of their human rights guaranteed under the United Nations Charter and European Convention on Human Rights; calls upon the Scottish Executive to make urgent representations to Home Office ministers to intercede immediately on behalf of the Ay family and use their discretionary powers to grant the family leave to return to the UK, and further calls upon the Executive to work with the Home Office to develop an impartial asylum assessment system.
