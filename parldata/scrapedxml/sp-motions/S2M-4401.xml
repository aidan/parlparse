 *S2M-4401 Nora Radcliffe: Malaysian Service Medal—That the Parliament notes that, while Her Majesty the Queen has been advised by the governments of Australia and New Zealand that the Pingat Jasa Malaysia, Malaysian Service Medal, should be accepted for wear by veterans in those Commonwealth countries, she has been advised by the Committee on the Grant of Honours, Decorations and Medals, quoting the Imperial Honours System, that British citizens may accept the medal but do not have the right to wear it formally; considers that this is unjust, inappropriate and a slight to the Agong, the Government and peoples of Malaysia and to those British servicemen and women and civilians who have been awarded the medal, and asks the committee to reconsider its anomalous decision.
