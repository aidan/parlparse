 *S3M-5981Pauline McNeill:Withdrawal of Chequesâ€”That the Parliament notes the decision of the UK Payment Council to phase out cheques by 2018; notes that, although the use of cheques is in decline, figures show that 663 million cheques were used in 2008 and the banks stand to gain significant savings from their abolition; further notes the concerns raised by the Federation of Small Businesses and Age Scotland; is concerned that, due to this decision, many companies are already refusing to accept cheques, and calls on the UK Payment Council to consult on a suitable alternative method for those who rely on the cheque system that has the confidence of the consumer.
