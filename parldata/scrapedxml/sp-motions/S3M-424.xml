*S3M-424# Hugh O’Donnell: Sale of Freescale Semiconductor Plant at East Kilbride—That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement that, after months of public speculation, the US electronics company, Freescale Semiconductor, is to end production at its East Kilbride plant, where it currently employs about 900 skilled staff; regrets this blow to the electronics sector in central Scotland, and hopes that the engagement of an international real estate consultancy by Freescale will result in a buyer being found who can provide continuing employment for this highly-skilled workforce and continuing use of the specialised equipment and processes used in the plant at East Kilbride.
