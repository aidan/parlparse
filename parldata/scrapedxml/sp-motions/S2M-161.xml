*S2M-161 Mr David Davidson: Care Homes for the Elderly—That the Parliament notes with concern the threat of closure to the majority of the Church of Scotland’s care homes; further notes that this crisis has occurred against a background of the Scottish Executive’s assurance in the last session of the Parliament that funding issues had been resolved; believes, therefore, that this matter needs to be re-examined as a matter of urgency with a view to achieving a sustainable funding agreement and ending inequality in funding between local authority-run homes and independent homes; recognises that there is a longer term issue to be addressed by government, and calls on the Executive to consult with Her Majesty’s Government on how people might be encouraged to make greater provision for their own long-term care. Supported by: Mrs Nanette Milne*
