 *S3M-2345 Rob Gibson: Portrait of a Nation—That the Parliament welcomes the Portrait of a Nation campaign from the Heritage Lottery Fund, Liverpool Culture Company and participating cities and places; recognises this as a platform for young people to explore and showcase their heritage and identity through arts and heritage projects as part of the Liverpool European Capital of Culture 2008 celebrations; congratulates Highland composer and artist, Blair Douglas, for his piece titled Dealbh Dùthcha, which incorporates unique elements of Highland culture, including traditional music, Gaelic song, step dance and the spoken word, and features 30 of the very best young musicians, singers and dancers from the Highlands and Islands Fèisean to perform the piece; notes that Dealbh Dùthcha is the Highlands and Islands contribution and the only Scottish representation in Portrait of a Nation, and recognises the importance of celebrating local and national heritage and giving young people the chance to express themselves and their cultural identity.
