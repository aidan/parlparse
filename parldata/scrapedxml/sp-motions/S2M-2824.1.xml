 * S2M-2824.1 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Tackling Serious and Organised Crime - Developing Strategic Partnerships—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2824) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end “notes, however, that, whilst co-operation with other bodies both elsewhere in the United Kingdom and abroad is vital, Scotland has a unique legal system and a distinctive policing culture that is community-based and independent from political interference and therefore that the Scottish legal system and Scottish Law Officers must always be responsible for, and in control of, operations in Scotland and the representation of Scottish views and needs abroad.”
