*S3M-5745 Anne McLaughlin: Scottish Charities, the Scottish People and Haiti—That the Parliament welcomes the outstanding work being performed by numerous Scotland-based non-governmental aid agencies in the Caribbean Republic of Haiti in the aftermath of the earthquake of 12 January 2010; considers that the high quality of their projects, commitment to working with local people and increased efforts to help Haiti in its time of need have all inspired the Scottish Government to allocate over double its original commitment, providing nearly £700,000 to support the organisations; congratulates the Scottish Government on its decision; views that this increase in aid reflects the concern of the Scottish people who have donated over £5.6 million for humanitarian aid; believes that the people of Scotland have shown themselves to be responsible global citizens, and hopes that such admirable efforts to aid Haiti and the greater global community continue to receive support in the future.
