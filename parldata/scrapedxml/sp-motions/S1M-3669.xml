 *S1M-3669 Mr Lloyd Quinan: Single MMR Vaccines-That the Parliament congratulates Direct Remedies for providing single mumps, measles and rubella vaccines, thereby offering parents a choice in the treatment of their children which is currently denied them by the Scottish Executive, and believes that, while doubt remains surrounding the 3-in-1 MMR vaccine and its possible link to the diagnosis of autistic spectrum disorders, the Scottish Executive should reconsider its position of denying the single vaccines to children on the NHS, whilst also taking the necessary action to ensure that all possible causes of autistic spectrum disorders are examined in the light of the staggering increase in the incidence of autistic spectrum disorders, previously a rare disease.
