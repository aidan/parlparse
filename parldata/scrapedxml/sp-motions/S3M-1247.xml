 *S3M-1247 Bill Kidd: Independent Living Funds—That the Parliament expresses concern over the Independent Living Funds (ILF) increasing, from 1 April 2008, the threshold sum that local authorities are required to pay from £200 to £320 per week before recipients are eligible to receive ILF funding, recognising that this excessively disproportionate increase will result in many severely disabled persons missing out on payments from the fund to help them remain in the community.
