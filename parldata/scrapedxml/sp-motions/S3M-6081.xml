* S3M-6081 Christine Grahame: Mary Fairfax Somerville 1780-1872—That the Parliament welcomes the naming of Committee Room 2 after Jedburgh-born Mary Fairfax Somerville, eminent mathematician, scientist and supporter of women’s education and emancipation, and considers that it is most appropriate that she takes her place in the naming of the Parliament’s committee rooms alongside such Scottish luminaries as Robert Burns, Sir Alexander Fleming, James Clerk Maxwell, Adam Smith and David Livingstone.
