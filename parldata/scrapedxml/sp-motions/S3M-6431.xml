 *S3M-6431 Willie Coffey: The Scheme—That the Parliament expresses its dismay and disappointment with BBC Scotland and its programme, The Scheme; deplores the exploitation and exposition of people with addictions and chaotic lifestyles for public entertainment; deprecates the negative portrayal of the communities of Onthank, Knockinlaw and Altonhill already struggling to cope with high unemployment; calls on BBC Scotland to abandon its plans to screen the last two episodes of the series as it considers that this would further tarnish the reputation of these communities, and calls on BBC Scotland to live up to its obligations for fairness and balance in its future programming.
