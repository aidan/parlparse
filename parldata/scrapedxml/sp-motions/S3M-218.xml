 *S3M-218 Robin Harper: GM-Free Labelling—That the Parliament expresses concern over the recent decision by EU Ministers, contrary to the will of the European Parliament, that organic foods can be labelled "GM-free" even if they contain up to 0.9% genetically modified content; believes that this action disregards the preferences of European consumers for transparent food labelling and genuine consumer choice to reject GM ingredients; recognises that in the United Kingdom "organic" has always meant zero tolerance of genetically modified food, and further expresses concern at how this decision may undermine consumer confidence in organic labelling and, as a result, may put the Scottish organic sector at risk.
