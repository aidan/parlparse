*S1M-3354# Christine Grahame: Crisis in Borders Public Sewerage System-That the Parliament notes with concern that there is no further capacity in water waste treatment works in some towns and villages in the Scottish Borders such as Duns, Earlston, Lauder, Newtown St Boswells, Stow, Peebles and West Linton; further notes that, as a consequence, developments are being delayed or restricted and that Scottish Water's current investment programme will be unable to resolve some of these issues until, for instance, 2004-05 in Peebles and 2005-06 in Earlston, and considers that the Scottish Executive should, as a matter of urgency, convene a meeting with representatives of Scottish Borders Council, the Chief Executive of Scottish Water, the Water Commissioner for Scotland and relevant MSPs. Supported by: Ms Sandra White*, Michael Matheson*
