*S3M-4277 Pauline McNeill: Children’s Orchard—That the Parliament congratulates the Children’s Orchard for making the shortlist for the TFN Scottish Charity Awards’ Community Action Award; notes that the Children’s Orchard aims to create a fruitful Scotland through the simple initiative of creating orchards in Scotland’s urban areas; also notes that, stemming from Glasgow’s Botanic Gardens, the Children’s Orchard began as an outreach project to plant fruit trees in the city’s George Square; further notes that the organisation has worked with 100 Glasgow schools to plant trees in their local areas and has supported work in Edinburgh, Perth and Kinross and other parts of Scotland, and wishes the project the best of luck at the awards and in its Commonwealth Orchard project, which aims to plant 2,014 trees across Scotland in time for the Glasgow Commonwealth Games 2014.
