*S3M-3028 Robin Harper: The May Day Network—That the Parliament congratulates Scottish Business in the Community for the part that it is playing in the setting up of the May Day Network and the Climate Change Business Delivery Group; recognises that the May Day Network is designed to encourage companies to make a pledge to monitor, report and cut their carbon emissions and help companies progress towards a low-carbon model; further recognises that the May Day Network now has over 1,300 members across the United Kingdom, with all members having committed to tackling climate change by pledging to take one or more of the following six actions - calculating their carbon footprint, reporting their carbon footprint publicly, setting an absolute emissions reduction target and taking action to meet it, encouraging employees to reduce their carbon footprint at home and work, mobilising customers to take action and working in partnership with suppliers to reduce emissions in the supply chain, and calls on the Scottish Government to demonstrate its environmental leadership by requiring all public sector organisations also to commit to taking all six of these same actions.
