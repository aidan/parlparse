* S3M-5779 Aileen Campbell: Lift off for Lanark Airshow Committee’s Centenary Events—That the Parliament encourages the efforts of the Lanark Airshow Committee to organise a series of events for the centenary commemoration of the 1910 airshow at Lanark Racecourse; welcomes the news that £22,000 has been released from the Lanark common good fund by South Lanarkshire Council to help towards commissioning an iconic sculpture, which will be placed in the Royal Burgh of Lanark to commemorate the event, and hopes that the airshow centenary committee is also able to acquire funds for its other proposed projects, including exhibitions on the 1910 airshow and an education pack for schools in the area.
