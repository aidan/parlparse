*S3M-763 Tavish Scott: Junior Golf in Shetland—That the Parliament welcomes the success of the junior golf programme in Shetland which now has almost 80 juniors playing golf in the islands following the rapid expansion of the Shetland and Whalsay golf clubs’ junior sections; notes that this is the result of the work of volunteer coaches, trained under the Professional Golfers Association coach training scheme; further notes that eight more volunteer coaches are to be trained this month, and commends both the individual golfers who give their time and energy to coaching young golfers and the partnership between Shetland Golf Club, Whalsay Golf Club, the Sport and Leisure Service of Shetland Islands Council and Clubgolf, a partnership including the Scottish Golf Union and sportscotland, which set up and supports the junior golf programme.
