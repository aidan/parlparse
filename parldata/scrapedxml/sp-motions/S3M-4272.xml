*S3M-4272 Irene Oldfather: Remember, I’m Still Me—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the report, Remember, I’m Still Me, by the Mental Welfare Commission for Scotland and the Care Commission; notes that the report draws on investigations into 30 care homes across Scotland that have residents with dementia; acknowledges that the report has found a number of areas where care homes are failing people with dementia, including more than half of residents not having the opportunity to leave the care home premises; further notes that, out of a total of 182 personal plans, fewer than a quarter had adequate details and a further third contained no life history at all; is concerned by the findings of the report, which suggest the misuse of medication, with a number of residents on more than one antipsychotic medication; believes that it is vital for care homes to have as much information as possible recorded in order that they can provide a high standard of care for residents with dementia; agrees that immediate action should be taken in those cases where bad practice continues to have a detrimental effect on residents; considers that the report is further evidence of the failings in the Scottish care system, and therefore believes that a culture change in Scottish care homes is essential and that the charter of rights currently being developed by the Cross-party Group on Alzheimer’s is one important strand towards improving the quality of care and treatment for people with dementia.
