 *S2M-1582# Murdo Fraser: Renewable Energy Strategy-That the Parliament supports the recommendations set out in the Enterprise and Culture Committee's 6th Report, 2004 (Session 2), Renewable Energy in Scotland (SP Paper 194); notes that the report criticises the Scottish Executive's current strategy for renewables and also highlights that the Executive's current policy has resulted in the development almost exclusively of onshore wind farms to the exclusion of other renewable technologies; believes that Scotland has the opportunity to lead the world in bringing to the market new renewable technologies such as wave, tidal and biomass, but that this will only happen with a change of strategy; believes, therefore, that the Executive should adopt the recommendations in the report and produce a new national planning strategy for renewables, working with local authorities to develop local plans and targets for onshore wind farms, and considers that there must be a national moratorium on all locally-opposed wind farm planning applications until such guidance has been developed and taken effect.
