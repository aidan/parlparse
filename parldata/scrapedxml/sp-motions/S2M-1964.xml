*S2M-1964 Frances Curran: NHS Argyll and Clyde Meetings—That the Parliament is appalled that NHS Argyll and Clyde has run roughshod over local democracy during its recent consultation on its clinical review of services; believes that this approach is reinforced by the Chief Executive of the board moving to implement the proposals before either the board or the minister have taken any decisions; further believes that the board has demonstrated this approach by restricting public access to its meetings by allowing space for only 100 members of the public in an area which covers over 400,000 people; considers that, as NHS boards decide on the allocation of millions of pounds of public money, they should ensure that all members of the public who wish to should be able to scrutinise board meetings, especially where crucial decisions are being made, and believes that it is now clear that the only outcome of this review of services that will be acceptable to local communities is the retention of Vale of Leven Hospital and Inverclyde Royal Hospital.
