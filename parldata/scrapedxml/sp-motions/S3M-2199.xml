*S3M-2199 Rob Gibson: Green Flag for Alness Academy—That the Parliament congratulates Alness Academy for being the first secondary school in the Highlands to receive the prestigious Green Flag award from Eco Schools Scotland, an international initiative accrediting schools that make a commitment to continuously improving their environmental performance; commends Alness Academy for improving its school environment and reducing litter and waste, as well as energy and water use, devising more efficient ways for students to travel to and from school, promoting healthy lifestyles and encouraging active citizenship of not only its students but also its larger community area, and notes finally that raising environmental awareness at the earliest ages in life is key to developing a large-scale change in citizens’ attitudes toward environmental management and their impact on the planet and, particularly, Alness Academy’s home area of Easter Ross.
