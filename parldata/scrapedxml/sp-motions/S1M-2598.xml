*S1M-2598 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Maggie's Centre—That the Parliament warmly congratulates the Evening Times, Glasgow, for a splendid example of positive journalism in the public interest through the editor, staff and readers, including child cancer patients, raising the remarkable sum of £500,000 to create a "Maggie’s Centre" for cancer sufferers; regards such work as a splendid example of the continuing power of Scottish journalism to change lives for the better and of the astonishing generosity of the public of Glasgow, and notes with pleasure that a fine piece of once endangered Glasgow architecture, the Victorian Gatehouse at the Western Infirmary, will be saved through becoming a "Maggie’s Centre".
