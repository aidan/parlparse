*S2M-4205# Christine Grahame: Closure of Borders CABx—That the Parliament notes with concern the closure of four Citizens Advice Bureaux (CABx) in the Scottish Borders, at Jedburgh, Innerleithen, Coldstream and Chirnside; further notes that four other centres at Galashiels, Hawick, Peebles and Berwickshire are having their hours of opening severely cut; commends the work of CABx in the Borders which, as elsewhere in Scotland, provide free and accessible services on complex issues such as debt, benefits, housing, employment and family relationships, often to the most vulnerable people, and recognises that last year these offices recovered a total of £2.5 million for clients and therefore that immediate support should be provided by the Scottish government to prevent these cuts in service.
