*S1M-2940.1 David McLetchie: Size of the Scottish Parliamentâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-2940) in the name of Patricia Ferguson, leave out from "acknowledges" to end and insert "further notes public disillusionment with the performance of the Parliament to date; believes that reducing the number of MSPs to 108 in line with the provisions of the Scotland Act would be a welcome step towards establishing public confidence in the institution of the Parliament, and considers that a smaller, more focused Parliament would better fulfil the objective of "doing less, better."
