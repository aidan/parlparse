 *S2M-860# Margaret Mitchell: Development of Cavalry Park-That the Parliament notes with concern the proposals for a housing development in the historic Cavalry Park in Kilsyth, North Lanarkshire; recognises the importance of preserving this greenfield site which the Scottish Covenanter Memorials Association has declared unsuitable for development as it understands part of the site is the graveyard of many covenanters killed in 1645 at the Battle of Kilsyth; notes that development of this green belt area is contrary to the local structure plan, would make the area less attractive for tourism development and would severely compromise the integrity of the landscape setting of the neighbouring B-listed Colzium House and Estate resulting in the destruction of the ecologically balanced wildlife habitat; further notes that the area is not suitable for development as it is at high risk of flooding with downstream displacement; is concerned that the disturbance of the peat bog could lead to pollution by the release of carbon dioxide at an estimated 8 tonnes per hectare per annum, and, in light of this, believes that North Lanarkshire Council or the Scottish Executive, or both, should reject any planning application to develop the site.
