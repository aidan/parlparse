*S3M-7211 Gil Paterson: Healthy Competition at last between Glasgow and Edinburgh Airportsâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the Court of Appeal, which will force BAA to sell off either Glasgow or Edinburgh airport; believes that this decision will help smash what it considers the central belt monopoly held by BAA and be of ultimate benefit to travellers in Scotland by bringing about competition between the central belt airports, which will hopefully result in more direct flights to and from Scotland, cutting out the need for two flights, two landing charges and two sets of flight taxes, which have been a feature of BAA ownership of these airports in Scotland, and further welcomes what it sees as the environmental benefits that this will bring.
