*S3M-2706 Jackie Baillie: Sprinklers Save Livesâ€”That the Parliament notes that Argyll and Bute Council has failed to install a sprinkler system in the new Hermitage Academy; expresses disappointment that it is the only education authority without sprinkler systems in each new school; notes that 50,250 fires were recorded and 52 people were killed by fires in Scotland in 2006; recognises the vital role that sprinkler systems may play in both maintaining the fabric of the buildings and, more importantly, the lives of the pupils and teachers, and calls on Argyll and Bute Council to consider retrospectively fitting a targeted system for the safety of all who attend Hermitage Academy.
