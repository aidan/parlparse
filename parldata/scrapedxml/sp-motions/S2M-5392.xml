*S2M-5392 Carolyn Leckie: Support Faslane 365—That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in organising and participating in the Faslane 365 campaign; recognises that this is a campaign of protest and civil disobedience in the cause of upholding international law against the barbaric Trident weapons of mass destruction; understands that protestors place themselves at risk of arrest only because the state refuses to uphold international law and instead arrests and prosecutes those who are attempting to uphold it on spurious and ironic charges of "breach of the peace"; believes that it is the existence of Trident that breaches international peace, and resolves to support Faslane 365 and all peaceful attempts to abolish Trident and to halt any replacement and the escalation of the arms race.
