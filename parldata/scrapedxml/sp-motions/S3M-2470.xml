*S3M-2470 Patrick Harvie: UNFPA and the Health Crisis in Georgia—That the Parliament recognises that, while significant international attention has been focussed on the possible consequences of the conflict between Russia and Georgia, there has been less attention paid to the wellbeing of the 130,000 or more people who have been displaced as a result of the hostilities; notes in particular that this figure includes around 30,000 women of reproductive age of whom 2,000 to 3,000 are estimated to be pregnant and without access to health infrastructure; notes that the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) has been providing emergency obstetric care, counselling and dignity kits that include basic items for sanitation but that the fund estimates that an additional $600,000 is needed to provide reproductive health services to internally displaced people in the short term, and calls on the UK Government to work with the UNFPA to ensure that these and other essential needs are met as quickly as possible for the many innocent people caught up in a conflict that is not of their making.
