*S2M-134# Dr Sylvia Jackson: Pet Passports-That the Parliament notes the ongoing discussions between the Scottish Executive, officials from the State Veterinary Service and Superfast Ferries regarding the introduction of a pet passport scheme on the Rosyth to Zeebrugge ferry route; recognises the great demand for such a scheme, not just from pet owners, but also from organisations such as Guide Dogs for the Blind and Hearing Dogs for the Deaf; believes that a pet passport scheme would greatly increase the attraction of this route by allowing hundreds of Scottish pet owners to travel to mainland Europe with their pets directly from Scotland, and considers that the Executive should do everything in its power to assist the implementation of the pet passport scheme in Scotland as quickly as possible.
