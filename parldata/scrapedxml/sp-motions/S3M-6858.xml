 *S3M-6858 John Park: Cancellation of Rosyth-Zeebrugge Passenger Service—That the Parliament notes with concern the recent announcement by DFDS to end the passenger service on the Rosyth-Zeebrugge ferry service in December 2010; hopes that changes to the existing freight service will improve the long-term security of the route; further hopes that businesses in Fife and across Scotland will not be faced with a repeat of the cancellation of the route in 2008, and calls on the Scottish Government to support the reintroduction of a passenger service on the route and help develop Rosyth’s status as an international transport hub.
