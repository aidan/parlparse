*S3M-8182 Cathy Peattie: International Rescue Corps—That the Parliament expresses its sympathy with the people of Japan who have been affected by earthquakes, tsunami and nuclear leaks; regrets that the team from the Grangemouth-based International Rescue Corps (IRC), despite having permission from Japanese authorities in Tokyo and London, was unable to assist with the humanitarian effort; understands that this was because of the lack of a letter of authorisation stating that IRC is a bona fide organisation from UK officials based in Japan; notes that this would have been the 32nd world disaster that IRC would have attended and that, although it has had problems previously with host governments in China and Afghanistan, this was the first time that the obstacle was with a UK embassy, and considers the efforts of IRC to be unstinting and that these should be recognised by the UK Government and that every effort should be made to facilitate IRC’s valuable work.
