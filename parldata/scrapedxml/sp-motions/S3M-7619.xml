 *S3M-7619 Alasdair Allan: Coastguard Centre Cuts—That the Parliament notes with concern the public consultation document launched by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency that envisages what are believed to be drastic reductions in the number of maritime operations centres in the United Kingdom; notes that the proposed reductions would leave only two 24-hour centres operating, based in Aberdeen and in Southampton/Portsmouth; further notes that these would be supported by seven sub-centres and only one would be in Scotland at either Shetland or Stornoway; notes that this would result in the five operations centres in Scotland being reduced to two; believes that this raises serious questions about the future operation of the coastguard given that centres will now be covering what it considers to be such huge areas and that this has clear implications for many members of staff, and urges reconsideration of what it believes to be the UK Government’s unwise proposal. Supported by: Bill Wilson*, Rob Gibson*, Kenneth Gibson*, Stewart Maxwell*, John Wilson*, Tavish Scott*, Bill Kidd*
