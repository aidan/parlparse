 *S3M-3762♦ Margaret Curran: St Bridget’s Chapel and the Mary’s Meals Backpack Project—That the Parliament endorses the work of the Mary’s Meals international movement and in particular the group working from St Bridget’s Chapel in Baillieston; commends the initiative, which is helping to feed over 350,000 children in poor areas of the globe on a daily basis, encouraging hungry children to attend school to be fed and, through education, gain a better future for themselves and their communities; expresses great pride in the fact that Mary’s Meals is based in Glasgow and administers volunteers and feeding programmes in Africa, Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe, and recognises the hard work of the volunteers at St Bridget’s who participate in the Backpack Project, providing deprived children across five continents with school bags and school essentials donated by local community members.
