*S3M-4956.2 Claire Baker: Role of Colleges in the Economic Recoveryâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-4956) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, insert at end "notes the contribution that colleges are making in further developing links with industry that can help deliver the 7,800 apprenticeships promised in the 2009-10 budget; recognises the concerns that exist regarding the ability of colleges to fully accommodate the increase in applicants, including the 2009 Christmas school leavers, and to cope with pressures on childcare and hardship funds, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Education and Lifelong Learning to report to the Parliament on how she intends to address these concerns."
