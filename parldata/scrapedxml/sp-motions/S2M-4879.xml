*S2M-4879 John Swinburne: Flawed Legislation on Ageism—That the Parliament notes that the new equality legislation, to be implemented on 1 October 2006, is flawed with regard to ageism as it allows age discrimination against those aged 75 years and over as far as pensions are concerned; also notes that in both Westminster and Holyrood a parliamentarian aged over 75 years will not receive pension benefits equal to those received by under 75-year-olds, and considers that this is blatant ageism which makes a mockery of otherwise sound legislation.
