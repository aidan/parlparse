*S2M-1571 Mr Brian Monteith: Queen Victoria School Appeal-That the Parliament congratulates Queen Victoria School in Dunblane and recognises its success as the only school of its type in Scotland to fill the role for which it was founded, providing high quality education in a stable environment for the sons and daughters of members of all three services, and additionally in making its facilities available to young persons' organisations, including the National Youth Orchestras of Scotland; wishes the school every success with its Â£2.5 million appeal as it approaches its centenary celebrations in 2008, and welcomes plans to mark the centenary with the building of an auditorium, suitable for assembly, musical and theatrical performances and to be made available to other groups and to the local community for public performances and conferences, which will be the visible symbol of the gratitude of the school's supporters for the sacrifices of servicemen and woman during the past hundred years, just as the foundation of the school was a tribute to the soldiers and sailors killed in the South African wars.
