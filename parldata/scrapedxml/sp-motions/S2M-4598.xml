 *S2M-4598 Carolyn Leckie: Trade in Dog and Cat Fur—That the Parliament welcomes Switzerland’s ban on the importation of products made with dog and cat fur; expresses concern that the import of dog and cat fur remains legal in the United Kingdom, with trade in dog and cat fur last year worth over £40 million in this country; notes with concern the position taken by the Department of Trade and Industry that, in the absence of clear evidence of a trade in dog and cat fur in this country, a UK ban on the trade will not be considered; supports the work of all bodies and organisations, including the Scottish SPCA, pressing for a change in the law, and urges the UK Government to bring in a ban on the import, export and domestic trade in dog and cat fur and of products made with dog and cat fur as soon as possible.
