 * S2M-2992 Mrs Nanette Milne: Huntington’s Awareness Week - 20 to 27 June 2005—That the Parliament welcomes Huntington’s Awareness Week which runs from 20 to 27 June 2005; notes that this annual campaign by the Huntington’s Disease Association significantly helps to raise awareness of Huntington’s disease; notes that Huntington’s disease is caused by a single defective gene on chromosome 4 which leads to damage of the nerve cells in areas of the brain including the basal ganglia and cerebral cortex, and further notes that the theme of the 2005 campaign is the “grand calorie events” which aims to teach people that those with Huntington’s disease need extra calories.
