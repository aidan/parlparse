 *S2M-1553 Carolyn Leckie: Iraq Remains Occupied-That the Parliament regards the alleged handover of sovereignty from coalition occupying forces in Iraq as completely fictitious; views the new Iraqi government as an unelected puppet of the US regime, its sovereignty guaranteed by an army of 160,000 foreign fighters and 3,000 US diplomats; notes that the Iraqi Prime Minister is a former CIA agent; notes that the new US embassy in Baghdad will be the largest in the world and bigger than the Iraqi government headquarters; notes that the US State Department has taken $184m earmarked for drinking water projects and moved it to the budget for the embassy; notes that the United States will continue to control all aspects of Iraqi life through "inspectors" appointed by the US; is outraged that 80,000 Western private mercenaries operating on behalf of Western companies in Iraq have been given immunity from prosecution for any crimes that they may commit including murder; notes that the US will continue to detain some 5,000 Iraqis without trial, and reaffirms its call for the immediate withdrawal of all coalition troops from Iraq and the ending of the privatisation of Iraq's infrastructure.
