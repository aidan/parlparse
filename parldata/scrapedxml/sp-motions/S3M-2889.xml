*S3M-2889 Patrick Harvie: Isle of Eigg’s Big Green Challenge—That the Parliament congratulates the Isle of Eigg Heritage Trust on being the only finalist from Scotland in NESTA’s £1 million Big Green Challenge; commends the community of Eigg for leading the way towards becoming a zero-carbon-energy community; believes that the project will also allow other communities to reduce their impact by learning from Eigg’s experience through the Build Your Own Green Island scheme when it is launched in early 2009, and congratulates NESTA for running the Big Green Challenge, which will help us all to learn lessons about how to reduce our environmental impact.
