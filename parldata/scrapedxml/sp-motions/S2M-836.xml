*S2M-836# Helen Eadie: Inadequate Consultation by Royal Mail on Closure of Local Post Offices-That the Parliament notes that the consultation period for Royal Mail's proposed closures of post offices started on 2 December 2003 and ended only six weeks later, spanning the Christmas and New Year holiday period, thereby pressurising post office users and elected representatives to respond to a critically important consultation at a time when they were focused on celebrations and preparations for the holiday period; further notes that Royal Mail based its decisions on incomplete information and a classification of settlements as rural or urban that was 15 years out of date and proposed closures of post offices that do comply with the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 while keeping open post offices that do not comply with the Act; notes that decisions to close post offices in some instances appear to have been made with little regard to submissions from local representatives or the views of post office users and that in some cases the decisions have been made prior to consultation meetings with the public having taken place, and is concerned at Royal Mail's style of consultation that goes to the heart of how this decision-maker has treated with contempt individuals in communities across Scotland.
