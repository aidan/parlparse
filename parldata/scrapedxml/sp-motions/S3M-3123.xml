 *S3M-3123 Bill Wilson: Sustainable Development Commission Report and GDP—That the Parliament, further to motion S3M-2790, welcomes the Sustainable Development Commission Scotland’s report on the Scottish Government’s progress with regard to sustainable development; supports its call for greater clarity over the way that sustainable economic growth is to be pursued; is aware of the tension between GDP growth and sustainability; considers that GDP is an extremely poor measure of economic success in that it makes no distinction between good and bad spending; is concerned about the global trend of ever-increasing consumption associated with measuring growth in terms of GDP without paying sufficient attention to the fair distribution of resources; notes the existence of alternatives to GDP, such as the United Nations human development index and the social return on investment tool, which measure the success of businesses by taking into account their overall contribution to society, and urges the Scottish Government to continue its work towards non-GDP related sustainability and to broaden its methods of measuring economic progress.
