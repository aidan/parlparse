 *S3M-356 Sandra White: Proposed Regional Minimum Wage—That the Parliament, while acknowledging that one of New Labour’s flagship policies, the national minimum wage, as praised by Douglas Alexander MP in his maiden speech to the House of Commons saying "when people look back at our time, let the national minimum wage be the monument by which they remember our commitment to dignity and decency in the workplace", has helped around one million low-paid workers each year and has brought huge benefits to the economy, expresses serious concern over proposals supported by the new Prime Minister to vary the minimum wage and unemployment benefit region by region across Britain and believes that such a move would lead to further inequality and the reversal of the benefit that millions of people have experienced through the introduction of the minimum wage.
