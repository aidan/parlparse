*S2M-863 Robert Brown: The Scottish Parliament Electoral System-That the Parliament notes the report of the Scottish Affairs Committee, Coincidence of Parliamentary Constituency Boundaries in Scotland and the Consequences of Change, proposing an electoral system for Scottish Parliamentary elections that would undermine the principle of proportionality set out in the Scotland Act 1998 and overwhelmingly backed by a referendum of the Scottish people; condemns this irrelevant proposal to move back to an undemocratic first past the post system and recommends the use of single transferable vote applied to multi-member constituencies as the most democratic way to address any problems with the current additional member system. Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone*, George Lyon*, Mike Rumbles*, Nora Radcliffe*, Mike Pringle*, Mr Keith Raffan*
