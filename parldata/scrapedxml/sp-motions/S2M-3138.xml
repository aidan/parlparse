 *S2M-3138 Patrick Harvie: Campaign for a Fairer Planning System—That the Parliament congratulates Scottish Environment LINK and the Association of Scottish Community Councils (ASCC) for their work in campaigning for a fairer planning system; recognises that public support for community rights in the planning system has been clearly demonstrated, for example in the Executive’s consultation on rights of appeal in planning; acknowledges that the issues raised by LINK and the ASCC in their e-petition on the forthcoming Planning (Scotland) Bill are serious and valid concerns, and urges the Executive to consider the importance of community rights and public scrutiny in the planning system.
