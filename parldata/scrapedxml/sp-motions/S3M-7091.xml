 *S3M-7091 Joe FitzPatrick: Dundee Museum of Transportâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the members of the Dundee Museum of Transport on what it considers to be the sterling effort undertaken by them in attempting to create a museum in the city with partners including the Taybus Vintage Vehicle Society, Dundee Model Boat Club and Dundee City Council; notes the plans to run apprenticeships in conjunction with the Claverhouse Group and believes that these will help to bring much-needed employment to the city; considers that the former site of the Maryfield Tram Depot in Dundee would be a perfect site for such a museum, and hopes that the charity can come to an amicable agreement with the current owners of the site.
