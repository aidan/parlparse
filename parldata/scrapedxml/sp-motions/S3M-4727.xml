*S3M-4727 Ken Macintosh: The Life of Ernest Levy—That the Parliament pays tribute to the life of Ernest Levy, holocaust survivor and inspiration to successive generations; admires the warmth and humanity that characterised Ernest’s teachings despite the brutalising experience and inhumanity that he suffered at the hands of the Nazis; feels privileged that, after leaving his native Hungary, Ernest chose to make Scotland his home; believes that his more than 40 years here has made our country a richer place; is grateful for the countless times that Ernest selflessly made himself available to talk to young and old about the horrors of the holocaust despite the toll recounting his years in Auschwitz-Birkenau and the other death camps took on him; recognises the contribution that Ernest made as cantor of the Giffnock and Newlands congregation, the love that he gave and received from his own family, the respect in which he was held in the wider community and the impact that he had on all who met him, and thanks Ernest for a life that could so easily have been cut short but instead has shone like the single light that gave him hope and inspiration at a time of hate and prejudice.
