 *S2M-4865 Dr Jean Turner: Stroke Awareness Week, 2 to 8 October 2006—That the Parliament commends Stroke Awareness Week in Scotland, from 2 to 8 October 2006, which is an annual health campaign that aims to increase public knowledge of strokes and the need for urgent diagnoses because of its devastating effects; notes that every five minutes someone in the United Kingdom has a stroke and that it is the biggest cause of disability in the UK and, contrary to popular belief, can affect anyone at any age; further notes that Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland’s theme this year is "Just Move", which is the encouragement of physical activity and walking in the Scottish population; recognises that less than 70% of adults undertake the recommended 30 minutes of activity on most days of the week, and notes therefore that Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland’s aim is to promote the health benefits of regular exercise which hopefully everyone can join in, whatever their level of fitness.
