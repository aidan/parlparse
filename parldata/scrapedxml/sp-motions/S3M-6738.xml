 *S3M-6738 Bill Wilson: United Kingdom A Key Player in £250 Billion Tax Losses in the Developing World—That the Parliament notes the comments by the Deputy General Secretary of the Public and Commercial Services Union that the public services of developing countries are suffering because of an estimated £250 billion lost to what he described as corporate tax dodging; further notes that he claimed that the United Kingdom is a key player in this because many of the world’s tax havens are based in the British Isles and that the City of London supported what he described as an army of lawyers and accountants dedicated to helping people dodge tax; considers that the issue of aid is trivial in comparison; calls on the UK Government to take urgent measures to stop what is considered to be the effective plundering of the poorest countries to benefit some of the richest individuals on the planet, and is of the view that UK Government should be aware that ending tax evasion and avoidance would also benefit most citizens of the UK.
