*S3M-7509 Patrick Harvie: Widespread Use of CCTVâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the recent comments of the Assistant Chief Constable, Ruaraidh Nicholson, of the Association of Chief Police Officers in Scotland, that "The continued use of public space CCTV by public authorities must be demonstrably based in evidenced need, and where that need can no longer be evidenced, we must be courageous and honest enough to step back from use of this technology"; notes that the United Kingdom has wider use of public space CCTV per capita than any other country; is concerned that this widespread installation of CCTV has taken place without reference to the long-term impact on privacy and that it does nothing to address the root causes of crime or antisocial behaviour, and considers that, while CCTV will continue to have a valuable role in some circumstances, community safety resources would often be better spent on things that build communities and neighbourliness, such as improvements in street lighting, urban design and services for young people.
