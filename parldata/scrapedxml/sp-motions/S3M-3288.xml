*S3M-3288 Bill Kidd: Aiming for a Nuclear-free World and a Nuclear-free Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes President Obama’s announcement of a strategic move towards a "nuclear-free world" through bilateral and multilateral disarmament; hopes to see the newly inaugurated president make good on this pledge in a constructive and practicable way, and believes that a fitting beginning to this new strategy necessitates the cessation of the shipment of vital bomb components by US weapons makers to the United Kingdom, historically sanctioned by US presidents, thus bringing about the end to the folly of Trident.
