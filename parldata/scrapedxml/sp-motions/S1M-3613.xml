*S1M-3613 John Farquhar Munro: Skye Bridge Tolls—That the Parliament recognises that toll charges on the Skye Bridge of £5.70 for non-ticket book holders are vastly higher than other bridges; notes that the Napier University Transport Research Institute report An Assessment of the Economic Impact of the Skye Bridge Tolls shows that the tolls are having a negative effect on the Skye and Lochalsh economy, and calls for the tolls to be removed entirely or at least reduced in line with the toll regimes on other Scottish bridges.
