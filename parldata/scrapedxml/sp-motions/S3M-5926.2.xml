*S3M-5926.2 Des McNulty: The Management of Schoolsâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-5926) in the name of Elizabeth Smith, leave out from "and that it is now" to end and insert "; supports schools and teachers being given more opportunities to innovate and head teachers greater control over school budgets; believes that the education system should incorporate both parental choice and local accountability; further believes that schools should encourage every child to achieve to the best of their ability and not be sources of social division, and considers that the Scottish education system should be open to learning from experience elsewhere in the United Kingdom or Europe in the interests of raising standards, reducing the achievement gap and meeting the needs of every pupil."
