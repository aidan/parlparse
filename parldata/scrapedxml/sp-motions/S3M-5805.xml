*S3M-5805♦ Bill Kidd: Scottish Academy of Literature—That the Parliament notes the publication of the report of the Literature Working Group, which proposes the creation of a Scottish academy of literature to foster and expand the literary culture of Scotland, shining a light on both authors of the past and those yet to come; welcomes the group’s other recommendations such as the establishment of a Gaelic literary magazine, encouraging publishers to publish works in Scots and the setting up of a government body to report on public libraries; agrees with the group that the creation of a Scottish academy of literature is long overdue given that Scotland is the birthplace of UNESCO’s first city of literature and that the Royal Scottish Academy was formed in 1826 and the Royal Society of Edinburgh in 1723, and believes that, coupled with other initiatives that celebrate literature, such as the Edinburgh International Book Festival and Glasgow’s Aye Write festival in March 2010, these recommendations can be successful in ensuring a bright future for Scottish literature.
