*S3M-3468 Bill Wilson: Violence Targeting Civilians in Sri Lanka—That the Parliament condemns the recent acts of violence in Sri Lanka involving the Tamil Tigers and Sri Lankan military; believes that any violence targeting defenceless civilians constitutes terrorism and, therefore, that actions by recognised states that target hospitals and schools are no less terrorist acts than actions by those generally recognised as terrorist groups, and calls on both sides to come to a diplomatic solution to the fighting.
