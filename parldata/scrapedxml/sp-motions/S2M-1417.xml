*S2M-1417 John Swinburne: D-Day Commemoration and the Treatment of Veterans and Widows-That the Parliament congratulates the First Minister on his decision to attend the D-Day 60th anniversary remembrance ceremony on the Normandy beaches; hopes that he takes this opportunity to remind the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, that far too many of the D-Day veterans and the immediate relatives of those who gave their lives for our democracy are currently living below the Government's own poverty level and that this generation is entitled to much more than a free television license on reaching 75 years old or a 25p increase in their pension on reaching the age of 80 years old, and therefore believes that it is unacceptable in 2004 that Scotland is still not a land where heroes can afford to live with the dignity that was earned by the ultimate sacrifices paid during World War Two.
