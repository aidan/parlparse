*S3M-5901 Johann Lamont: International Women’s Day—That the Parliament notes International Women’s Day on 8 March 2010; welcomes that this day will be marked in the Scottish Parliament chamber on Saturday 6 March as well as with 216 other events across the United Kingdom; believes that this day provides an opportunity to celebrate the central role of women in society, among many other things supporting their families and holding communities together in tough economic times; regrets that too many women in Scotland and across the world remain the victims of abuse, discrimination, violence and exploitation; considers that, despite progress on equality, women are still likely to be paid less than men, are underrepresented in positions of power and face discrimination in all aspects of their social and working lives, and believes that International Women’s Day provides an important opportunity to restate a commitment to securing equality for women and reaffirm the need to ensure that government at every level acts to improve the position of women and address all the barriers that prevent women from being safe and achieving their full potential.
