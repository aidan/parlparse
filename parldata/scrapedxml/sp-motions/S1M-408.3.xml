*S1M-408.3 Tommy Sheridan: Housing—As an amendment to motion (S1M-408) in the name of Ms Wendy Alexander, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes that this will only be delivered by a radical and sustained increase in public housing investment throughout Scotland; agrees to change immediately the capital receipt set-aside rules and release significant resources for vital investment in local authority housing throughout Scotland, and further calls for a comprehensive Housing Bill to be presented which will reject the damaging right-to-buy legislation and contain provision for a strong single social tenancy and appropriate incentives to retain tenants in the rented sector."
