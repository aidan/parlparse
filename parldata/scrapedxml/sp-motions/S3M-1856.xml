*S3M-1856 Bill Wilson: Possible Replacement of Disability Living Allowance—That the Parliament believes that the present system of payment of Disability Living Allowance (DLA), which provides money to disabled people based on the severity of their impairment rather than on the level of their income, should continue; deprecates UK Government proposals to remove this money from disabled people in order to support the implementation of "individualised budgets" as this would lead to uncertainty with regard to the level of individual budgets provided, to a loss of portability of the benefit and to the introduction of stigmatising means-testing, and accordingly asks for immediate discussions to take place between Scottish and UK ministers on this proposal, which has significant implications for issues of devolved responsibility, and for the outcome of these discussions to be brought before the Parliament and into the public arena.
