*S2M-4384 Ms Sandra White: The Chagos Islanders—That the Parliament applauds the decision taken by the High Court in England in favour of families forcibly exiled from the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean; notes that in the mid-1960s the United States of America, worried about possible Soviet expansion in the Indian Ocean, wanted a base in the region, but one without a "population problem"; recalls that at that time the Chagos Islands was a British territory campaigning for independence; abhors the campaign of disinformation that was pursued by British diplomats to pretend that there were no permanent inhabitants; notes again that the USA was willing, in return, to offer the United Kingdom an $11 million subsidy on Polaris nuclear missiles; observes that in 2000 the islanders won a ruling that their eviction was unlawful but the British Government then introduced a new order to allow their continued eviction; further notes that in his ruling Sir Sydney Kentridge QC describes the treatment of the islanders as "outrageous, unlawful and a breach of accepted moral standards", and urges the UK and the USA in the name of humanity, to honour the legal ruling and allow the families to return to their rightful home.
