*S2M-4457 Ms Rosemary Byrne: School Environment—That the Parliament notes that the environment in which many of our children, young people and teachers learn and teach is not always conducive to ensuring the best learning conditions; accepts that poor school environments are a direct result of following a policy of building schools under PPP initiatives and under-investment in the fabric of existing schools, instead of investing in properly built and maintained schools financed under the public sector; notes that students and teachers deserve the best conditions possible in which to learn and teach, including buildings in which facilities exist to monitor and control temperatures, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to initiate an immediate review of school building conditions and the installation of temperature monitoring and control systems. Supported by: Colin Fox* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
