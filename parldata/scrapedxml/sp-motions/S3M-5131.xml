*S3M-5131 Jamie Hepburn: Campsie Fells Regional Park—That the Parliament notes discussions that have taken place between East Dunbartonshire, Stirling, Falkirk and North Lanarkshire councils with Scottish Natural Heritage and Forestry Commission Scotland regarding the possible establishment of a Campsie Fells regional park; further notes the success of Scotland’s existing regional parks, Clyde Muirshiel, the Pentland Hills and the Lomond Hills, in promoting sustainable development in these areas; believes that there is considerable merit in regional park designation for the Campsie Fells, and encourages all relevant bodies and organisations to continue exploring this exciting possibility.
