*S3M-5958 Bob Doris: Congratulations to Summerston Youth Forumâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the highly successful Summerston Youth Forum, which was established only in 2009 yet now attracts upwards of 80 children each week; notes that, due to the early success of the forum, the range of activities on offer will now have to be extended and hosted on two evenings per week and will have both junior and senior sections; praises the many volunteers who have given their time and energy to improving the lives of young children in Summerston and the surrounding area, and believes that the official launch of the Youth Forum on Tuesday 16 March 2010 is a welcome landmark for all involved.
