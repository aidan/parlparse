*S2M-3831 Brian Adam: Robert the Bruce Commemoration—That the Parliament recognises the significant role that Robert the Bruce had in re-establishing Scottish independence; notes that 2006 marks the 700th anniversary of his accession to the throne of Scotland; believes that this event is worthy of commemoration and celebration; further notes, and encourages support for, local events such as that established by The Robert the Bruce Commemoration Trust; calls on the Scottish Executive, in partnership with EventScotland and VisitScotland, to organise a national celebration to promote tourism and better inform Scots of the important events in their own history, and recommends that plans also be created to commemorate other key related events in his reign, such as the Battle of Bannockburn, the Declaration of Arbroath and the Treaty of Northampton.
