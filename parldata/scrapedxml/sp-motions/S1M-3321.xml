*S1M-3321# Ms Sandra White: Future Development of Glasgow Airport-That the Parliament notes the publication of the consultation paper, The Future Development of Air Transport in the United Kingdom: Scotland; further notes that Her Majesty's Government believes that Scotland needs one new runway by 2030; is concerned at the reports that Glasgow Airport could lose out in future expansion plans, and believes that the Scottish Executive should recognise the pivotal role that the airport plays in the economy of Glasgow, the west of Scotland and indeed the nation as a whole and take whatever measures necessary to ensure that Glasgow Airport benefits from any future air transport development in Scotland.
