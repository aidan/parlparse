*S1M-1022 Tommy Sheridan: North Lanarkshire Council Direct Labour Organisation—That the Parliament notes the improved performance of North Lanarkshire Council Direct Labour Organisation (DLO) which produced a surplus of £1.59 million in financial year 1999-2000 and is estimated to produce a surplus of £1.457 million in the current financial year, despite being expected to trade internally for only nine months; congratulates the workforce for their tremendous efforts in turning around a serious deficit two years ago into a healthy surplus, which will provide extra finance for North Lanarkshire Council either to improve council services to the citizens of North Lanarkshire or reduce any council tax rises for the citizens of the area; calls upon the Scottish Executive in the light of this excellent performance by the DLO workforce to lift the statutory determination which is forcing the council to privatise its DLO service and workforce; recognises the immense benefits to local authority areas of DLOs, and believes that the current statutory determination being imposed on North Lanarkshire is completely unnecessary and does not represent best value for the citizens of the North Lanarkshire Council area.
