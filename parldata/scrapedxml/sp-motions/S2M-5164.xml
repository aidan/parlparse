*S2M-5164 Tommy Sheridan: Solidarity with RMT and NUJ Members—That the Parliament recognises and congratulates those trade union members organised by the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union (RMT), who are employed as divers by oil companies in the North Sea, and journalists in the National Union of Journalists (NUJ), employed by the Telegraphtitles, who were compelled to take part in industrial action recently to defend living standards and working conditions and who secured significant victories; hopes that these two recent victories for organised trade unionists will encourage other workers involved in struggles against arrogant bosses and employers who believe that vast wealth is fine for them but that their employees should be content with buttons, and therefore expresses solidarity with all those workers forced to embark on industrial action, including withdrawing their labour to defend their working conditions or secure a decent wage rise.
