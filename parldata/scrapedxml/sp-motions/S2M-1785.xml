*S2M-1785 Rosie Kane: Declaration on the Occasion of the Royal Opening of the Scottish Parliament—That the Parliament calls for an independent Scottish republic built on the principles of liberty, equality, diversity and solidarity; believes that these principles can never be put into practice while Scotland remains subordinate to the hierarchical and anti-democratic institutions of the British state; believes that these principles can be brought about by a freely-elected Scottish government with full control of Scotland’s revenues; believes that the right to self-determination is an inherent right, and not a favour to be granted, whether by the Crown or the British state; believes that sovereignty rests with the people and vows to fight for the right of the people to govern themselves for the benefit of all those living in Scotland today, tomorrow and in future times; further believes that the government of a country is the servant to the people, not master of the people; believes that a written constitution would guarantee, under law, everyone’s right to freely vote, speak and assemble and would guarantee the people’s right to privacy and protection and access to information on all of the government’s actions; vows to fight for the power to refuse to send our sons and daughters to kill and die in unjust wars in foreign lands and to fight for the power to banish nuclear weapons of mass destruction from our land; vows to fight for the power to acquire and restrict the use of property or lands controlled by individuals, corporations or governments beyond Scotland’s borders; vows to fight for the power to build a more equal society, free of poverty, through the redistribution of our vast wealth; vows to fight for the power to protect our soil, seas and rivers for our children and for the generations to come; swears to oppose all forms of national chauvinism, imperialism and racism, to oppose all forms of discrimination on the grounds of gender, ethnic origin, religion, place of birth, age, disability, sexuality or language; aims to fight for an independent Scottish republic in which people may live with dignity and with self-respect, free from exploitation and assuming the responsibilities of free women and men, and which will negotiate freely and as an equal with governments of other lands; affirms that its aim is not to erect walls of separation, but to build an outward-looking Scotland that will extend the hand of friendship to all the peoples of the world, and vows to continue the struggle for a free, democratic Scottish republic for as long as it may take as our fight is for freedom.
