*S3M-630 Alasdair Allan: Optimism in Scotland—That the Parliament notes the recent YouGov Scottish opinion poll, which finds that the First Minister Alex Salmond is more popular among Labour voters in Scotland than the Labour leader in the Scottish Parliament, Wendy Alexander MSP, by 25% to 20%, and more popular among Liberal Democrat voters than Scottish Lib Dem leader, Nicol Stephen MSP, by 26% to 14%; further notes that 63% of Scots in the same poll believe that the First Minister is doing a good job compared to just 25% who disagree, and believes that the hugely positive attitudes of people in Scotland to the Scottish Government is explained by a further poll finding that more people believe that the Scottish National Party is optimistic about Scotland’s future than all of the other parties added together.
