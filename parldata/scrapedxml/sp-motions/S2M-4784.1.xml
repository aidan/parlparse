*S2M-4784.1 Carolyn Leckie: Health—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4784) in the name of Shona Robison, insert at end "; believes that the case has not been made for the loss of full accident and emergency services at any of Lanarkshire’s hospitals or for the geographical separation of planned and unplanned care, and further believes that the Executive should re-examine these issues with a view to securing the future of health services in Lanarkshire with the full and genuinely democratic support of the people of Lanarkshire."
