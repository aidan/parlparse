*S2M-3607 Rob Gibson: Congratulations to Glas Cymru—That the Parliament congratulates Glas Cymru, the owners of Dwr Cymru/Welsh Water, for attaining the position of joint top-performing private water and sewerage company in Wales and England with Yorkshire Water this year; particularly notes that Glas Cymru is a not-for-profit trust that has no shareholders and reinvests all its financial surpluses for the benefit of customers; welcomes its dividend strategy which will maintain or increase the £18 level of bonus paid to its one million customers this year; believes that Scottish Water should be transformed into a not-for-profit trust in the public sector that could reduce costs to Scottish customers instead of expecting to charge excessive rates to domestic and, especially, business water users, a practice that will continue with the Scottish Executive’s chosen model, which is due for the next determination by the Water Commission on St Andrew’s Day, and notes that this practice is locking Scottish Water customers into a punitive charge regime that has resulted in capital expenditure being mainly funded by current water charge payers since 2003.
