 *S1M-766 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Pollution in Scotland from Sellafield—That the Parliament notes that the major source of radioactive pollution found on the Scottish coastline is not from Scottish nuclear installations, but from Sellafield in Cumbria; further notes that in testing for pollution in the sea off East Lothian, more man-made radioactivity can be attributed to Sellafield discharges than to the Torness nuclear generating station there; believes that it is unacceptable that the entire length of the Scottish coastline should be polluted in this way by the BNFL plant in Cumbria and therefore joins with the international community, including Iceland, Denmark and Ireland in calling for an end to reprocessing at Sellafield.
