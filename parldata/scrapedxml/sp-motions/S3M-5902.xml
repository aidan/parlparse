*S3M-5902♦ Bob Doris: Tackling Organised Crime—That the Parliament believes that the cross-party Glasgow crime summit on Monday 8 March 2010 is a welcome initiative in tackling serious and organised crime; affirms its desire to find political consensus for the various methods of tackling serious and organised crime, and would welcome further work to close in on the seemingly respectable business activities of organised criminals and find solutions that will protect the safety of the public and seize assets from criminal networks.
