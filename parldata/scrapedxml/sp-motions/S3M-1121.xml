 *S3M-1121 Iain Smith: Woodland Trust Scotland’s Christmas Card Recycling Scheme—That the Parliament supports Woodland Trust Scotland’s Christmas Card Recycling Scheme which runs until 31 January 2008 in conjunction with Waste Aware Scotland; urges people to help exceed this year’s Scottish target of 10 million recycled Christmas cards by taking their cards to special recycling bins placed in participating WH Smith, Tesco, TK Maxx and M&amp;S stores; encourages people who do not traditionally recycle to participate in the scheme, and notes that funds raised from the scheme will help to save woods and trees and will contribute towards the Woodland Trust’s projects to create new woodland.
