*S3M-670 Hugh O’Donnell: School Councils and Pupil Participation—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Scottish Consumer Council’s report, School Councils and Pupil Participation in Scottish Secondary Schools, and believes that involving Scotland’s school pupils in relevant school issues affecting them is a vital tool in developing responsible citizens who are interested in participation; believes that all Scotland’s schools should develop a fully operational school council, and supports the findings and recommendations of the report calling for substantial improvements in the quality of pupil participation, with additional investment in guidance for schools, training for school staff and council members as well as mechanisms for sharing good practice on pupil participation to ensure consistent standards across Scotland’s schools.
