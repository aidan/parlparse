 *S1M-105.1 Mary Scanlon: Public Health—As an amendment to motion (S1M-105) in the name of Susan Deacon, leave out from "the key" to end and insert "that a partnership between individuals and health providers based on shared responsibilities is a better route to improving health in Scotland than the Executive’s plans, based on "improved life circumstances" and action in relation to "health topics", which are failing the people of Scotland."
