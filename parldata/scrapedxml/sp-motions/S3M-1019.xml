*S3M-1019 David Stewart: Undermining Development: Copper Mining in Zambia—That the Parliament congratulates SCIAF, Christian Aid and Action for Southern Africa (ACTSA) on the publication of Undermining Development: Copper Mining in Zambia which focuses on Zambia’s largest copper mining company, KCM, which is majority-owned by UK-based Vedanta Resources; notes with concern the report’s key finding that Zambian society is deriving few of the advantages of copper mining while suffering many of the disadvantages and regrets the way in which particular companies’ operations compound this problem, and therefore calls for action to ensure that those UK corporations, particularly those which claim to be socially responsible investors, take their responsibilities seriously in ensuring that the companies in which they invest uphold best practice in terms of social and environmental responsibilities.
