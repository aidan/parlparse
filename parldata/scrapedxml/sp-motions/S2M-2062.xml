*S2M-2062# Dr Jean Turner: Sensitivity to Promotion of Breastfeeding—That the Parliament acknowledges that not all mothers who desire to breastfeed their babies are able to and that some may only manage for a few hours or over a period of a few weeks at best after a great deal of pain and discomfort; understands that in no way should these mothers be made to feel guilty or feel that they have not considered what is best for their child; accepts that a few of these mothers may have succeeded in breastfeeding if there had been more time for professionals to assist them through a difficult and stressful period, and considers that sensitivity in addressing all mothers’ needs, as well as promoting breastfeeding, is essential. Supported by: Mrs Nanette Milne*, Patrick Harvie*, David Mundell*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Eleanor Scott*, Mr David Davidson*, Tommy Sheridan*
