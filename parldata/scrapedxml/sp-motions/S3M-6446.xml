*S3M-6446 Jamie Hepburn: Devastating Floods in Central Europe—That the Parliament notes with concern the flash floods that have affected parts of Poland, Slovakia, Serbia and the Czech Republic; notes that the flooding has forced the closure of the Auschwitz-Birkenau Holocaust memorial, caused the evacuation of 2,000 residents in southern Poland and sadly led to the deaths of a number of individuals in these countries; sends its sympathies and condolences to all those affected, and welcomes moves by the international community to support these countries during this difficult time.
