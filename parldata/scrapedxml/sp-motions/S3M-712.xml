 *S3M-712 Aileen Campbell: Disappointment at Labour Group Voting Against Rescue Package for Scotland’s Farmers and Crofters—That the Parliament expresses grave disappointment at the disgraceful actions of the Labour group in voting against the motion on 24 October 2007 supporting a £25 million rescue package for Scottish farmers and crofters affected by the foot-and-mouth outbreak; notes that the Scottish Government’s aid package is twice the size of that of the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for England while Scotland’s industry is half the size; condemns Hilary Benn MP, the UK Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs for snubbing NFU Scotland, and believes that the betrayal of London Labour and Scottish Labour alike will not be forgiven by Scotland’s farming and crofting communities.
