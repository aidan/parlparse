 *S3M-2360 Bill Kidd: No to Privatisation of Nuclear Weapons in Scotland—That the Parliament expresses concern over the possible privatisation of the Royal Navy Armament Depot in Coulport, where Trident warheads are stored and loaded on to nuclear submarines; further notes that the Ministry of Defence (MoD) fears that in the future it may not have the personnel capable of servicing Trident and ensuring its own safe and secure practice, and believes that, given the Scottish Parliament’s opposition to nuclear weapons and the possibility that in the future the MoD will not have the skills necessary to be able to guarantee the safety of its nuclear operations, planning for the removal of Trident from Scotland should begin in earnest.
