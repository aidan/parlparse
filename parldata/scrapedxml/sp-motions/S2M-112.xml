*S2M-112# Alex Fergusson: Stranraer to Cairnryan Rail Link—That the Parliament notes the proposal of P&amp;O and Stena Line to operate a joint port at Cairnryan from which the premier British ferry crossings to Northern Ireland will operate; further notes that, following the implementation of this proposal, there will be no sailings from, or to, the port of Stranraer, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should examine the possibilities of restoring the rail link between Stranraer and Cairnryan for the benefit of both public and freight transport alike and the relief of the already fragile roads infrastructure in that region.
