*S1M-908# Elaine Thomson: Women's Pay - 30 Years on from the Equal Pay Act—That the Parliament notes with concern that 30 years after the introduction of the Equal Pay Act women earn only 73.3% of average male earnings; notes further that Aberdeen has the widest discrepancy between men and women’s earnings in Scotland, with women in Aberdeen earning only 64.2% of men’s earnings; believes that these figures clearly show that legislation in itself has failed to deliver parity in the labour market; believes that the Scottish Executive and its economic development agencies should pursue policies that would assist in the equalisation of pay between the genders, and asks the Scottish Executive, whilst pursuing the creation of a knowledge economy, to put in place adequate monitoring and evaluation to ensure that women will become equal players in the labour market. Supported by: Trish Godman*, Maureen Macmillan*, Paul Martin*, Mr John McAllion*, Marilyn Livingstone*, Johann Lamont*, Cathy Jamieson*, Dr Richard Simpson*, Bristow Muldoon*, Mike Watson*
