*S3M-3609.3 Nicola Sturgeon: Scottish Government Failures—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3609) in the name of Johann Lamont, leave out from first "notes" to end and insert "commends the Scottish Government’s record of achievement since May 2007; believes that the benefits to the Scottish people of lower council tax bills, lower business rates, lower prescription charges and a return to free education are reflected in the SNP’s excellent poll ratings; notes the Scottish Government’s six-point economic recovery plan that is providing much-needed assistance during Labour’s recession; believes, however, that additional economic powers for the Scottish Parliament, in particular borrowing powers, are essential to steer the Scottish economy out of recession and thereafter to support economic growth; condemns the £500 million in cuts that the UK Labour government plans to impose on the Scottish budget in 2010-11 and 2011-12, which will cost more than 8,000 jobs and represents a serious threat to economic recovery; calls on all parties with Scotland’s interests at heart to oppose these cuts, and looks forward to continuing a lively debate and National Conversation about Scotland’s future."
