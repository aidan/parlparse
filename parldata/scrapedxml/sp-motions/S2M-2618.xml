*S2M-2618 Ms Sandra White: Pension Rebate Gender Discrimination—That the Parliament notes the one-off council tax rebate promised to pensioners by the Chancellor of the Exchequer; further notes that this will not apply to roughly 40,000 female pensioners in Scotland; concurs with the view expressed by Help The Aged Scotland that "This one-off payment is a grotty little bribe, but even worse it is also sexist and ageist", and believes that, if a rebate is to be given to pensioners, it should be done in a more equal fashion and should not discriminate against one group in this way.
