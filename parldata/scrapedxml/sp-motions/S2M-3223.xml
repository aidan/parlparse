*S2M-3223 Michael Matheson: Support for the Scottish Football Team—That the Parliament recognises the importance of the Scottish Football Association (SFA) as the governing body of football within Scotland; praises its role within FIFA and UEFA; strongly agrees with the SFA’s views on a British football team for the 2012 Olympic Games, and disagrees with Sepp Blatter, FIFA President, for his recent misguided and ill-thought-out remarks which will have little or no support amongst those who run football in Scotland and, more importantly, those who support it. Supported by: Bruce Crawford*, Linda Fabiani*, Fiona Hyslop*, Christine Grahame*
