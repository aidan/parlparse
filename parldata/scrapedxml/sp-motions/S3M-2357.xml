*S3M-2357 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Climate Change Legislation and the Big Ask Scotland Campaign—That the Parliament welcomes the involvement of organisations such as Friends of the Earth, through its Big Ask Scotland campaign with Radiohead, in engaging the public with the issues surrounding climate change; welcomes the commitment of the Scottish Government to reducing Scotland’s impact on global climate change by setting a statutory target to reduce emissions by 80% by 2050; recognises the need to work together with our partner governments in the United Kingdom and the European Union to reduce emissions from all greenhouse gases, including those from international aviation and shipping; supports the Scottish Government’s ambition to progress continuously towards the 80% reduction target by achieving average annual emission reductions of at least 3%, which will be rigorously and regularly scrutinised, and is confident that the Scottish Climate Change Bill will adopt the most credible and effective mechanisms to ensure it provides the necessary framework to drive Scotland forwards towards a cleaner, greener and more sustainable future. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Mike Pringle*, Kenneth Gibson*
