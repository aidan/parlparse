*S3M-2450 Keith Brown: Unclaimed Pensioner Benefits at £4.6 Billion—That the Parliament notes figures published by Age Concern Scotland estimating that there are £4.6 billion in pensioner benefits that go unclaimed across the United Kingdom each year; further notes that the estimates are that at least 1 in 3 of those eligible for the main Pension Credit do not claim, at least 1 in 5 do not claim the minimum income guarantee component, at least 1 in 7 do not claim Council Tax Benefit and at least 1 in 9 do not claim Housing Benefit; believes that these figures are unacceptably high, especially given the rising costs of domestic bills such as for food and energy and that the additional income can be genuinely life-changing; welcomes the campaign by Age Concern to address this widespread problem; urges government at all levels to do all it can to simplify access to these entitlements; welcomes steps towards this objective such as the recently launched Age Concern projects in partnership with the Scottish and UK governments, and further urges all other concerned bodies to step up efforts to raise awareness and uptake of these benefits so that all of Scotland’s pensioners receive the support they deserve.
