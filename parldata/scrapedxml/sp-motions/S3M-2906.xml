*S3M-2906 Fergus Ewing: ID Cards—That the Parliament notes that the UK Government’s proposals for an ID card scheme are presently estimated by it to cost the public purse around £5 billion and considers that the scheme as proposed will not increase security, nor deter crime, and will have serious implications for the civil liberties of ordinary citizens.
