*S2M-803.2 Mr Jim Wallace: Impact of Top-up Fees on Higher Education in Scotland-As an amendment to motion (S2M-803) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from "believes" to end and insert "recognises that Scotland's distinctive higher education system is a valuable asset which must be maintained and developed for the good of the nation; further recognises that its competitive advantage must be maintained; welcomes the commitment in the Partnership Agreement that the Executive "will not support the introduction of top-up tuition fees" in Scotland; notes that the Enterprise and Culture Committee's report on its Scottish Solutions Inquiry considers that the Executive's decision to respond to developments in England by proceeding with a third phase of its higher education review in order to establish a robust evidence base "is wholly appropriate", and looks forward to this third phase of the review reporting in the early spring."
