*S3M-5135 Dr Richard Simpson: Sir John Crofton—That the Parliament is united in sadness at the death of Sir John Crofton and considers that Scotland has lost one of its most inspirational health pioneers; further notes his many achievements, such as the development of a new and effective way of treating tuberculosis (TB) in the 1950s that reduced TB in Edinburgh to almost zero in six years; commends his contribution to raising awareness about the harm caused to public health by tobacco, arguing for policies to control smoking and tobacco and calling for smoke-free legislation long before it became law in Scotland, knowing the important contribution that it would make to future public health; recognises the pivotal role that Sir John and his wife, Dr Eileen Crofton, also played in founding ASH Scotland in 1973 and believes that the ban on smoking in public places implemented by the previous Scottish Executive is a fitting tribute to his lifetime work, and welcomes the launch, earlier this year, of the Crofton Award by the Royal Environmental Health Institute of Scotland in partnership with ASH Scotland to recognise the achievements of young people in reducing tobacco and smoking-related harm in Scotland and in honour of Sir John and Lady Eileen Crofton’s tireless work over the decades on tobacco control.
