*S3M-8003 Linda Fabiani: 35th Anniversary of the Declaration of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic—That the Parliament notes that 27 February 2011 will be the 35th anniversary of the Saharan Arab Democratic Republic (SADR); considers that, although this is cause for some celebration by the Sahrawi people, there is still no just, lasting and mutually acceptable political solution that provides for the self-determination of the people of Western Sahara; believes that, as the current mandate of the United Nations precludes human rights’ protection, monitoring and reporting, the role of the UN Mission for the Referendum in Western Sahara (MINURSO) should be thus widened, and expresses solidarity on this 35th anniversary with the Sahrawi people and their demand for a free and fair referendum that allows them to decide their future.
