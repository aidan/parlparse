*S3M-4748.1 Richard Baker: Decision on Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi—As an amendment to motion (S3M-4748) in the name of Kenny MacAskill, leave out from second "notes" to end and insert "believes that the process of making this crucial decision was mishandled by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice; believes that it was wrong for the Cabinet Secretary for Justice to meet Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi in prison while considering his application for compassionate release to Libya and that this potentially sets an inappropriate precedent; also believes that it was unacceptable that the media was made aware of the decision a week before it was formally announced; does not accept that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice received or sought sufficient medical advice to make his judgement on Megrahi’s prognosis; further believes that the Cabinet Secretary for Justice did not sufficiently explore options to take account of Megrahi’s illness other than compassionate release to Libya; recognises that Scotland’s international reputation has been damaged not simply by the decision to release Megrahi on compassionate grounds to Libya but also because of the way that taking the decision was mishandled, and, given the mishandling of this process by the Cabinet Secretary for Justice, does not agree with his decision to return Megrahi to Libya on compassionate release."
