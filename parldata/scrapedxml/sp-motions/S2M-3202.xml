*S2M-3202 Ms Sandra White: Costs of Backing the British Council—That the Parliament notes that more than £2,136,000 has been spent by the Scottish Executive since 2002 on a range of joint events with the British Council, including £5,600 for a "crossroads for ideas" workshop and a five-day arts presentation in Sweden which cost £60,000; notes that many of the events held were either closed to the public or to the press and that no report of these activities was made available; expresses concern that the Executive was unable to provide a total cost to the taxpayer for 24 of the 49 events held, and urges the Executive to review its auditing procedures to ensure greater transparency and accountability in the disposal of public funds.
