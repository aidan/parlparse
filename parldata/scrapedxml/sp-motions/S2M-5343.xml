*S2M-5343 Robin Harper: Inappropriate Proposals to Regulate Psychology Profession—That the Parliament notes the deep concerns of psychologists about proposals by the Department of Health to use the Health Professions Council as a single regulatory body for all psychologists; contends that the proposals are entirely inappropriate when 60% of psychologists do not work in the health service and that many will not be regulated, particularly in Scotland; further contends that the proposals will not deliver the stronger public protection and the high professional standards required for the practice of psychology; recognises the work of the nine organisations representing psychology in seeking an agreement on alternative proposals in discussions with Her Majesty’s Government and the Scottish Executive, and strongly urges the UK Government and the Executive not to introduce any legislative instruments on this issue until such agreement is reached.
