 *S2M-287.1 Murdo Fraser: The Scottish Economyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-287) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from "endorses" to end and insert "notes, however, the poor performance of the economy with levels of growth lower than the rest of the United Kingdom, falling levels of business start-ups, rising levels of business failure and job losses in the private sector; recognises that the objective of long-term, sustainable growth is currently being hindered by high non-domestic rates, increased business water charges and a heavy burden of corporate regulation, and calls on the Scottish Executive to use its existing powers to reduce the business rate poundage to levels at least equal to those in England, to ease the burden of increased water charges that are stifling business growth and to work proactively to free businesses from undue regulation, thereby eliminating the competitive disadvantage at which many Scottish businesses find themselves relative to their English counterparts and allowing the Scottish economy to grow to its full potential."
