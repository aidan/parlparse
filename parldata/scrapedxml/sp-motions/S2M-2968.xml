 * S2M-2968 Chris Ballance: Green Transport Week and Bike Week, 11 to 19 June 2005—That the Parliament supports the aims of Green Transport Week which are “to raise awareness of the impact of excessive car use and help individuals and organisations to make positive changes in their travel habits”; further supports Bike Week and commends the dedication of participants, many voluntary, contributing to over 160 events taking place across Scotland throughout the week; notes that Scotland has had a strong cycling heritage throughout the industrial age and supports a return to widespread cycle use for transport as well as for leisure; notes that, currently, around 2% of journeys are made by bike in Scotland, compared with over 20% in other European countries; further notes that, even though there was a 24% reduction in road deaths in Scotland between 2003 and 2004, there were still an unacceptable 307 deaths in 2004; congratulates local authorities and police on achieving the target of a 50% reduction of the 1994 to 1998 average level in the number of children killed or seriously injured; notes, however, that this figure still represents more than one child being seriously injured or killed on our roads every single day of the year, and calls on the Scottish Executive to continue to promote and support measures to limit excessive car use, including considering imposing interim targets towards its stated goal of a stabilisation of road traffic levels at 2001 levels by 2021.
