*S3M-880 David Whitton: Nursery Education—That the Parliament welcomes the increase in funding entitlement to free nursery education for Scotland’s three and four-year-olds from 33 weeks to 38 weeks but is concerned that this funding, under the guidance from the Scottish Government, is available in many local authorities only from the start of the term following the third birthday of the child and leaves many parents in the position of not being able to provide a suitable nursery place for their three-year-old child until the start of the following term, and calls on the Scottish Government to review the guidance provided to local authorities to encourage funding to be available from the child’s third birthday and ensure that adequate funding is provided to all local authorities for early years education to be available from the day of a child’s third birthday.
