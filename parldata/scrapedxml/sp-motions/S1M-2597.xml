*S1M-2597# Dorothy-Grace Elder: Plight of Chronic Pain Patientsâ€”That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive and health boards should move the plight of chronic pain patients up the health agenda, chronic pain being regarded as the most neglected health issue in Scotland and possibly the biggest in terms of numbers as, according to the Pain Association Scotland, some 500,000 people suffer long-term pain through problems such as back pain and arthritic conditions, and agrees with health professionals who have appealed to the Parliament that the wreckage of many lives through lost jobs, and the loss of millions of pounds to the economy, could be relieved by ending the dire shortage of specialised pain clinics and staff in Scotland.
