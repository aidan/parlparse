*S2M-5182 Tommy Sheridan: Oppose "Back-Door" Privatisation of Ferry Services—That the Parliament expresses concern about the effective privatisation of the Gourock to Dunoon ferry route through the decision of the publicly-owned ferry operator, Caledonian MacBrayne, not to tender for the route and believes that CalMac’s decision confirms the warning of the Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union that the whole enforced tendering process amounted to "back door" privatisation of ferry services; believes that the CalMac decision leaves the Gourock to Dunoon route to be run as a monopoly by the existing private sector operator and demands assurances concerning the future jobs and conditions of those CalMac staff who currently work on the route, and further believes that ferry services and other public transport modes should be returned to public ownership and democratic control to allow maximum devotion to the safety and needs of users not to maximum profits and dividend payments for private shareholders.
