 *S3M-3859 Rhoda Grant: Meat Inspection Charges at Abattoirs—That the Parliament deplores the proposed 9% increase in meat inspection charges at abattoirs; calls on the Scottish Government to instruct the Food Standards Agency to drop this proposal; recognises that any increase will have a detrimental effect on the farming industry in the present economic climate; further recognises the work of meat hygiene inspectors and fears that this increase will make it more difficult for them to carry out their work, and urges the Scottish Government to look at ways to develop small local abattoirs in order to promote local food production.
