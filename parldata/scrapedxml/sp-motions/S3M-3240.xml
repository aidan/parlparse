*S3M-3240 Bill Kidd: Generals Say Trident Completely Useless—That the Parliament expresses concern at the UK Government’s continued commitment to renewing the aging Trident system at a cost of £20 billion and notes that the former head of the armed forces, Field Marshal Lord Bramall, argued in a letter to The Times on 16 January 2009, also signed by General Lord Ramsbotham and General Sir Hugh Beach, that nuclear weapons have shown themselves to be completely useless as a deterrent to the threats and scale of violence we currently face, or are likely to face, particularly international terrorism.
