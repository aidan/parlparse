*S3M-3446 Stewart Maxwell: 200th Anniversary of Darwin—That the Parliament welcomes the unveiling by the Royal Mail of stamps commemorating the 200th anniversary of the birth of Charles Darwin; recognises the tremendous leap forward that took place in our understanding of the origins of all life on earth with the publication of On the Origin of Species and Darwin’s theory of evolution, and welcomes the fact that, in the intervening 150 years since the theory was published, evidence has continued to accumulate to support evolution as the only credible explanation of the origin of our species. Supported by: Christine Grahame*, Rob Gibson*, Jim Tolson*, Christina McKelvie*, Jackson Carlaw*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Bill Wilson*, Liam McArthur*, Bill Kidd*
