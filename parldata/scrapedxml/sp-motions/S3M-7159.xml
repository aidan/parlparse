*S3M-7159 Patrick Harvie: Otago Lane Environmental Impact Assessment—That the Parliament notes the submission from Woodlands and Park Community Council (WPCC) to the Scottish Government, which raises the lack of an environmental impact assessment (EIA) for the proposed residential development at 65-77 Otago Street and Otago Lane, Glasgow; understands that the site is within both a green corridor and a conservation area and therefore considers that an EIA is imperative; shares the WPCC’s view that the assessment made by the consultant on the size of the development and its impact on the area is contradictory, contains ambiguous language and fails to demonstrate that an EIA is not needed; is concerned that the issues of flooding, drainage, water quality and the development’s impact on wildlife have not been adequately addressed; urges the planning committee at Glasgow City Council not to accept the developer’s argument that an EIA is not necessary, and calls on the Scottish Government to provide a sympathetic and timely response to WPCC’s concerns.
