*S3M-3609.2 Margo MacDonald: Scottish Government Failuresâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-3609) in the name of Johann Lamont, leave out from "SNP manifesto" and insert "the SNP manifesto included a commitment to a referendum on Scottish independence within the lifetime of this Parliament but believes that there should be a campaign to educate the electorate as to the differences between the devolved powers exercised by the Scottish Parliament and the reserved powers exercised by the UK Parliament before people in Scotland are asked to make a choice for or against a transfer of power from one legislature to the other."
