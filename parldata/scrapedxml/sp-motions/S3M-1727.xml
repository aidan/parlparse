*S3M-1727 Christine Grahame: And Finally... Radio Scotland Newsreading Changes—That the Parliament notes the recent change in format made to BBC Radio Scotland that has resulted in presenters of programming output being required to read the hourly and half hourly news bulletins; notes that this change, introduced by BBC management to reduce costs, is undermining the quality and authoritativeness of news and current affairs output on BBC Radio Scotland, such as Good Morning Scotland and more recently its evening radio output, and urges the BBC to reconsider the change in format which has been motivated by the need to make efficiency savings and reinstate the established format so that the quality of output from Scotland’s national radio service is not further eroded. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Kenneth Gibson*, Rob Gibson*, Alex Neil*, Gil Paterson*
