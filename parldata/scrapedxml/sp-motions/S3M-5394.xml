 *S3M-5394 Nigel Don: Rail Fares for Companions of Deafblind Peopleâ€”That the Parliament notes that, although deafblind rail passengers receive free rail travel across Scotland, people accompanying them have to pay a full fare; considers that people with a dual sensory impairment are extremely unlikely to travel unaccompanied and therefore need a companion; notes that there are currently concessionary fares available for people aged over 55 and considers that, at the very least, this could be extended to include companions of dual sensory impaired travellers, and calls on all train companies across Scotland to review their policies toward people accompanying deafblind travellers and consider introducing free travel for their companions.
