*S2M-2821 Patrick Harvie: Identity Cards Bill—That the Parliament regrets the inclusion of the Identity Cards Bill in the Queen’s Speech today; notes that a majority of MSPs backed parliamentary motion S2M-2463 which outlined various concerns with the proposals for identity cards and demanded a full statement from the Scottish Executive on the intended use of the identity database by devolved institutions; believes the proposals to be flawed on political, technical and financial grounds; notes that the introduction of this legislation will be costly, impractical and an ineffective response to problems of security and fraud; believes that the legislation poses an unacceptable threat to civil liberties and may contravene the European Convention on Human Rights; notes that, despite the Parliament’s decision on motion S2M-2463, the Executive has not yet delivered the full statement; resolves to use all powers available to it to safeguard the civil liberties of people in Scotland, and repeats its call for the Executive to comply with the terms of the motion by giving a full statement to the Parliament before the summer recess. Supported by: Carolyn Leckie*, Frances Curran*, Eleanor Scott*, Chris Ballance*, Alex Neil*
