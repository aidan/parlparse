*S3M-5117 Bill Wilson: Evidence-based Approach to Drugs Essential—That the Parliament deplores the Home Secretary’s sacking of Professor David Nutt from the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs; considers that he was fired for having the integrity to criticise UK Government policy on the classification of drugs as unsupported by scientific evidence; believes that this development is but the latest example of gross mishandling of the drugs issue by the UK Government and that its refusal to base policies on scientific evidence has seen the number of addicts soar in the last few decades, with devastating consequences for many; contends that if the UK Government spent less time worrying about signals and more time worrying about the evidence there would be less drug addiction, lower crime rates and fewer deaths, and urges the Scottish Government to continue with an evidence-based approach to drug addiction.
