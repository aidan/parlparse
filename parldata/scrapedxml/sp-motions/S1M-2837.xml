 *S1M-2837 Shona Robison: Support for Max Jimmy—That the Parliament acknowledges Max Jimmy as a former journalist for Unity Now from Sierra Leone who is claiming asylum in the UK; recognises his need for National Asylum Support Service (NASS) support whilst he awaits a decision on his asylum claim; is concerned that without vital subsistence support from the NASS he is threatened with destitution and is only managing at present owing to the goodwill of Sierra Leonean friends and small donations from press freedom organisations, and urges the Home Office to reconsider its decision not to provide Max Jimmy with the essential, basic support he needs, while awaiting a decision on his asylum claim.
