*S3M-5889 Kenneth Gibson: Lessons from Australia’s Great Barrier Reef—That the Parliament applauds the success of marine reserves in rejuvenating the health of Australia’s Great Barrier Reef; recognises that, within two years of the establishment of no-take zones, the numbers of coral trout in these reserves doubled and the coral showed fewer signs of damage; notes that the fish population is twice as dense in the designated green zones as it is in the rest of the reef; understands that, as fish in the marine reserves grow larger and more populous, they contribute their larvae to areas outside of the protected waters, benefiting the entire ecosystem and the local fishing industry; commends the Scottish Government’s commitment to countering the impact of global climate change, notably by establishing Scotland’s first no-take zone at the north end of Lamlash Bay in 2008 following a long and dedicated campaign by members of the Community of Arran Seabed Trust, and urges the Scottish Government to redouble its efforts toward environmental preservation by expanding the no-take zone in Lamlash Bay. Supported by: Sandra White*, Rob Gibson*, Alasdair Allan*, John Wilson*
