*S2M-1821 Linda Fabiani: Plight of the Saharawi People—That the Parliament notes the plight of the Saharawi people who have been forced out of their land; condemns the actions of Morocco over the last quarter of a century which have resulted in the partitioning of Western Sahara and the expulsion of the Saharawi; acknowledges the humanitarian actions of Algeria and compliments Algeria on the help it has given the Saharawi, and calls on Her Majesty’s Government to use the opportunities afforded to it as a permanent member of the Security Council of the United Nations, and in particular its term as President, to ensure that the referendum on self-determination promised for 1992 takes place as soon as possible and in a manner that ensures freedom of expression and fairness for the Saharawi people and includes the choice of independence.
