*S3M-3364 John Scott: End the Inhumane Long-distance Transportation of Live Horses for Slaughter in Europe—That the Parliament notes with concern the practice of the long-distance transportation of live horses for slaughter into and across the European Union (EU) involving an estimated 100,000 horses each year; believes that such a practice is indefensible in terms of animal welfare; also believes that existing legislation relating to such transportation and its enforcement are inadequate; supports an early review introducing short finite journey limits and space allowances that reflect the welfare needs of horses and, thereafter, rigorous enforcement by all EU member states of Council Regulation (EC) No 1/2005, which governs the transport of live vertebrate animals within the EU in connection with an economic activity, and supports the Make a Noise campaign by World Horse Welfare to end the inhumane transportation of horses within the EU.
