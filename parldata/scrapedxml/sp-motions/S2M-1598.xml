*S2M-1598 Pauline McNeill: Hillhead Children’s Garden—That the Parliament applauds the efforts of the children and parents of Hillhead Primary School in creating a children’s garden in Glasgow Botanic Gardens that aims to give local children the chance to learn about growing fruit and vegetables; believes that projects such as these allow city children to access a piece of garden and provide an educational resource for the future; notes the support given to the project by various public and private sector funders and the practical assistance in place from Glasgow City Council’s Land Services Department which also utilises the garden as a training resource for apprentices, and looks forward to the planting of organic apple trees at the site in the autumn.
