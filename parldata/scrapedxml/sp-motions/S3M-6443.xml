 *S3M-6443 Marilyn Livingstone: Revaluation of Rates for Nurseries in the Independent Sector in Fife—That the Parliament notes with concern the revaluation of rates for nurseries in the independent sector in Fife, which has seen significant rates increases on business properties; acknowledges that of the 26 nurseries in the independent sector in Fife, only four have seen increases in their rates of under 30% while 15 face increases of 50 to 100% and seven nurseries face increases of 150% or higher; understands that nurseries in the independent sector across Fife are facing these increased rates at a time of already difficult economic circumstances in which it is believed that many parents are hesitant to put their children into nursery because of the cost involved, and that this impacts on women looking to return to work; recognises that the significant increases in rates may lead to job losses and force smaller independent nurseries out of business, and urges the Scottish Government to look again at transitional rates relief to give businesses time to accommodate increased rates.
