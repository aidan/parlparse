*S2M-4117 Frances Curran: Mehmet Tarhan is Free—That the Parliament sends solidarity greetings to Mehmet Tarhan, the gay Kurdish conscientious objector who was released from military prison in Turkey on 9 March 2006; notes that the "crime" for which he has been imprisoned since 9 April 2005 was refusing to kill, as he is a conscientious objector and refused to be drafted into the Turkish army; is appalled that he suffered torture and solitary confinement while in prison and twice went on hunger strike to win equal treatment with other prisoners; considers that his release is a victory for his determination to refuse the army’s offer of avoiding the draft by allowing himself to be classified as "ill" because he is gay; considers it abhorrent that the Turkish army and police, and even teachers, are allowed to perform "virginity tests", involving forced anal and vaginal penetration of men and women, which are a pretext to perpetrate rape and other sexual violence and notes that Mehmet Tarhan refused to submit to this abuse; further notes that the court which freed Mehmet has ruled that such "tests" are a violation of human rights and considers that this precedent will help in women’s struggle against this form of legalised abuse in Turkey; is concerned that, despite his release from prison, the army could still try to force Mehmet to serve against his will; congratulates the Payday and Wages Due Lesbians organisations for their work in highlighting Mehmet’s case, campaigning for his release and for exposing the persecution of conscientious objectors in Turkey, and demands that Turkey be forced to adhere to the European Court of Human Rights’ guidance and other international rulings recognising the right to conscientious objection and to abolish from its military regulations the definition of homosexuality as an illness.
