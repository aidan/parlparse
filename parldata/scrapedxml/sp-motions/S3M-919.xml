*S3M-919 Bill Butler: Glasgow City Council’s Fire Cadet Partnership Programme—That the Parliament welcomes the ground-breaking Fire Cadet Partnership Programme pioneered by Glasgow City Council and Strathclyde Fire and Rescue; supports the aim of this programme to help young people, many of whom come from deprived areas and have no formal qualifications, to access employment with Strathclyde Fire and Rescue; applauds the programme as an innovative way of delivering training and learning and the opportunity to progress to full-time employment with Strathclyde Fire and Rescue, and commends Glasgow City Council for driving forward this partnership in conjunction with Strathclyde Fire and Rescue, Scottish Enterprise and the Glasgow Community Planning Partnership.
