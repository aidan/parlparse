*S2M-1115# Rob Gibson: Promoting Regional and Minority Languages of Scotland-That the Parliament welcomes the deliberations of the Shetland dialect conference held recently in Scalloway; notes the bearing on these deliberations of recommendations under the current review of the obligations of the Scottish Executive to meet its pledge to promote Scots under the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages; further notes that this must include creating conditions for the use of Scots in public life, through the adoption of a language policy and concrete measures, in co-operation with the speakers of the language, and considers that Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body should make a commitment to a thorough and explicit adherence to the spirit and letter of this review.
