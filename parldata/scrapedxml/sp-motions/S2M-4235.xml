*S2M-4235 Euan Robson: Access to Palliative Care for People with Chronic Progressive Conditions—That the Parliament believes that palliative care should be provided on the basis of need for people living with chronic, progressive disease; is concerned that those living with non-cancer, chronic, progressive conditions can find it very difficult to access palliative care; notes that providing palliative care offers physical, emotional and psycho-social benefits to people with chronic, progressive conditions and can also reduce demands on NHS resources through, for example, limiting the number of hospital readmissions; recognises that most palliative care needs can be addressed by ensuring that allied health professionals receive training in palliative care, and considers that the Scottish Executive should establish a national forum to develop and promote education in basic palliative care skills for healthcare professionals.
