 *S3M-677 Bill Aitken: Police Numbers—That the Parliament notes with serious concern that, almost six months after its election, the Scottish Government has made no progress towards the SNP’s manifesto commitment of 1,000 more police officers; expresses concern also at an apparent dilution of that commitment, and calls on the Scottish Government to keep that election promise by increasing the number of police officers from 16,234 to 17,234 by the end of this parliamentary session.
