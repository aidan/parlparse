 S3M-3745 Trish Godman: Renfrewshire Education Cuts—That the Parliament views with serious concern the decision taken by Renfrewshire Council to make savings in its educational budget for 2009-10 of some £2.5 million and that as part of the reduction it plans to cut music tuition from weekly to once per fortnight; congratulates those pupils who expressed their deep anger over this decision by protesting outside Paisley Town Hall before the annual Renfrewshire schools spring concert; further notes with concern that Renfrewshire has already suffered the sharpest proportionate reduction in teacher numbers in Scotland; deplores the council’s stated objective of eliminating a further 81 educational posts; believes that it is reprehensible that teachers are afraid to voice their concerns because of fear of disciplinary measures, and calls on Renfrewshire Council to withdraw the damaging education cuts to music tuition in order to encourage and support those pupils who wish to study music after school.
