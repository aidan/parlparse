 *S3M-6766 Sandra White: Concern over Pole-dancing Classes for Six-year-olds—That the Parliament expresses concern over the offer of pole dancing classes to children as young as six by a Lanarkshire-based company, Up Your Pole; believes that the practice of pole dancing is closely linked to the adult entertainment industry and as such is wholly inappropriate for minors; echoes the sentiments of children’s charity Kidscape that these classes will sexualise youngsters, may encourage paedophiliac behaviour and should be stopped, and hopes that the promoters of these classes will consider why such classes may cause concern and review their current stance with regard to their provision. Supported by: Bill Wilson*, Kenneth Gibson*, Rob Gibson*, Bill Kidd*, Gil Paterson*, Dave Thompson*
