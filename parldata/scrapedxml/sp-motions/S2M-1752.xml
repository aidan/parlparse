*S2M-1752# Mr Ted Brocklebank: Reject Clatto Hill Windfarm—That the Parliament condemns the decision taken by Fife Council to erect 17 wind turbines, at a height of 300 feet each, on Clatto Hill in north-east Fife in an area of outstanding natural beauty; notes that this decision has been taken contrary to great public opposition, in particular that of local residents who have formed the Clatto Landscape Protection Group; further notes that the decision contravenes at least nine of the council’s major planning policies and is contrary to the local plan, and considers that the Scottish Executive should reject this application when it comes before ministers.
