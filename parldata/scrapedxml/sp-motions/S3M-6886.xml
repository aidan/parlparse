 *S3M-6886 Sarah Boyack: Keeping the Heat on for Edinburgh’s Residents—That the Parliament expresses concern at the recent Ipsos MORI survey commissioned by the City of Edinburgh Council that highlighted that 22% of Edinburgh residents fear that they will not be able to afford to heat their home and that the proportion of people who can afford to heat their home has fallen since spring 2007; recognises that increased fuel prices may be a cause and may lead to more households becoming fuel poor; regrets that the UK Government is reducing the availability of the winter fuel allowance by increasing the qualifying age from 60 to 66 and considers that UK Government proposals to reduce the amount of Winter Fuel Payment are regressive and may increase fuel poverty levels in Edinburgh and Scotland as a whole, and believes that the Scottish Government needs to review the effectiveness of energy efficiency programmes to ensure that they reach people in all types of housing tenure including tenements and flats and to encourage and support local authorities in promoting the use of one-off council tax discounts to drive greater uptake of energy efficiency measures across Scotland.
