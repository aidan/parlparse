 *S1M-3248.2 Mary Scanlon: Action on Waiting and Delayed Dischargeâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-3248) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "in delivering" to end and insert "; regrets the fact that waiting times are longer than they were when the Scottish Executive took office; notes with concern a simultaneous drop in NHS activity; particularly regrets the political interference within the NHS which has led to the inconsistent and unclear record keeping within the NHS discovered by Audit Scotland; and further notes that while the Executive continues to exert political control over our health service waiting times and delayed discharges will only get worse and that the best way to deliver improvements is to put patients first by giving them real choices and devolving power to local hospitals and GPs so that decisions are taken on the basis of clinical priorities."
