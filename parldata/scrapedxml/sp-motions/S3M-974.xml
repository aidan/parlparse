 *S3M-974 Shirley-Anne Somerville: End the Spectre of Poll Tax—That the Parliament notes the publication of Citizens Advice Scotland’s latest briefing on the community charge; expresses concern that poll tax arrears can continue to be collected in Scotland up to 20 years after they are due; recognises that, due to the length of time involved, many people in Edinburgh and across Scotland find it impossible to prove that they have paid poll tax charges that councils insist are still due; further notes that the English and Welsh system for pursuing community charge debts resulted in a six-year time limit, and calls on the Scottish Government to review the prescriptive periods for the community charge.
