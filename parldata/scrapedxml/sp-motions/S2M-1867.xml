 S2M-1867 Mr Stewart Maxwell: World Osteoporosis Dayâ€”That the Parliament recognises World Osteoporosis Day on 20 October 2004; acknowledges that the consumption of carbonated drinks is a factor in the development of osteoporosis both for the calcium-leaching components of carbonated drinks and the reduced intake of milk associated with an increased intake of carbonated drinks; recognises the alarming occurrence in consumption of carbonated drinks among Scottish children who drink more fizzy drinks than any other country in Europe, and calls on the Scottish Executive to protect the bone health of future generations of Scottish citizens by banning the sale of carbonated drinks in schools.
