 *S3M-4469 Jackie Baillie: Learning Disability Week, Changing Places—That the Parliament welcomes Learning Disability Week, from 22 to 29 June 2009; notes that the theme of the week will be to highlight the need for accessible toilets in every local authority area of Scotland; recognises that around 3,500 people in Scotland with profound and multiple learning disabilities, as well as many thousands of other disabled people, cannot use standard accessible toilets and require public toilets with enough space for disabled people and their carers along with the right equipment, including a height adjustable changing bench and a hoist; supports the Changing Places campaign, which is calling for more of these toilets to be installed in public places to enable disabled people and their carers to be active citizens; further notes that British Standard 8300 recommends that a Changing Places toilet should be provided in larger buildings and complexes, and calls on the Scottish Government to reinforce this by calling on all local authorities and other public bodies to provide a fully accessible toilet in their area.
