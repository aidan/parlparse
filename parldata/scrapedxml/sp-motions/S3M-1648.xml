*S3M-1648 Robert Brown: Children’s Commissioner Report on Age of Leaving Care—That the Parliament welcomes the Sweet 16?: Age of Leaving Care in Scotland report produced by the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland which was laid before the Parliament on 25 March 2008; recognises that young people in care are probably the most disadvantaged group in Scotland today; supports in particular the Commissioner’s recommendations that proper care should normally continue until the age of 18 with appropriate support thereafter and the need for a culture change to make this a reality; is appalled at the continued use in some areas of bed and breakfast accommodation or homeless hostels for young care-leavers; recognises the importance of the corporate parent concept of the local authority and the community more generally, and calls on the Scottish Government to act to take forward the recommendations on an urgent basis to ensure that young people leaving care are properly and appropriately supported in accordance with their wishes, needs and maturity, and in a way which gives a stable foundation for their future lives.
