*S3M-3684 Rhoda Grant: Rejection for Proposals for a Separate Quota Management and Licensing System—That the Parliament rejects the SNP government’s proposals for a separate quota management and licensing system, which are potentially damaging to the fishing industry; believes that the proposals create new bureaucracy for fishermen; calls on the Scottish Government to publish any legal advice that they have taken on the competence of the proposals; urges the Scottish Government to take a coordinated approach with Her Majesty’s Government and the devolved administrations in Wales and Northern Ireland to develop a marine strategy for the benefit of the fishing industry and marine conservation, and calls on the Scottish Government to encourage cooperation between all sectors, including local fishing communities, to enable them to work to develop regional fisheries management and also work with Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) to ensure reform of the Common Fisheries Policy to enable the devolution of decision making to regional management structures.
