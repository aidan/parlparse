 *S3M-303 Jamie Stone: Compulsory Purchase of the Nigg Fabrication Yard—That the Parliament recognises that the Nigg fabrication yard remains a significant asset for the Highlands and Scotland, boasting one of Europe’s largest dry docks; notes the recent launch of two experimental wind turbines for the Beatrice oil field wind project; further notes, however, that the Wakelyn Trust which owns part of the site is unwilling to sell its share thus undermining any future potential for the economy and local employment, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive and Highland Council to investigate the compulsory purchase of the site to secure its long term use.
