*S3M-7933 Cathy Peattie: Grangemouth Biomass and Air Qualityâ€”That the Parliament notes concerns raised at the local impact of large-scale biomass plants such as currently proposed for Grangemouth and three other Scottish sites; notes also the concerns at the sustainability of such plants with regard to transportation, production and the wood and renewables markets; notes that, because of the frequency of breaches of 15-minute mean sulphur dioxide objectives, Grangemouth has been designated as an Air Quality Management Area and considers that any increase in emissions will exacerbate this problem, and is of the view that the Grangemouth, and other large-scale biomass plants, should not proceed without a full investigation of all concerns.
