*S3M-7471 David Whitton: Support for ED’s Cycle Co-op—That the Parliament celebrates the success of ED’s Cycle Co-op for what it considers its outstanding impact as revealed in the recent Sustrans Hands-Up Scotland survey; understands that almost 8% of pupils now cycle to primary schools across seven primaries in Bishopbriggs, almost three times the national average in 2009; considers that, because of the scheme, the rate at St Matthew’s Primary School, at almost 20%, is double the Scottish Government target of 10% by 2020, 10 years ahead of schedule; notes that ED’s Cycle Co-op has organised events such as the inaugural Bishopbriggs Cycle Festival, which had around 1,000 participants, and the Guinness World Record attempt at simultaneous bike-bell ringing to the tune of the Blue Danube, which was broadcast to over 2.9 million listeners on Classic FM and shown on STV Daybreak; notes a four-fold expansion of the St Matthew’s Primary School cycle club, from 32 to 128 participants, who receive cycle skills, cycle mechanics, first aid and escorted rides looking at the natural and cultural heritage around East Dunbartonshire, and nearly a 5% modal shift in cycling to primary schools in just one year, and considers that there would be an economic benefit of between £2 and 4 billion every year if Scotland could achieve European levels of cycling.
