 *S3M-4232 Kenneth Gibson: Stronger Apart—That the Parliament notes that, following the European elections on 4 June 2009, the independent nations and EU member states of Malta, Luxembourg, Cyprus, Estonia and Slovenia, with a combined population of 4.9 million, will be represented by 30 MEPs, while Scotland will have only six; recognises that Luxembourg alone, with fewer citizens than Edinburgh, will match Scotland’s total; is aware that an independent Scotland like Denmark, would have 13 MEPs, and believes that, if all the nations of the United Kingdom had independent representation, the number of MEPs in the United Kingdom would rise from 72 to around 92 and that we are therefore weaker together, stronger apart. Supported by : John Wilson*, Jam ie Hepburn*, Aileen Cam pbell*, Stewart Maxwell*, Bill Kidd*, Alasdair Allan*, Bob Doris*, Ian McKee*, Christina McKelvie*, Brian Adam *
