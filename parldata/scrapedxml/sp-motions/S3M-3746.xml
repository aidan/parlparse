 *S3M-3746 Anne McLaughlin: Acknowledging that No One is Immune to Mental Health Problems—That the Parliament welcomes the news that the Crown Office has begun offering support to those of its staff at risk of suffering mental trauma; notes that this will be beneficial not only to the individuals involved and the Crown Office but also to wider society by reducing the stigma attached to mental health problems; notes that these staff have to deal with the consequences of the most disturbing and barbaric acts on a regular basis; recognises the importance of their work to the justice system and to wider society; applauds them for their continued dedication, and hopes that this will encourage other professions to address the risk of second-hand shock among those who deal with the victims and aftermath of traumatic and disturbing incidents. Supported by: Kenneth Gibson*, Bill Kidd*, Christina McKelvie*, Bob Doris*, Alasdair Allan*, Brian Adam*, Rob Gibson*, Ken Macintosh*, Bill Wilson*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Christine Grahame*, Elaine Smith*, Aileen Campbell*, Stuart McMillan*, John Wilson*
