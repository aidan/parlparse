 *S3M-4608 Mr Frank McAveety: Reach for the Stars—That the Parliament congratulates St Anne’s Primary School in Calton, Glasgow, for achieving an outstanding report from Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Education; recognises that, in the last two years, the school has turned itself around from a poor-performing school to one that has been highly commended for teamwork, boosting ambition and improving educational attainment; draws attention to the hard work of head teacher Louise Jarvie and all staff at the school who have worked together to overcome challenges facing the pupils, including poverty and poor health, and hopes that St Anne’s will give hope to schools across the east end whose pupils face similar challenges and encourage them that they, too, can reach for the stars, which has quite appropriately become the school’s motto.
