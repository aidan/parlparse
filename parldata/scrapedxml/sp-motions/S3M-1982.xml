*S3M-1982 Johann Lamont: Congratulations to Sir Alex Ferguson and Manchester Unitedâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Manchester United FC on winning the UEFA Champions League after a final which was an excellent advert for the quality of British football; sends the warmest of congratulations to the manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, a son of Govan, who has by his talent and endeavour become the most successful manager Britain has ever had; acknowledges the significance of his contribution to professional football across the globe, and, in particular, commends him for remaining true to his roots in giving unstinting support to Harmony Row football club in his home city, allowing some of the most disadvantaged young people in Scotland to experience the joy and the benefits of participating in sport.
