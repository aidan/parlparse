*S3M-421 Cathie Craigie: Antonine Wall World Heritage Site—That the Parliament welcomes to Scotland UNESCO representatives judging the Antonine Wall’s bid to win World Heritage status; notes that Scotland already has four world heritage sites, recognised across the world and of significant importance to Scotland in cultural and economic terms; recognises that tourism is Scotland’s biggest industry and that the majority of visitors from overseas visit a historic site during their stay; believes that the inclusion of the Antonine Wall in the list of Scotland’s world heritage sites would boost tourism across the central belt, from the Kinneil fortlet at Bo’ness on the River Forth, through Callendar Park, Bonnybridge, Castlecary, Croy Hill, Twechar and Bearsden, to the fort site and rampart base at Duntocher, and hopes that the bid is successful to help preserve the most northerly boundary of the Roman Empire for generations to come.
