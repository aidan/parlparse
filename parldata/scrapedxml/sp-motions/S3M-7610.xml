*S3M-7610 Patrick Harvie: Extrajudicial, Summary and Arbitrary Executions on Grounds of Sexual Orientation—That the Parliament condemns the decision on 16 November 2010 by the Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee of the United Nations to remove a reference to sexual orientation from a resolution on extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions; recognises that in many countries lesbian, gay, and bisexual people, as well as transgender people, remain at risk of execution as a result of prejudiced laws and public attitudes; congratulates the United Kingdom, the United States of America, Australia, New Zealand and many European countries for voting to retain the reference to sexual orientation; welcomes the commitment of Susan Rice, the US ambassador to the UN, to restore this reference when the resolution is discussed by the General Assembly, and urges the global community, in opposing all extrajudicial, summary and arbitrary executions, to recognise that prejudice on grounds of both sexual orientation and transgender identity are being used as justification for what it sees as offensive and unacceptable actions. Supported by: Bob Doris*, Marlyn Glen*, Stuart McMillan*, Cathy Peattie*, John Wilson*, Pauline McNeill*, Patricia Ferguson*, Bill Kidd*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Gil Paterson*, Anne McLaughlin*, Christina McKelvie*, Robin Harper*
