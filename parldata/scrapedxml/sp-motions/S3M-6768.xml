 *S3M-6768 Kenneth Gibson: Scottish Parliament Election and the Proposed Alternative Vote Referendumâ€”That the Parliament notes its concern at what it considers the contempt that the UK Government has shown to the Scottish Parliament with its proposal to hold a referendum on the alternative vote system on the same day as the 2011 Scottish Parliament election; believes that, in choosing the date, UK ministers did not give Scotland a thought and simply forgot that the election was being held here; considers that, while the Scottish public could cope with two elections on the same day, the UK-wide publicity generated about the referendum could overshadow the Scottish election campaign; acknowledges that voter turnout across the United Kingdom could vary considerably between areas where elections are and are not being held, potentially impacting on the legitimacy of the referendum result; considers that all parties in the Scottish Parliament have long accepted that no other ballot should be held on the same day as the Holyrood election, and urges both the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats in the Scottish Parliament to restate that this remains their position.
