*S2M-1474 Mr Jamie Stone: Downgrading Caithness Maternity Services-That the Parliament notes the serious concerns of the residents of Caithness and north-west Sutherland regarding the continuing uncertainty facing Caithness General Hospital maternity services; is concerned that NHS Highland's proposals to downgrade maternity services will increase risks to mothers and children associated with childbirth and hinder attempts to increase employment and reverse population decline in the far north; believes, therefore, that the preservation of the existing round-the-clock consultant cover is essential, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to NHS Highland in order to prevent this downgrading.
