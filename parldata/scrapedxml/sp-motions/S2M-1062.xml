*S2M-1062 Donald Gorrie: Support for Sport and Youth Activities-That the Parliament is concerned about the problems faced by many sports clubs in attracting young people, providing good quality coaching and giving them enough opportunities to play their sport, because of the lack or cost of facilities, the inadequate or non-existent funding of clubs from local or national sources and the lack of sport or physical activity in the lives of many young people; calls on the Scottish Executive, local authorities and bodies such as sportscotland to provide an effective, extended curriculum in schools, including enough student and staff time to provide good opportunities for sports, music, drama and other activities and enough staff time to fully develop liaison between secondary schools and sports clubs and a full programme of sports and other activities both in schools after school time and at clubs, and recognises the contribution made by school staff and club volunteers to the development of after-school sport through modest honoraria or other gestures and active measures to attract more voluntary helpers for sport and youth activities.
