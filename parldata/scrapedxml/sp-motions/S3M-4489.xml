*S3M-4489 Christine Grahame: National Library?—That the Parliament notes and deplores the decision of the National Library of Scotland to remove Saltires and items of tartan from workplaces across the organisation; notes further the implication in a string of internal emails by senior management that these items may be considered racist and may offend non-Scottish colleagues; considers that such attitudes and actions have not been evident in Scotland since the purging of tartan and other identifiable symbols of Scotland under the 1746 Disarming Act introduced by the Westminster Parliament, and calls on the National Library of Scotland to issue an unreserved apology over this apparent slur to the national flag of Scotland and other Scottish iconography.
