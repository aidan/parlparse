*S2M-4666 Brian Adam: Scottish Homes’ Failure to Have Roads, Footpaths and Lanes Adopted Prior to Stock Transfer—That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to mount an investigation into why Scottish Homes transferred housing estates to other housing associations without ensuring that all roads, pavements and car parks were brought up to adoptable standards and transferred to local authority control and furthermore calls on the Executive to instruct Communities Scotland, Scottish Homes’ successor organisation, to stop washing its hands of this situation and to take action to try to resolve this debacle, which has left many householders faced with the prospect of paying for the upgrade of these roads and pavements.
