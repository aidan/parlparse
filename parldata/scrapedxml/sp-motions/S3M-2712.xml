 *S3M-2712# Bill Butler: Show Racism the Red Card’s Fortnight of Action—That the Parliament supports Show Racism the Red Card’s (SRTRC) 5th annual Fortnight of Action, which takes place from 16 to 30 October 2008 and will see a number of high profile events aimed at tackling racism and celebrating cultural diversity at football matches across the country; notes that, since it inception in Scotland, SRTRC has proved consistently successful in using football as a tool to challenge racism, ignorance, intolerance and bigotry in both sport and wider society; recognises the quality of SRTRC educational resources and programmes, which are rolled out across schools in Scotland; welcomes the development of SRTRC’s Islamophobia package, which seeks to challenge many of the myths that have become attached to the subject of Islam, and wishes the Scottish Parliament’s football team the best of luck with its contribution to the campaign when it plays against the SRTRC team at Tynecastle on 17 October 2008.
