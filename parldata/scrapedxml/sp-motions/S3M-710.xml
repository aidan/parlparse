*S3M-710 Kenneth Gibson: Peace in the Middle East—That the Parliament acknowledges that peace in the Middle East can only be achieved through the establishment of a viable Palestinian state which recognises Israel’s right to exist within secure borders; is aware that significant difficulties would remain, partly due to the continuing ramifications of the 1916 Sykes-Picot Agreement which aligned middle-eastern boundaries to suit the perceived interests of the British and French empires, taking no account whatsoever of the ethnic, linguistic and religious differences on the ground; notes that one of the most pressing issues is the statelessness of the Kurdish people; accepts that stability is not possible while 25 to 30 million Kurds are denied the right to self determination; believes that the claims made by the "Coalition of the Willing" regarding its aim of establishing democracy in Iraq are hollow unless Iraqi Kurds, of whom 99% plus support independence for Iraqi Kurdistan, are allowed to determine their own future and recover the lands from which they were ethnically cleansed by Saddam Hussein; considers that those regions of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey where Kurds form a majority of the population should be allowed, under UN auspices, to vote for the establishment of an independent, unified and democratic Kurdistan; agrees that forcing Iraqi Sunni and Shia Arabs to live together in one state against their wishes is futile, and accepts that allowing Arab Iraq to partition along sectarian lines might be the surest road to securing long-term peace in that tormented country.
