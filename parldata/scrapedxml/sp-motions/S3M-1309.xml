*S3M-1309 Jim Tolson: Food Without Fear Campaign—That the Parliament recognises the importance of the proper handling by chefs and caterers of allergens in loose foods in hospitals, schools and eating establishments; notes the recent publication of guidance by the Food Standards Agency (FSA) to increase the understanding of chefs and caterers and to protect consumers with a food intolerance; recognises that people with coeliac disease have an autoimmune disease and that the only treatment is a lifelong adherence to a gluten-free diet; notes that for people with coeliac disease eating in hospital can be restrictive and potentially unsafe if proper guidelines are not followed; urges hospitals to improve the availability of gluten-free choices and chefs and caterers in all eating establishments to do the same; calls for the impact of the new FSA guidance on the handling of allergens in loose foods to be monitored to achieve greater understanding, awareness and gluten-free choices on menus, and supports Coeliac UK in its Food Without Fear campaign to raise chefs’ and caterers’ awareness and understanding of coeliac disease to ensure that eating out through pleasure or need for those who suffer from this condition is made less restrictive.
