*S3M-914 Jeremy Purvis: Vulnerable Child Witnesses—That the Parliament recognised the World Day for Prevention of Child Abuse on Monday 19 November 2007; notes that young witnesses who may have experienced sexual or physical abuse are still required to undergo direct questioning and cross-examination in court; further notes that inappropriate questioning can be harmful both for young witnesses and for the quality of their evidence; recognises that special measures under the Vulnerable Witnesses (Scotland) Act 2004, while welcome, do not address the issue of inappropriate or intimidating questioning of children in court; welcomes the Scottish Government’s consultation on the use of intermediaries for vulnerable witnesses, and looks forward to a positive debate that may lead to the introduction of intermediaries into the Scottish court system in the near future.
