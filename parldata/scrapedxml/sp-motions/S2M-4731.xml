 *S2M-4731 Roseanna Cunningham: Overt Acts of Religious Belief—That the Parliament notes with great concern the damage done to Scotland’s international reputation by the reported decision to caution Artur Boruc for making the sign of the cross during a football match; notes the belated explanation from the Crown Office that the caution related to gestures other than the sign of the cross, and believes that, in view of the damage already done, the Lord Advocate should make an explicit statement to the effect that overt expressions of religious belief are not and will not be regarded as criminal acts in Scotland.
