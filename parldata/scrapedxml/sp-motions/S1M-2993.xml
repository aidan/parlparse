 *S1M-2993 Mr Jim Wallace: Prison Estates Review-That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the consultation paper Proposals for the Future of the Scottish Prison Service Estate; believes that to help achieve a safer Scotland the prison estate should facilitate the secure holding of prisoners and the delivery of effective rehabilitation programmes, and that prisons should provide a reasonable standard of accommodation; recognises that these objectives can only be achieved by substantial modernisation of the present prison estate, and encourages all interested individuals and organisations to contribute to the current consultation.
