*S3M-6964 Irene Oldfather: 2010 Business Rates Revaluation, Ayrshire—That the Parliament acknowledges the concerns of the Ayrshire Chamber of Commerce and Industry regarding the latest revaluation of business rates; notes that these rates were set based on information as at 1 April 2008 and did not take into account the current economic climate; further notes the decision by the Scottish Executive to remove the relief, which could have supported businesses now facing rate increases of up to 200%; further notes that a transitional relief has been retained in England, limiting annual increases to a maximum of 12.5%, and that Northern Ireland has withdrawn its 2010 revaluation due to the substantial changes in the economic climate; acknowledges the views of the chamber of commerce that the reintroduction of transitional relief to support businesses and an urgent review of the rating appeals process are considered vital in order to help companies in Ayrshire return to a period of growth, and calls on the Scottish Executive to support businesses in Ayrshire and help those businesses hardest hit by the revaluation.
