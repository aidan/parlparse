*S3M-1747 Michael McMahon: Congratulations to Hamilton Accies—That the Parliament congratulates Hamilton Academical FC on winning the Scottish First Division title and gaining promotion to the Scottish Premier League; notes that this success comes only a few years after the club was in a position where it had no home ground, was unable to pay the players wages and was punished by the Scottish Football League in a manner which many consider to be unfair, all of which put the club’s very existence at risk; notes the efforts of Chairman, Ronnie MacDonald, and manager, Billy Reid, for turning the club’s fortunes around, and wishes all staff, players and supporters good luck for season 2008-09. Supported by: Tom McCabe*, Charlie Gordon*, Bill Butler*, Jamie McGrigor*, Helen Eadie*, Bashir Ahmad*, Stuart McMillan*, Kenneth Gibson*
