*S3M-4437 Kenneth Gibson: Service Personnel Travelling Time—That the Parliament notes with disapproval that the Ministry of Defence (MOD) currently counts travel time to and from service areas as part of service members’ well-deserved vacations; believes that service men and women, who risk their lives for their country, should be afforded full 14-day vacations excluding time in transit and therefore enabling them to have more contact with friends and family, calls on the MOD to make the necessary changes as soon as is practically possible, and believes that the inaugural Armed Forces Day on 27 June 2009 would be an appropriate date to make such an announcement.
