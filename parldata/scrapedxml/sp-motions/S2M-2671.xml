 * S2M-2671 Mr Duncan McNeil: Baby and Infant Mortality in Inverclyde—That the Parliament notes the publication of the Registrar General’s 2004 Preliminary Return; expresses concern that the figures reveal that Inverclyde has the highest rate of stillbirths and perinatal deaths per 1000 in Scotland, that neonatal deaths stand at over two and a half times the national rate and that infant deaths are more than double the national average; further notes that these figures follow the re-organisation of maternity and paediatric services by NHS Argyll and Clyde; acknowledges that these figures are unacceptable, and calls on the Scottish Executive and NHS Argyll and Clyde to investigate and address the reasons behind these mortality rates.
