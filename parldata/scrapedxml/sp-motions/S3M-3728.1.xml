 *S3M-3728.1 Rhona Brankin: Science in Scotlandâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-3728) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, after "problems" insert "; agrees with the comments of the Royal Society of Edinburgh that "It is vital that Scotland remains an integral part of the UK science base", that the "integration offsets one of the problems of small countries in research, that they cannot be internationally competitive in all sectors of research and the businesses that rely on it" and that, consequently, "an attempt to devolve Research Council functions would be a seriously retrograde step"".
