*S3M-7508 Cathy Peattie: Carers Rights Day—That the Parliament notes that Friday 3 December 2010 is Carers Rights Day; acknowledges and values what it considers the substantial contribution made by over 700,000 unpaid carers and young carers across Scotland; welcomes the practical and emotional support provided by the network of Princess Royal Trust for Carers Centres across Scotland; recognises what is seen as the critical work of Falkirk Carers Centre in identifying and supporting over 53,000 carers and young carers; understands that, despite what it considers their valuable work and social impact and the inclusion of £5 million of Carer Information Strategy funding for NHS boards in the draft budget, carers organisations across Scotland continue to face significant funding challenges as a result of local government cuts, and believes that all parties should demonstrate their support for unpaid carers in the Parliament and in local constituencies and regions across the country as carers centres wait to hear about local core funding over the coming weeks.
