 *S1M-2089 Mr Keith Harding: Record Council House Rent Arrears in Scotland—That the Parliament notes with dismay that the annual amount of council house rent arrears in Scotland has risen from £40 million in 1997 to £60 million last year; further notes that if collection levels had been maintained at 1997 levels an extra £40 million would have been available for projects such as improvement and homelessness programmes or for even lower rents over the past three years, and believes that this position is a damming indictment of the appalling management of council finances exhibited particularly by Labour administrations.
