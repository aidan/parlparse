*S1M-1500# Euan Robson: Scottish Borders Labour Force—That the Parliament notes the recent studies which have shown that a skills shortage is likely to develop in the labour force in the Scottish Borders in the next few years, creating particular challenges for traditional industries such as textiles and also for the construction industry, and therefore urges all relevant agencies to develop plans for training, retraining and upskilling, which will also assist in attracting high technology inward investors to broaden the base of the Borders’ economy and in expanding attractive job opportunities for young people near their home localities.
