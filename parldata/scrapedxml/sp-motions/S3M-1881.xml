*S3M-1881 Keith Brown: The National Game on Terrestrial Television—That the Parliament notes the new findings of the Scottish Broadcasting Commission that there is an overwhelming 96% public support for Scotland’s international football matches being shown on free-to-air terrestrial television from among those interested in football and even 70% support from those who would not watch it; recognises that only one-third of households have access to subscription TV services; supports the right of the entire Scottish public to see the national team playing the national sport, and reiterates calls for this to take place, either through successful and wholehearted bidding by terrestrial broadcasters or through the exercise of government powers to reserve Scotland matches exclusively for terrestrial television.
