*S2M-5603 Christine Grahame: National Tartan Register - Located in Hawick—That the Parliament notes the growing backing for a proposed national tartan register for Scotland and urges ministers to give close consideration to such a register being housed in the National Genealogy Centre, currently under construction in the Scottish Borders’ town of Hawick, as an appropriate location; notes that placing the register in Hawick would represent a major boost for the area, and believes that the additional jobs created by locating the register in Hawick would be of significant benefit to an economy hit by a spate of redundancies in textiles and electronics.
