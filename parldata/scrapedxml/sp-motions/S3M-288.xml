*S3M-288 Sandra White: Welcome Victory for Mesothelioma Sufferersâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the decision reached by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence overturning its earlier decision to refuse the prescription of Alimta for suffers of mesothelioma; notes the dedicated campaign by many groups, including the Clydebank Asbestos Group and MSPs, in highlighting this issue and galvanising public opinion behind the right of mesothelioma suffers to have access to Alimta, and hopes that this decision, along with the provisions in the Rights of Relatives to Damages (Mesothelioma) (Scotland) Act 2007, will lead to a great improvement in the lives of those suffering from this terrible disease.
