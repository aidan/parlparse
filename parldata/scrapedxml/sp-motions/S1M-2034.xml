(2) The purposes of this allowance are to enable a member: - to engage as an employee (whether full-time or part-time, temporary or permanent) or through an agency or on a contract for services, personnel to assist the member in carrying out his or her Parliamentary duties. The allowance shall include employers’ costs other than employers’ National Insurance contributions and employers’ pension contributions which are provided for under paragraph 2; to establish and run an office, within the constituency/region from which the member was returned; to meet with constituents either on a one-to-one basis or as a group; subject to sub-paragraph (16), to meet his or her travelling expenses and overnight expenses relating to travel commencing within Scotland to destinations within the UK (but outside Scotland) and return incurred whilst undertaking Parliamentary duties; to pay fees of attending a seminar/conference which relates to the member carrying out his or her Parliamentary duties; to meet travelling expenses, overnight expenses, and fees of attending a seminar/conference incurred by a member's staff or volunteers who are assisting the member in his or her Parliamentary duties, which costs are not otherwise covered by paragraph 7; to pay staff and volunteer training costs; where any member pays an employee a "one-off" bonus payment, to meet any employers’ National Insurance contributions which arise; subject to sub-paragraphs (16) and (17) to meet travelling expenses and overnight expenses relating to travel to Brussels/Strasbourg for meetings with members of the European Parliament and/or representatives of European Union institutions, as part of his or her Parliamentary duties.

(6) Whilst the remuneration of employees shall be the responsibility of the member the SPCB shall provide: - payroll services for members’ employees; and arrangement for employers’ pension contributions to be paid to an employee’s choice of pension scheme, and members shall provide the SPCB with details about their employees to enable the SPCB to provide such services and make such arrangements. (7) A member may pool his or her allowance with another member or other members in order to employ employees who are shared between or amongst them, provided that: - the employee remains employed by a single member; and the members concerned give written notice to the SPCB.

(11) Where sub-paragraph (9) applies in relation to a region mentioned in Section C of Annex C (Eligibility for exceptional needs allowance: The largest regions), the SPCB: may determine after inquiry that the regional members concerned may run one additional office because that is necessary for the regional members concerned to carry out their Parliamentary duties effectively; and in those circumstances may increase the amount of this allowance to which each of the regional members concerned is entitled by such a sum as the SPCB may determine but the total of such increases shall not exceed 100% of the notional amount of £12,000 referred to in sub-paragraph (9) above, and under no circumstances shall any increase under this provision result in the maximum Members’ Support Allowance specified in sub-paragraph (1) above being exceeded.

(13) A constituency member may locate his or her Parliamentary office base in a constituency other than the one from which the member was returned provided that the location has prior approval of the member returned from that other constituency and the SPCB is notified immediately. (14) An amount of £12,000 for each constituency member and the amount computed in accordance with sub-paragraph (9) above for regional members per financial year for the establishment and running of an office are notional but the actual amount to be spent shall be for each member to determine subject to the limit of his or her Members' Support Allowance. (15) Where local office costs are higher than in other parts of Scotland due to the state of the local economy, a member may refer the matter to the SPCB for its determination as to whether the member should be eligible for an allowance greater than the maximum Members’ Support Allowance mentioned in sub-paragraph (1) but any increase shall be not greater than 10% of the notional amount of £12,000 per financial year.
