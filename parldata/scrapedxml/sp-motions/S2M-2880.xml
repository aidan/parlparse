 * S2M-2880 Patrick Harvie:Rising Cost of ID Cards—That the Parliament notes the Home Office figures showing that the estimated charge to individuals for identity cards has increased to £93 per card and expects this to be the first of many increases in cost to both the individual and the taxpayer; further notes that the annual running costs for the scheme are currently estimated at more than a half a billion pounds; further notes that the success rate for the biometric technology used with the proposed ID card scheme was shown to be worryingly low at 69% during recent tests, and restates its view that the ID card scheme proposed by the UK Government is flawed on political, technical and financial grounds.
