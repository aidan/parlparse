*S3M-4908 Liam McArthur: 2009 Greenspace Survey—That the Parliament notes the results of the 2009 survey undertaken by Greenspace Scotland that shows that 63% of Scots use their local greenspaces every week, up from 49% five years ago, and that 86% agree that it is important to have a greenspace in their local area; further notes that the most popular uses of greenspaces are walking, relaxation, exercise and play, all of which contribute to an individual’s health and wellbeing; believes that this amply demonstrates the importance of greenspaces and the need to maintain and improve them so that everyone has easy access to well managed greenspaces, and urges government at all levels to ensure that the provision of well managed greenspaces is given a high priority along with work to encourage people from all backgrounds and ages to make full use of their local greenspaces.
