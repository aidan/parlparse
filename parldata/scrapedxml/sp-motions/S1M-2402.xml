 *S1M-2402# Alex Fergusson: Research into Myalgic Encephalomyelitis-That the Parliament notes the privately funded research to be carried out by Dr Derek Pheby in Bristol, and that being carried out by Dr Vance Spence in Dundee, into the factors which may be involved in the development of severe myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME); recognises that ME is a condition growing in incidence among both adults and children in Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive should take the lead within the UK by commissioning further research under the remit of the NHS into the causes of, and cures for, this debilitating condition. Supported by: Mr John McAllion*, Mary Scanlon*, Nicola Sturgeon*, Tommy Sheridan*, Margaret Smith*, Robin Harper*
