*S3M-7639 Alasdair Allan: BBC Alba on Freeview—That the Parliament notes that the BBC Trust has, on 21 December 2010, given approval for the Gaelic language digital television channel, BBC Alba, to be shown in Scotland on Freeview following its review of the service; recognises that this comes following what it considers to have been a sustained and strong campaign from within and outwith the Gaelic community, which saw over 5,000 responses to the BBC Trust’s public consultation on this issue; is encouraged to note for the future of the channel that four out of every five viewers are non-Gaelic speakers, and believes that BBC Alba is bringing Gaelic to Scotland as a whole and is helping to provide a major boost to the Scottish broadcasting industry and is acting as a real confidence boost to the Gaelic language at a critical point in its history. Supported by: John Wilson*, Willie Coffey*, Kenneth Gibson*, Aileen Campbell*, Rob Gibson*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Christina McKelvie*, Bob Doris*, Jamie McGrigor*, Ian McKee*, Ted Brocklebank*, Gil Paterson*, Bill Kidd*
