*S2M-3224 Shiona Baird: Don’t Shop at Supermarkets Day—That the Parliament welcomes Don’t Shop at Supermarkets Day 2005 on 3 September which encourages consumers to purchase goods at alternative food retailers such as farmers’ markets and small, independent stores; further welcomes the start of Organic Week 2005, from 3 to 11 September, and the annual Dundee Flower and Food Festival, from 2 to 4 September, which play an important part in promoting a vibrant, mixed food-production system and market in Scotland; notes the plight of Scottish dairy farmers, who do not receive a fair price for their goods, and the concerns voiced by the North West Cattle Producers’ Association that cattle farming in north Scotland is increasingly under threat from cheap imports, and calls on the Scottish Executive to respond urgently to concerns regarding the monopoly of supermarkets and the impact that supermarket price wars have on Scottish small businesses and producers in the light of the recent decision by the Office of Fair Trading not to improve the supermarkets’ code of practice.
