*S3M-2012 Jamie Hepburn: Effect of Fuel Prices on Mileage Rates for NHS Staff—That the Parliament notes with concern the effect that rising fuel prices are having on low-income groups dependent on driving for work; in particular, notes that NHS district nurses are often required to travel for work purposes and yet NHS mileage rates, which are set at a UK level, have not changed since 2002; believes that fair reimbursement of work-related expenses is a necessity especially for low-income groups, and supports the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) in its negotiations with NHS employers across the United Kingdom to find a suitable solution that realistically reflects the nature of changing fuel prices and their impact on RCN members. Supported by: John Wilson*, Jamie Stone*, Mike Pringle*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Brian Adam*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Bob Doris*, Christina McKelvie*, Willie Coffey*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Alex Neil*, Bill Kidd*, Rob Gibson*, Sandra White*, Alasdair Allan*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Kenneth Gibson*, Bill Wilson*, Elaine Smith*, Jackson Carlaw*
