*S2M-1572 Christine Grahame: The Unclaimed Millions-That the Parliament welcomes the research commissioned by Macmillan Cancer Relief into the extent of unclaimed disability living allowance by people with a terminal diagnosis of cancer, undertaken by the Centre for Economics of Health at the University of Wales, Bangor; notes with concern the figures that show that 64% of people with terminal cancer in Scotland did not claim, amounting to nearly Â£15 million unclaimed and affecting 9,783 people; notes also that many others living long term with cancer are also eligible for benefit so the true amount going unclaimed, and the number of people affected, is much higher; further notes that Scotland has the lowest claim rate in the whole of the United Kingdom and that someone in Scotland with cancer is twice as likely not to claim benefit as someone in Wales and almost three times as likely not to claim as someone in Northern Ireland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to improve the targeting of funds to ensure that this vulnerable group receive the access to benefits they are entitled to and, further, to work with local NHS boards to introduce measures to address patients' financial concerns.
