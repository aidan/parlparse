* S3M-5618 Karen Whitefield: A Deafening Silence—That the Parliament notes the recent report, Diabetes UK survey of people with diabetes and access to healthcare services 2009, which reveals that children and young people with diabetes feel that they are being ignored and disenfranchised; further notes that 56% of children and young people want to see better communication between their diabetes care team and schools so that they can receive the necessary joined-up support to manage their diabetes better; believes that hundreds of children and teenagers with diabetes in Scotland are at risk of developing serious health complications because they feel that healthcare professionals and schools do not always listen to their needs and help them control their diabetes, and calls for improved provision of and access to educational and psychological support for children and young people with diabetes in Scotland.
