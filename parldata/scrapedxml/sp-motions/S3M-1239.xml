 *S3M-1239# Aileen Campbell: Penguin Publishers and the Future of Scottish Publishing—That the Parliament regrets the decision made by leading publishers, Penguin, to end its presence in Scotland and its reported comments that "it made more business sense" to commission Scottish writers from London; considers that this is an ironic decision, given that Penguin will be leaving Edinburgh, a UNESCO City of Literature, and at a time when Scotland celebrates its most famous writer and bard, Robert Burns; believes that the decision could have a significant impact on both publishing in Scotland and the effective nurturing of Scottish literary talent in the south of Scotland and throughout the country, and further believes that Penguin’s decision should be reconsidered.
