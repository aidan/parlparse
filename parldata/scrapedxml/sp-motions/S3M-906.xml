*S3M-906 Bill Wilson: Cancelling Stamp Duty for Disabled People—That the Parliament notes the recent report from the Disability Rights Commission, The Disability Agenda; supports its proposal to remove stamp duty for disabled people purchasing property that will require substantial alteration to meet their needs; recognises the cancellation of stamp duty for disabled people to be a reserved matter that has been inadequately addressed by Westminster; acknowledges that the definition of "disabled person" is purposefully wide and that only those with needs likely to require substantial alteration to their houses should benefit, and calls for an inquiry to assess the development of a "passport" benefit to assist those entitled to either the higher rate care or mobility elements of the Disability Living Allowance plus those entitled to Attendance Allowance in order to offset the additional cost of adaptations. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Alex Neil*, Stuart McMillan*, Bill Kidd*
