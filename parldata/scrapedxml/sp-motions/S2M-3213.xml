*S2M-3213 John Swinburne: Big Lottery Seniors Fund—That the Parliament welcomes the introduction of the Young People’s Fund by the Big Lottery Fund, allowing young people to access directly the grant distribution process and encouraging the youth of Scotland to contribute positively to their communities; notes, however, that no similar scheme is to be set up for the older sections of society; further notes the sizable proportion of lottery players who are senior citizens, and, recognising the wide network of pensioners’ groups and elderly forums who could make a positive input, urges the Scottish Executive to encourage the Big Lottery Fund to introduce a Seniors Fund, to be set up with the same purpose as the Young People’s Fund, allowing our older citizens to use their experience for the positive benefit of our communities.
