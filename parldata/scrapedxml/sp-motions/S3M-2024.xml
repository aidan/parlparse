*S3M-2024 Bill Kidd: The Labour Party’s Cash Crisis—That the Parliament notes the serious financial difficulties facing the Labour Party, which has five weeks to find over £7 million pounds to pay off outstanding loans or face the possibility of the Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP and other senior officials becoming personally liable and subsequently facing possible bankruptcy; believes that the scale of continuing financial mismanagement within the Labour Party raises serious concerns over its ability to control the finances of the United Kingdom, and further believes, that given that according to Labour sources "the party’s constitution is like a five-a-side football club", it is of little wonder that so few voters now trust the UK Government.
