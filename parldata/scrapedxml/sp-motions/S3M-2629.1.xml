 *S3M-2629.1 Kenny MacAskill: Age Limits on Purchases of Alcohol—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2629) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from "rejects" to end and insert "welcomes the period of consultation, listening and debate that is happening in Scotland on how to rebalance the country’s relationship with alcohol; welcomes the initiatives being taken at local level, including voluntary agreements not to sell alcohol to persons under 21; notes the ongoing work done by licensing boards and other partners to implement the Licensing (Scotland) Act 2005; recognises the need to build on that legislation with further measures including the ending of irresponsible alcohol promotions, and acknowledges that given the major public health implications failure to take further action to tackle alcohol misuse is not an option." Supported by: Nicola Sturgeon*
