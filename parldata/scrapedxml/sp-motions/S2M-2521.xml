*S2M-2521 Donald Gorrie: First-time House Purchasers—That the Parliament urges the Scottish Executive to press the Chancellor of the Exchequer to raise the threshold at which house-buyers have to pay stamp duty from £60,000, the figure that it has been since 1993, to the equivalent related figure for current house prices, estimated to be £156,000; notes that 59% of Scottish first-time buyers now pay stamp duty compared to virtually none in the 1990s, and believes that this change would help new first-time buyers to enter the housing market.
