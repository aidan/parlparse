*S2M-218 Richard Lochhead: Save Scotland's Ink Recycling Industryâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the potential impact that the implementation of EU Directive 2002/96/EC on waste electrical and electronic equipment could have on the business of ink cartridge refill shops and the prices of printer ink and toner for the Scottish consumer; endorses the petition under way at cartridge refill shops across Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make representations to the United Kingdom's Department for Trade and Industry to ensure that the transposition of the directive into domestic Scots law does not penalise Scottish businesses or consumers in favour of multinational manufacturers of ink cartridges.
