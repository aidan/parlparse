*S3M-2672 John Farquhar Munro: Compensation for Sea Eagle Predation—That the Parliament recognises the success of the sea eagle reintroduction program, which has seen the birds breeding well; notes however that this has resulted in crofters and farmers loosing many lambs as a result of predation; further notes that a scheme on Mull, Lochaber and Skye compensates for stock losses due to sea eagle predation, and believes this scheme should be extended to Wester Ross and all areas where there is evidence of sea eagle predation.
