*S3M-564 Ken Macintosh: Parents Have a Right to Care—That the Parliament is concerned that parents caring for a child with cancer often struggle to balance their commitment to work with caring for their sick child; acknowledges that 49% of parents end up using their own sick leave or holiday allowance to care for their children with cancer; notes that families experience financial stress when their child is diagnosed with cancer and that 43% of families suffer a higher level of debt as a result; highlights the benefits to employers of looking after employees with caring responsibilities; recognises that parents now have the right to request flexible working arrangements but agrees with the children’s cancer charity, CLIC Sargent, that parents have a right to care, and urges the Scottish Government to work with the UK Government in the development of a carers’ strategy that provides the paid leave and career breaks, as well as the support, advice and information, that parents caring for children with cancer desperately need. Supported by: Elaine Smith*, Cathy Peattie*, Cathie Craigie*, George Foulkes*, Mike Pringle*, Bill Butler*, Hugh Henry*, James Kelly*, Patricia Ferguson*, Robin Harper*, Irene Oldfather*, David Whitton*, Robert Brown*, Marlyn Glen*, Des McNulty*, Elaine Murray*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Bill Kidd*
