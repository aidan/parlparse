 *S3M-8019 Jackie Baillie: NUS Scotland LGBT Campaign, There’s More to my Education—That the Parliament welcomes National Union of Students (NUS) Scotland’s new lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) campaign, There’s More to my Education, which seeks to improve the experiences of the LGBT community when accessing mental health services; notes that the campaign’s first reception, networking and lobbying event is scheduled to be held in the main hall on 8 March 2011; considers that mental health and creating positive mental health should be priorities for the Parliament, and believes that mental health services across Scotland should be open and free from judgement on the basis of sexuality and that the Scottish Government should ensure the inclusion of LGBT-specific elements in mental health anti-stigma campaigns.
