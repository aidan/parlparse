* S3M-5784 Dr Richard Simpson: International Rare Disease Day—That the Parliament welcomes the third International Rare Disease Day on 28 February 2010; notes that there are over 6,000 rare diseases affecting approximately 300,000 people in Scotland; supports the focus of this year’s Rare Disease Day on the importance of research for the majority of rare disease patients who are without adequate treatment or a cure, and joins Rare Disease UK in calling on the Scottish Government to build on the strong research and development base in Scotland to develop a framework to encourage further research and development for rare diseases and develop a strategy and implementation plan for their diagnosis and management.
