*S1M-465# Scott Barrie: Positive Discipline of Children—That the Parliament believes that in a modern Scotland concerned with social justice for all there is no place for the concept of "reasonable chastisement" of children; that children should have the same protection under the law as adults from being hit; that a new, modern legislative framework would be the best basis from which to promote positive discipline; that such policies would keep more children safe, support families and assist in the development of a less violent, more caring society, and that failing to scrap the Victorian defence of "reasonable chastisement" and trying to define where a child can be hit, how a child can be hit and with what a child can be hit, is a recipe for confusion and fear for parents and fails children in the new millennium.
