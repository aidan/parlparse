*S2M-3276 Tommy Sheridan: Support for North Action Group and the Retention of Full Maternity Services at Caithness General Hospital—That the Parliament congratulates the North Action Group for its persistent and untiring campaigning to retain full maternity and gynaecology cover in Wick, with 24/7 consultant cover; is concerned that the long-term future of these services has still not been secured; is further concerned that the impact of a loss of consultant services will lead to an unacceptable increase in the numbers of women unable to give birth near their homes and families and an increase in high-risk transfers of mums and babies and that the issue of travelling time and its consequences for outcome has not been reconciled by NHS Highland, and believes that nothing less than full consultant cover will ensure the health and well-being of all women and babies in Caithness and equality of access to maternity services.
