*S2M-1194# Scott Barrie: Recognition of Jack Vettriano-That the Parliament notes the increasing popularity, both at home and abroad, of the Fife-born and bred artist Jack Vettriano; notes the sale by auction of his most recognised work, "The Singing Butler", for a record amount for a painting sold in Scotland by a Scottish artist; notes with dismay that not one of his works appears in any of our national galleries, and believes that at least one of his paintings should be obtained by one of our national institutions to recognise his contemporary popularity and national significance. Supported by: Christine May*, Janis Hughes*, Rhona Brankin*
