*S3M-5822 Brian Adam: Observer Status for Taiwan—That the Parliament notes with disappointment that Taiwan is still not a member of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) or the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO); considers that Taiwan is vulnerable to global warming and rising sea levels and is a key regional air hub with an air traffic control that services over 1.34 million flights a year; believes that if the UNFCCC is to succeed it must be an inclusive organisation seeking the co-ordination of all countries in their efforts to tackle climate change; believes that Taiwan can make a valuable contribution to the UNFCCC as a forum to discuss with other countries its efforts to reduce carbon emissions and to learn from the experience of others; considers that if Taiwan was given access to the ICAO it would be provided with up-to-date international standards and norms that would improve the safety of its civil aviation industry, and therefore believes that Taiwan should be invited to attend and be given at least observer status at all future UNFCCC and ICAO meetings.
