 *S3M-7444# Dave Thompson: Publication of the SIGN Guideline on Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis—That the Parliament welcomes the publication by the Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) of the guideline, Diagnosis and Management of Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis in Adults, as a potentially important milestone in the treatment of psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in Scotland; understands that this is the first ever clinical guideline of its kind internationally to draw together what is considered to be the best available evidence on diagnosing and treating psoriasis and PsA; notes that the prevalence of these conditions in Scotland is estimated at between 2% to 3% of the population, with over 100,000 people affected by the condition; further notes that approximately one in every five people with psoriasis will also have PsA where the body’s immune system misfires against its own joints and tendons, causing inflammation, pain and disfigurement; welcomes the guideline’s key recommendations, which include proposals that dermatology and rheumatology professions should work together to manage patients with severe joint and skin disease, that health professionals be made aware of the link between psoriasis and PsA and the need for early diagnosis and treatment, that healthcare professionals should be aware of the need to consider comorbid conditions such as diabetes, hypertension, coronary heart disease, inflammatory bowel disease, lymphoma and depression in patients with psoriasis and PsA, that all patients with psoriasis and PsA should receive best practice and optimal treatments as advised by the new SIGN NHS Quality Improvement Scotland care pathway, that there should be an annual review for all patients with psoriasis and PsA, that the active involvement of patients in managing their care should be encouraged, that treatment options, risks and benefits should be discussed with the patient, allowing them more opportunity to be involved in decision making and that all patients suspected of having PsA should be assessed by a rheumatologist to make an early diagnosis and provide appropriate treatment thereby reducing joint damage, and would welcome early implementation of these key recommendations in the Highlands and Islands and across Scotland.
