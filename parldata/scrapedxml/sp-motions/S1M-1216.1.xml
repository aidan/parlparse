 *S1M-1216.1 Fergus Ewing: Scottish Tourism-As an amendment to motion (S1M-1216) in the name of Mr David Davidson, leave out from "recognises" to end and insert "notes that tourism in Scotland faces considerable competitive disadvantages in comparison with countries such as Ireland in respect of the high pound, high levels of tax on fuel, high business rates and lower resourcing for generic and other promotion; believes that those involved in the tourism industry are to be congratulated for their work and the measure of success achieved despite these disadvantages; further believes that the tourism strategy launched by the Scottish Executive, whilst it has certain good elements, cannot in itself meet the needs of the sector, and calls for (a) an immediate assessment of the efficacy of the Ossian on-line booking system, (b) targetting of resources to permit locally based marketing, (c) a review of the level of landing charges in our airports and (d) a commitment that the area tourist board structure will be amended in the light of the conclusions of the local economic forums with the aim of finding the best solution for each area."
