 *S2M-4512 Christine May: Welcome for Research into the Co-operative and Mutual Sector—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of research by Heriot Watt University on the scale of the co-operative and mutual sector in Scotland; recognises that co-operative and mutual sector turnover represents 5.6% of Scottish GDP; further notes that this turnover is produced by 426 co-operatives and 10 mutuals across a wide range of businesses from small island shops, credit unions, employee-owned businesses to retail, farmer and fishermen’s co-ops; further recognises that these co-ops and mutuals have over 2,540,000 members in Scotland, which shows that over 49% of the Scottish population already has a relationship with the sector, and believes that this research gives a solid basis for Co-operative Development Scotland to begin its work to further develop the co-operative and mutual sector in Scotland.
