 *S3M-3732 Alison McInnes: Bike Belles—That the Parliament welcomes the Bike Belles initiative, recently lauched by Sustrans, that seeks to persuade more women to take up cycling; notes that less than one in 10 women cycle more than once a month and that women in Scotland are among the least likely in the United Kingdom to cycle; further notes the many health benefits that cycling brings at comparatively low cost compared with many other methods of staying in shape, and therefore encourages more women to visit the Bike Belles website to see whether cycling could be right for them. Supported by: Robin Harper*, Johann Lamont*, Liam McArthur*, Mike Rumbles*, Claire Baker*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Bob Doris*, Robert Brown*, Marlyn Glen*, Hugh O’Donnell*, David Stewart*, Mike Pringle*, Trish Godman*, Stuart McMillan*, Mary Scanlon*, Des McNulty*, Bill Kidd*, Maureen Watt*
