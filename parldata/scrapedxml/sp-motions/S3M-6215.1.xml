 *S3M-6215.1 Murdo Fraser: Democratic Reformâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-6215) in the name of Robin Harper, leave out from "UK" to end and insert "first-past-the-post electoral system has delivered decades of strong and stable government in the United Kingdom; regrets that the adoption of proportional representation for European elections has resulted in the election of members of the British National Party; supports the retention of first-past-the-post for Westminster elections, and calls for the necessary reforms to be made to the system so as to ensure a fairer outcome in future UK elections."
