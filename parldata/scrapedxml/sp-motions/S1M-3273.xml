*S1M-3273 Robert Brown: Amnesty International—That the Parliament commends the work of Amnesty International in fighting for human rights across the world and, in particular, in Israel and Palestine; welcomes the independent perspective brought to the Middle East conflict by Amnesty International; recognises that human rights must be at the centre of any peace process in the region, and urges Her Majesty’s Government to use all efforts to work for a peace settlement based on full recognition of human rights and the rights of both Israelis and Palestinians to live within their own independent and secure borders.
