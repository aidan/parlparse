*S3M-1521 Mr Frank McAveety: Commonwealth Games Benefits the East End of Glasgow—That the Parliament recognises the commitment to developments in the east end of Glasgow and, in particular, the development of the M74 Motorway, proposals for the National Arena and Velodrome, the expansion of Tollcross International Aquatics Centre and investment in housing-led regeneration across the east end, including the development of the Athletes’ Village and, recognising the previous investment in schools across the east end, acknowledges the work of the community and the role of eastenders in shaping their future; welcomes the Evening Times’s positive portrayal of the changes for the east end, and calls on all agencies, especially the city council, the Scottish and UK governments and the voluntary sector to work together with the local community to continue the transformation of the east end of Glasgow.
