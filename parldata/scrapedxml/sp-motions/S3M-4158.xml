*S3M-4158 Christina McKelvie: Liber8 Lanarkshire—That the Parliament commends the work of Liber8 Lanarkshire, South Lanarkshire’s only community-based alcohol service; notes that Liber8 has provided counselling and support to over 1,000 adults in the last two years, has already experienced a 30% increase in user numbers during 2009 and is expanding its youth service with a new pilot in North Lanarkshire; further notes that, thanks to Scottish Government funding, Liber8 has recently moved to bigger purpose-designed premises in Blantyre; applauds Liber8 on its proactive approach to staff training, which has so far resulted in eight volunteers making the transition to becoming paid staff; believes that such community-based alcohol services are vital tools in reducing the effects of alcohol misuse and promoting responsible attitudes to drinking in Scotland, and welcomes the Scottish Government’s reaffirmed commitment to tackling alcohol abuse with targeted funding of £36 million for 2009-10, which will enable services such as Liber8 to reach and help even more individuals, families and communities affected by alcohol misuse.
