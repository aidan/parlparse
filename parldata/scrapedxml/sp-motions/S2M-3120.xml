*S2M-3120 Christine Grahame: Alcohol Misuse and the Remediesâ€”That the Parliament recognises the valuable work done by Borders Counselling on Alcohol and Substances (BCAS); notes its commitment to promoting a healthy and responsible approach to alcohol use, providing counselling, education and support to those suffering from alcohol/substance misuse and their families; congratulates the volunteers on their essential work; notes that in the Scottish Borders there were, in 2002-03, 119 alcohol-related hospital discharges of people aged 24 and under, representing 43 per 10,000 population compared with the Scottish rate of four per 10,000, an increase in such discharges in the Borders of 25% since 1998 against a national increase of 15%; further notes with concern that discharges with alcohol-related liver disease have risen by 64% in the Borders compared with 37% Scotland-wide and that alcohol-related deaths have increased by 70% compared with 15% nationally; considers therefore that, while congratulating BCAS, the substantial sums spent by the Scottish Executive on national advertising to deter excessive drinking are failing, with the consequential costs to human well-being and to society, and therefore calls on the Executive to set up an independent inquiry as a matter of priority to establish which interventions, both short, medium and long term, will reverse this worrying trend both Borders-wide and elsewhere.
