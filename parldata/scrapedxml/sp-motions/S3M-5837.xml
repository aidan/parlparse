*S3M-5837# Gil Paterson: We Like Milngavieâ€”That the Parliament notes the launch of the campaign group known as We like Milngavie, which was set up to oppose plans by Tesco to double the size of its current premises in Milngavie; considers that this would seriously affect the village theme of the Milngavie town centre; believes that local town centres are the lifeblood of any local community and that town centres across Scotland are losing their character; further considers that there is increasing local opposition to these plans, and would welcome consideration of the views of the people of Milngavie and Bearsden with regards to this proposed development with a view to not overdeveloping the sight.
