*S2M-2246 Rosie Kane: Climate Change—That the Parliament notes with concern the bad weather currently experienced by Scotland; agrees that the impact of this weather is a direct result of a lack of commitment on the part of successive Westminster and Holyrood governments to address the issue of climate change; calls on the Scottish Executive, in light of the current flooding and the upcoming G8 summit being hosted by Scotland, to initiate an immediate cessation of all non-essential road building projects in Scotland such as the M74 extension, an immediate cessation of all building on floodplains, an immediate cessation of draining of wetlands including proper river basin management and an immediate nationwide project of native broadleaf tree planting.
