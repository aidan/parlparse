* S3M-5786 Aileen Campbell: Intangible Cultural Heritage in Scotland—That the Parliament recognises the importance of the work being undertaken by Edinburgh Napier University in association with UNESCO through the Intangible Cultural Heritage (ICH) in Scotland project to record and protect the traditions, dances, celebrations, superstitions, sayings, customs, beliefs and skills being practised in Scotland; notes that this is a nationwide initiative that encourages all communities and individuals living in Scotland to take part and contribute; hopes that it is successful in safeguarding living cultural practises across Scotland which help shape people’s sense of identity, and encourages everyone to get involved and help build the ICH in Scotland’s wiki national database, which is accessible to everyone and available at http://ichscotland.org/.
