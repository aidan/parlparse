*S1M-630 Dorothy-Grace Elder: American Navy Exercise at Cape Wrath—That the Parliament expresses its outrage to President Clinton and to the British Ministry of Defence over Cape Wrath being shelled by the American Navy, following the expulsion of their ships from a firing range on Puerto Rico because the death of a local person and widespread environmental damage; condemns the Ministry of Defence for not consulting with the Parliament before inviting the US Navy and others to bombard Cape Wrath, as other areas of the world refused them permission; calls upon President Clinton, and the leaders of other nations whose navies are queueing up to shell Scottish soil, to withdraw the ships involved immediately and ensure they do not return, thereby showing respect for human life in Scotland and for the Scottish environment, especially in view of President Clinton’s previous involvement, in having Georgian uranium flown secretly to Dounreay in 1998 after the American public refused to have it processed in the United States; notes that while the US Navy claims it will not use depleted uranium cannon rounds at Cape Wrath it gave the same assurances to Puerto Rico and subsequently accidentally fired 267 depleted uranium rounds, flattened entire hills and polluted air, water and soil with toxic residues, and further asks that it be noted that this motion is supported by the proposed cross party CND group.
