 * S2M-2398 Christine Grahame:Tory Comments—That the Parliament condemns the comments of Dominic Grieve, the Conservative Shadow Attorney General, who stated on “Good Morning Scotland” on Monday 7 February 2005 that “The problem in Scotland has absolutely nothing to do with immigration levels. I’m afraid it is to do with the fact that Scotland is not a very attractive place for people to come and settle”, comments which demonstrate an insulting and ignorant attitude to Scotland, and calls on him to apologise to the people of Scotland. Supported by: Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Alex Neil*, Fergus Ewing*, Michael Matheson*, Fiona Hyslop*, Rob Gibson*, Brian Adam*, Jim Mather*
