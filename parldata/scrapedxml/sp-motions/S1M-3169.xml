 *S1M-3169 Brian Adam: The Parliament thanks Aberdeen-That the Parliament expresses its thanks to the University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen City Council and all Aberdonians for the welcome and the hospitality that we received in the Granite City during our historic sitting in Europe's oil capital; considers that, in the words of the city's famous toast, we were "Happy to meet, sorry to part and happy to meet again, Bon Accord!", and calls on the Parliamentary Bureau to give consideration to the Parliament meeting outwith Edinburgh periodically, including returning to Aberdeen.
