 * S2M-2320.3 Shiona Baird:Energy Policy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2320) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from “is concerned” to end and insert “welcomes the political consensus that climate change is a reality and that alternatives to fossil fuel energy sources must be developed in order to curtail emissions of greenhouse gases; strongly believes that Scotland’s energy future requires a wide range of environmentally-sustainable energy sources; agrees with the Enterprise and Culture Committee’s Inquiry into renewable energy that Scotland needs to develop urgently all forms of renewable energy including marine, on and off-shore wind and solar sources; believes that a much greater focus on energy efficiency across all sectors must be central to any energy policy; notes the International Atomic Energy Agency’s view that nuclear power will be unable to halt climate change and considers that the case for nuclear power in Scotland’s long-term energy future remains completely unconvincing, and calls for more powers over energy policy to be devolved to the Scottish Parliament.” Supported by: Mr Mark Ruskell*, Chris Ballance*, Robin Harper*
