*S3M-6444 Bill Butler: RMT Industrial Dispute—That the Parliament notes the continuing dispute between First ScotRail and the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) that has resulted in six days of industrial action being taken since February 2010; believes that the issue at the heart of the dispute is what it considers to be First ScotRail’s refusal to abide by the agreement that the company would not, during the current franchise, remove conductors from any of the services on which they are now present; is concerned at First ScotRail’s refusal to negotiate on this issue; is further concerned that published correspondence between the Scottish Government’s transport agency, Transport Scotland, and First ScotRail reveals that the company decided to proceed with plans to remove conductors only at the behest of Transport Scotland and following firm indications that Transport Scotland would exercise a provision in the franchise agreement to reimburse any losses incurred by First ScotRail that arise from industrial action; urges the Scottish Government to intervene to ensure that Transport Scotland and First ScotRail honour the existing agreement with the RMT, and calls on the Scottish Government to state that it will not reimburse First ScotRail for any losses or costs incurred arising from the current dispute with RMT.
