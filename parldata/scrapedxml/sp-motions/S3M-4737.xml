 *S3M-4737 Stuart McMillan: Winter is Looming so Time to Contact The Energy Saving Trustâ€”That the Parliament recognises that the winter months are nearing in Scotland and considers that it is vital that people, especially those on low incomes and older people, contact the Energy Saving Trust to ascertain what assistance is available to them to tackle fuel poverty; notes that the Energy Saving Trust, which manages the Energy Assistance Package on behalf of the Scottish Government, takes an integrated approach to tackling fuel poverty by reducing high fuel costs through giving advice on social tariffs and improving the energy efficiency of properties through advice, insulation and heating measures; further notes that there is a free telephone advice line that people can contact on 0800 512 012 to seek assistance, and urges all constituents who are concerned about the winter months ahead to contact the advice line as soon as possible.
