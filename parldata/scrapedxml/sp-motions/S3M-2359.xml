*S3M-2359 Bill Kidd: BBC Licence Fee Payers Unfairly Punished—That the Parliament regrets the perverse nature of the fine imposed on the BBC by Ofcom for deceiving its audience by faking winners of competitions and deliberately conducting competitions unfairly, which sees £400,000 of licence fee money paid to the UK Government; believes that such action is unjustifiable as licence fee payers, the very people who were deceived, are in effect being punished for the failings of BBC management and producers, especially given that the investigations found that in some cases the production team had taken premeditated decisions to broadcast competitions and encourage listeners to enter in the full knowledge that the audience stood no chance of winning and that, overall, Ofcom found that the BBC failed to have adequate management oversight of its compliance and training procedures to ensure that the audience was not misled, and calls on Ofcom to review this decision with a view to disciplining the management and production teams responsible.
