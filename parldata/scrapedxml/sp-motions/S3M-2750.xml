*S3M-2750 Tavish Scott: Shetland Times Petition on Airline Chargesâ€”That the Parliament notes that airlines are adding extra charges to their basic ticket prices; further notes that such extra charges often include the use of debit and credit cards and seat reservations; is concerned that such charges often seem to bear very little relationship to the actual costs that the airlines face and that such extra charges have been imposed on the air services between Shetland and the UK mainland; understands the concerns that this has raised and believes that there should be no charge for using a debit card or for reserving a seat and that the charges applied to credit cards should reflect the actual cost to the airline, and congratulates Shetland Times on its petition campaign to see seat reservation and debit card charges dropped and credit card charges lowered.
