 *S3M-5257 Bill Kidd: Partnership in Action—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the innovative and exciting Public Social Partnership projects to promote the design and delivery of public services through the third sector, which have at their heart the aim of supporting and improving the lives of some of the most vulnerable members of our communities; particularly welcomes the Registers of Scotland and Haven project, which will explore ways of expanding current levels of employment for disabled people, given the high percentage of disabled people stuck in the poverty trap as a result of the low level of employment, and wishes these pilot projects every success in meeting their worthy aims and in serving as an example of best practice for future public social partnerships. Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Brian Adam*, Bob Doris*, Stuart McMillan*
