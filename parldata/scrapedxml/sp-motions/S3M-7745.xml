 *S3M-7745 Richard Baker: Congratulations to Anne Marie Carrie, New Barnardo’s UK Chief Executive—That the Parliament congratulates Anne Marie Carrie on her appointment to the post of Barnardo’s UK chief executive; notes her long career as a public servant in Scotland, including roles as a community centre manager in Glasgow, teacher in West Lothian, further education lecturer in Edinburgh and director of education and children’s services in East Lothian; notes her call on her first day in office for greater government action to tackle child sexual exploitation; notes the evidence from Barnardo’s Scotland that the age of young victims of sexual exploitation appears to be dropping and that exploitation is becoming more organised; understands that Vulnerable Children Guidance Pack: Sexual Exploitation Through Prostitution, published by the Scottish Executive in 2003 is the most recent set of Scottish guidance for professionals focusing on sexual exploitation; notes the commitment in the guidance to commissioning research on the nature and scope of the problem in Scotland; believes that sexual exploitation of children is a horrific form of abuse and that such abuse is not confined to any one area or racial group; believes that the Scottish Government should make good the commitment made in 2003 to commission research into the nature and scale of child sexual exploitation, and further believes that the Scottish guidance on child sexual exploitation should be revised and refreshed to take account of the changes, particularly in internet use, since its publication in 2003.
