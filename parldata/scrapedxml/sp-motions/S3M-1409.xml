*S3M-1409 Kenneth Gibson: Abducted and Missing Children—That the Parliament notes with concern that no figures for abducted and missing children in Scotland are collected by either governmental or charitable agencies; is deeply disturbed that, according to the Police National Missing Persons Bureau and Parents and Abducted Children Together (PACT), over 100,000 children go missing every year in the United Kingdom, approximately one child every five minutes; is alarmed that up to one-third of these children are under the age of 13; is distressed that child abduction offences in the UK have more than doubled in a decade; understands that the America’s Missing Broadcast Emergency Response (AMBER) Alert System introduced in the USA more than 10 years ago has, according to research carried out in the field, saved the lives of more than 200 children; approves of this system whereby when a child is reported missing to the police, in a matter of minutes all the country’s police forces are alerted, TV and radio programmes are interrupted and a picture of the missing child is flashed onto the screen, alerts appear on motorway electronic notice boards, text messages are sent out to all mobile phone subscribers and border posts and airports are notified along with Interpol, Europol and foreign police forces; understands that speed is critical in locating missing and abducted children; is disappointed that in a Europe which boasts of ever closer union, there are no European protocols, no common policies and there is no electronic infrastructure to ensure a co-ordinated European response when children are abducted or go missing, and calls on the Scottish Government to press upon the UK Government the importance of working in close partnership with other EU member states to create the necessary infrastructure to enable a rapid response from the police and public alike.
