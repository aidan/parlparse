*S2M-2022# Richard Lochhead: Scottish History—That the Parliament recognises the educational and cultural benefits of promoting Scottish history from ancient to modern times in our schools; notes that this will allow pupils a greater understanding of Scotland in European and global contexts and will encourage a balanced perspective; appreciates that this will cultivate greater confidence and self-awareness in pupils, and considers that the Scottish Executive should investigate the level of Scottish history taught in our schools with a view to attaching greater importance to the subject.
