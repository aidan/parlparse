 * S2M-2833# Paul Martin: Closure of Clydesdale Bank Branches—That the Parliament condemns the decision by National Australia Bank to close 60 Clydesdale Bank branches within Scotland over the next 18 months; notes that research has demonstrated that the closure of branches triggers an outflow of economic activity and threatens the long-term survival of communities, particularly when a bank is “the last bank in town”; believes that closures will have a devastating impact on local communities, particularly in poorer areas where alternative banking is not accessible, and will affect the most vulnerable and least able to travel, such as older people, the less able and parents with young children, and considers that the National Australia Bank should reconsider this massive programme, particularly where a closure will leave communities without any local bank.
