*S1M-2450 Hugh Henry: World AIDS Day: 1 December 2001â€”That the Parliament notes World AIDS Day on 1 December 2001 and the "Out of sight, out of mind" campaign; further notes that recent figures published show that 91 people have been diagnosed as HIV positive in the first six months of this year compared with 154 in total for the previous year and that, if this trend continues for the rest of the year, it would represent an 18% increase over last year; further notes that, if the number of people aged 15 to 24 being diagnosed as HIV positive continues at the current rate, there will be a 47% increase by the end of the year, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to undertake a high profile national campaign on HIV and AIDS awareness.
