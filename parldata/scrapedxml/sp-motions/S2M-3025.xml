 * S2M-3025 Eleanor Scott:Preventing Childhood Obesity—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of Preventing childhood obesity by the British Medical Association (BMA); notes with concern that nearly one-in-three Scottish children are overweight by the age of 12, that around half of 13-year-olds drink sugary drinks and eat sweets every day, while less than one quarter eat vegetables every day and that less than one third of 13-year-old girls and less than half of boys meet the guidelines for moderate physical activity; further notes that recent research indicates that the treatment of ill health caused by poor diet costs the NHS over £170 million per year; further notes, while commending initiatives taken by the Scottish Executive to date to address the issue, the BMA’s recommendations, in particular those on mandatory standards for school meals, on banning the sale of unhealthy food and drink products in schools and on improving access to sport and recreation facilities within schools and communities, and calls on the Executive to go further and adopt these recommendations in its attempts to improve Scotland’s health.
