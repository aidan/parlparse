*S2M-662 Mike Watson: Rugby World Cup-That the Parliament congratulates the England team on its victory over Australia in the final of the Rugby World Cup; notes that its success was the result of four years of dedication and preparation based on a strong club structure, which contains valuable lessons for the Scottish Rugby Union; trusts that England will use its term as world champions to help develop the game further throughout the world, and hopes that, before defending its title in 2007, it might commission a National Anthem of its own.
