*S3M-443.3 Jeremy Purvis: The Scottish Government’s Skills Strategy—As an amendment to motion (S3M-443) in the name of Fiona Hyslop, leave out from "the Scottish Government’s" to end and insert "and regrets that the strategy contains no specific targets or indicators of success for improving skills in Scotland, fails to respond to the recommendations of the Leitch Review of Skills and makes no commitment to increased investment in further or higher education; calls on the Scottish Government to amend its strategy to include specific skills targets, including targets for modern apprenticeships and widening access, and details of how it will measure progress towards these targets and commit to report annually to the Parliament on that progress, and further calls on the Scottish Government to commit to providing an additional £168 million for Scottish universities and at least a 3% real terms annual funding increase for Scotland’s colleges over the period of the spending review to ensure that the sectors can make an increased contribution to improving skills in Scotland."
