*S3M-3818 Margaret Mitchell: Congratulations on the Opening of the New Burns Memorial Centre—That the Parliament congratulates East Ayrshire Council on the opening of the new Burns Monument Centre at the Kay Park, Kilmarnock; congratulates East Ayrshire Council architects, 3D8, for their interior design and Hunter and Clark for the restoration and new building work; recognises that this is an exciting development for East Ayrshire and Scotland as a whole, bringing together first-class facilities to provide a research room and PC room that will now house previously scattered local history archives and records from each of the East Ayrshire burghs; notes that the centre will provide access to family history, census and burial records and will act as a complete guide to family and local history in the area; commends the fact that the centre will also house a collection of 1,500 volumes of Burns poetry, songs and letters as well as providing new registration services for the area, a new conference centre and a new venue for weddings and ceremonies, and hopes that the new centre will revitalise Kay Park and that it will be a source of pride for local residents, attracting many visitors to the area and resulting in a massive boost to tourism in the Year of Homecoming 2009.
