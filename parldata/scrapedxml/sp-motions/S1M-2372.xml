*S1M-2372 Ms Margo MacDonald: Institutional Racism-That the Parliament welcomes the First Minister's comments during First Minister's Questions on 25 October 2001 that "institutional racism must be stamped out, no matter where it occurs - whether in government, the police or the courts" (Official Report, Col. 3387); recognises the racism inherent in the treatment of asylum seekers who have already been stigmatised and excluded, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive, as a first step, to implement this commitment to stamp out racism and make immediate representations to Her Majesty's Government to abolish the voucher system which shames us all.
