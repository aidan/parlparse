*S2M-4845 Cathy Peattie: ADHD Awareness Weekâ€”That the Parliament notes that 18 to 24 September 2006 is the first national ADHD Awareness Week, which takes as its theme "ADHD is REAL"; congratulates groups such as Falkirk-based Ecosse Adders, set up to promote awareness of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and to provide information and free practical help to sufferers, both adults and children, and their families; notes the increasing recognition that ADHD is under-diagnosed and that it may affect 5% of the population; further notes that with appropriate help most hyperactive children will settle down and catch up with learning and social interaction by the time they reach their mid-teens, and believes that the Scottish Executive should promote public awareness and better understanding of ADHD and ensure that those affected have access to appropriate advice and support.
