 *S3M-1138 Helen Eadie: Organ Donors and Presumed Consent—That the Parliament commemorates the first heart transplant just 40 years ago when a team of 30 doctors and nurses, led by Dr Christiaan Barnard, Professor of Cardiothoracic Surgery, gave a new heart to Louis Washkansky, a 53-year-old grocer who was suffering grave heart failure; notes that the kidneys of the dead donor, Denise Darvall, were transplanted into a black boy in another hospital; welcomes the announcement by the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown MP, and Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, Nicola Sturgeon, that they back the policy of "presumed consent"; notes that 1,000 people die every year while waiting for organs, and applauds the people of Spain where there are more organ donors per head of population than anywhere else in the world.
