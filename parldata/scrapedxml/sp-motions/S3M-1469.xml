*S3M-1469 Jackie Baillie: West Dunbartonshire Youth Services—That the Parliament welcomes the range of services available to young people in West Dunbartonshire including Y Sort-it and the Youth Trust; notes that both organisations are run by young people for young people; further notes that Y Sort-it provides health drop-ins, a mobile information centre with computers and chill-out rooms and advice to young people; further notes that the Youth Trust provides a variety of grants to promote initiatives for young people in West Dunbartonshire; believes that services like the Pulse, Youth 2 Youth, Unit 23 Skatepark, Aquadiscos and several youth action groups have a valuable role in making sure that young people are engaged in their local communities; recognises that the Scottish Government has given West Dunbartonshire Council one of the worst local government settlements in Scotland and cut funding by over £1 million from the Fairer Scotland Fund; understands that the council intends to review youth provision in order to reduce the services available, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to provide additional funds for West Dunbartonshire to prevent a loss of youth services.
