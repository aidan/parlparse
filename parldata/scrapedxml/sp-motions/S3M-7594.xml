 *S3M-7594 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Support for Lothian Bus Workers’ Campaign—That the Parliament recognises the excellent track record of Lothian Buses, winners of the UK Bus Operator of the Year Award 2007 and the Public Transport Operator of the Year Award 2008; believes that the publicly owned company provides a high quality and profitable public transportation service for over 350,000 passengers per day; understands there to be considerable opposition among the Edinburgh and Lothians travelling public, Lothian Bus staff and unions to the continuation of Transport Edinburgh Ltd (TEL) and the proposed merger of Lothian Buses and Transport Initiatives Edinburgh Ltd (TIE); notes that the decision on any merger is one for the City of Edinburgh Council; is concerned about the potential consequences of such a merger for bus passengers; therefore believes that the case for merger has not been made and urges the city council instead to task the operation of any completed tram line to Lothian Buses, debt free and in full public ownership, and supports the Lothian Bus workers’ campaign to this end.
