*S3M-2202 Bill Kidd: Nuclear Weapons Planning Application—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision by the Ministry of Defence (MoD) to apply for planning permission for a new warhead component manufacturing facility at AWE (Atomic Weapons Establishment) Burghfield, brother site to AWE Aldermaston, where nuclear warheads for the current Trident submarine fleet are assembled and refurbished; believes that this proposal should also be rejected on the grounds that in July and again in autumn 2007 the MoD took the decision to tell AWE plc to suspend all live nuclear work, including all refurbishment of the current warhead system, after the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate (NII) insisted on receiving a new licence application from AWE plc for every operation of live work on nuclear warheads and its failure by September 2007 to remedy some 400 of 1,000 health and safety defects identified in 2006; further notes that the new planning application cannot be effectively scrutinised, given the fact that the plans have a Defence Exempt Direction, which excludes consideration of key elements of the proposals, and calls on all those opposed to the further development of the Trident Nuclear Missile Programme to register their objections and call for a public inquiry in the terms referred to above at planapps@westberks.gov.uk.
