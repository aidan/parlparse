*S2M-5609# Helen Eadie: Unfair Annual Railway Season Ticket Charging Policy—That the Parliament deplores the incredible differential of £304 for an annual season ticket, representing the additional cost to rail passengers travelling from North Queensferry station to South Gyle station who pay £780 per annum, in contrast to annual season ticket holders from Dalmeny to South Gyle who pay £476 per annum; is concerned that this difference may relate to the Forth Bridge crossing between North Queensferry and Dalmeny stations and demands an urgent investigation by Scotrail into this apparent penalty on commuters from North Queensferry; hopes, however, for a much wider review of train fares from Fife to other parts of Scotland in the knowledge that Fifers still pay the highest rail fare per kilometre of any part of Scotland, and hopes that such a review will result in a lowering of rail fares in a bid to ensure that more commuters travel by rail.
