 *S3M-2582 Irene Oldfather: The Importance of Transport Links in North Ayrshire—That the Parliament recognises the importance of ensuring improved transport links between North Ayrshire and the rest of Scotland to the economic recovery of the area; agrees that the upgrading of the A737 and the construction of the Dalry bypass will play a vital role in attracting future private investment; notes the success of the previous administration in constructing the Three Towns Bypass on time and under budget, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that connectivity within North Ayrshire is made a priority when the outcome of the strategic transport projects review is announced.
