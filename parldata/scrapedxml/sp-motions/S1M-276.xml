*S1M-276 Michael Russell: BBC Resources and BBC Worldwide—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposals contained in the Davies report regarding BBC Resources and BBC Worldwide, believing that any threat to BBC Resources in Scotland will have a detrimental effect on the BBC in Scotland and on the Scottish independent sector and will inevitably be detrimental to training provision for the production industries, lead to job losses and affect the ability to be a public service broadcaster capable of responding in a national emergency; further notes that the sale of BBC Resources and BBC Worldwide will also have little positive impact on the financing of the BBC and, in the case of BBC Worldwide, may actually reduce the income available to the BBC; supports the devolution of broadcasting powers, but in the meantime urges Her Majesty's Government to reject the Davies report and take no steps to sell off such important parts of the broadcasting infrastructure.
