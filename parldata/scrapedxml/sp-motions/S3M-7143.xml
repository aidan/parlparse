*S3M-7143 Patrick Harvie: Land Value Tax—That the Parliament considers that there is a need to ensure that taxes are fair, easy to collect, hard to avoid, sufficient to fund public services and supportive of a sustainable society; recognises the long history of debate over the role that land values should play in the tax system; notes the estimate, published in research by land reform campaigner Andy Wightman, that the total land value of Scotland exceeds £120 billion; considers that, while the owners of land gain the benefit of increased land values, those values are largely created by the wider community, and believes that land values should become the new basis for property taxation in Scotland to ensure that the economic, environmental and social benefits identified by Mr Wightman are secured.
