*S3M-771 Margaret Mitchell: Rocket Shot Syringe Sweet—That the Parliament condemns the sale of the "rocket shot", a sweet packaged in a plastic container modelled in the shape of a syringe filled with a variety of different coloured sugar liquid solutions, including red; deplores the irresponsibility on the part of the manufactures and retailers who sell this product which is targeted at children; notes with concern that the sale of such a product is not currently covered by legislation that would allow it to be banned by trading standards, and calls for the product to be withdrawn from sale immediately.
