*S2M-5008.3 Eleanor Scott: Coastal and Marine National Parks—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5008) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "and notes" to end and insert "expects the Executive to take account of all stakeholders’ views with no one sector having primacy; recognises that very many livelihoods depend on our safeguarding our coastal and marine environment; expects local management of marine resources to underpin the organisation of any future coastal and marine national park, and believes that location should not be a barrier to the siting of a marine national park."
