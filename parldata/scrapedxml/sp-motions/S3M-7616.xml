*S3M-7616 Kenneth Gibson: Disability Benefit Cuts—That the Parliament is appalled by the decision of the UK Government to scrap a series of benefits for disabled people including the Independent Living Fund and the mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance; recognises that the Independent Living Fund directly supports 3,654 disabled people in Scotland to help them live independently in the community rather than in residential care; further condemns the scrapping of the mobility component of the Disability Living Allowance, which also affords disabled people the ability to live independently of carers by providing them with a small budget to help with transportation costs or running their own vehicle; recalls plans by the Labour Party earlier this year to scrap both Attendance Allowance and Disability Living Allowance to pay for the creation of a National Care Service only for those in England and Wales; recognises that independent analysis by the Institute for Social and Economic Research predicted that the removal of Attendance Allowance would result in over 67,000 disabled people in Scotland being forced into poverty, and considers that the unionist parties at Westminster have a track record of picking on the poorest and most vulnerable people in society in an attempt to rectify the negative outcomes of their own financial ineptitude.
