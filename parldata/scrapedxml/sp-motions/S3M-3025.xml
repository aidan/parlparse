*S3M-3025 Cathy Jamieson: Increased Vulnerability of Homeowners to Reposession—That the Parliament notes the increased vulnerability of homeowners to repossession, particularly those with mortgages from sub-prime lenders; notes with deep concern that Scottish households currently have less protection from repossession than people elsewhere in the United Kingdom, and calls on ministers to act on the recommendations of organisations involved in debt management, and the joint statement by spokespeople from the Scottish Labour Party, Scottish Liberal Democrats, Scottish Green Party and Margo Macdonald MSP, by facilitating the introduction of a Scottish equivalent to the pre-court protocol introduced in England to place an enforceable duty on both lenders and courts to ensure that repossession is genuinely a last resort, to introduce licensing of sale and lease-back schemes and to provide vulnerable families facing repossession with an automatic right to legal aid.
