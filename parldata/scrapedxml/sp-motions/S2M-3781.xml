*S2M-3781 Christine Grahame: Financial Education by CAB Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament congratulates CAB Scotland on the invaluable assistance it provides, noting in particular the financial education projects including one in Haddington established to help vulnerable people to avoid debt problems, and notes that the bureaux work with agencies such as NHS boards, credit unions and specialist charities; considers that these schemes should be expanded, given that money and debt problems account for the majority of enquiries at advice bureaux accounting for some 12% of all enquiries amounting to some 50,000 enquiries in the year 2004-05, and further recommends that the Scottish Executive fund outreach programmes from CABs into secondary schools to provide young people who are vulnerable to credit card inducements with basic but essential awareness of the ease of falling into consumer debt.
