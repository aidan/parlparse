 *S2M-4563 Ms Sandra White: Atomic Weapons Establishment, Aldermaston—That the Parliament is concerned that on 12 June 2006 the Atomic Weapons Establishment, Aldermaston, refused to meet a cross-party delegation of MSPs, the Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, a former Lord Advocate and representatives of Scotland’s trade unions, churches and civic society and that Aldermaston did not respond to the delegation’s concern that over £1 billion is being spent on new facilities at Aldermaston which are likely to be used to design and build new nuclear weapons that would be deployed in Scotland, and urges the Scottish Executive to make representations to the Westminster Government in respect of its plans for Aldermaston.
