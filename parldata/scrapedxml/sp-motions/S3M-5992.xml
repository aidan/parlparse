 *S3M-5992 Elaine Smith: Celebrating St Patrick’s Day in Coatbridge—That the Parliament congratulates the St Patrick’s Day Festival Committee in Coatbridge on its work in organising and promoting the annual festival, which is now the 8th biggest St Patrick’s Day celebration in the world; notes that Saturday 20 March 2010 will be the 8th annual event in Coatbridge and is expected to attract in excess of 15,000 people from Scotland, the rest of the United Kingdom and abroad; further notes that this year’s festival will be opened by the TV presenter, singer and former pupil of St Ambrose High School, Michelle McManus; recognises the Irish heritage of the Iron Burgh and the contribution made by Irish immigrants in the development of the area; acknowledges the hard work of the organisers of the festival, who have involved the whole community in fundraising all year round in order to have over a week of festivities to celebrate the Irish heritage of many of the Coatbridge populace, and believes that the Scottish Government should look at ways to assist groups of committed citizens such as this in undertaking events that significantly boost tourism and visitor numbers to Scotland’s smaller towns thus benefiting local economies and educating people in the industrial and cultural heritage of areas such as Coatbridge.
