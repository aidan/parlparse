 *S3M-3265 Liam McArthur: 70th Anniversary of the Sinking of the Royal Oak—That the Parliament notes that 14 October 2009 will be the 70th anniversary of the loss of HMS Royal Oak when the German U-boat, U-47, penetrated the defences protecting Scapa Flow and torpedoed the battleship, sinking her with the loss of 833 lives; notes that many boy sailors aged between 15 and 17 were drowned that night and that, as a result, Churchill ordered that boy sailors were no longer to serve on ships on active service, a point drawn out vividly in the recently published book on the sinking, Last Dawn; further notes that the sinking is remembered every year at a service held over the site of the wreck when Royal Navy divers replace the white ensign that still flies on the submerged wreck, and remembers the sacrifice of those who lost their lives that night in the defence of Britain.
