*S2M-837 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Solidarity with Diane Wilson-That the Parliament notes with alarm the charges of criminal trespass and resisting arrest brought against leading US environmental activist Diane Wilson; acknowledges that these charges are an attempt to silence a woman whose only crime has been to act peacefully in the interests of the people of Texas; recognises that the actions committed were only an attempt to draw attention to Union Carbide/Dow's moral responsibility to face up to the ongoing horrors in Bhopal, India, the scene of the world's worst industrial disaster, and calls upon the Texan authorities to recognise that Diane was motivated by nothing more than the necessity of alerting the people of Texas to the dangers posed by the pesticide industry and to drop all criminal charges against her.
