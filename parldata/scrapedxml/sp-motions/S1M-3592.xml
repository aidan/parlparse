*S1M-3592 Ms Margo MacDonald: Comments by Scottish Executive Chief Architect on Enric Miralles-That the Parliament is indebted to the Scottish Executive Chief Architect for revealing, as attributed to him in The Herald magazine on 16 November 2002, that, in respect of Enric Miralles, "We did not employ an architect who was able to describe what he was doing and show in traditional ways what he was building" and "He quite deliberately didn't give you all the info"; expresses regret that the Chief Architect should have kept hidden until the day of the decisive debate in the Parliament on the Holyrood Project the true nature of Enric Miralles' illness which "threatened the future of the whole Parliament", and further regrets deeply that, deprived of full information on Enric Miralles and an independent medical assessment and prognosis, the Parliament was misled as to his fitness to perform in accordance with his contractual obligations.
