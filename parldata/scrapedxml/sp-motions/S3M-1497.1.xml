 *S3M-1497.1 John Park: National Minimum Wage—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1497) in the name of John Wilson, leave out from "expresses" to end and insert "notes the increase of the National Minimum Wage to £5.73 per hour in October 2008; further notes this will be an increase of nearly 60% since its introduction on 1 April 1999; recognises that the introduction of the National Minimum Wage had a huge impact on thousands of low-paid workers, many of whom were women; applauds the introduction of such legislation for its focus on the rights of working people and not the profits of big business; further notes the failure of the SNP MPs to turn up to vote in the House of Commons for the National Minimum Wage in 1998, and expresses disappointment that the current First Minister and the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth were among those who did not participate in the vote to introduce the National Minimum Wage."
