*S3M-4004.3 Andy Kerr: Budget Implications for Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S3M-4004) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from "expresses" to end and insert "welcomes the real-terms increase in the Scottish Government’s budget for 2010-11; also welcomes the earlier measures that the UK Government has taken to support Scotland during the global downturn, such as the £50 billion funding to Scottish banks to support bank workers, families and businesses who rely on the banks and the £2 billion that has gone into the pockets of hard working Scots and the VAT cut that has given the equivalent of £275 to every Scottish family and boosted retail sales; recognises that last week’s Budget continues to provide real help now to families and businesses, such as the guarantee that anyone aged between 18 and 25 who has been unemployed for 12 months or more will be given a training place or a job and the new investment in the renewable energy industry, which will benefit Scotland, and calls on the Parliament to recognise the role the UK Government has taken in leading the international response to the global economic crisis."
