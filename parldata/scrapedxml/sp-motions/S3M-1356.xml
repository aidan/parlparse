*S3M-1356 George Foulkes: Nursery Cuts Must Stop—That the Parliament condemns the SNP/Liberal Democrats’ decision to cut 320 full-time nursery places in the Edinburgh City Council area; believes that changes to the allocation criteria for nursery places will affect some of the most vulnerable parents and families across Edinburgh, particularly those with additional support needs and for whom English is a second language; further believes that taking the power to allocate nursery places away from nursery headteachers and allocating places on a term-by-term basis centrally is already deterring parents from trying to get back into work or undertaking further study; considers that these new measures are just another obstacle for families trying to work their way out of poverty; hopes that opposition politicians will be successful in reinstating some elements of fairness and social justice to the city budget, and ultimately believes that the value of nursery education is too important to play politics and balance budgets with.
