 *S3M-2669 Rob Gibson: Captain’s Galley Lands Another Success—That the Parliament congratulates chef Jim Cowie and his wife, Mary, on the latest success of the Captain’s Galley restaurant in Scrabster harbour; notes that its recent award of Taste of Highlands and Islands Restaurant of the Year at the Highlands and Islands Food and Drink Awards follows on from being the only Scottish restaurant to be named in the top ten of the Which? Good Food Guide 2009 editor’s choice, as well as a host of awards in recent years; commends the seafood restaurant’s ethical food policy, which means that, whenever possible, the restaurant uses fresh local ingredients sourced within a 50-mile radius of the restaurant, uses only seafood that is in season and purchases non-pressured stocks, which are taken from sustainable areas of the seas, thus benefiting the local economy and environment as well as the population’s palates, and wishes all those connected with the restaurant continued success for the future.
