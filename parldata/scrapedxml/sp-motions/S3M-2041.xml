*S3M-2041 Helen Eadie: European Maritime Day—That the Parliament notes that European Maritime Day is to be celebrated annually on 20 May, the aim being to highlight the whole web of relationships that bind together all maritime and marine-related issues and activities in Europe, in line with the joined-up and cross-cutting approach of the new Integrated Maritime Policy for the European Union proposed by the Commission in October 2007; welcomes the fact that, during the consultation process on this new policy, numerous stakeholders voiced the opinion that celebrating Europe’s maritime heritage and future as well as highlighting its maritime activities would help to raise citizens’ awareness, not only of the importance of the maritime sectors, but also of the key roles of the marine environment and Europe’s coastal regions, islands and outermost regions; further welcomes this initiative by the European Commission which is also planning an annual Open Ports Day in the context of a maritime week that encourages all the European regions, ports, cities and other maritime stakeholders to join in the celebrations and to work together so that the European Maritime Day can serve in the future as the focal date for launching a maritime week of conferences, festivities, networking, best practice exchange and benchmarking activities throughout the EU, and hopes that the Scottish Government will engage robustly with the Conference of Peripheral and Maritime Regions with a determination to ensure that such full resolve will result in new passenger and freight ferry operators to Zeebrugge and other ports across the EU.
