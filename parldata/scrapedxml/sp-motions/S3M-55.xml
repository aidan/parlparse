*S3M-55 Mike Pringle: Congratulations to Waitrose Supermarkets for Starting Plastic Bag Reduction—That the Parliament welcomes recent supermarket initiatives to encourage customers to re-use plastic bags, including Waitrose supermarkets’ "green till" initiative, where one till in each store does not supply plastic bags, which is being piloted this week at 14 stores including Morningside in south Edinburgh; encourages supermarkets to take even bolder steps to reduce packaging and waste, and calls on the new Scottish Executive to ensure that supermarkets keep to their agreement to reduce plastic bag impact by 25% by 2008.
