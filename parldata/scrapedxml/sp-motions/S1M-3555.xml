*S1M-3555 Michael Russell: The "Scottish Six" and the Prime Minister-That the Parliament notes with astonishment the remarks of the former director-general of the BBC, Mr John Birt, in the Sunday Herald on 20 October 2002 that he conspired with the Prime Minister in 1998 in order to stop the development of a "Scottish Six" main evening BBC television news bulletin, produced and edited in Scotland rather than in London, that he did so because he feared that it would lead to "the collapse of the union" and that according to him the Prime Minister "was quick, as ever, to grasp the case, 'Let's fight,' he said"; further notes Mr Birt's words that a "plan of action" was agreed to stop the "Scottish Six", involving senior BBC personnel, Gordon Brown MP and Peter Mandelson MP amongst others; believes that such a conspiracy fatally undermines the BBC's status as an "independent corporation", as set out in the Corporation's Royal Charter; welcomes the assurance of the BBC's current director-general, Mr Greg Dyke, that the issues of a "Scottish Six" in the forthcoming BBC review of news and current affairs output in Scotland "will be considered on their editorial, not their political merits", and believes that the conclusive broadcasting arguments in favour of a "Scottish Six" are reflected in the fact that it is supported by the Broadcasting Council for Scotland, BBC Scotland management and journalists and 69% of the Scottish people.
