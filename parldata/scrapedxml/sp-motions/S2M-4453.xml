*S2M-4453 John Farquhar Munro: Scottish Water Development Constraints—That the Parliament is becoming frustrated by the increasing number of development constraints imposed by Scottish Water in the Highlands and Islands because of potable water supply limitations; notes that the constraints are blocking the construction of much-needed affordable housing and restricting business developments offering employment opportunities; further notes that Scottish Water’s inability to provide a potable water supply means that the new Dunvegan fire station is sitting unused while the local fire officers remain in their old, sub-standard premises; believes that this situation is becoming untenable, and calls on Scottish Water to investigate the feasibility of reactivating old mains supplies and on the Scottish Executive to consider offering grant aid to those developing alternative private water supplies.
