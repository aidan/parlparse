*S2M-575 Sarah Boyack: Aung San Sui Kyi-That the Parliament notes with great concern the continued detention of Aung San Sui Kyi, head of the National League for Democracy in Burma; further notes with dismay the continued refusal of the military junta of Burma to recognise the result of the 1990 elections where the National League for Democracy won more than 80% of the vote; condemns the house arrest and continued detention of Aung San Sui Kyi; applauds the Nobel Peace Prize winner and salutes her determination in her continued struggle for democracy in Burma, and encourages the City of Edinburgh Council to grant the Freedom of the City to Aung San Sui Kyi to send a message of solidarity to all those who work for freedom in Burma. Supported by: Elaine Smith*, Mr Alasdair Morrison*, Cathie Craigie*, Dr Elaine Murray*
