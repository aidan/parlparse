*S3M-5915 Stewart Maxwell: Remembering the Clydebank Blitz—That the Parliament marks the anniversary of the Clydebank Blitz, which, on the 13 and 14 March 1941, involved the bombing of what were seen by the Nazis as strategic military targets, including shipyards and the Singer sewing machine factory; also remembers the bombing of Hillington, Renfrewshire, which resulted in the destruction of the Rolls Royce factory as well as other manufacturing outlets; acknowledges that Clydebank suffered the most concentrated bomb damage of any part of the British Isles during World War II; pays respect to those injured and killed by the raids and recognises the sacrifices made and the role played by the people of Clydebank and Scotland in their contribution to the Allied effort that finally defeated the Axis forces in 1945, and congratulates the town of Clydebank in retaining its link to the events of World War II in its continued and ongoing regeneration.
