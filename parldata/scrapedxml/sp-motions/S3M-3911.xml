*S3M-3911 Jackson Carlaw: Beatson Pebble Appeal—That the Parliament notes that 54 people are diagnosed with cancer every day in the west of Scotland alone; further notes the outstanding work being done by the Beatson Institute and the Beatson West of Scotland Oncology Centre in researching cancer and treating cancer patients respectively; acknowledges the requirement for a Translational Research Centre to bridge the gap between these two existing facilities and finalise the Glasgow Centre for Cancer Research, the largest comprehensive cancer centre in Scotland, serving almost two-thirds of the population; congratulates The Evening Times on its Beatson Pebble Appeal campaign, designed to raise £10 million for this new research centre, and encourages as many people as possible to back the campaign by visiting www.beatsonpebbleappeal.com to ensure that the new research centre can become both a reality and a key player in speeding up the process of finding new drugs and better methods of prevention and diagnosis in the international battle against cancer.
