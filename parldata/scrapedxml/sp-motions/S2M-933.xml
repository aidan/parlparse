*S2M-933 Mr Duncan McNeil: MMR Vaccine-That the Parliament notes that the research by Dr Andrew Wakefield linking the MMR vaccine to autism has been discredited by what the editor of The Lancet describes as a "fatal conflict of interest"; regrets that this flawed research led to many parents refusing to vaccinate their children; notes, however, that this impact was compounded by the irresponsible use of the study's findings by certain politicians, and invites those politicians who seek to use questionable medical research to create public disquiet or further a political agenda to reflect on their actions.
