*S3M-351# Sandra White: Glasgow Care Workers—That the Parliament raises serious concern at the ongoing dispute over pay and grading which has led to 600 care workers in Glasgow being on indefinite strike; believes that this situation has arisen as a direct result of the failings of both the previous Scottish Executive administration and local councils to tackle the issue of equal pay and single status, leading to a situation where workers are seeing their salaries being cut by means of downgrading the pay structure many workers were attached to in order to meet the council’s liabilities under the Equal Pay Act; further notes that at the parliamentary debate on equal pay on 9 November 2006 the previous administration failed to take any action despite the recommendations of the Finance Committee which concluded that "The Committee believes that the implementation of Single Status and retrospective compensatory payments is the biggest financial challenge that local government in Scotland has faced. The Committee further believes that there is no reason why, in the interests of employees, council taxpayers and service users, this issue cannot be resolved within 12 months. The Committee calls on the councils, unions and COSLA to enter urgently into discussions at local and national level, facilitated by the Executive where necessary, to ensure implementation within this timescale and to consider what lessons must be learned from the failure to progress agreement on Single Status" in its Report on the Financial Implications of the Local Authority Single Status Agreement, and considers that appropriate representations should be made to Glasgow City Council in order to resolve this situation at soon as possible to safeguard the wellbeing of the people who social care workers care for, by protecting vulnerable children, ensuring that older people live at home safely, assisting people with learning disabilities, rehabilitating those with an addiction, providing guidance and monitoring for those in the criminal and youth justice system and much more.
