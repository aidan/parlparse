*S2M-405 Frances Curran: Army Display in the Parliamentâ€”That the Parliament expresses its opposition to the army display at the reception area in Parliamentary Headquarters on 23 September 2003; notes that since defence is a reserved matter there is therefore no reason for a display by the army in the Parliament; feels very strongly that the time is not suitable because of the humanitarian and political disaster in Iraq, with parents of young men and women serving there wondering whether their children will come home alive; questions why there is a recruitment display by the army when other companies are not permitted to advertise in the Parliament, and considers that the invitation to the army to display in the Parliament should be withdrawn immediately and not be repeated. Supported by: Rosie Kane*, Carolyn Leckie*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Tommy Sheridan*, Colin Fox*
