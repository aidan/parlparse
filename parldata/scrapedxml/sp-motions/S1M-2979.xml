*S1M-2979# Bill Aitken: Partick Thistle FC-That the Parliament congratulates the management, staff, players and supporters of Partick Thistle FC whose tremendous efforts over the last five years have brought the club back from the verge of extinction and who have seen these efforts result in the club being promoted for the second time in two years, achieving once again the status of a Premier League side and reaching the semi-final of the Scottish Cup, thus ensuring that this well-loved Glasgow institution, which has contributed so much, over many years, has regained its natural place at the top level of Scottish football.
