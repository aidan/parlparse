*S2M-3585.2 Alex Johnstone: Waste Strategy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3585) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from first “welcomes” to end and insert “believes that the Scottish Executive’s policy on waste is failing and that the amount of waste being sent to landfill is increasing, so that local authorities will have to double their recycling performance in one year to meet the 2006 targets, and further believes that after six years the Executive needs to take immediate steps to free up local authorities to enable them to deliver innovative and appropriate solutions to suit their local circumstances.”
