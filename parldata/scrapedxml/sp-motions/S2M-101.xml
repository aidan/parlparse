*S2M-101 Margo MacDonald: Independent Inquiry into the War on Iraq—That the Parliament recognises that when it voted to support war on Iraq it was persuaded to do so by the Prime Minister’s assertions of proof of the existence of 200 sites of weapons of mass destruction and of his knowledge of such weapons ready and available for launch within a 45-minute period; further recognises that no such weapons have been discovered; notes the widespread concern in the country about Government deception in gathering support for war, and joins the calls being made for a full independent inquiry into the Government’s conduct leading up to the initiation of war.
