*S2M-4963 Ms Sandra White: Lebanon Visit—That the Parliament extends its support to those, including MSPs from many different parties, who are currently in Lebanon in an attempt to better understand the situation in the country through meeting the government and touring the worst-hit areas of the country; wishes them all the success possible, and recognises that these types of venture serve to boost Scotland’s standing on the world stage by demonstrating the values of collaboration and understanding that we wish to promote.
