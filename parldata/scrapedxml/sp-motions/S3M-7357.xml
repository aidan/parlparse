 *S3M-7357 Aileen Campbell: 20th Anniversary of the UN Human Development Report—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the United Nations Development Programme’s Human Development Report 2010, which marks the 20th anniversary of the first such report, in 1990; considers that, over the years, the report and the Human Development Index that it contains have contributed to a better understanding of factors affecting quality of life in countries around the world and the causes and effects of poverty and deprivation; notes that, in the 2010 Human Development Index, Norway, Ireland, Iceland, Finland and Denmark are all ranked in the top 20 countries and that these countries have also been identified as part of the arc of prosperity by the Scottish Government; considers with regret that some of these countries have been criticised by Labour politicians in an attempt to argue against the democratic right of self-determination for the people of Scotland; further notes that the United Kingdom is ranked 26th as a result of what the report identifies as significant inequalities and gaps between the rich and poor in the UK, and believes that an independent Scotland would be motivated by reports such as this to strive more urgently and effectively to reduce social inequalities and achieve a better quality of life for all.
