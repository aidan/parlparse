*S3M-6648 Kenneth Gibson: BBC Spending—That the Parliament condemns flamboyant spending by the BBC on its coverage of major sporting and cultural events; believes that, in times of such economic hardship and austerity, the BBC should not be wasting licence fee payers’ money on new studios, flights and excessive staff numbers; notes with incredulity what is considered the lavish expenditure by the BBC to cover the World Cup, spending £1 million on a studio overlooking Table Mountain while also sending 295 staff, twice as many as ITV sent despite covering the same number of games; is also shocked that the BBC intends to send 400 staff to cover this year’s Glastonbury festival at a cost of almost £2 million, despite viewing figures averaging only 800,000 last year; further believes that such money would be better spent on quality programming in Scotland where licence fee payers are routinely short-changed as Scottish licence fee payers contribute over £300 million to the BBC expenditure while Ofcom calculates that only £31.6 million is spent on Scottish network productions; considers that the BBC promise to implement the recommendations of the Scottish Broadcasting Commission and increase expenditure in Scotland to approximately £70 million is little more than a token gesture considering the vast amount of money that Scottish licence fee payers fork out annually; is aware that £18 million was paid to Jonathan Ross for a three year contract, that 46 executives earn more than the Prime Minister’s £194,250 salary, and agrees that the BBC must spend licence fee payers money in a more prudent, creative and sensible way and end its culture of extravagance.
