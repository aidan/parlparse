*S2M-4974 Mr Brian Monteith: Barnardo’s Youthbuild Service—That the Parliament commends the Barnado’s Youthbuild service for addressing issues at the very foundation of social exclusion as it helps young people to overcome obstacles of homelessness and the impact of poverty and to gain employment through extensive personal support and appropriate industry training, and welcomes the invitation to a young woman from Youthbuild to the Parliament to lead Time for Reflection on Wednesday 25 October 2006 at 9.00 am to tell how she has left behind her label of "not in employment, education or training" and whose story of taking control of her life is a positive example of what can be achieved.
