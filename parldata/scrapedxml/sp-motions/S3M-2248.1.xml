 *S3M-2248.1 Pauline McNeill: Aircraft Carrier Delay Could Cost Jobs—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2248) in the name of Sandra White, leave out from "concern" to end and insert "continued support for the announcement of the joint venture to construct two new aircraft carriers, HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, and calls on the Ministry of Defence to move quickly to formally sign the contracts confirming the construction arrangements for the carriers which will provide certainty for workers at the Scotstoun and Govan Shipyards on the Clyde and Rosyth Dockyard as well as at Portsmouth and Barrow; notes that a recent report published by the Scottish Affairs Select Committee of the House Commons warned that the sustainability of up to 50,000 highly-skilled jobs in the Scottish defence industry which are reliant on UK Government contracts would be put under threat by constitutional change and welcomes the robust defence of the sector by Glasgow’s local MPs and MSPs, and further notes that the survival and significant revival of the heavy shipbuilding industry on the River Clyde has been made possible only as a result of the UK Government’s strong commitment to Scottish defence industry jobs since 1997." Supported by: Bill Butler*, James Kelly*, Rhona Brankin*, Karen Gillon*, Des McNulty*, Hugh Henry*, Helen Eadie*, Mr Frank McAveety* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
