*S2M-2144# Linda Fabiani: Scotland's Nobel Prize Winners—That the Parliament notes those Scots who have become Nobel Laureates since the prize was inaugurated in 1901 and, in particular, notes the contribution of Scotland’s first Nobel Laureate, Sir William Ramsay, who received the honour in 1904 "in recognition of his services in the discovery of the inert gaseous elements in air, and his determination of their place in the periodic system" and recognises that the example set by Scotland’s Nobel Laureates is an effective generator of confidence and wellbeing.
