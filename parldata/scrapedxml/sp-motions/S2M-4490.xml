*S2M-4490 Colin Fox: 90th Anniversary of the Easter Rising—That the Parliament notes that the annual James Connolly commemoration march through Edinburgh on 3 June 2006 takes place in the year of the 90th anniversary of the Easter rising; believes that James Connolly’s part in the 1916 Dublin rising and his legacy to the struggle for freedom, national liberation and socialism, not just in Scotland and Ireland but throughout the world, should be much more widely recognised, and calls on the Scottish Executive to support new educational and cultural initiatives to bring greater understanding and clarity in respect of the hugely significant part that this native of Edinburgh played in events shaping the world of the early 20th century.
