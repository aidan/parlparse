 *S2M-3881 Frances Curran: No Cover Up On CIA Rendition Flights—That the Parliament welcomes Swiss Senator, Dick Marty’s, interim report on his continuing investigation into alleged secret detention centres and the use of airports and airspace within Council of Europe member states to assist the US Government’s policy of extraordinary rendition; notes the Italian judicial investigation into an illegal abduction in the streets of Milan and the subsequent issuing of arrest warrants for 22 American agents as part of the judicial proceedings; notes that, despite Senator Marty’s Committee on Legal Affairs and Human Rights having written to member states asking for information concerning the use of their airports for CIA flights, the biggest problem for the committee has been the lack of information provided so far and the lack of co-operation from those governments; calls on member states to provide the information by the stated deadline of 21 February 2006; further notes that the Polish Government ordered an inquiry into the alleged existence of CIA detention centres in Poland, but that the findings have not been published nor provided to the committee; suggests that the real question that Senator Marty’s report raises is what information is being hidden and by whom; believes that, if such flights were using airports in Scotland and across Europe for trafficking illegal immigrants, Colombian drugs barons or parcels of cocaine, governments would not be experiencing the same problems in obtaining information, and calls on all governments across Europe to co-operate with Senator Marty and his investigation.
