*S3M-814# Sandra White: Moratorium on Post Office Closures—That the Parliament notes with grave concern the admission by the Post Office, in response to concerns raised over the proposed post office closures in Glasgow, that "If, at the end of the consultation period, a post office branch is removed from the list of proposed closures, then we would have to propose another branch for closure within this area plan." and believes that such an admission calls into question the validity of any consultation process and that, in light of these damning revelations, a moratorium on the current process should be considered.
