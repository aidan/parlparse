*S3M-2841 Liam McArthur: Brian Pack - Well-Deserved Winner of Ed Rainy Brown Memorial Award—That the Parliament notes that the Chief Executive of the ANM Group, Brian Pack, has received the prestigious Ed Rainy Brown Memorial Award, which is presented annually to individuals in the farming, forestry, aquaculture or associated industries who has made an exceptional contribution within their specific field; believes that this award is welcome recognition of the contribution that Brian Pack has made to Scottish agriculture as the driving force behind ANM Group’s development into one of the largest and most progressive farmer-owned businesses in the United Kingdom; recognises that, under his leadership, the ANM core business in auctioneering and abattoir sectors has grown while, at the same time, it has expanded into livestock procurement, meat processing, catering, hospitality, land and property sales and specialist auctions, and hopes that, although he will formally retire from the ANM Group in 2009, his pugnacious style, perceptive insight and pithy wit will still be enjoyed by and available to the industry.
