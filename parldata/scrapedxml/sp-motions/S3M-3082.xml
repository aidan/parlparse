*S3M-3082 Bob Doris: Protecting Those Who Take a Stand Against Organised Crime—That the Parliament congratulates all who take a stand against organised crime, be they police officers, hard-pressed communities or democratically-elected politicians; condemns any attempts of organised criminals to threaten, intimidate or attack such individuals as a result of their stance against organised crime, and believes that where such incidents take place, police forces across Scotland should tackle such serious matters with a high priority.
