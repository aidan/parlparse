*S1M-2680 Tommy Sheridan: Funds Paid to the Third Age Group-That the Parliament notes with grave concern the most recent allegations regarding links between the constituency office of former First Minister Henry McLeish in Glenrothes and the Third Age Group and regarding the payment of £40,000 in grants by Fife Council to the charity for two years after it ceased to exist; believes that, once again, activities in the constituency of the former First Minister are likely to cast a shadow over his activity as a member of the Scottish Parliament, and calls for an independent inquiry into relations between Fife Council, the Third Age Group and the former First Minister's constituency office in order to determine who was responsible for granting such funds to the Third Age Group and what they were used for.
