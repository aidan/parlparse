*S2M-4826&lt;&gt; Irene Oldfather: European Day of Modern Languages 2006—That the Parliament acknowledges that 26 September 2006 is the annual European Day of Modern Languages; believes that learning a modern language other than English is a vital tool in helping our young people to broaden their horizons and improve their employment opportunities; agrees that the teaching of European languages in schools raises awareness and understanding of Scotland’s place in the European Union; notes the findings of a recent report from the European Parliament’s Culture and Education Committee that member states should include at least two foreign languages from a very early age in their school programmes, and therefore welcomes the efforts of Scottish local authorities to improve language attainment in primary schools, such as North Ayrshire Council which has recently provided training for 18 primary teachers in the delivery of Spanish lessons, to complement the existing availability of French tuition at primary level.
