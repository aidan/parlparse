 *S3M-5477.1 Kenneth Gibson: Inadequate Response to a National Emergency—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5477) in the name of George Foulkes, leave out from "recognises" to end and insert "commends the Scottish Government for its speedy response over the Christmas/New Year holiday period and strong commitment to dealing with the severe weather and for co-ordinating the efforts of agencies and local government partners, and considers that the impact of the cold weather would have been much more severe had the Scottish Government not rejected Labour Party proposals to cut £10 million from the winter road maintenance budget in 2008-09, 2009-10 and 2010-11."
