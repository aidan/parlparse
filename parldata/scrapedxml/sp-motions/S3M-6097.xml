 *S3M-6097 Marilyn Livingstone: Care Services in Fifeâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the findings of the recent Care Commission report, Making the Grade?, that Fife care services are the best in Scotland with the biggest percentage of highly rated facilities and the third-lowest proportion of poorly rated services; notes that more than 11,000 inspections were carried out of public, private and voluntary sector services with inspectors evaluating quality themes, including care and support, information and environment, staffing, management and leadership, rated on a scale of 1-6, from unsatisfactory through weak, adequate, good and very good to excellent; commends the fact that Fife had just 0.4% of its services in the bottom two categories and 40.4% of them in the top two groupings, giving it the best overall performance, and welcomes the fact that the Care Commission now has the ability to check whether the good quality of care provided by most services has been maintained, where the quality of care in Scotland is improving and where further action is needed to ensure that improvements are made.
