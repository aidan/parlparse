*S2M-4495 Mrs Nanette Milne: Cow Parade 2006—That the Parliament welcomes Cow Parade 2006, the collection of life-size fibreglass cows strikingly decorated and painted in various cities across the globe, which is now the world’s largest public art event; notes that Cow Parade has grown in stature to become a major force in world art; further notes that, as well as ensuring significant exposure for the artists and designers involved and entertaining the public, the cows have an "udder" job to do as selected cows will be auctioned after the event, with 75% of the net proceeds being donated to VETAID and OneCity Trust, and calls on members and their staff to give generously to help to bid for "Salty", the cow outside the Parliament.
