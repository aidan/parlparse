 *S3M-4322 Dr Richard Simpson: National Men’s Health Week, Access to Services—That the Parliament welcomes National Men’s Health Week, from 15 to 21 June 2009; commends the work of the Men’s Health forum, which seeks to raise the profile of men’s health by raising awareness of men’s health issues among people working with men and men themselves with the aim of making a difference to the quality of life of men everywhere; notes that the current life expectancy for men in Scotland, at 74.2 years, is five years less than for women and that men’s life expectancy varies enormously across Scotland, with 66 years in the 10% most deprived areas and 79 years in the 10% least deprived; notes that the number of men in Scotland dying from alcohol-related diseases is double that in England; further notes that, over a 10-year period from 1995, the incidence of prostate cancer rose by 14.3%, with 2,500 men in Scotland diagnosed with prostate cancer; also notes that the poor health outcomes and reduced life expectancy experienced by a large proportion of men can be improved by simple lifestyle changes, and considers that it is generally accepted that men access health services differently from women although this is not always factored into the design of NHS services.
