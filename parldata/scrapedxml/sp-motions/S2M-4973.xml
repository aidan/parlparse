*S2M-4973 Mr Brian Monteith: Free Maps for 11-Year-Olds—That the Parliament commends Ordnance Survey (OS) and its "Free Maps for 11-year-olds" programme which offers a free OS Explorer map to every Scottish pupil in Primary 7 through their school, simply by registering online, and notes that this raises awareness of local geography and encourages further inquiry and learning, while introducing many aspects of citizenship, and also builds on the programme’s past success in issuing over 60,000 maps to eligible schools in 2005.
