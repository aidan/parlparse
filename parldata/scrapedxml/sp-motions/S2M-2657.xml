 * S2M-2657 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Poultry Meat Standardsâ€”That the Parliament recognises the improving standards in animal welfare and environmental protection in the Scottish poultry industry; acknowledges and applauds the drive to raise these standards even further; condemns, however, the situation where Scottish poultry producers are penalised by having to bear the cost of increased standards while at the same time imports of poultry meat from countries with lower standards are allowed, and calls on the Scottish Executive to put pressure on EU trade ministers to demand that the same rigour of animal welfare standards and environmental measures is applied to imported meat.
