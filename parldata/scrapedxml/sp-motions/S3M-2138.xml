*S3M-2138 Bill Kidd: Sense or Census—That the Parliament expresses serious concern over the possible consequences of the 2011 Census contract being awarded to the US defence group, Lockheed Martin; notes that under the terms of the US Patriot Act which allows US law enforcement bodies to demand public information from private sector companies, detailed personal information on UK citizens could be handed over to US authorities and used for covert intelligence and surveillance work, and believes that assurances from the UK Government that provisions will be made to ensure that this does not happen, which have been dismissed by the Treasury Select Committee, could lead to many citizens boycotting the census or giving false evidence which in turn would render the census useless in terms of its objectives.
