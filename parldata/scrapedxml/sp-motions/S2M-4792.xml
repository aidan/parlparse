 *S2M-4792 Ms Rosemary Byrne: School Transport—That the Parliament notes with concern the arbitrary rules set by local authorities by which the mileage limits for school transport are set; further notes that these rules can fail to take into consideration local geography and traffic conditions whereby school pupils may have to walk along busy main roads where school transport is denied, and calls on the Scottish Executive to advise local authorities to set school transport rules which take local geography and traffic conditions into consideration and are based on pupil safety.
