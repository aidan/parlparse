 S2M-2294 # Elaine Smith: A Better Deal for People Dealing with Cancer—That the Parliament congratulates Macmillan Cancer Relief on the success of its “A Better Deal for People Dealing with Cancer” campaign which has so far directly helped 8,000 people across the UK access advice on the benefit entitlements of cancer patients; reasserts its support for the campaign and the recent round of radio promotions targeted at areas in the United Kingdom with high cancer and mortality rates and low uptake of disability benefits, including five areas of Scotland; expresses concern that Scotland has the highest non-claimant rate (64%) amongst patients with a terminal diagnosis; acknowledges that the key aim of the campaign is to secure specialist advice for every cancer patient at diagnosis; recognises that such an objective could be best realised through partnership-working between stakeholders, such as the Benefits Agency, the NHS, local authorities and cancer charities, and considers that co-operation between the Scottish Executive and the UK Government is necessary to facilitate such change.
