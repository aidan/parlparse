*S3M-762 George Foulkes: Congratulations to the Drake Music Project Scotland—That the Parliament congratulates Drake Music Project Scotland on being awarded £4,645 in-kind sponsorship and a £4,645 SENASA award from Scotsys Ltd as part of the Scottish Executive’s New Arts Sponsorship Awards; recognises the excellent work that Drake Music Project Scotland does with adults and young people with disabilities; notes the project’s 10th anniversary in 2007 and, as part of a new office move, its launch of a programme of taster sessions for clients at its new base, SPACE, in Craigmillar, Edinburgh; recognises the hard work and commitment that Arts and Business Scotland has undertaken in making this scheme a running success, and believes that this money is even more valuable in light of the growing concern across Edinburgh that the SNP/Liberal Democrat council will make significant cuts to the grants budget for voluntary groups across the city.
