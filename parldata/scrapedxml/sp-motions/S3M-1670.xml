*S3M-1670 Ted Brocklebank: 90th Anniversary of the Formation of the Royal Air Force—That the Parliament celebrates the 90th Anniversary of the formation of the Royal Air Force (RAF); notes that the RAF, the world’s first independent air force, was created on 1 April 1918; notes with considerable pride the achievements and professionalism of our armed forces’ men and women; further notes the significant role which bases such as RAF Leuchars in North East Fife play in the military, economic and social fabric of Scotland, and notes that as a nation we can, therefore, be justifiably proud of our RAF, both past and present.
