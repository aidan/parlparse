 *S2M-5097 Tommy Sheridan: Suspension of Edinburgh Accommodation Allowance—That the Parliament notes the considerable concern expressed in the press over the latest revelations about the Members’ Allowances Scheme; agrees with the editorial in the Sunday Herald of 5 November 2006 that the scheme needs to be suspended and that there should be an urgent review to seek an alternative which does not result in profit for individual MSPs; also notes the continuing support from the First Minister for reform of the system, and accordingly calls on the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to carry out an urgent review of the scheme.
