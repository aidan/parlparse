*S3M-1694 Jackson Carlaw: The SNP’s Broken Promises on Stobhill—That the Parliament notes that, prior to May 2007 election, Shona Robison MSP pledged that the SNP was "committed to retaining Stobhill as a small general hospital attached to the ACAD, with a casualty unit and an appropriate number of inpatient beds"; further notes that since forming a minority government the SNP has repeatedly rebuffed calls to honour this unambiguous pledge, creating a growing sense of anger and resentment amongst staff and users of Stobhill Hospital; congratulates the Save Stobhill campaigners on their continued efforts to hold the SNP to its word and, at the very least, calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to establish an independent scrutiny panel for NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde’s proposals for the Greater Glasgow area in order to interrogate the assumptions behind the original plans for Stobhill, the solutions identified and the progress made to date.
