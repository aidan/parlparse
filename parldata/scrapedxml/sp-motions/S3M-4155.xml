*S3M-4155 Christine Grahame: Establishment of Scottish National Lottery—That the Parliament backs the establishment of a Scottish national lottery; considers that the UK Government should devolve powers to Scottish ministers to enable them to establish such a lottery so that monies raised in Scotland are spent in Scotland; condemns the decision by the UK Government to divert £150 million of lottery money earmarked for good causes in Scotland to help fund the 2012 London Olympics, which has a budget that is increasingly out of control, and recognises that, without the establishment of a Scottish national lottery, voluntary sector organisations and other good causes will suffer as the Camelot National Lottery continues to drain monies towards the south east of England.
