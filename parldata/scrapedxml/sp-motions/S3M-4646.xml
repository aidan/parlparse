 *S3M-4646♦ Robert Brown: Tokyo Beer—That the Parliament is concerned at the extent of health and criminal justice problems associated with excessive and unhealthy alcohol consumption in Glasgow and other parts of Scotland; notes the production of Tokyo beer by BrewDog brewery; further notes that Tokyo is being cited as Britain’s strongest beer; is concerned that, with an alcohol content of 18.2%, each 330ml bottle will contain the equivalent of six units of alcohol, which is twice the recommended daily limit for women set by health professionals; recognises the significant health and social harms associated with irresponsible drinking; further recognises that major cultural change is required if Scotland is to tackle its damaging relationship with alcohol, and therefore believes that promoting drinks of this kind with both a very high alcohol content and unit volume is reprehensible in a society where the medical evidence shows that, across all age groups and socio-economic categories, individuals are drinking too much alcohol.
