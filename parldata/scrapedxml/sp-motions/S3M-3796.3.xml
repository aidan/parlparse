*S3M-3796.3 Nicola Sturgeon: The NHS and the Independent Sector—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3796) in the name of Mary Scanlon, leave out from "success" to end and insert "Scottish Government’s commitment to a mutual NHS in Scotland and its decision only to use the private sector for health provision at the margins where necessary; further welcomes the fact that there has been a 37% drop in private sector acute activity, excluding Stracathro, between 2006 and 2008 and congratulates NHS staff for achieving this reduction; notes the role of the private treatment centre pilot at Stracathro, established by the last administration, and awaits the final evaluation of this pilot, and commends the Scottish Government policy to direct investment into the NHS rather than divert scarce resources into private sector health provision."
