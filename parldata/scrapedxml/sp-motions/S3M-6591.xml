*S3M-6591♦ Johann Lamont: Independent Living in Scotland Magazine, Rights Here Rights Now—That the Parliament congratulates Independent Living in Scotland on the publication of the magazine, Rights Here Rights Now, which is published for the first time as a 23-page supplement in The Big Issue in Scotland, on sale this week; considers that this marks a huge step forward for the rights of disabled people and that the magazine showcases the issues around independent living for disabled people to over 125,000 people in Glasgow and across Scotland; believes that its publication highlights that the independent living movement is growing in strength and influence and that independent living for disabled people is not only the right thing to do in terms of equality and human rights but is right for the economy and for the cohesion of Scottish society and Scotland’s communities, and finally, alongside the Independent Living in Scotland project, thanks The Big Issue in Scotland for its support and continued commitment to the independent living agenda.
