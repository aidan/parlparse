*S3M-911 Karen Whitefield: People Need Physios Campaign—That the Parliament notes that physiotherapy students from across Scotland will take to the streets of Aberdeen, Edinburgh and Glasgow tomorrow to promote their People Need Physios campaign, raising awareness of the value of physiotherapy to Scotland’s health and the employment crisis facing physiotherapist graduates in Scotland; further notes figures from the Chartered Society of Physiotherapy revealing that over 70% of 2007 graduates remain unemployed five months after graduation and that one third of 2006 graduates are still seeking their first NHS posts; expresses concern that over one third of recent physiotherapy graduates are seeking registration abroad and believes that, unless action is taken to tackle this problem, Scotland’s NHS will lose these skilled professionals at a time when there are 28,000 people on waiting lists for physiotherapy; recognises that this is a massive waste of potential, and calls on the Scottish Government to take urgent action to deliver on its manifesto commitment to increase the number of NHS physiotherapists and take the necessary steps to exploit the talent pool of physiotherapists in Scotland for the benefit of patient care. Supported by: Robin Harper*, Cathie Craigie*, Trish Godman*, Nanette Milne*, Charlie Gordon*, James Kelly*, Mary Scanlon*, Pauline McNeill*, Karen Gillon*, Bill Butler*, Jim Hume*, David Stewart*
