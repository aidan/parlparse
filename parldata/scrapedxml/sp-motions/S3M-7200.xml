 *S3M-7200 Jackie Baillie: Reinstatement of Christie Wardâ€”That the Parliament notes that the Vale of Leven Monitoring Group has collectively agreed to a motion that calls for the reinstatement of the Christie Ward at the Vale of Leven Hospital following a recent fire; believes that the Christie Ward is an integral part of inpatient mental health care at the Vale of Leven Hospital; recognises that the reinstatement of the ward will require funding in the financial year 2010-11, and calls on NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to respond to what it believes is the clear view of the local community and reinstate the Christie Ward without delay.
