*S3M-877 Alex Neil: Liberal Democrat Plans for Scottish Water—That the Parliament notes with concern the suggestion by the leader of the Liberal Democrats that he intends to amend the Scottish budget to mutualise Scottish Water; considers that this proposal has not been thought through; notes that Scottish Water cannot be mutualised or privatised through the budget process and that any reduction by the Liberal Democrat or Labour party in the funding allocated by the Scottish Government to Scottish Water will lead to increased water charges for all Scottish taxpayers, including pensioners, and urges the Liberal Democrats and other opposition parties to state clearly which public services they intend to cut in any attack on the Scottish budget. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Stuart McMillan*, Michael Matheson*, Sandra White*, Robin Harper*, Bob Doris*, Brian Adam*, Bill Kidd*, Kenneth Gibson*
