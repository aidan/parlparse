*S2M-2265.2 Christine Grahame: Closing the Opportunity Gap—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2265) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "and extending" to end and insert "but only in very limited areas; notes that one in three children, one in five working-age adults and one in five pensioners live in relative poverty despite Scotland’s wealth; notes the recent report by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, Strategies Against Poverty, published in December 2004 which highlighted the link between deprivation and problems such as crime, poor health, premature death, family breakdown and poor educational attainment; further notes that, according to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, what is required is a modest redistribution of wealth, and believes that, without power over the macro-economy, tax and benefits, any progress towards eradicating poverty will continue to be minimal so that many of Scotland’s children will continue to be born to fail and our pensioners will live in poverty or on its margins."
