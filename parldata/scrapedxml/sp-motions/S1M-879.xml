*S1M-879 Mr Gil Paterson: Mike Tyson - Decision to Grant Entry for Proposed Fight in Glasgow—That the Parliament notes motions S1M-609, S1M-847 and S1M-854 which together carry the support of more than half of the Parliament; further notes the Home Secretary’s decision to allow Mike Tyson into the United Kingdom in order that he should fight for financial gain; notes that this decision has been taken despite the fact that Mike Tyson has been convicted and sentenced for rape, a situation which would normally prohibit entry to this country, and therefore believes that a judicial review of this decision should be undertaken.
