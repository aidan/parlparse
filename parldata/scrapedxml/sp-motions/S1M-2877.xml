*S1M-2877# Michael Russell: Hamish Henderson—That the Parliament recalls the unique and vigorous contribution made by Hamish Henderson to Scotland and its culture; notes that he was a strong supporter of a Scottish Parliament but an even stronger supporter of opening up the minds and hearts of the peoples of Scotland to social justice and song; pays tribute to his work to record and maintain the languages, stories and passions of ordinary Scots folk and to carry such traditions forward, and determines to find an appropriate way to honour him and the many national and international causes he espoused in the new Parliament building at Holyrood.
