*S3M-5884 Kenneth Gibson: The Completeness and Accuracy of Electoral Registers—That the Parliament notes the Electoral Commission report, The completeness and accuracy of electoral registers in Great Britain, which provides snap shots of electoral registers in eight local authorities, including Glasgow and South Ayrshire; recognises the issue of low voter registration, particularly among young people between 17 and 24 years of age, ethnic minorities and those who have recently changed address; considers that there is room for modernization of the system, such as moving the annual canvass, currently held in autumn, closer to elections; commends the Electoral Commission’s campaigns specifically targeting groups less likely to register, and urges Scottish authorities to follow its example, particularly in light of elections this year and next, in order to better serve the Scottish people.
