*S3M-5520 Aileen Campbell: Dutch Inquiry Finds Iraq War Was Illegal—That the Parliament notes the findings of the Dutch Committee of Inquiry on Iraq, which,, at the request of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands investigated the political support given by the Netherlands for the invasion of Iraq in the period from the summer of 2002 to the summer of 2003; notes the committee’s conclusion that "the military action had no sound mandate under international law", and believes that this finding gives further weight to the argument that the invasion of Iraq in 2003 was illegal, that such findings should be taken into account by the Chilcot Iraq Inquiry currently under way in London, and that those responsible for such illegal actions should be held to account under the terms of international law.
