*S3M-4151 Christine Grahame: Hot Brandingâ€”That the Parliament notes that from 1 July 2009 permanent identification by microchipping will be mandatory for all newborn foals and adult horses not already registered in the European Union, on implementation of the revised European rules (Commission Regulation (EC) 504/2008) on equine identification; considers that this measure removes, once and for all, any supposed necessity for the hot branding of horses; notes that the British Equine Veterinary Association has called for hot branding to be outlawed; believes that hot branding is an unnecessary mutilation involving the burning and scarring of sensitive living tissue, which should not be permitted in Scotland, and urges the Scottish Government to amend the Prohibited Procedures on Protected Animals (Exemptions) (Scotland) Regulations 2009 to ban hot branding.
