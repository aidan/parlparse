*S3M-5301 Anne McLaughlin: Detention of Children at Eid Al Adhaâ€”That the Parliament condemns the deeply insensitive decision to take five Muslim children and their parents into Dungavel Detention Centre two days before Eid Al Adha; considers that it is an outrageous act to detain any asylum-seeker child in such centres; believes that it adds insult to injury to demonstrate such a lack of cultural sensitivity, and urges all political parties in Scotland to continue working together toward cultural harmony and to end the detention of children at Dungavel.
