*S1M-482 Kay Ullrich: National Health Service in Scotland—That the Parliament recognises the debt owed to NHS staff at all levels in relation to their commitment over the winter period and through the flu outbreak; acknowledges that without this commitment on the part of the staff, the NHS in Scotland would not have coped over this period; recognises that the flu outbreak exposed an NHS in Scotland that is struggling to deliver high-quality patient care, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to acknowledge the problems that exist and to provide the necessary resources to ensure that the health service is adequately equipped and funded to provide optimum health care for the people of Scotland.
