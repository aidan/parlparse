*S2M-3335# Mr Duncan McNeil: Jimmy Cowan, The Prince of Goalkeepers—That the Parliament notes the nomination by the Greenock Morton Supporters’ Trust of legendary goalkeeper, Jimmy Cowan, for induction into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame; welcomes the enthusiastic backing which the bid has already received from the people of Greenock and Inverclyde and The Greenock Telegraph; notes that the 25 international caps that Cowan won during his illustrious career included the 3-1 win over England at Wembley in 1949, in which his heroic performance led to its being dubbed “Cowan’s Match”, and therefore considers that the Scottish football authorities should look beyond the usual suspects of the Old Firm when they come to consider on whom should be bestowed this most prestigious of honours and elevate “The Prince of Goalkeepers” to where he belongs.
