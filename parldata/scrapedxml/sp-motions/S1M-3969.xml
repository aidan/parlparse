*S1M-3969# Angus MacKay: 20th Anniversary of the Recognition of HIV/AIDS-That the Parliament notes that 2003 marks the 20th anniversary of the discovery of HIV as being the virus that leads to AIDS; further notes that at the end of 2002 the United Nations estimated that over 40 million people had been infected with the virus and many millions more affected by it; acknowledges that Scotland, and Edinburgh in particular, were seen as being at the forefront of the epidemic in the early 1980s; recognises the achievements of voluntary and statutory organisations involved in limiting the impact of HIV/AIDS in Scotland; further recognises that the current epidemic is particularly virulent in sub-Saharan Africa where over 25 million people are infected with the virus, and encourages Scottish organisations and institutions working on HIV/AIDS to develop partnerships with similar organisations in southern Africa to share expertise and encourage mutual understanding of how best to care for people with HIV and to maximise our efforts at preventing further transmissions of HIV.
