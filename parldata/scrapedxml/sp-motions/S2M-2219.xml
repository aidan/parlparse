*S2M-2219# Campbell Martin: School Zonesâ€”That the Parliament is concerned that evidence suggests that local authorities do not have available sufficient funding to ensure that every primary school has road safety measures in place that minimise the potential for injury or worse to schoolchildren on roads around their schools; therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure that "School Zone" road safety areas are created around every primary school in Scotland by either providing local authorities with sufficient funding to create such zones or by making the creation of such zones a responsibility of the Parliament, with funding provided directly by the Scottish Executive, and recognises that in the document, Review of Research on School Travel, produced on behalf of the Executive by the Derek Haldane Consultancy and published by the Scottish Executive Central Research Unit in 2002, reference is made in Chapter 4 (General) at 4.12 (Infrastructure and Enforcement) to the fact that for traffic calming schemes to improve safety, "They must be properly signed, well designed and use physical features appropriate for the local environment", but that, at present, roads around most primary schools in Scotland do not have any physical impediments to speed, such as chicanes and humps in the road.
