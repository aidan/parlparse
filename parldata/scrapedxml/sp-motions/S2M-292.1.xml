*S2M-292.1 Mr David Davidson: Investment and Change in Cancer Servicesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-292) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "acknowledges" to end and insert "welcomes the improvement in survival rates for the majority of cancers, thanks to scientific advances, and praises those in the health service who work to combat this disease, but notes with grave concern that the delivery of health care in Scotland has fallen short of the standards that people expect and deserve, with patients' chances of survival under threat due to unacceptably long waiting times, staff shortages, postcode prescribing and the inequalities in accessing clinical assessment throughout Scotland."
