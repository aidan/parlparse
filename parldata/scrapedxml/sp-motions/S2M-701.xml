 *S2M-701# Frances Curran: Coca Cola Sponsorship of UK Charts-That the Parliament notes with grave concern that Coca Cola has signed a sponsorship deal with the official UK charts company that will lead to the BBC mentioning the sponsor in every "Top of the Pops" and Radio 1 "Chart Show" broadcast; further notes that this product placement will effectively promote and advertise the drink to the millions of young people who watch and listen to these shows and that this is happening despite a voluntary undertaking from Coca Cola to cease targeting its products at under-12s; believes that the BBC has seriously breached its public broadcasting duties by agreeing to the terms of the sponsorship agreement and that voluntary regulation by the fast food manufacturers has patently failed, and considers that the Scottish Executive should introduce statutory regulation to curb the influence of advertising in promoting unhealthy diets to our children.
