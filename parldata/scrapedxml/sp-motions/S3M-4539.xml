S3M-4539 Jamie Hepburn: Part Privatisation of Royal Mail Delayedâ€”That the Parliament notes the decision of Lord Mandelson, Secretary of State for Business, Innovation and Skills, to delay the sell-off of Royal Mail; believes that any moves to privatise the postal service would result in a marked deterioration of service provision and conditions of those employed by Royal Mail; believes that the widespread dissent that has emerged amongst the Labour backbenches provides a clear indication of the scale of opposition that exists to these plans, and calls for the proposal, rather than being shelved, to be abandoned so that Royal Mail remains wholly within the public sector. Supported by: Alasdair Allan, Bob Doris, Christopher Harvie, Stewart Maxwell, Michael Matheson, Bill Wilson, Kenneth Gibson, Bill Kidd, Gil Paterson, Mike Pringle, Joe FitzPatrick, Shirley-Anne Somerville
