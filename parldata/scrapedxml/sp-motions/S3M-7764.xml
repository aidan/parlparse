*S3M-7764 Charlie Gordon: Fight to Retain BMI’s Glasgow/Heathrow Air Link—That the Parliament regards the threatened reduction in the frequency, or complete withdrawal, of BMI’s air service between Glasgow International and London Heathrow airports as a potentially serious blow to the Scottish economy; notes that the catalyst for doubts over the service’s future is the proposed increase in landing charges from April 2011 that has been made by Heathrow’s owners, BAA, of around £10 per passenger; further notes BMI’s intention to lodge a formal complaint under section 41 of the Airports Act 1986 regarding this; calls on the Scottish Government to add its weight to the efforts of other stakeholders to bolster the service, and calls on BAA to agree to impose a moratorium on its proposed increase in landing charges.
