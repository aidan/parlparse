 *S2M-1943.1 Christine Grahame: Domestic Abuse Servicesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-1943) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "and welcomes" to end and insert "expresses its concern, however, at the level of secure funding to agencies working in this area and the lack of suitably-located alternative accommodation for the victims of domestic abuse, particularly those with children; further expresses concern that services for elderly people who are victims of domestic abuse are even more limited, and commends the role of Tayside Domestic Abuse Service, the only service of its kind in Scotland where police and a voluntary organisation work together to support the victims of abuse, as a model of effective partnership working."
