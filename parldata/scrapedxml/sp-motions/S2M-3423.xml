*S2M-3423 Ms Sandra White: Amnesty International’s Protect the Human Week—That the Parliament supports Amnesty International’s (AI) Protect the Human Week from 16 to 22 October 2005; welcomes the organisation’s recent report on the detention of people who have sought asylum in the United Kingdom and congratulates the many schools across Scotland which will be holding a Refugees’ Voices assembly; realises that the impetus behind this awareness-raising week is to highlight the fact that there has been an increase in the number of people seeking asylum who are being detained under immigration law and that a large number of them are asylum-seeking families with children; is concerned that AI’s report points out that there are no comprehensive statistics on the number of those who have sought asylum who are held in detention or the length of time they are detained; shares the concerns of AI that the risk of absconding is being used as the justification for detention without meaningful assessment; calls on the Scottish Executive to use its limited powers to influence the government at Westminster to take notice of AI’s report, to properly assess asylum claimants and to have consideration for these people as human beings with rights and feelings, and further asks the Executive to consider getting the full powers of immigration devolved to Scotland so that the Scottish governing bodies can implement Scottish solutions and have a specifically tailored Scottish approach to immigration and asylum.
