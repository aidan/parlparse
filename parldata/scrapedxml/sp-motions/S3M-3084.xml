*S3M-3084 George Foulkes: School Budget Cuts Must Stop—That the Parliament welcomes the creation of the Edinburgh Parent Council Network, a first class framework for parent councils across Edinburgh to support each other in their work; congratulates the network on its first publication, a dossier detailing the very concerning impact that a 1.5% efficiency saving has had on school budgets this financial year and outlining just how the proposed 2% efficiency saving would devastate each school’s budget next year; calls on the Lib Dem/SNP council to abandon its plans for a 2% budget cut; reminds John Swinney MSP of his words in the Chamber on 20 November 2008 (Official Report, c. 12632) when he said "What might be described as crude cuts in services can in no way pass the test for efficiency savings", and believes that the SNP government’s historic concordat is failing Scotland’s children.
