*S2M-4889 Bruce Crawford: Stirling Livestock Market—That the Parliament is concerned by Labour-led Stirling Council’s decision to refuse planning permission for a new livestock market to be built in Stirling; notes that a livestock market has existed in Stirling for more than two centuries and is vital to the local economy of Stirling; further notes that the current site requires such extensive upgrading, to comply with European Union directives and animal health rules, that it is not a viable option; believes that the decision of those councillors who voted against the granting of an alternative site means that Stirling now risks losing its livestock market and the many jobs associated with it, and further believes that Stirling Council should enter immediate discussions with United Auctions to resolve this matter and ensure the long-term future of a livestock market in Stirling.
