*S1M-2468# Alasdair Morgan: North Channel Ferry Crossing—That the Parliament notes with regret that Stena Line is to withdraw one ferry from the Stranraer to Belfast route resulting in 92 job losses; welcomes, however, the feasibility study being undertaken by Stena Line into creating new port facilities in Loch Ryan and at Belfast with a view to decreasing crossing times and increasing the daily number of sailings; recognises the importance of the North Channel ferry traffic to the economy of Wigtownshire, and considers that the Scottish Executive should come forward with plans to upgrade the road infrastructure leading to the Loch Ryan ports in a way which will complement the investment undertaken by P &amp; O and Stena Line ferry companies.
