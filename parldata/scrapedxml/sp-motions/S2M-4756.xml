*S2M-4756 Bill Aitken: Glasgow - Favourite UK City—That the Parliament welcomes the news that Glasgow has been voted Favourite UK City 2006 by readers of leading lifestyle magazine, Condé Nast Traveller; believes that this award is testament to the great efforts of all those who have worked so hard to counter mistaken stereotypes of the city, especially those involved in the Glasgow - Scotland with Style campaign; supports comments made by Alex Mosson, Chairman of Glasgow City Marketing Bureau, that "this demonstrates a real vote of confidence in Glasgow as a vibrant, cosmopolitan and stylish destination", and hopes that Glasgow will continue to build on its growing reputation as a great city for people to visit.
