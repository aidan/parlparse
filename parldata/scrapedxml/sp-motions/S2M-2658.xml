 * S2M-2658 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Gypsy Travellers’ Right to Homes—That the Parliament utterly condemns discriminatory attacks on the gypsy traveller community by the Conservative Party leader, Michael Howard; acknowledges that it was the discriminatory policies of the 1994 Conservative Government, of which Michael Howard was part, which abolished the legislation that compelled councils to provide travellers’ sites; further acknowledges that the sites that do exist for gypsy travellers are of an insufficient standard and inadequate for their family and community needs, and calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce legislation to compel councils to create and maintain sites for gypsy travellers.
