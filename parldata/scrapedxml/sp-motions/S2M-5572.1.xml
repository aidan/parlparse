*S2M-5572.1 Carolyn Leckie: Making the NHS Localâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-5572) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from "congratulates" to end and insert "recognises that demand for acute services, including accident and emergency, intensive care and independent beds, will not decrease before preventative measures take effect in the context of an increasing elderly and dependent population, persistent socio-economic inequalities and related poor health; further recognises that there is insufficient capacity in the acute sector at present; believes that the future of the NHS is being undermined by government policies designed to fragment, commodify and privatise health care through, for example, open tendering for GP services, local improvement finance trusts (LIFT), joint ventures, the contracting of NHS care at Stracathro to the private sector and PFI, and believes that there needs to be a full needs-based assessment of the capacity the NHS requires to deliver optimum care in acute and community care settings and that reductions in acute provision should be halted until this is achieved and commitment made to deliver the capacity required as locally as possible, that all recent legislation which has opened up the NHS to market forces should be repealed and that the costly and discredited policy of PFI should be abandoned."
