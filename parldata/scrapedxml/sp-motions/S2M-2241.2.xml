*S2M-2241.2 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Victims and Witnesses—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2241) in the name of Hugh Henry, insert at end "; further notes that, whilst it is a citizen’s duty to report crime and testify, in doing so significant difficulties and dangers can be encountered by many; calls for additional assistance to be given towards rehousing and protection including a specific Scottish Witness Protection Programme, and further recognises the serious psychological effect that being a witness or victim of crime often involves and so calls for any future reform in this area to include adequate provision for treatment of trauma."
