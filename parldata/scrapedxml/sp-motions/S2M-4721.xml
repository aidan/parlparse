 *S2M-4721 Donald Gorrie: The Need for Common Sense Over Regulationâ€”That the Parliament is anxious that any regulation relating to the publicising and enforcement of the law on smoking in enclosed public spaces should be composed and interpreted with common sense, especially since the law is being observed with very few exceptions; believes that it is important to retain the impressive goodwill among the public towards the policy on smoking in such spaces and not to lose this goodwill by introducing measures such as compelling retailers who have no problems with smokers and have operated a no smoking policy for many years to put up large no smoking notices, and urges those responsible for enforcing the law to deal effectively with occasions when people do smoke in contravention of the law and to let other people get on with life as normal and not harass them.
