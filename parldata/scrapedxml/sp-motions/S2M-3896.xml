*S2M-3896# Christine Grahame: Keeping Healthcare Local—That the Parliament notes the determination of the communities of Coldstream and Jedburgh to keep their cottage hospitals and that many hundreds of people turned out at recent rallies in Coldstream and Jedburgh to save local healthcare; further notes that GPs and the churches, together with MSPs across political parties, support retention; recognises that in both communities there are developed plans to modernise healthcare provision through the cottage hospitals; further recognises that the increasing elderly population in these communities means that there is more, not less, need for these two hospitals; notes that the Borders General Hospital is already unable to accept all of the elderly people who require beds and cannot discharge others for want of support services, and believes that the Scottish Executive, in the spirit of the Kerr report and in the interests of these Borders communities, should refuse any application for closures.
