*S2M-5385 Margo MacDonald: Awareness of Coeliac Disease—That the Parliament is concerned that the average general practitioner has little or no experience of coeliac disease, an extremely debilitating illness that affects one in 100 of the population, of which seven out of eight are undiagnosed; regrets that the lack of knowledge of this condition prevents many people with coeliac disease from receiving early diagnosis, leading to serious complications such as osteoporosis and bowel cancer if left undetected; welcomes the work done by Coeliac UK in providing literature, advice, a helpline and dietary information to address this need, and calls on the Scottish Executive to promote such measures as it sees fit to ensure that GPs receive more appropriate training and support to enable them to recognise and to diagnose the disease more accurately.
