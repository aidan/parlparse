*S3M-950 Sarah Boyack: Excellent HMIE Report into Workers’ Educational Association—That the Parliament congratulates the Workers’ Educational Association (WEA) on the publication of a glowing report by HM Inspectorate of Education on its programme of courses; notes that WEA was founded in Scotland in 1903 originally to promote the education of working men and women at a time when few educational opportunities existed and today continues to provide adult learning in the workplace and in the community based on democratic principles in conjunction with a range of local authorities, enterprise companies, employers, trades unions and voluntary sector partners; further notes the inspectorate’s comments that WEA Scotland is "developing and delivering work that no other organisation was providing and the organisation was sector leading in terms of its practice and range of partnerships" and that it achieved an excellent or very good rating in every category of inspection; is concerned that the delivery of the WEA’s courses in the capital must not be undermined by the City of Edinburgh Council’s plans to close its current home at Riddles Court Community Centre, and calls on the council’s administration to ensure that WEA is able to continue its valuable work helping adults in Edinburgh and the Lothians to gain new skills and qualifications.
