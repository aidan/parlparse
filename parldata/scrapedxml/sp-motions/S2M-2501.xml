*S2M-2501 Rosie Kane: Agent Orange—That the Parliament applauds the people of Vietnam in their decision to bring a civil law suit that seeks class action status, claiming that up to 4 million Vietnamese people suffered dioxin poisoning due to Agent Orange; condemns utterly the stance taken by the Dow Chemical Company and Monsanto to attempt to have this action dismissed; rejects totally the claim by Dow Chemical Company and Monsanto that there is no connection between Agent Orange and the health problems that it is known to cause; further rejects the idea that the lack of a law on corporate liability in the 1960s is any defence, and agrees to send a message of support and solidarity to the people of Vietnam in this case.
