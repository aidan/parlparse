*S3M-6663 Liam McArthur: Scottish Hockey and Scotland’s Islands—That the Parliament notes the assurances given by Scottish Hockey that it will not impose a rule on its national league matches requiring them to be played on the Scottish mainland unless both teams agree otherwise; also notes their undertaking to review a similar rule that already applies to its District Cup and Plate competition; welcomes this as a recognition that island teams should not be discriminated against, and believes that Scottish mainland teams lucky enough to travel to Orkney or any other islands for a match will receive a warm island welcome, which will make the effort of getting there well worthwhile.
