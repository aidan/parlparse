 *S3M-3223 Bill Kidd: Taxes Galore—That the Parliament expresses concern over the announcement by the UK Government that whisky prices will rise again when VAT returns to 17.5% rather than alcohol duty being reduced, as had been expected, in order to create price and market stability; considers that whisky companies that are major local employers, such as Edringtons in Glasgow, will be adversely affected by these rises, and believes that Secretary of State for Scotland Jim Murphy should make representations to the UK Government to protect this vital industry, which contributes so much to the local and national economy.
