 *S3M-319 Pauline McNeill: Super-Carriers Secure Future of Shipbuilding on the Clyde—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the UK Government of an order worth some £3.8 billion for the United Kingdom’s two new aircraft carriers which will help to secure the long-term future of Scotstoun and Govan shipyards; congratulates the 3,000 workers based at the BAE Systems’ sites in the Glasgow Kelvin and Glasgow Govan constituencies; notes the recruitment of a further 100 designers and 400 other staff to complete this ambitious project and the nature of these high quality employment opportunities, and recognises the commitment of the UK Government and successive Scottish administrations and the work done by Scotland’s representatives in Westminster and Holyrood over the last 10 years that has ensured the viability of the Scottish shipbuilding and defence industries on the Clyde and in other areas such as Rosyth.
