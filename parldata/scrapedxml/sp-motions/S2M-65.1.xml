 *S2M-65.1 Jackie Baillie: Reduction in Services at Vale of Leven General Hospital—As an amendment to motion (S2M-65) in the name of Frances Curran, leave out from "elderly" to end and insert "services at the Vale of Leven Hospital caused by a combination of the increasing specialisation of staff, particularly in surgery, the inability of Argyll and Clyde NHS Board to attract staff to the area and the demands of Royal College guidelines; further notes the contingency arrangements in place for the provision of maternity services, in partnership with the Queen Mother's Hospital, Glasgow, and for accident and emergency services; welcomes the forthcoming return of maternity services delivered through a midwife-led unit and the prospect of returning full orthopaedic surgery to the Vale of Leven Hospital; recognises the deep concern of local people at the gradual erosion of services and, in particular, at the recent announcement by Argyll and Clyde NHS Board of changes to the accident and emergency service; urges the Scottish Executive to review all the circumstances that led to the decision, and believes that the acute services review, due to be launched in the summer, provides a real opportunity to deliver sustainable and improved healthcare for the future."
