 *S2M-2247# Helen Eadie: Scotland Leads the Way in Revolutionary New Skin Cancer Treatment, Highlighting Partnership Between Dunfermline, St Andrews and Dundee—That the Parliament welcomes the fact that Scotland is leading the way in developing a revolutionary new skin cancer treatment; notes the significance of this development as skin cancer has become so prevalent throughout the world that full statistics are generally no longer collected for its most common form, non-malignant melanoma; acknowledges conservative estimates that around 10% of Scotland’s population, or half a million people, will suffer from the disease at some point in their lifetime and that the percentages of the population at risk in countries with sunnier climates, such as the United States of America and Australia, are very much higher; regrets that non-melanoma skin cancer is often excluded from comparative analyses of cancer data due to a perception by medical professionals that cancers of this kind are rarely life-threatening; welcomes, however, the news that most non-melanoma skin cancers are detected early and can be treated on an out-patient basis; understands that the relationship between sunlight and skin cancer is well known, but also welcomes the news that cause can become treatment; congratulates, therefore, Professor Samuel of the Organic Semiconductor Centre at the University of St Andrews and Dermatology Consultant and Professor James Ferguson, Head of the Photobiology Unit at Ninewells Hospital in Dundee, who have come up with a novel way of treating melanomas using a treatment called "photodynamic therapy" with the use of "light bandages", a concept which has never been tried anywhere else in the world and which works by using a dressing containing its own light source; notes that patients undergoing photodynamic therapy are able to move around freely, ensuring that it is less painful than existing treatment methods because a less intense light is required and that using the bandage is also often more effective as it can be used over a longer period of time; further notes that Professor Samuel and Professor Ferguson are ready to take the next step towards making it available to the world, and commends Mr Alf Stewart, a Dunfermline businessman, for his generous financial support of the photodynamic treatment for cancer through the Barbara Stewart Cancer Trust in memory of his late wife, Barbara, a victim of skin cancer.
