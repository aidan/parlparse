 *S3M-1001 Murdo Fraser: Reinstate our Christmas Carol Service—That the Parliament notes with regret the decision to hold a festive evening rather than a Christmas carol service in the Parliament this year; is concerned that this represents a further retreat from celebrating the traditional Christmas message; considers that, as a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ and a long-established national festival, Christmas should be explicitly celebrated annually in the Parliament, and therefore believes that the festive evening should be scrapped and the traditional Christmas service reinstated.
