*S3M-3373 Christine Grahame: SSPCA v RSPCA—That the Parliament notes the concerns of and campaign raised by the Scottish SPCA (SSPCA) about the fundraising activity of the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), which has fundraised in Scotland with all the monies it has raised going exclusively to animal welfare in England and Wales; urges the Scottish Government, in consultation with Her Majesty’s Government, to undertake a review of the regulations governing cross-border charity fundraising to ensure that individual donors know explicitly in which country their money will be spent, and calls on the RSPCA to transfer the monies that it has raised in Scotland over the past 10 years, or for such reasonable period as the SSPCA and RSPCA see fit, to the SSPCA to ensure that this body continues in its vital role to uphold and maintain welfare standards for animals across Scotland and that the intentions of those who have mistakenly donated to the RSPCA in the belief that such monies were being applied to the welfare of animals in Scotland are respected. R Supported by: Robin Harper*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Bashir Ahmad*, Jamie Hepburn*, Brian Adam*, Stuart McMillan*
