*S3M-3075.2 Alison McInnes: ScotRail Franchise—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3075) in the name of Des McNulty, insert at end "requires the Scottish Government to conduct the next steps of the franchise extension process with the greatest possible transparency, and therefore calls on the Minister for Transport, Infrastructure and Climate Change to bring before Parliament the draft proposals on how the £73.1 million accrued through the franchise extension will be reinvested to allow close scrutiny of the plans before any further funds are committed."
