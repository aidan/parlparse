* S3M-6612 Ian McKee: Edinburgh Tenants Federation—That the Parliament congratulates the Edinburgh Tenants Federation in its 20th anniversary year for winning the nationally acclaimed Frances Nelson Award for its pioneering work to improve services for high-rise block tenants with mental health difficulties; notes that, over the past four years, the organisation has focused on developing mental health services for tenants following two tragic suicide events in high-rise blocks; commends the organisation’s efforts for creating a mental health working group with the City of Edinburgh Council and a number of agencies across Scotland, which resulted in the provision of training for over 200 council staff in suicide awareness, increased support and material for frontline staff and the launch of a mental health awareness campaign; considers that its services have become significant to many community groups in Edinburgh, and hopes that other tenant groups across Scotland can learn from the processes that have lead to the establishment of these crucial mental health services.
