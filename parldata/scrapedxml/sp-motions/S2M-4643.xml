*S2M-4643 Margaret Smith: Cash Machines—That the Parliament notes with concern the increasing use of charging cash machines in Scotland; notes research from the Nationwide Building Society which found that UK consumers spent £140 million on cash machine charges in 2004; further notes the projection by Which? that by 2015 over half of the cash machines in the United Kingdom are expected to charge for transactions; is concerned that these machines can prevent people having free access to their own money; is particularly concerned that there is a particularly negative impact in deprived areas such as Muirhouse, in Edinburgh, where there are no local bank branches to provide an alternative place to withdraw cash free and where local people are less likely to have credit or debit cards; is concerned that, for individuals on incapacity benefit withdrawing funds three times in one week, charges can amount to 8% of weekly income; supports the conclusions of the Treasury Select Committee’s 2005 inquiry into cash machine charges, and calls for all charging machines to be clearly labelled, for the charges levied by cash machines to be capped at a rate that reflects the cost of transactions, for banks in Scotland to ensure that consumers have access to at least one free cash machine in every community and for the Scottish Executive to consider holding urgent talks with banks in Scotland to tackle the financial inclusion issues that this situation raises.
