*S2M-1003# Christine Grahame: Crisis for Borders Schools-That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed closure of the following Borders schools: Cranshaws, Teviothead, Eccles/Leitholm, Hutton, Roberton, Teviothead, Ednam, Channelkirk, Newlands, Oxnam, Glen Douglas, Heriot and Fountainhall; further notes that Scottish Borders Council in its consultation document Management Review of the School Estate in the Scottish Borders, in particular the chart describing the factors that may be considered when making decisions on the schools' long-term viability, did not include the "importance of the local school to the community" which had been included in the first stage evaluation; reminds the Scottish Executive of its commitment in A Partnership for a Better Scotland to "continued reform so that our public services are designed and delivered around the needs of individuals and the community within which they live" and also its commitment in Building our Future Scotland's School Estate to place "the child at the centre, meeting the needs of the individual" and "the school at the heart of the community, meeting the needs of the communities"; believes that the proposed closures, against the expressed wishes of many communities, are driven by the requirements of proposed PPP/PFI school building programmes, and therefore believes that the Executive should adhere to its aforesaid commitments and reject rural school closure proposals which, if they proceed, will permanently damage fragile communities.
