 * S2M-2374 Colin Fox: A Tribute to Martyn Bennett—That the Parliament pays tribute to Martyn Bennett, one of Scotland’s most talented musicians; recognises that his untimely death from cancer at the age of 33 leaves a vacuum in Scottish music; acknowledges that he was classically trained as a violinist at the Royal Scottish Academy of Music and Drama, was an accomplished piper and fiddler and was raised with folk music and storytelling; regards his innovative contribution to Scottish music as unique; further notes that he was responsible for evolving and progressing Scottish traditional music, fusing it together with contemporary dance music and Scottish storytelling to widen its appeal to a new young audience, and deeply regrets his passing.
