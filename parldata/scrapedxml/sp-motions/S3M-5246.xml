*S3M-5246 Rob Gibson: Announce Pentland Firth Leases Locally—That the Parliament notes that the Crown Estate Commission is due to announce in March 2010 the proposed leases of sites in the Pentland Firth for marine power development; argues that this announcement should be made in either Caithness or Orkney to show commitment to the area that will ultimately deliver on the renewable potential for Scotland and the rest of Europe, and believes that the decision to make such an important announcement elsewhere is inappropriate.
