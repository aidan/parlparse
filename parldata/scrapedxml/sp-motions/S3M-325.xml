*S3M-325 Helen Eadie: Carrier Jobs Announcement—That the Parliament welcomes the Ministry of Defence’s announcement of the order of two aircraft carriers for the Royal Navy which will support and create around 10,000 jobs across the United Kingdom, with a significant portion of the economic benefit being felt in Scotland; acknowledges that hundreds of jobs are projected for each of the four worksites including in Rosyth and the west of Scotland, with thousands of support jobs to follow; notes that this announcement compounds further the good news for the Forth Bridgehead area, as the carrier jobs that will result, in conjunction with the construction jobs from a new Forth crossing, will enhance the regeneration taking place across Fife and bolster economic confidence in central Scotland, and celebrates the fact that, as the final job of joining the hull sections of the carriers is slated for the Rosyth shipyard, the eventual launch of the largest UK military vessels ever is likely to be from the Fife shore.
