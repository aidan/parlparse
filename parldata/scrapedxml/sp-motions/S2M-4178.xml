*S2M-4178&lt;&gt; Rob Gibson: Unchecked Spiral in Land Prices—That the Parliament notes that prices paid for Scottish estates have outperformed stock market values over the past 25 years; also notes that property prices for farms, houses and flats have risen in consequence of spiralling land prices, with especially negative effects in the Highlands and Islands, so that new entrants to farming and potential house buyers cannot relate the prices being asked to the income and wages which they can realistically hope to earn; regrets the lack of a land value tax in Scotland to correct the inflation of unearned increases in land prices; therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should bring forward a scheme for land value tax; recalls that this was not dismissed but merely postponed in the first range of land reform proposals until adequate research had been conducted, and believes that the Executive should ensure that Scots have a realistic opportunity to access affordable land for both homes and business development in their own country.
