*S1M-3469.1 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Future of Air Transport in Scotlandâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-3469) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from "consultation" to end and insert "urgent need, in relation to tourism and the economy in Scotland, to increase the limited number of direct international connections and to expand the number of routes operated by low-cost carriers; further notes that Inverness Airport is operated by Highlands and Islands Airport Limited, which is wholly owned by Scottish Ministers; is concerned at studies indicating that Inverness Airport has the highest landing charges in Europe, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to set up a route development fund to promote direct international connections from Scotland and to take immediate action to reduce the landing charges imposed at Inverness Airport."
