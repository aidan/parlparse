*S3M-900 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Tenth Anniversary of the Jubilee Scotland Campaign—That the Parliament congratulates Jubilee Scotland on the 10th anniversary of the global debt campaign in Scotland; notes that Jubilee Scotland’s campaigns were significant in keeping the debt issue in the public eye and so contributed to the significant write-off of debt agreed at the G8 Summit in 2005; recognises that Jubilee Scotland has recently set out a three-year vision for continuing to attack issues of global injustice from the perspective of debt, and wishes Jubilee Scotland well with its future campaigns.
