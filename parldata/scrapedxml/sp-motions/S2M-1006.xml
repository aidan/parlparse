*S2M-1006 Frances Curran: Erskine Bridge Tollsâ€”That the Parliament notes with grave disappointment the statement by Trish Godman MSP on 4 March 2004 in the Parliament that she has opposed tolls on the Erskine Bridge since "day one" when it considers that the Official Report, on 6 September 2001, clearly shows that this is not so; believes that Trish Godman MSP has failed in her role of upholding the aspirations of wisdom, justice, compassion and integrity of the Scottish people for their members of the Parliament, and considers that she should set the record straight by acknowledging that in the last session of the Parliament she supported tolls and voted in favour of them.
