*S2M-5600 Roseanna Cunningham: Government’s Decision to Pursue a Programme of New Nuclear Power Stations - "Unlawful"—That the Parliament welcomes the High Court judgement that the UK Government’s decision to pursue a programme of new nuclear power stations is unlawful; congratulates Greenpeace on bringing the case in an effort to ensure full and free public information; agrees with Mr Justice Sullivan’s judgement that the government’s energy review did not constitute the "fullest public consultation" that had been promised as a condition for backing new nuclear power stations in the 2003 Energy White Paper, that the consultation exercise on the energy review was "seriously flawed" and that the process was "manifestly inadequate and unfair" because no clear proposals nor adequate information was made available by the government to allow consultees to make an "intelligent response"; deplores the fact that the government’s failure to disclose relevant documents made it impossible for stakeholders to comment on important aspects of the policy; believes that Scotland’s energy needs can be met by developing renewable energy rather than nuclear power, and resolves that there shall be no nuclear power stations in Scotland.
