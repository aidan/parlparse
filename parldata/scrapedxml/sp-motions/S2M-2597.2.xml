*S2M-2597.2 Tommy Sheridan: Educationâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-2597) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from "acknowledges" to end and insert "fully endorses a comprehensive education system based on equality of opportunity for all from the nursery sector through to secondary education and beyond; supports a reduction in class sizes to no more than 20 or, indeed, less, along with suitably-qualified support teachers with expertise in working alongside classroom teachers to support pupils with special educational needs and social, emotional and behavioural difficulties, and recognises that early intervention in early years, learning styles and developing emotional intelligence are key areas that require different approaches to learning and teaching, alongside flexibility to ensure that all children and young people reach their potential."
