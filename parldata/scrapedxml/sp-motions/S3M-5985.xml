*S3M-5985Stewart Maxwell:Finland Acts to Cut Number of Fire Deaths—That the Parliament congratulates the Finnish Government on the swift action that it has taken to protect its population from smoking-related fires by introducing reduced ignition propensity (RIP) cigarettes from 1 April 2010; commends the Finnish Government on showing that there is no need for governments and cigarette manufacturers to drag their feet on this issue; acknowledges that 41% of accidental dwelling fire deaths are caused by smokers’ materials and that smoking products are the leading cause of domestic fire deaths across Europe, and strongly urges the European Union to finish the job of setting and implementing a safety standard that will protect smokers, their families and neighbours and firefighters across Europe.
