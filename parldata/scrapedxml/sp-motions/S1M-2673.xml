 *S1M-2673 Michael Russell: OECD Programme for International Student Assessment: Scottish Report-That the Parliament notes the OECD Programme for International Student Assessment: Scottish Report which confirmed that Scotland's young people have the potential to be the best in the world in terms of school attainment but that they have not yet reached that position; congratulates students and teachers on their performance in the light of continual interference from a Scottish Executive which is not meeting its own targets in education, and notes that the report specifically states that "the performance in reading literacy of students (at age 15) varied substantially with the amount of time they read for enjoyment", thus confirming the importance of enjoyment and personal satisfaction in educational attainment in contrast to imposing the treadmill of over-assessment which remains the Scottish Executive's policy.
