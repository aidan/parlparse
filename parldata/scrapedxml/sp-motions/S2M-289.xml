 *S2M-289# Shona Robison: Nurse Recruitment and Retention—That the Parliament is concerned about the 52% rise in nurse vacancies since 1999 and the increase in spend on agency nurses to £28 million per year; notes that nurse recruitment and retention problems are not diminishing; understands that nurses’ pay is an important part of the solution to the recruitment and retention problem and pays tribute to the role played by both the Royal College of Nursing and Unison campaigns in raising awareness of this; recognises that the Agenda for Change has made some progress on pay and conditions, but believes that there needs to be a Scottish recruitment and retention premium, as allowed by the Agenda for Change deal, in order to fully address the problem of nurse recruitment and retention by attracting more nurses to come and work in Scotland.
