 *S3M-5648 Jackie Baillie: Free Prescriptions for Cancer Patients—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish National Party’s Angus MacNeil MP for originally supporting Early Day Motion (EDM) 641 on prescription charges; notes that the motion suggests that the Scottish Government should follow the lead of the UK Government in exempting cancer patients from prescription charges; further notes that cancer patients in England have enjoyed free prescriptions since April 2009, whereas in Scotland they will be required to pay £3 per prescription until 1 April 2010; shares the disappointment of those who supported EDM 641 that the Scottish Government has not acted on this quickly; regrets that the SNP has broken promises from its 2005 and 2007 election manifestos when it stated that it would end prescription charges for cancer patients immediately, and calls on SNP members to pay heed to the sensible view of their colleague at Westminster.
