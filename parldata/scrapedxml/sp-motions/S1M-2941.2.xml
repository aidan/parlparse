*S1M-2941.2 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Tourism—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2941) in the name of Mike Watson, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the damage caused to the tourism industry by the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease and the events of 11 September 2001; further notes that the underlying problems of the high pound and high fuel costs remain; notes with concern that the Scottish Executive’s Tourism Framework for Action 2002-05 contains no additional funding; calls on the Executive to promote marketing and accessibility for the sector, and further calls for action to open new air routes to Scotland and to make VisitScotland, not the British Tourist Authority, responsible for marketing Scotland abroad."
