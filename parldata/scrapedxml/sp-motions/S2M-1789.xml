 *S2M-1789 Mr Jamie Stone: Concern at Rising Oil Prices—That the Parliament notes with concern the increase in oil prices beyond $50 a barrel for the first time, taking oil to the highest price it has ever been; notes the comments of the Opec President that "If prices continue to go up there will be a danger to the global economy … I warn that high oil prices will result in the start of a recession"; notes Opec’s aim to keep oil prices between $22 and $28 a barrel; believes that high oil prices are linked with international conflict and are not a cause for celebration, and calls for increased use of renewable resources to reduce the global dependence on oil for economic stability.
