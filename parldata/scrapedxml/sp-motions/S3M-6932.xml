 *S3M-6932# Anne McLaughlin: Silence in George Square—That the Parliament condemns what it considers to be the culture of silence in Glasgow City Council’s Labour administration enveloping the large number of scandals in recent months; considers that the City Chambers has been linked with drug taking, breach of the peace, awarding contracts to firms with gangland links, systematic patronage in the appointment of arms length external organisations and the complete mismanagement of the handling of an important LGBT centre, and would welcome an investigation into the goings-on in the Labour Party in Glasgow.
