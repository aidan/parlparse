*S2M-5064 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Make School Make Sense—That the Parliament recognises that children with autistic spectrum disorder have the potential to learn, achieve and make a positive contribution to school life; is concerned that many children with autism find it difficult to access an appropriate education; welcomes the National Autistic Society Scotland’s "make school make sense" campaign to improve educational provision for children with autism; supports the campaign’s demands that every child with autism should have local access to a diverse range of mainstream and specialist educational provision, that all teachers should expect to teach a child with autism and must receive appropriate training to best support their needs, and that all schools should be autism-friendly schools which promote and provide a positive environment for children with autism now and in the future, and calls on the Scottish Executive to implement these demands, so that all children with autism have access to the education to which they are entitled.
