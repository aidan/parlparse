* S3M-6617 Elaine Murray: Keep the Moratorium on Whaling—That the Parliament notes with concern that the upcoming Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC), which takes place in Agadir in Morocco from Monday 21 to Friday 25 June 2010, will discuss lifting the moratorium on commercial whaling; strongly urges the IWC not to relax commercial whaling laws; deplores the practice of commercial whaling, and calls on the Scottish and UK governments to appeal to the whaling nations to stop the practice.
