 *S3M-7413 Jackie Baillie: SNP in a Spin with the Living Wage—That the Parliament condemns the decision by SNP councillors on West Dunbartonshire Council to vote down a proposal to introduce a living wage for its lowest paid employees; notes that this is the fourth time that SNP councillors have voted down a proposal by the Labour Group to introduce a living wage for those workers earning less than £7.15 an hour; believes that this flies in the face of comments from Councillor Ronnie McColl, SNP leader of the council, who, following what it regards as Alex Salmond’s belated support for the living wage, performed a U-turn by saying that he had got it wrong and that he now supported the policy; believes that, with what it considers all their spinning, the local SNP must now feel very dizzy in light of this U-turn, and calls on West Dunbartonshire Council to implement the living wage without further delay. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
