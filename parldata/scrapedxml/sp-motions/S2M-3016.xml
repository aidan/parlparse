*S2M-3016 Rosie Kane: The War on All Terror—That the Parliament supports the efforts of Fidel Castro and the Cuban people in their pursuit of justice in relation to Luis Posada Carriles and Orlando Bosch, who have openly boasted about their involvement in terrorist attacks on Cuban citizens throughout the world, including the bombing of a Cuban Airline in 1976 which resulted in the deaths of all 73 people on board, including five students who were travelling to Cuba to train as doctors and the Cuban teenage fencing team who were described disgustingly on Miami TV by Orlando Bosch as "niggers"; considers that George W Bush, the President of the United States of America, cannot wage a "War on Terror" around the world warning countries that they must not hide terrorists when his own administration is doing exactly that in relation to Carriles and Bosch; furthermore congratulates Fidel Castro for his openness and honesty in gathering together 700 delegates from 67 different countries, including the United Kingdom, America, Australia, Spain and Russia, to hear evidence at a three-day forum in Havana from 2 to 4 June 2005 which was broadcast live and unedited throughout Cuba, the Caribbean, parts of America and on the internet to the rest of the world; thanks the Cuban Government for furnishing us with video footage of the entire event, and asks that the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, raises the issue with George W Bush when they meet at Gleneagles.
