 *S2M-4654 Mr Ted Brocklebank: Death of Tom Weir—That the Parliament notes the sad death of the broadcaster, climber, naturalist and writer, Tom Weir, whose STV programme, "Weir’s Way", brought the beauty of Scotland’s outdoor places to generations of Scots and those further afield; recognises his genuine ability to engage with all types of people and his passion for the Scottish landscape and natural history; further notes the rediscovery of Tom’s work through recent repeats of his work on television which has gained a new and younger audience, and sends its condolences to his wife and family.
