 * S2M-2707# Ms Sandra White: Support for Inclusion Scotland Manifesto—That the Parliament congratulates Inclusion Scotland on the recent launch of its “Manifesto for Inclusion” document which seeks to promote, amongst other things, independent living for disabled people, allowing them to have the same choices, controls and freedoms as any other citizen; notes that the document calls for a significant transformation with regard to expenditure between institutional and non-institutional care, and considers that all of Scotland’s politicians should read and support the calls made in the document, such as the right to live in the community with appropriate support and not in an institution, a greater emphasis on self-assessment in the existing community care assessment process, that the “duty of care” retained by social work should be redefined, that all planning partners should develop advocacy services for all people with a mental health disorder to meet the requirements of the Mental Health Care and Treatment (Scotland) Act 2003, and that there should be varied and flexible housing across all tenures for disabled people, the inclusion of key disabled stakeholders in the formulation of transport strategies and associated legislation at all levels, increased resources to support mainstream educational opportunities for all disabled children and adults, a coherent strategy to meet the needs of disabled job seekers and employees, improved portrayal and inclusion of disabled people in the mainstream media, inclusive access for all to all public spaces, the enactment of a single equality bill as an urgent priority, a complete review of wheelchair/power chair services in Scotland, acknowledgement that disabled people are also sexual beings with attendant health and emotional needs and, finally, increased awareness and funding of disabled patients’ independent advocacy services.
