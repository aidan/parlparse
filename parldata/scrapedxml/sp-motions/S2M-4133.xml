*S2M-4133 Pauline McNeill: Unions Work: Rebuilding Scotland’s Trade Union Movement—That the Parliament joins with the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) in welcoming the rise in trade union membership levels in Scotland; acknowledges that statistics show that 2005 saw a rise of over 4,000 in the membership of STUC-affiliated trade unions, giving a membership density of some 33.7 per cent; believes that the increase in the number of women members is particular proof that Scotland’s unions are organising better, campaigning better and recruiting better around the issues that concern Scottish workers; believes that membership of a trade union remains the best way for individual workers to achieve better workplaces and a better Scotland; congratulates the STUC and its affiliates on the success of the "Unions Work" campaign, and declares that modern, growing trade unions are an important, indeed vital, part of both Scottish society and of the viability and future success of Scotland’s economy.
