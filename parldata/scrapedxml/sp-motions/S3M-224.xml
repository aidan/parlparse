 *S3M-224 Bill Wilson: Blair, Middle East Envoy—That the Parliament notes reports of a discussion between outgoing UK Prime Minister Blair, US President Bush and US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice about the former becoming a Middle East envoy; believes that the policies supported by the three thus far have, by and large, only promoted peace in that troubled region in the sense of the Orwellian slogan "War is Peace", and accordingly wishes Mr Blair well in a role that would require him to undo the damage done by the UK’s and USA’s invasion of Iraq and their markedly selective support of democracy, human rights and United Nations resolutions in the Middle East. Supported by: Christine Grahame*
