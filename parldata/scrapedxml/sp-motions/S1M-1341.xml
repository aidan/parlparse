*S1M-1341# Alex Neil: Energy Review-That the Parliament recognises the need for a far-reaching and thorough debate concerning energy in Scotland; notes with concern reports that government discussion papers may promote nuclear power as the answer to our environmental plight; asks for a clear commitment that nuclear power will be rejected as an option beyond the lifetime of existing plants, and believes that the Scottish Executive should initiate such a debate, which will look to both address energy consumption and realise Scotland's potential as a source of research into and production of renewable energy alternatives.
