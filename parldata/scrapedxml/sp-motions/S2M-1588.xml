 *S2M-1588 Christine Grahame: People First Borders-That the Parliament recognises the value of People First Borders, a self-advocacy movement for adults with learning difficulties where participants learn about their rights and how to improve their independence while in a supportive environment, building confidence and empowering each other; notes the crucial role of the volunteers as well as staff; congratulates it on the success of its recent annual conference which highlighted the transport difficulties for participants, and calls on the Scottish Executive to help publicise the Thistle Travel Card scheme and take other steps to assist those with learning difficulties to reach their full potential.
