 *S1M-2421 Trish Godman: Trade Union and Employee Negotiations-That the Parliament is deeply concerned at the growing number of job losses in Renfrewshire and elsewhere in the West of Scotland; believes that companies experiencing difficulties in domestic and international markets must take their loyal and hard-working employees into their trust when difficult or harsh decisions have to be taken; urges all companies to engage in honest and forthright negotiations with both employees and their trade unions in order to ensure reasonable settlements, retraining and redeployment for those who regrettably lose their jobs, and condemns the small minority of companies that obstinately refuse to engage in constructive dialogue on such serious matters with employees and trade union representatives.
