*S3M-1834 Dr Richard Simpson: Convener of the Standards and Public Appointments Committee—That the Parliament notes with concern Keith Brown MSP’s decision to accept a £15,000 payment after standing down as a member of Clackmannanshire Council despite stating during the election campaign that "it would not be morally right to take this money"; expresses concern that Keith Brown has not declared this payment in his register of interests; believes that Keith Brown as convener of the Standards, Procedures and Public Appointments Committee has compromised his position and should resign as convener, and calls on Keith Brown to apologise to people in Ochil for his inconsistency on this matter.
