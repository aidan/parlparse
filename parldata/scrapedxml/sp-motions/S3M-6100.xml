*S3M-6100 Liam McArthur: Fishing Musical Chairs—That the Parliament notes that Ian Gatt is to step down as the President of the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation (SFF) and is to join the Scottish Pelagic Fishermen’s Association (SPFA) as its new Chief Executive, replacing Derek Duthie who, in turn, is moving to the Scottish Fishermen’s Federation to become its new Director of Administration and Finance; recognises the track record of service to Scotland’s vital fishing industry that both Ian Gatt and Derek Duthie will take with them to their new posts; believes that the SFF’s loss is the SPFA’s gain and vice versa; welcomes the fact that the expertise each gentleman has brought to the fishing industry will not be lost, and wishes both of them every success in their new posts.
