*S3M-1027# Sandra White: Tackling Homelessness—That the Parliament commends the Glasgow Rent Deposit and Support Scheme (GRDSS), which enables homeless people to gain access to quality private rented accommodation by acting as an independent third party providing landlords with a bond guarantee on tenants’ behalf and providing support for clients to enable them to remain in their tenancies; welcomes the GRDSS befriending service aimed at supporting previously homeless people to integrate into the community by way of providing access to social activities and regular contact with volunteers, and acknowledges that these services are essential if we are to eradicate homelessness and offer those taken off the streets hope for the future.
