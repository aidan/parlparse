*S2M-2166 Patricia Ferguson: Tourism - Ambitions for Scotland—That the Parliament recognises the economic benefits of promoting the long-term growth of Scotland’s tourism industry; approves of the Scottish Executive’s ambition, shared with VisitScotland and the tourism sector, of achieving 50% revenue growth over the next decade; notes that this will benefit the economies of rural as well as city and urban areas in every part of the country; appreciates that this long-term growth can only be achieved by ensuring that the marketing of Scotland in UK and overseas tourism markets is further strengthened and that the businesses that comprise the tourism and hospitality sectors are encouraged to compete even more strongly and coherently in this most competitive of global industries, and welcomes the additional funding given to VisitScotland to help achieve this.
