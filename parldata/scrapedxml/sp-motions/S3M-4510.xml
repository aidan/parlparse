*S3M-4510 Ian McKee: Genius Bread—That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh’s Lucinda Bruce-Gardyne, the creator of Genius, the first ever fresh gluten and wheat-free bread available in stores, and United Central Bakeries Ltd of Bathgate for producing it; notes that the product has won several innovation awards, including Best Free From Award 2009; further notes that, according to medical research, one in 100 people has coeliac disease and an even greater number of people experience some degree of wheat or gluten intolerance; understands that Genius is an alternative to traditional wheat bread that is high in fibre and low in carbohydrates, protein and sugars in comparison to traditional breads; considers that this product will allow people who lead gluten-free lifestyles, either for medical reasons or dietary choices, the possibility to introduce fresh bread into their diets, and hopes that the product will soon become available in all supermarkets and local shops across Scotland.
