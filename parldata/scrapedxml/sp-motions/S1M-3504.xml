*S1M-3504# Bill Butler: Provision of Dedicated Mother and Baby Services for Women with Post-Natal Depression-That the Parliament expresses its deep concern regarding the lack of proper facilities within the NHS in Scotland that would allow women with post-natal depression (PND) to continue to care for their children whilst undergoing treatment; recognises that the lack of dedicated mother and baby services for women with PND is completely unacceptable; notes the recent Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network report which detailed the shocking lack of appropriate services for women with PND, and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure that NHS boards throughout Scotland take the swiftest possible action to remedy the alarming poverty of provision of mother and baby units devoted to women suffering from PND.
