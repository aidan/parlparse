 *S3M-1397.1 Sandra White: The Annexe Healthy Living Centre, Partick, Glasgow—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1397) in the name of Pauline McNeill, leave out from "expresses" to end and insert "welcomes the announcement by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to provide a £2.5 million funding package for healthy living centres, which will stop the threat of closures and redundancies in Glasgow and throughout Scotland; further welcomes the ringing endorsement by the Healthy Living Centre Alliance which thanked the Scottish Government and stated that funding "will provide time for local partners including the NHS and local authorities to come together with us and the Scottish Government to ensure that the HLCs are integral to local and national health improvement for the foreseeable future" and that it "looks forward to working with the administration and HLC local partners to improve the health of Scotland’s disadvantaged communities.", and believes that the alarmist tone of the motion, S3M-1397, is misguided at best and political opportunism in the extreme, causing undue stress and uncertainty to the excellent staff and grateful users of these services."
