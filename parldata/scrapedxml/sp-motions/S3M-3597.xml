*S3M-3597 Margaret Mitchell: Drivers’ Awareness Evening—That the Parliament congratulates Strathclyde Police and the Wishaw Crime Prevention Panel on their recent drivers’ awareness evening held at a local garage and designed to be particularly useful to female drivers; recognises that the evening’s presentation was designed to increase awareness of potentially dangerous situations, focusing on areas such as planning a journey, road rage and safe parking as well as practical car checks including tyre pressure and treads, lights, oil and engine fluids and changing tyres; notes that the feedback from the evening has been very positive, and welcomes the fact that another event has been planned for later in March.
