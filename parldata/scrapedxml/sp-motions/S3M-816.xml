*S3M-816 Hugh O’Donnell: Barnardo’s and MPS Training—That the Parliament welcomes the partnership work in the youth education and training field being done by Barnardo’s Scotland and social enterprise group, MPS Training, which uses innovative approaches and vocational skills training within the framework of mainstream education to re-engage young people for whom the traditional model of school education has not been suitable and who are at risk of not having the necessary skills to enter the workforce, and believes that the model used by Barnardo’s Scotland and MPS Training at its centres in Johnstone and Clydebank is one that merits consideration by the Scottish Government and more local authorities as a more widely used option for some school pupils.
