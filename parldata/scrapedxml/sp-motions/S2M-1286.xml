*S2M-1286# Ms Sandra White: Eviction of Asylum Seekers-That the Parliament condemns the recent evictions of failed asylum seekers in Glasgow and notes with concern the comments of David Gormley of the city's asylum seekers' support team that "the only way the council can assist people evicted at the Home Office's request is if they have children or are in need of community care. We have no funding and have made no provision for the housing of people evicted by the Home Office"; further notes that Glasgow Campaign to Welcome Refugees estimates that there are around 170 destitute refugees in Scotland and that this number looks set to rise considerably in response to the current number of evictions, and believes that the Scottish Executive has a duty to contact the Home Office, urging it to rethink its policy of leaving failed asylum seekers destitute.
