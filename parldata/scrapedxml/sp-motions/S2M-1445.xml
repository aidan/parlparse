*S2M-1445 Mark Ballard: Fair Play at the Olympics-That the Parliament recognises that the Olympic Games is supposed to be a showcase for fairness and human achievement but that the exploitation and abuse of workers' rights endemic in the sportswear industry is violating that Olympic spirit; notes that a recent report by Play Fair has found that employees of international corporate sportswear companies are working long hours for low wages in arduous conditions, often without the most basic employment protection; commends the work of the Play Fair at the Olympics campaign, which is attempting to persuade sportswear companies and the International Olympic Committee to take their responsibilities seriously and challenge the abusive business practices of its sponsors and licensees, and believes that the Scottish Executive should pledge its support for this campaign and help place pressure upon the Olympic movement to become part of the solution to end such labour abuses.
