 *S1M-3564 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Congratulations to Titanic Historian-That the Parliament congratulates the German historian Susanne Stormer on her superb scholarship in respect of the Titanic disaster and her efforts to tell the truth about the heroic actions of First Officer William McMaster Murdoch of Dalbeattie; records the gratitude of the people of Dalbeattie; supports Ms Stormer in her continuing fight against a wrongful portrayal of Mr Murdoch in James Cameron's film, Titanic, a portrayal that 20th Century Fox eventually admitted was untrue; congratulates Ms Stormer on her latest scholarly book William McMaster Murdoch - a Career at Sea which shows that, but for Mr Murdoch's calmness and courage, even greater loss of life could have occurred on the Titanic, and notes that the sailor from Dalbeattie stayed to the end, going down with the Titanic after giving up his life jacket to another.
