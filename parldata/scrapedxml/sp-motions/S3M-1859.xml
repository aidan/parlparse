*S3M-1859 Elaine Smith: National Breastfeeding Awareness Week—That the Parliament welcomes National Breastfeeding Awareness Week which takes place from 11 to 17 May 2008; acknowledges the importance of the week in raising awareness of, and support for, breastfeeding; further acknowledges the extent of the challenges faced in Scotland in facilitating a cultural shift in favour of breastfeeding and securing improvements in rates of uptake and duration; notes the findings of recent research in Belarus which suggests that breastfed babies tend to have higher IQ; further notes with interest the views of health visiting experts in Leeds which indicate that a woman’s choice to start and sustain breastfeeding is highly influenced by the support of her partner; considers that more work must be done at a national level to promote support for breastfeeding among men and to challenge negative attitudes where required; believes that more general information and assistance is required to promote breastfeeding as an important public health priority, and calls on the Scottish Executive to promote material aimed specifically at men to act as a mechanism for discussion to ensure that men are made aware of the advantages of breastfeeding and encouraged to offer support to partners.
