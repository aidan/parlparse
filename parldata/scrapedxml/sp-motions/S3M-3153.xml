*S3M-3153 Bill Kidd: The Late Sir Bernard Crickâ€”That the Parliament notes with sadness the passing away of Sir Bernard Crick, who devoted his life to political and constitutional philosophy, championing the political system as the only tested alternative to government by coercion, and contributed to the understanding of citizenship and published influential works, including George Orwell: A Life, and notes that Sir Bernard was interested in the notion of positive citizenship throughout the world, including in his adopted homeland of Scotland, that he will be sadly missed by all who knew him and by democrats everywhere and that the legacy of his works will live on.
