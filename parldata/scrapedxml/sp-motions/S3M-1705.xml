*S3M-1705♦ Alasdair Allan: Fuel Costs—That the Parliament notes that the price of diesel is now over £1.30 in the Western Isles and across Scotland’s island and remote communities, making it probably the most expensive diesel in the western world; further notes that fuel costs now represent an ever increasing burden in the Western and Northern Isles, not least for businesses and fishermen, some of whom report 80% increases in diesel costs in the last two years; notes that the main company delivering fuel to the islands deposits fuel at differing costs at different ports on the West Coast despite the fact that the same vessel is used; notes the irony of an oil-producing nation putting its motorists, businesses, fishermen and rural businesses in this impossible position, and finally notes the various measures that exist in parts of France, which makes cuts in fuel duty in the remotest areas.
