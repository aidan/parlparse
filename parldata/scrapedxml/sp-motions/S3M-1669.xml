 *S3M-1669♦ Bill Wilson: Commemorative Stamps for 200th Anniversary of Scots Language Dictionary and Funding for Complete Modern Scots Dictionary—That the Parliament notes that 2008 is the 200th anniversary of John Jamieson’s extensively researched An Etymological Dictionary of the Scottish Language, a book dedicated to the Baron of Renfrew, known also as the Prince of Wales, which included words from Renfrewshire and elsewhere in Scotland; notes that this dictionary set new standards in lexicography and has influenced two centuries of lexicographers, including Sir James Murray, the founding father of the Oxford English Dictionary, and those presently working for the Scots language dictionaries organisation; regrets, however, that two centuries after the publication of An Etymological Dictionary there is still no complete modern dictionary of the Scots language which includes words Scots shares with the related language, English; notes that this anomaly prevents the production of an effective spell-checker for Scots and makes automated translation impossible; believes that the existence of such a complete dictionary would raise the status of the Scots language and help prevent possible discrimination against the language and its speakers in the west of Scotland and elsewhere, and would welcome investigation of the feasibility of both providing adequate funds for the production of such a dictionary and the issuing of stamps to commemorate John Jamieson’s remarkable achievement.
