 *S1M-1716# Christine Grahame: Edinburgh Zoo—That the Parliament notes that the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland, founded in 1909, is the custodian of the Scottish National Zoological Collection which is managed and exhibited at Edinburgh Zoo and the Highland Wildlife Park; further notes that both sites closed to the public on 26 February 2001 as a precautionary measure against foot and mouth disease, and that, as a consequence of this responsible action, the society now faces a substantial revenue loss; recognises the international status of Edinburgh Zoo, which contains 36.2% of endangered species, forming part of a major involvement with the survival and recovery programmes of international endangered species, and which has active conservation and research programmes for behaviour and nutrition and also provides benign research to many universities and other higher learning institutes in Scotland and beyond; believes that the Zoo is a major educational resource for primary and secondary schools throughout Scotland, notes that it is in the top three paying visitor attractions in Scotland yet receives no core funding from the public sector, is currently not eligible for national lottery funding and is virtually self-supporting, principally from charitable sources and trading activities such as gate income, catering and retail at the Zoo, and therefore invites the Scottish Executive, as a matter of urgency, to consider financial support for this most valuable national asset until it may re-open to the public. R Supported by: Dorothy-Grace Elder*, Mr Kenneth Gibson*, Dr Winnie Ewing*
