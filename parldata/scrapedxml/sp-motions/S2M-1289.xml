*S2M-1289 Patrick Harvie: Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital - Centre for Integrative Care-That the Parliament acknowledges the unique service offered at the in-patient unit of the Centre for Integrative Care at Glasgow Homeopathic Hospital; recognises the value to patients and to the NHS that the "whole person" integrative approach offers; expresses concern at the suggestion that this service will be closed as a result of funding cuts; believes that such a closure would result in the loss of an effective model of care and a consequent long-term increase in other health care costs, and urges the Scottish Executive to promote the availability of homeopathic care within the National Health Service.
