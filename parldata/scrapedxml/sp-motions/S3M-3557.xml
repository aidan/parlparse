*S3M-3557 Cathy Peattie: Keep the Post Public—That the Parliament notes that the Royal Mail Group third-quarter results show revenue of £2.6 billion, up from £2.5 billion last year, with all four businesses in profit, year-to-date profit of £255 million compared to £162 million for the whole of 2007-08 and full-year profits expected nearly to double; considers that profits would be higher were it not for the uncompetitive conditions under which the Royal Mail delivers mail for rival companies; notes opposition from businesses and the public towards privatisation, with opinion polls showing public support for privatisation as low as 3%; notes the importance of the universal service obligation to the social and economic wellbeing of Scotland; endorses the call for a new relationship between management and postal unions and welcomes the commitment of the Communication Workers Union to negotiate an agreement that would support the modernisation of the industry; observes that in 2007 the UK Government agreed to a £1.2 billion loan facility on commercial terms to modernise Royal Mail operations but that two years later only half of this money has been spent; welcomes the recommendations in the Hooper Report that the UK Government should take responsibility for the pensions deficit that followed an extended contributions holiday; recognises that the global financial situation has exacerbated the pension fund problems, but believes that, if these can be addressed to facilitate partial privatisation, then they can be addressed to facilitate keeping the otherwise profitable Royal Mail publicly owned, and further believes that the best way to protect the universal service obligation, including six days a week delivery, is to keep the post public.
