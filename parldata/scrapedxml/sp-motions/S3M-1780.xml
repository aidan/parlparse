*S3M-1780 Sandra White: Child Fighting v Child Abuse—That the Parliament condemns in the strongest possible terms the practice of child Thai boxing which sees children as young as four forced to battle one another in the ring in front of large adult audiences; believes that this barbaric practice, which has no age limit, no protective headgear despite repeated kicks and punches to the face, no rules or regulations and requires parents to sign disclaimers before each fight absolving promoters of any responsibility should their children be injured or worse, should be banned; notes that these children are being groomed to take part in cage brawls which see nine and 10- year-olds fighting inside a 23ft metal cage in front of a 1,000 strong crowd; expresses profound sadness that these contests are seen by the watching audiences as a form of entertainment; believes that these fight clubs should be investigated as a matter of urgency to determine whether they are a form of abuse, and further believes that these practices should be made illegal. Supported by: Alasdair Allan*, Bashir Ahmad*, Charlie Gordon*, Stuart McMillan*, Rob Gibson*, Bill Wilson*, Mike Pringle*, Bill Kidd*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Jim Tolson*, Christina McKelvie*, John Wilson*
