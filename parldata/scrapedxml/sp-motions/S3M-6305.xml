*S3M-6305 Kenneth Gibson: Rise in Anti-Semitismâ€”That the Parliament expresses concern at the rising trend of anti-Semitic activity throughout 2009; acknowledges that the number of anti-Semitic incidents including extreme violence, assaults, damage and desecration of property, threats, abusive behaviour, including verbal abuse, and the disbursement of anti-Semitic literature almost doubled in the United Kingdom; recognises that a majority of the incidents were arbitrary and opportunistic in nature and notes that the number of politically motivated anti-Semitic incidents is also on the rise; believes that there is never an excuse for any type of hate crime, nor should they be accepted or tolerated, and considers anti-Semitic incidents to be counterproductive as a method of achieving political aims and not conducive to an overall peace solution in the Middle East.
