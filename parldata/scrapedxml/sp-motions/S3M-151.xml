 *S3M-151# Sandra White: Action Plan for Glasgow Required—That the Parliament notes the Federation of Small Businesses Scotland’s FSB Index of Success 2007 which shows that Glasgow has the poorest rating for education, health, employment and inequality of all the 32 local authority areas in Scotland; agrees with the policy recommendations of the report highlighting the need for cross-party support at national and local level in order to take forward crucial policies and address the serious problems facing Glasgow; acknowledges that many initiatives and organisations have been set up to tackle these problems, but believes that, as the report illustrates, many of these have failed to achieve their intended aims and as a result new ideas and approaches must be put forward as a matter of urgency.
