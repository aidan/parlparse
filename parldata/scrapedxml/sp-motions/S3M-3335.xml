*S3M-3335 John Scott: Enhancements to the A77 - Provision of a Bypass for Maybole—That the Parliament notes that proposals for a bypass for Maybole in South Ayrshire were considered as part of the Scottish Government’s Strategic Transport Projects Review and that at page A132 of Strategic Transport Projects Review Report 3: Generation, Sifting and Appraisal of Interventions it is considered that the provision of a bypass for Maybole would "reduce the conflict between long distance and local traffic with a focus on identified key constraint points"; further notes that, despite this assessment, a bypass for Maybole has not been included on the list of identified projects to be taken forward under the Strategic Transport Projects Review; considers that an enormous amount of preparation work has been undertaken over many years in anticipation of approval of a bypass for Maybole, including the publication of full technical reports and a costed preferred route; considers that the construction of such a bypass would bring significant benefits to the economy of South Ayrshire as a whole, and believes that a bypass for Maybole must be included as part of the proposed enhancement of the A77 south of Ayr referred to in Strategic Transport Projects Review Report 4: Summary Report.
