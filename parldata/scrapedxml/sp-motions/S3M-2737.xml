*S3M-2737 Marlyn Glen: A Budget for Peace not War—That the Parliament congratulates Scotland’s for Peace for organising the People’s Budget for Peace gathering on Saturday 25 October 2008 in George Square, Glasgow; notes that supporters of the gathering include Scottish CND, UNISON Scotland, STUC, Oxfam, Campaign Against Arms Trade and the Scottish Islamic Foundation; considers that the UK Government’s plan to renew and replace Trident would have an impact on matters devolved to the Parliament for the next 50 years; expresses concern that the UK Government is spending £2 billion a year on Trident, almost twice as much as five years ago, and at least another £2 billion a year on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; suggests that Scotland’s share of that money would be £340 million a year; acknowledges that most Scots think that this money should be spent instead on tackling poverty and climate change; believes that a convincing case can be made, in military, economic and political terms, for the non-renewal of Trident; is concerned that that the money for Trident will be paid for by cuts in other UK Government budgets, including public services, and calls on the majority of Scottish MPs of all parties who voted against Trident renewal on 14 March 2007 to encourage the UK Government to spend this money on public services and tackling global climate change and world poverty.
