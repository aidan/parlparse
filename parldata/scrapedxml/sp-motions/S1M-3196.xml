 *S1M-3196 Brian Fitzpatrick: Links Between Scotland and Southern Africaâ€”That the Parliament notes the anniversary of the uprising of South African schoolchildren and students in Soweto and across South Africa on 16 June 1976; recognises the historic roles played by young people, trade unionists, political activists, church folk and internationalists in the struggle for the defeat of apartheid and its supporters and for the establishment of a non-racial, democratic South Africa; resolves to send its warmest greetings to the Government and people of South Africa around this historic day; further recognises that the final victory against the apartheid system came on the heels of sacrifice, commitment and travail by men and women, young and old, Governments, organisations and institutions of various kinds resolved to uproot the evil system of apartheid and that their shared efforts bore fruit on 27 April 1994, when South Africa attained democratic rule under Nelson Mandela; recognises that the new leadership, resurgent economies and greater democracy at the centre of the promotion of the African Renaissance are in the interests not just of African countries and African peoples but also of the whole world; believes that the Scottish Executive and MSPs should ensure that innovative measures and opportunities for the development of mutual support and understanding between the peoples of Scotland and southern Africa are addressed across all Executive departments and across the responsibilities of the committees of the Parliament, and urges renewed effort in order to encourage links between the peoples and organisations of Scotland and southern Africa in areas such as education, health and local government with a view to sharing experience and good practice.
