*S3M-3577♦ Sandra White: Loss of Investigative Journalism—That the Parliament commends the Sunday Mail on setting the benchmark for investigative journalism in Glasgow and, indeed, Scotland and which, through its dedicated and skilled journalists, has bravely led the way in exposing the country’s most powerful criminal gangs; considers that the country’s largest-selling paper is also acknowledged for its investigations into official corruption (political, police and government); believes that the decision to merge the Sunday Mail with its sister title, the Daily Record, will result in savage job cuts, in many criminals and corrupt officials, who might otherwise have been exposed, escaping justice and will signal the death knell for investigative journalism, and deeply regrets the decision by Trinity Mirror to press ahead with these plans.
