*S3M-2143# Stuart McMillan: NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Proposed Changes to Maternity Services—That the Parliament recognises that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde is currently undertaking a consultation on proposed changes to maternity services in Clyde; notes that the consultation is proposing to remove birthing services from the Community Maternity Units (CMUs) at the Inverclyde Royal Hospital in Greenock and the Vale of Leven Hospital in Alexandria and centralise them both at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley; highlights that the CMUs have been in operation since 2003; further highlights that the Independent Scrutiny Panel initiated by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing recommended that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde maintain the CMUs for a further three years alongside a community education programme but this has been rejected by the board; further notes that in its consultation document the board states that it does "...not think there is anything to do to significantly improve this" in terms of promoting the usage of the CMU service, and invites the board to listen to the people of the Clyde area who wish the CMUs to remain open, an outcome which would also have the benefit of reducing the stress and strain on the staff at the Royal Alexandra Hospital. Supported by: Alasdair Allan*, Bob Doris*, Alex Neil*, Kenneth Gibson*, Bill Wilson*, Christina McKelvie*
