 *S3M-607.4 Patrick Harvie: The Scottish National Party’s Broken Promises—As an amendment to motion (S3M-607) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from "recognises" to end and insert "further notes that the previous administration had its own failures, as will every government; recognises, however, the widespread disillusionment with confrontational and negative politics; recognises that in a parliament of minorities, and especially under a minority government, no single party can expect to implement its full manifesto without consultation or compromise; accepts that the current administration cannot claim a mandate to implement every manifesto commitment and that no political party that has served in coalition government was able to do so either; notes the words of Donald Dewar MSP, on being elected as Scotland’s first First Minister, that "Co-operation is always possible where there are common aims and values, even though there may be great and dividing differences in other areas"; further notes the words of Annabel Goldie MSP that Scotland "wants posturing and petty playground antics to be left at the door", those of the First Minister that "our overwhelming responsibility is to work together in the people’s interest" and Nicol Stephen MSP’s commitment to be "constructive and positive", and urges all members to hold the Scottish Government to account but also to work constructively and positively wherever possible for the benefit of the people and the country in the spirit of the founding principles of the Parliament."
