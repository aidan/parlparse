*S3M-2081 Margaret Mitchell: Violence is Preventable Booklet, See Us – Hear Us!—That the Parliament supports the recent launch of the Violence is Preventable (VIP) booklet, See Us – Hear Us!; acknowledges and encourages the work that VIP carries out with young people who have been victims of sexual abuse; welcomes the fact that the booklet is targeted at staff and others working in schools and youth organisations to increase their awareness and understanding of this complex issue and to make disclosure easier by providing, when possible, a safe and unthreatening environment in schools where fears and apprehensions can be discussed before appropriate action is taken; commends the content of the booklet drawn from the research of Sarah Nelson, one of Scotland’s leading writers and campaigners against child sexual abuse (CSA), and recognises the tremendous value of this research in that it catalogues the educational experiences of survivors of CSA from Eighteen And Under in Dundee, Pathway in Edinburgh with input from Barnardo’s Skylight project in Edinburgh and the Nationwide Foundation, and hopes that See Us – Hear Us!, currently available in schools in Dundee and Edinburgh, will also be available in schools in Lanarkshire, Falkirk, Ayrshire and throughout Scotland in an effort to increase the confidence of pupils and staff in dealing with this harrowing issue and in order to make significant progress in attempting to break down "the wall of silence" on the subject, which is the perpetrator’s best friend.
