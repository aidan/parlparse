*S3M-2120.2 Jeremy Purvis: Education Cuts—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2120) in the name of Rhona Brankin, insert at end "welcomes the assessment from the Association of Directors of Education in Scotland that implementation of the SNP policy to cut class sizes to 18 in P1-P3 requires £360 million of capital for additional classrooms and £62 million of recurring revenue funding, and therefore calls on the First Minister to confirm to the Parliament whether his government believes that this is an accurate estimate and why."
