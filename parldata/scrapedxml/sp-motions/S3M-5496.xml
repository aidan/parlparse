*S3M-5496 Brian Adam: Review of Consumer Protection for Holidays—That the Parliament notes with regret the collapse of Flyglobespan, which left thousands of passengers out of pocket due to their flights and holidays not being covered by the ATOL scheme or eligible for a refund under section 75 of the Consumer Credit Act 1974; welcomes the call by the President of the Scottish Passenger Agents’ Association, Brian Potter, for a review of the consumer financial protection system in the United Kingdom, and believes that a new protection scheme is needed that takes into account the move toward online and direct booking of flights and holidays to protect all air passengers and holidaymakers from the potential failure of their travel agent or operator.
