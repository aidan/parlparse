 *S2M-2783 Chris Ballance: Leak of Plutonium and Uranium—That the Parliament notes with concern the leak of some 20 tonnes of uranium and plutonium fuel at the Thorp reprocessing plant at Sellafield, including, reportedly, enough plutonium to make 20 nuclear weapons; notes that the stoppage puts Thorp even further behind its promise to have 7,000 metric tons of spent fuel processed by 31 March 2004; notes that the consequent indefinite closure of the plant will cost the taxpayer over £1 million per day; further notes the statement from the Nuclear Decommissioning Authority that this could delay plans to tackle the problem of nuclear waste, and considers that this latest failure highlights the financial and strategic irresponsibility of Whitehall plans to embark on a new generation of nuclear plant with complete disregard to cost, safety issues, environmental risk or public concerns.
