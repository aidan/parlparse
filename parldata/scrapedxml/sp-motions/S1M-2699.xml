 *S1M-2699 Irene McGugan: Iain Anderson on BBC Scotland—That the Parliament, while respecting the right of BBC Radio Scotland to set its own schedules, notes the station's intention to end this Spring the afternoon programme presented by Iain Anderson; regrets the damage done to the programme over the last year by constant managerial interference in a highly successful formula which mixed classical and Celtic music, now allowing only the blandest of contemporary music to be broadcast in the key afternoon slot; observes in particular the damage that this did to audience numbers and to the total air time given to Scottish music by the main, publicly-funded Scottish broadcaster; is saddened that such a wrong-headed policy was persisted with, despite much opinion to the contrary expressed to the BBC by loyal listeners, and hopes that Iain Anderson’s new programme, to be broadcast on weekday evenings, will be left free of such meddling and allowed to develop the style and content that has made Iain Anderson deservedly popular with a very wide range of listeners.
