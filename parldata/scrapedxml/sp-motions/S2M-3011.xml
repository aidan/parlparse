 *S2M-3011 Alex Johnstone: Congratulations to Arbroath High School—That the Parliament congratulates the four sixth-year pupils from Arbroath High School who won the annual "Shares4Schools" competition; notes that, despite the fact that none of the team had any prior experience of stocks and shares, their result soundly beat many professional market analysts, and furthermore recognises the benefits open to all of a free market, capitalist economy which allows individuals to reap the benefits of their hard work and talents.
