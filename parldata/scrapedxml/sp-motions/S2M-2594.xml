*S2M-2594 Frances Curran: Support for Caledonian MacBrayne Workers—That the Parliament congratulates the Caledonian MacBrayne workers, who are members of the RMT, on their decision to take industrial action to prevent the privatisation of every ferry service in Scotland; condemns the Scottish Executive for its refusal to abide by the vote of the Parliament which rejected the privatisation of Caledonian MacBrayne; views the sell-off of our ferry routes, which are lifelines for remote communities, to multi-national companies whose only interest is to make profit for their share holders as a betrayal of those communities, and calls on MSPs to support the one-day strike by CalMac workers on 23 March 2005.
