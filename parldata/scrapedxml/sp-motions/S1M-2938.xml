*S1M-2938 Jackie Baillie: Naval Defence Review and Faslane and Coulport Naval Dockyards—That the Parliament notes with regret the announcement by Geoff Hoon MP, Secretary of State for Defence, of the outcome of the naval defence review and his failure to give adequate consideration to representations from trade unions and elected parliamentarians; recognises that the trade unions, whose agreement to changes in conditions at the Faslane and Coulport naval dockyards in previous years has been hailed as a model in industrial relations, proposed further in-house efficiencies and proposed "through life" maintenance plans which would team the repair yards with the companies that build Royal Navy ships in long term maintenance deals but would appear now to have been rejected; further notes that in addition to the privatisation of cleaning, catering and maintenance staff, there will be the possibility of redundancies across the UK with a significant proportion of these anticipated at the Faslane and Coulport dockyards; further recognises that this level of job loss will have a critical effect on the local economy as well as a significant negative impact on the individual employees and their families, the majority of which reside in the Dumbarton parliamentary constituency where employment at the dockyards accounts for approximately one quarter of the full-time employment in the area; is concerned that the area already has one of the highest levels of unemployment in Scotland and that the scale of the job loss will be devastating, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to take action to mitigate these job losses by providing significant additional financial support for the re-training and re-skilling of those affected, to work closely with the Ministry of Defence to maximise redeployment and to establish a job creation programme for the area and to consider extending the Clyde Corridor initiative to include all areas from Bowling, through Dumbarton and up to Garelochhead in order to assist in the economic regeneration of the area.
