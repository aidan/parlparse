*S1M-3752 Tavish Scott: Dumping of Salmon-That the Parliament notes with concern the recent decision of the European Commission to allow the EU/Norway agreement on the minimum import price of salmon to lapse and to terminate its investigation of the anti-dumping complaints against salmon farmers in Chile and the Faeroe Islands without imposing any anti-dumping measures; condemns the Commission for making the announcement over the Christmas and New Year holiday period, effectively leaving Scottish salmon farmers less than a week to make a detailed submission in response to its disclosure document; recognises the importance of the salmon farming industry to Scotland, particularly in the Highlands and Islands, and calls on the Scottish Executive to support calls for an extension of the deadline for responses to the Commission's disclosure document and to ensure that the case put to the Commission by the EU Salmon Producers Group is given full and proper consideration. Supported by: Mr Jamie Stone*, John Farquhar Munro*, Robin Harper*
