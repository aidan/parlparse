*S3M-1989 Kenneth Gibson: The Export Credits Guarantee Department—That the Parliament disapproves of the behaviour of the Export Credits Guarantee Department (ECGD), the official export credit agency of the UK Government; considers that the primary purpose of this surreptitious department should be to honourably broaden the UK economy but recognises that it privately banks for the aerospace and oil industry, naively ignoring requirements to facilitate exports; is deeply concerned that the ECGD may be breaking international law, paying little or no regard to known environmental standards; believes that the work of the ECGD illustrates that the UK Government is only paying lip service to issues relating to climate change and environmental pollution as long as it continues to subsidise and endorse an organisation actively working against the government’s own stated policies; sustains calls for transparent and open reporting, effective public participation and alignment with international treaties, all of which have generally been accepted worldwide; considers it to be totally unacceptable that a department such as the ECGD is able to operate almost autonomously from UK ministerial control and questions if this is deliberate; deplores the unsubstantiated rhetoric with which the ECGD cedes responsibility for lowering the cost of carbon emissions, and the inconsequential business principles, which time and again have delivered up the submissive ECGD to foreign political pressure; believes that the UK Government should suspend the ECGD until a full investigation into its working practices and controls has been completed, and welcomes the gradual phase-out of the ECGD’s support for carbon intensive projects.
