*S2M-4477.2 Michael Matheson: Architecture—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4477) in the name of Patricia Ferguson, leave out from "both" to end and insert "our buildings have a critical role to play in maintaining and enhancing the quality of Scotland’s urban and rural communities; notes the progress made to date on the Scottish Executive’s policy on architecture; acknowledges the important role that local authorities have in promoting good architectural design, and believes that future national architectural policy should place greater emphasis on local authorities developing their own local architectural policy."
