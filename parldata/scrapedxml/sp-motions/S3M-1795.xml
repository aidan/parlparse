 *S3M-1795 Bob Doris: The Ben Nevis Beyond Boundaries Challenges—That the Parliament applauds the Ben Nevis: Beyond Boundaries Challenge taking place on 31 May 2008, which is designed to raise £100,000 for both Scope and Capability Scotland; praises the efforts of the Monarch’s of the Ben team from Glasgow and the other nine teams that will take part; notes that the project, led by TV presenter Ken Hames, will involve teams led by wheelchair users attempting to scale Ben Nevis; considers that such an initiative will not only raise much-needed funds but is also a worthy symbol of a barrier-free Scotland for all those with any form of disability, and wishes all 10 teams every success, that the climb is completed safely and that their fundraising targets are met.
