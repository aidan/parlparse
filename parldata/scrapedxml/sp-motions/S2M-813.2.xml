*S2M-813.2 Patrick Harvie: Gender Recognition Bill - UK Legislation-As an amendment to motion (S2M-813) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end " but, in so doing, expresses its concern at the late introduction of the Sewel motion on this issue, taking place two months after the introduction of the Bill to the UK Parliament and leaving only two weeks for this Parliament to agree its principles; believes that this process has offered insufficient time for evidence to be taken by the lead committee, or for a full debate on a committee inquiry, and regrets that the evidence of those who gave evidence to the Equal Opportunities Committee was not used to inform the scrutiny of the Bill."
