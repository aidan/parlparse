*S2M-3412 Mr Andrew Arbuckle: Burmaâ€”That the Parliament condemns the illegal government of Burma in its widespread abuse of human rights; calls on the relevant institutions, including the UN Security Council, to act to stop the terror of the Burmese Government; further condemns the overthrow of the previous democratically elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi, and recognises the brutality inflicted on ethnic groups, the use of forced labour and child soldiers and the huge numbers of refugees created as a result of the actions of this regime.
