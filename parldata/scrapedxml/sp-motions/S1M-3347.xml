*S1M-3347# Bill Butler: Iraq-That the Parliament believes that a war against Iraq would result in an enormous loss of innocent lives and could provoke a wider war in the Middle East; is of the view that public opinion, both at home and abroad, is overwhelmingly against such a war, and believes that the Scottish Executive should make representations to the Prime Minister to urge him to dissociate himself and Her Majesty's Government from military action against Iraq, which is not sanctioned by the United Nations Security Council.
