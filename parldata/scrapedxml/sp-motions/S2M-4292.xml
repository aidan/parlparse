 *S2M-4292 Brian Adam: Maternity Leave for Nursing and Midwifery Students—That the Parliament believes that nursing and midwifery students who become pregnant during their studies should continue to receive their bursary during an agreed period of maternity leave; notes that students in Scotland do not automatically have this right, while those in England do; further notes that this often leads to these students dropping out of their courses and being lost to the profession, and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring the financial support arrangements for nursing and midwifery students taking maternity leave in Scotland into line with those south of the border.
