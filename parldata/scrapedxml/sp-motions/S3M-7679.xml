 *S3M-7679 Jackie Baillie: School Closure Plans Halted—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Argyll and Bute Council to halt the consultation process on the proposed closure of 25 of its primary schools; understands that the Lib Dem/Independent-led administration has agreed to halt the process that was originally started by the previous SNP/Independent-led administration; further understands that substantial flaws have been exposed in the consultation documents that would have led to the proposals being called in by the Scottish Government in any event; praises the hard work and dedication of the pupils, parents, teachers and the Argyll and Scottish Rural Schools Networks in campaigning against these proposals; considers that Argyll and Bute has been left with the worst local authority settlement in Scotland, resulting in severe pressure on its finances, and calls on the Scottish Government to engage in dialogue with the council to mitigate the cuts.
