*S3M-2853.2 Patrick Harvie: Scottish Economyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-2853) in the name of John Swinney, leave out from "supports" to end and insert "recognises the urgent need for a response from government at all levels and the degree of support that exists for an emphasis on public investment as a route to recovery; rejects the idea that the existing and failed models of economic growth through fossil fuel dependence can simply be refloated; believes that for any recovery to be truly sustainable the priority must be given to investment projects that specifically assist the transition to a low-carbon, high-skill economy; understands that such an economy will enable resilient local communities to meet more of their needs from local resources; considers that the current economic situation, for all the difficulties it presents in Scotland, also offers an opportunity to rebalance the global economy around the principles of fair trade and ecological justice through supportive not exploitative relationships with developing countries, and urges the UK Government to take this opportunity to honour promises given at Gleneagles to lift the burden of international debt."
