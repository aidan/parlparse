*S3M-6118 Robert Brown: Crime Reduction in Glasgow—That the Parliament welcomes the success of Glasgow Central and West Division of Strathclyde Police in tackling and reducing crime; congratulates the division on reductions of 21.6% in Group 1 crimes of violence against the five-year average, 75% reduction in murders, 20.6% in serious assaults and 21.6% in robbery and assault with intent to rob; welcomes the finding that cases involving offensive weapons and knives have reduced by 28.4% and 20.2% respectively; considers that these positive findings indicate that proactive policing policies are succeeding in reducing crime figures in the major crime categories and generating confidence among victims to come forward to report crimes; further considers that such positive figures indicate the success of effective policing methods such as stop-and-search and proactive intelligence-gathering methods, and believes that effective policing is far more successful in deterring and reducing crime than populist calls for longer or mandatory prison sentences.
