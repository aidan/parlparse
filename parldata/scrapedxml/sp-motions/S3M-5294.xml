*S3M-5294♦ Johann Lamont: STUC Women, Working to Improve Women’s Lives—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Trades Union Congress Women’s Committee on its recent conference, bringing together women trade unionists from across Scotland to debate the key economic and social issues facing women in the Pollok constituency, across Glasgow and throughout Scotland; acknowledges the important role played by Scottish women trade unionists in campaigning for greater representation of women at every level of government, in public bodies and in the private sector; recognises the importance of addressing the impact of economic recession on women’s lives, and believes that tackling disadvantage and inequality must be high in policy and budget priorities.
