*S3M-7169♦ Helen Eadie: World Arthritis Day, 12 October 2010—That the Parliament notes that World Arthritis Day takes place on 12 October 2010; understands that arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions are a major cause of pain and disability, accounting for 48% of all work-related illness in Scotland; considers that this places a significant burden on both the NHS and society; acknowledges that it is estimated that over one million people consulted a GP or practice nurse in 2008-09 in relation to a musculoskeletal condition and that there were over one hundred thousand NHS hospital stays in Scotland in 2009 for which a musculoskeletal condition is recorded; pays tribute to organisations working to raise awareness of arthritis and other musculoskeletal conditions, such as the Arthritis and Musculoskeletal Alliance, Arthritis Care Scotland, the National Osteoporosis Society in Scotland, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry (ABPI), Scottish Inflammatory Diseases and Rheumatology Industry Group (SIDRIG), the National Rheumatoid Arthritis Society (NRAS) and Psoriasis Scotland Arthritis Link Volunteers; looks forward to the publication of the national musculoskeletal programme and considers that it has the potential to develop a national framework for improving the standards of care for people who live with all forms of arthritis and musculoskeletal conditions; understands that a national lead has been appointed to support this work and a national programme board to ensure implementation; believes that people living with musculoskeletal conditions can usefully input to the national programme board, and would welcome publication of research into the prevalence of musculoskeletal conditions and on improving treatments and their impact on local NHS services.
