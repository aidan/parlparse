*S2M-1503 Roseanna Cunningham: GM Oilseed Rape GT73-That the Parliament welcomes the vote at the EU Regulatory Committee on the release of GM organisms into the environment held on Wednesday 16 June 2004 which blocked approval of the application to import Monsanto's GM oilseed rape (GT73) into Europe; notes that there were 57 votes against approval, 43 votes for and 24 abstentions; recognises that this was the first occasion since expansion in which the enlarged European Union's approach to GM crops has been tested; registers its serious concern that a confidential Monsanto feeding study on rats showed that those fed the GM oilseed rape had a 15 per cent increase in liver weights; further notes that the European Commission must now formally adopt a proposal to be sent to the Council of Ministers, and expresses the hope that the view expressed by the regulatory committee will be upheld.
