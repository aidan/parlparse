*S3M-1339 Margaret Mitchell: Resettlement and Support Initiative, South Lanarkshire—That the Parliament notes and supports the renaming of South Lanarkshire’s Rough Sleepers Initiative as the Resettlement and Support Initiative (RSI) to reflect the changing nature of the service which celebrates its 10th anniversary in March 2008; notes that the RSI is a partnership involving Barnardo’s, YMCA Glasgow, South Lanarkshire Council and the Jubilee Key Scheme; recognises the range of person-centred services offered by the RSI for homeless, roofless and vulnerable individuals by adopting a flexible, holistic approach towards the issues affecting service-user groups, and welcomes the continued success of the RSI in developing a range of innovative services in partnership with service users and others including rent deposit schemes, Nightstop, the Tenancy Support Service and the Rural Outreach scheme in an aim to reduce and prevent rough sleeping.
