 *S2M-4168 Phil Gallie: Taiwan’s Exclusion from the WHO: Avian Flu—That the Parliament expresses regret that Taiwan is currently excluded from the World Health Organisation (WHO) given current concerns over the spread of avian flu; recognises that Taiwan is geographically located in the hot-spot area of avian flu presence and plays host to many species of migratory birds, and urges the Scottish Executive to express a view to relevant bodies that it is essential that the WHO takes regard of the situation in Taiwan whilst, in broader terms, pointing out that, if the WHO is to succeed in co-ordinating and controlling actions in potential global pandemics, there should be no exclusion areas.
