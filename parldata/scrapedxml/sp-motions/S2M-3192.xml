*S2M-3192 Alex Johnstone: Arbroath Abbey Pageant Societyâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the Arbroath Abbey Pageant Society for its successful floodlit re-enactment of the signing of the Declaration of Arbroath in Arbroath Abbey; commends the fact that the cast is made up of local people from all walks of life who give up their spare time to take part in the re-enactment as well as making costumes and props to a professional standard; recognises the ambassadorial role that the society has with the Scottish expatriate community; acknowledges that the society is obliged to raise the substantial sums of money required to fund the production that has marked the anniversary of the Declaration of Arbroath since 1947, and urges the Scottish Executive to ensure that the town of Arbroath is given a more prominent role in future Tartan Day celebrations.
