 *S2M-1347 Fergus Ewing: Impingement Syndrome-That the Parliament believes that those who have impingement syndrome of the shoulder relative to an industrial injury should be entitled to Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit under the Industrial Injuries Disablement Benefit scheme; recommends that the syndrome should be added to the list of prescribed diseases; notes that the matter was referred to the research working group of the Industrial Injuries Advisory Council, but considers that this may result in a further delay before the syndrome is recognised and that, in the interim period, those individuals who suffer from this syndrome will continue to lack the benefits to which they would have been entitled had they incurred another form of bursitis to the knee (Beat Knee) or elbow (Beat Elbow), and believes that the lack of inclusion of bursitis of the shoulder in the list of prescribed diseases is anomalous and unfair and, as a result, those workers who are denied benefit are suffering from a manifest injustice.
