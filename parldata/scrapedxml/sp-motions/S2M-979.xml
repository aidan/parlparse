*S2M-979# Elaine Smith: The Role of the Higher and Further Education Sector in Attracting Fresh Talent-That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Executive on its Fresh Talent initiative and its aims to counter demographic change and reverse population decline in Scotland; recognises the integral role that the higher and further education sector looks set to play in this project and the objectives of nurturing and retaining home grown talent whilst also attracting individuals from abroad; notes concern, however, at the threat posed by the current dispute between the Universities and Colleges Employers Association and the Association of University Teachers (AUT) and the AUT's contention that, academic, related and research staff could face a potential career earnings loss of as much as Â£40,000 under the current pay offer tabled by employers; expresses further concern at the suggested move from national to local bargaining and the inevitable lengthening in timescales that would result from any such move; acknowledges that such academic staff play a vital role in the creation and sustainability of a smart, successful Scotland, and encourages both parties to work towards an adequate and timely resolution.
