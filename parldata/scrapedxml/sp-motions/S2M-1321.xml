 *S2M-1321# Dr Jean Turner: Bearsden Post Office Closures-That the Parliament deplores the announcement by Post Office Ltd of its proposal to close three post offices in the Bearsden area, in addition to the closure of the post office at Killermont; considers that consultation time was not sufficient, given that the Easter holiday break was within the period set for consultation; acknowledges that the most vulnerable people in society will be affected since the majority affected are elderly, few drive and there is a paucity of public transport and guaranteed parking and therefore the suggested alternative post office at Roman Road is not suitable as it would require considerable adaptation to meet the needs of elderly people; deplores the fact that communities surrounding the post offices proposed for closure will be bereft of vital services, and believes that the Scottish Executive should exert pressure on Post Office Ltd to reconsider these closures, which are detrimental to the well-being of an increasingly aging population.
