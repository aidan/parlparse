 *S3M-4088 Jamie Hepburn: Scrap ID Card Scheme in the Face of £500m Cuts in Scottish Public Services—That the Parliament believes that the UK Government’s ID card scheme is an enormous waste of money, especially in the face of cuts of £500 million in Scottish public services that are being imposed by that same government; considers that the £5.75 billion cost of the scheme could be far better spent on frontline public services than on a scheme that poses an unprecedented and unnecessary infringement to the civil liberties of the general public, and believes that the UK Government should take heed of the advice of David Blunkett MP, previously a proponent of ID cards as Home Secretary eight years ago, and scrap the ID card scheme. Supported by: Sandra White*, Bill Wilson*, Brian Adam*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Anne McLaughlin*, Rob Gibson*, Alasdair Allan*, Michael Matheson*, Stuart McMillan*, Ian McKee*, Willie Coffey*, Bob Doris*, Christina McKelvie*, Christine Grahame*
