*S2M-5330 Shona Robison: Discrimination Doesn’t Work—That the Parliament notes the findings of disability charity, Leonard Cheshire, which recently conducted research into discrimination in recruitment in Scotland; further notes that the report shows that many disabled people still face discrimination in the labour market and that employers were twice as likely to discriminate in favour of a non-disabled applicant; agrees with Leonard Cheshire that there needs to be further research conducted into this issue to develop new ways of engaging with employers to find positive and pro-active ways to reverse the findings of this report, and urges all MSPs to raise awareness of the issues raised by Leonard Cheshire among their constituents, especially local employers, to ensure that equality prevails in Scotland’s employment markets.
