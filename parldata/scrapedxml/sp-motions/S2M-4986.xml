*S2M-4986 Rosie Kane: Ann Gloag and the Right to Roam—That the Parliament supports Ramblers Scotland in its court battle against Ann Gloag; believes that no landowner, however wealthy, should place themselves above the law of the land and that right to roam legislation will have little meaning if landowners use their wealth to inflict onerous costs on those wishing to gain access to their land, and believes that, if right to roam access is to be maintained, the Scottish Executive needs to make itself a party to any future appeals that arise from the Gloag case.
