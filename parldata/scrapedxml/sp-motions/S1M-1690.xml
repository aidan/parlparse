*S1M-1690 Pauline McNeill: Partick Music and Community Arts Initiative—That the Parliament notes the work of the Partick Community Association in developing the Partick Music and Community Arts Initiative in order to create community-based cultural industries in music and the arts which embrace both artistic endeavour and therapeutic benefits and the generation of economic development; believes that grassroots arts projects such as this can enhance and enrich the quality of life for local communities and allow access and participation to groups of people who are normally socially excluded from the mainstream cultural industries, and welcomes the development of a play about the Partick Rent Strike of 1915 and the workshops and performances coming from traditional and Gaelic and from West African and Caribbean cultural roots.
