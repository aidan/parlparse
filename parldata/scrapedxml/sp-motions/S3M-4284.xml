 *S3M-4284 Jamie Hepburn: Congratulations to Winners of Amnesty International Scottish Media Awards—That the Parliament congratulates Lucy Adams on winning the Amnesty International Scottish Media Award for the second time in three years; notes that her winning article, The Fight for Justice, was published in The Herald Magazine in September 2008 and looked at the use of rape as a weapon of war in conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, examining its impact on the lives of women and their communities and the coping mechanisms that have been developed; also congratulates the runners-up in the competition from the BBC Scotland Eòrpa Gaelic language programme, Hedda MacLeod, Catriona MacKinnon, Colin MacLeod, Annie Cheape, Iain Macinnes, Darren Laing and Alasdair Fraser, for three short films looking at immigration issues in Europe, and hopes that the award will continue to inspire journalists in Scotland to work for better understanding and awareness of human rights issues in Scotland and around the world.
