 *S1M-3699 Tommy Sheridan: Scrap Scottish Enterprise and Increase Minimum Wage in the Public Sector-That the Parliament notes the research conducted by the Scottish Parliament Research Service, revealing that the cost of imposing a £7.32 per hour minimum wage and a 35-hour maximum working week across the public sector in Scotland would be £450 million per annum and would create an additional 24,000 public sector jobs; further notes that the Scottish Enterprise (SE) budgets for 2003-04, 2004-05 and 2005-06 are £446 million, £453 million and £454 million respectively; believes that SE should be scrapped and its budget used instead to eradicate low pay in Scotland's hospitals and town halls, modernise working conditions and create 24,000 new jobs on a minimum hourly rate of £7.32, as recommended by the Low Pay Unit, and further believes that such a public investment package would end low pay in the public sector, raise hundreds of thousands out of poverty and set good employment practices which the private sector would be compelled to match and that, instead of talking about tackling poverty, the Scottish Executive should act.
