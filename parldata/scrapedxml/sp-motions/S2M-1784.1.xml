 *S2M-1784.1 Carolyn Leckie: Centralisation of Health Servicesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-1784) in the name of Mr David Davidson, leave out from "is opposed" to end and insert "notes the succession of profound concerns expressed in debates and motions on the NHS; further notes that these concerns are so serious that calls for a moratorium on NHS closures and centralisations have been made for over a year; notes that communities remain at odds with NHS boards and the Scottish Executive over the future of the NHS, that NHS boards implement Executive policy and budgets, notably the expensive PFI/PPP model of funding for capital projects and have no control of pharmaceutical profits, which represent a massive strain on their budgets, that the application of the working time regulations has neither been planned properly nor budgeted for, that new contracts for medical staff at all levels have not been fully funded and that numbers of graduates in all health professions have been, and are, consistently insufficient to meet the needs of patients or a 21st century NHS; believes that NHS boards should be democratically accountable for their responsibilities but that it is the Executive that sets the structural, strategic, financial and political context that they operate in and regrets the failure of the Executive to acknowledge that responsibility in relation to NHS re-organisation or engage in a debate with the public; further believes that the threat of closure of so many important facilities is entrenching the disengagement between communities and government; believes, therefore, that all reorganisation plans in the NHS should be revisited in a national context so that a wide-ranging and meaningful debate about the security and future of the NHS can take place in Scotland, involving all trade unions and professional organisations who represent NHS workers, community organisations, voluntary organisations, the public at large and academics whilst ensuring that resources and strategies are put in place to protect local services until such a debate has taken place and a national strategy is developed that has the confidence of the Scottish people, and sends its support and solidarity to all campaigners attending the demonstration called by the Scottish Health Campaigns Network in Glasgow this Saturday."
