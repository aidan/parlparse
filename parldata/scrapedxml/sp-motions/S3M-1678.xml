 *S3M-1678 Rob Gibson: DSA Motorcycle Centres—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision by the Driving Standards Agency (DSA) to close 51 motorcycle test centres in Scotland; considers that these closures will result in increased travel time, expense and complications to those wishing to pass their motorcycle tests; notes that the closure of the Moray motorcycle test centre in Elgin results in test-sitters enduring a four-hour round trip to their nearest test centre coupled with a one-hour test, as well as increased costs estimated at over £250; considers that the dangers of fatigue are greatly enhanced and calls on the DSA to reconsider closing test centres, such as Elgin’s, which would result in people’s safety being put in danger, and finally considers that the DSA should be promoting motorcycling as a greener mode of transport and should make it easier to take the test, not more difficult.
