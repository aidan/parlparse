*S3M-1605 Robin Harper: GM Crops—That the Parliament welcomes the proposals by the Welsh Assembly Government to make producers of genetically modified (GM) crops fully liable for any damage that these crops cause; believes that this policy will in effect amount to a complete ban on the planting of GM crops because of the significant scientific uncertainty about the associated risks; notes the support that this move has received from the Farmers Union of Wales as well as from RSPB and other environmental organisations; further notes the decision by Scottish Ministers to continue with a moratorium on the planting of GM crops, and calls on Scottish Ministers to go further and adopt the same type of full liability approach proposed in Wales.
