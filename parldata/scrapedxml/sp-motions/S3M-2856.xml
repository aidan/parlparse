*S3M-2856 Michael Matheson: Good Luck Bankier Primary—That the Parliament wishes Bankier Primary School in Banknock the best of luck as it competes in the final of STV’s People’s Millions competition; notes that its entry, an Eco Attack project, will transform part of the grounds of the school into a multi-use area for the local community, which will include work on a garden, installing a climbing wall, building shelters and providing benches made from plastic bottles, and hopes that it is successful on 27 November 2008 in making this project a reality.
