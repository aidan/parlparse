 *S3M-7104 Dave Thompson: Scotland’s Level Crossings Need Barriers Now—That the Parliament acknowledges the report from the Rail Accident Investigation Branch into the fatal accident in Halkirk in September 2009; notes that the report highlights the failure of Network Rail to learn safety lessons from four previous accidents at the crossing and that the company should have taken these previous accidents into account in its consideration of the installation of barriers; further notes that investigators found that safety measures that were identified during previous inspections had not been implemented by Network Rail at the time of the accident; urges Network Rail to upgrade the level crossing at Halkirk immediately and install barriers; further calls on Network Rail to seriously consider the upgrading of all 22 other open level crossings in Scotland and to produce a timetable for this and the installation of barriers; calls on the Scottish Government to assist Network Rail in the funding of these vital safety measures; considers that barriers can give the highest level of guarantee of public safety at level crossings, and further considers that the safety of level crossings across Scotland is of paramount importance to the safety of motorists, train drivers and their passengers alike.
