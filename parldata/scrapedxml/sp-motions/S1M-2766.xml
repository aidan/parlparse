 *S1M-2766 Bruce Crawford: National Park Funding—That the Parliament recognises the very real concerns of the Association of Community Councils of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs regarding under-funding of Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park and calls on the Scottish Executive to reconsider the amount of finance being made available to ensure that the National Park is provided with a sustainable level of resources, bearing in mind the amount recommended by Scottish Natural Heritage of £5.6 million.
