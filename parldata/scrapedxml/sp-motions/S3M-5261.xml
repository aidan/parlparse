*S3M-5261 Robin Harper: Pilot Local Records of Deaf Children—That the Parliament commends the announcement by the Minister for Public Health and Sport on 17 November 2009 that the Scottish Government is piloting the creation of local records of deaf children, from which national data can be extracted, in two pathfinder sites in NHS Lothian and NHS Tayside; considers that this is a significant step forward in establishing the true number of deaf children living in Scotland today, as highlighted by the National Deaf Children’s Society (NDCS) Scotland’s Pick a Number campaign, launched at the Scottish Parliament in September 2008; is encouraged by the minister’s longer-term aspiration for the pilot project, that it will result in the sharing of information between the agencies involved in supporting hearing-impaired children and those planning support services for them; believes that accurate local records also have the potential to assist local and national government to monitor the outcomes for deaf children and be sure that they are collectively getting it right for every deaf child; notes with pride that Scotland is now on course to be the first UK country to collect accurate data on the number of children with permanent confirmed hearing loss; commends NDCS Scotland for bringing this matter to the Parliament, and wishes all involved in the pilot process every success in developing this vital information tool to support multi-agency professionals in planning a world without barriers for every deaf child in Scotland.
