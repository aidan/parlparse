 *S1M-2207.1 Shona Robison: Improving Patient Care-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2207) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes that, as a result of successive government policies, Scotland has become the PFI capital of Europe and that PFI is the most expensive method of financing hospital building; further notes that the privatisation of domestic services in hospitals presided over by the last Conservative government has resulted in a deterioration of standards of cleanliness in hospitals and record levels of hospital-acquired infections; believes that further private involvement in the delivery of health services is not in the interests of patients, and is committed to rebuilding a public health service in Scotland that is capable of delivering the highest quality of care for all our citizens."
