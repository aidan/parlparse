*S3M-1860 Mary Mulligan: Getting it Right for Every Deaf Child—That the Parliament celebrates Deaf Awareness Week from 5 to 11 May 2008; shares the vision of the National Deaf Children’s Society (NDCS) of a world without barriers for every deaf child; acknowledges that the NDCS estimates that there are almost 3,000 deaf children in Scotland today; agrees that the family is the most important influence on a deaf child’s development in the early years; acknowledges, however, that 90% of deaf children are born to hearing parents with little or no previous experience of deafness; is aware that Universal Newborn Hearing Screening, introduced in Scotland in 2005, means that more deaf children are being identified earlier; agrees that this should be an opportunity for parents to access co-ordinated support from professionals to help them to unlock their deaf child’s potential from the moment of diagnosis; recognises the crucial role that qualified professionals working within the health, education, social care and voluntary sector play in providing support to parents in providing emotional support and developing language and communication skills with their child in the early years; is aware of the fact that in 2003 the Department for Education and Skills published detailed guidance, Developing Early Intervention/Support Services for Deaf Children and their Families, for professionals working with deaf children and their families in the early years setting in England; is concerned that there is currently no such national guidance for professionals working with deaf children and their families in Scotland, meaning that services vary throughout the country, and therefore endorses NDCS’s call for the Scottish Government’s forthcoming early years strategy to acknowledge and consider the specific support needs of deaf children and their families in the early years and commit to producing detailed guidance for professionals working with deaf children and their families in the early years setting.
