*S2M-2262# Mike Pringle: Ban on Sale of Arms to China—That the Parliament condemns any move to lift the 15-year embargo on the sale of arms to China; urges the European Union to resist any move by the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, and French President, Jacques Chirac, to have the embargo lifted; hopes that other European states will oppose efforts by France, Germany or Britain to restore arms sales; believes that China’s human rights record is comparable to Burma and Zimbabwe’s record, and further believes that this move, if successful, could lead to greater instability in the region.
