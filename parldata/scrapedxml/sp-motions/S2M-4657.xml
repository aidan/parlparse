 *S2M-4657 Ms Sandra White: Failure of the Scottish Executive to Address Youth Crime—That the Parliament notes with concern the continuing failure of the Scottish Executive to address effectively the rising levels of youth crime in Scotland; notes with dismay the increase in the number of Scotland-wide referrals to the Children’s Reporter by 11% and of persistent offenders by 16%, whereas the stated aim of the Executive was a reduction of 10%; questions the efficacy of the Minister for Justice’s strategy for tackling the problem of youth crime in Scotland’s largest city, Glasgow, where the number of persistent offenders rose from 210 to 252 which represents an astonishing 55% off the reduction target, and considers that a permanent youth court in Glasgow should be established to address this worrying trend as a matter of urgency.
