 * S2M-2328 Christine May:Fife Constabulary - Use of Antisocial Behaviour Powers—That the Parliament welcomes the success of Fife Constabulary in obtaining a closure order on a flat in Leven under the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004; notes that the new powers introduced under this legislation made it possible for such an order to be granted; congratulates Fife Constabulary and Fife Council for this innovative use of the new powers; agrees with Mr Richard Martin of Leven who noted that it was regrettable that an Act of the Scottish Parliament was needed to deal with the antisocial behaviour to which he and his neighbours had been subjected for a lengthy period of time but nevertheless welcomes this addition to the legal framework in Scotland; regrets the opposition which was shown to the Bill in its passage through the Parliament by those who argued that such powers would not be needed and would prove ineffective; congratulates ministers and the Parliament for their courage in passing the legislation, and urges all involved in dealing with antisocial behaviour to study the actions of Fife Constabulary to see if similar solutions can be used across Scotland.
