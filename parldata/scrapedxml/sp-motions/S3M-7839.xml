 *S3M-7839 Kenneth Gibson: Financial Threat to Scotland—That the Parliament is appalled by those Westminster MPs who want to slash the Scottish block grant; is of the view that some MPs see the Scotland Bill as an opportunity to cut Scottish expenditure and public services; opposes such opportunism and considers that the Scotland Bill is broken and a tax trap that needs to be fixed; considers that the Bill, in its present form, will merely deliver budget cuts in disguise and that full fiscal autonomy for Scotland is the minimum that Parliament should demand, and believes that Scotland will only be respected in London as an equal partner when it is once again an independent sovereign state.
