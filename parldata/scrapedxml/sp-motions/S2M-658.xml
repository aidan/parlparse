 *S2M-658# Mark Ballard: Impact of Globalisation on Jobs in the Scottish Finance Sector-That the Parliament is concerned that Lloyds TSB/Scottish Widows is considering plans to transfer some of its operations to India, with the potential loss of many hundreds of Edinburgh-based jobs; notes that moves to replace Scottish workers with significantly lower-paid labour abroad could put pressure on other finance companies to follow suit, with serious consequences for jobs and the economy, and believes that the Scottish Executive should seek a commitment from Lloyds TSB/Scottish Widows that it will cease developing plans to transfer work abroad.
