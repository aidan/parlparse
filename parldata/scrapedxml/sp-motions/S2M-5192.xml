*S2M-5192&lt;&gt; Ms Sandra White: Time for Real Debate—That the Parliament notes with concern that, while Scottish Power has increased profits by a staggering 77% to £483 million, customers have seen bills rise by an incredible 95% for gas and 50% for electricity over the last three years, leading to a dramatic increase in the number of people living in fuel-poor homes and adding further misery and hardship to many deprived areas, especially in Glasgow; contrasts this with Scottish Water’s recent accolade from the Water Industry Commission for Scotland whose cost and performance report states "Determined management is generating real benefits for customers. At the same time as it has lowered costs, it has improved service and achieved better quality and environmental standards", and believes that there should be a mature, modern and considered debate, without the usual dogmatic arguments, on the whole issue of private and state ownership.
