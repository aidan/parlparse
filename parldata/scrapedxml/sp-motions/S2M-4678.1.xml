 *S2M-4678.1 Patrick Harvie: Gay Police Association Advertisementâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-4678) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from "the use of" to end and insert "prejudice and discrimination, including that based on homophobia or religious intolerance; congratulates Scottish police forces for making significant progress in recent years to tackle prejudice within their own ranks and to improve public protection from hate crime; congratulates the Gay Police Association (GPA) in Scotland for its contribution to this progress and for raising public debate on the issue through its advertisement in the 29 June 2006 issue of The Independent newspaper; agrees with the GPA that religion can never be an excuse for homophobic hate crime and condemns those who attempt to use it as such; considers that the timing of the advert was particularly appropriate given that on the same day the Scottish Executive announced its rejection of the headline recommendation from its own working group on hate crime, and urges the Executive to reconsider this decision and ensure that victims of homophobic crimes in Scotland have the same legal protection as religious communities already enjoy."
