 *S2M-1940.1 Mary Scanlon: A Better Deal for Pensioners—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1940) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from "believes" to end and insert "condemns the Chancellor’s promotion of the means test which acts as a major disincentive to save; believes that linking the basic state pension to earnings would lift a million pensioners out of means-testing over a four year period; calls for greater measures to encourage personal savings, and acknowledges that only a Conservative administration at Westminster can implement these changes for the benefit of all Scotland’s pensioners."
