*S2M-4987 Dr Elaine Murray: A Manifesto for Life Sciences in Scotland—That the Parliament notes the recent document produced by the BioIndustry Association Scotland, entitled Manifesto for Life Sciences in Scotland, which sets out key recommendations for all Scotland’s political parties to follow in order to create a healthier and more prosperous Scotland; recognises that the life sciences sector is a success for Scotland, with 592 companies and institutions employing over 20,700 people and contributing over £800 million per annum to the Scottish economy; appreciates that the sector is highly competitive and that the right conditions are important for the sector to grow and for such important jobs to stay here, and considers that the Scottish Executive should support this manifesto in order to continue the success of life sciences as part of a thriving Scottish economy and to realise the human healthcare benefits that life sciences promise.
