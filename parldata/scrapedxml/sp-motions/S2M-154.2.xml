*S2M-154.2 Mr David Davidson: Patient Focus and Public Involvement in the NHS—As an amendment to motion (S2M-154) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "regrets that the Scottish Executive’s proposal in Partnership for Care: Scotland’s Health White Paper and A Partnership for a Better Scotland, in an attempt to increase patient focus and public involvement, will only increase bureaucracy in an over-centralised NHS and considers measures such as GP fundholding and foundation hospitals would offer patients real choice regarding their own care, would focus on clinical priorities over political priorities, and would, therefore, start to solve the real problems facing the health service."
