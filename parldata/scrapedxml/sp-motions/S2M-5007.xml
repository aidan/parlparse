*S2M-5007 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Support for Traditional Farming—That the Parliament condemns the replacement of traditional farming methods with intensive farming initiatives with devastating impacts on both the environment and the local community; notes that in many areas in the developing world farming communities have followed low-impact traditional farming practices successfully for many years; further notes that traditional methods, including mixed cropping, provide a nutritionally diverse diet to the local community and greater resilience to pests and local weather conditions; notes with concern, however, that in many countries traditional farming methods are under threat from intensive farming methods with their emphasis on high yields, the use of agri-chemicals, high-yielding hybrids, mechanisation and monocultures, which are detrimental to both the environment and local communities, and calls on the Scottish Executive to do all it can to encourage traditional farming methods, both at home and abroad, and to seek to aid farmers in the developing world in their attempts to resist changes to their faming methods and allow them to keep control of their farming and their communities.
