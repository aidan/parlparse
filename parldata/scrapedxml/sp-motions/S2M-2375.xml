 * S2M-2375 Frances Curran: The Right to Protestâ€”That the Parliament believes that the right to peaceful protest is a fundamental right which underpins our democracy; further believes that there should be absolutely no attempt to use repressive laws to prevent or ban any peaceful demonstrations against George Bush and the G8 leaders when they meet at Gleneagles in July; considers that in a democracy we have the democratic right to challenge the policies and actions of these leaders; hopes that the Scottish Executive has no intention of using any repressive measures to prevent this, and will actively challenge any attempt to deny our civil rights.
