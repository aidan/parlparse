 *S1M-3021.1 Mr Jamie McGrigor: Scotland's Freshwater Fish and Fisheries: Securing their Future-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3021) in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from "endorses" to end and insert "agrees that there should be a commitment to the future conservation and management of salmon and freshwater fish and fisheries in Scotland; further agrees with the general aim of the consultation paper Scotland's Freshwater Fish and Fisheries: Securing their Future, but notes with concern the substantial harm that the Scottish Executive's Land Reform (Scotland) Bill will do to the future of Scotland's freshwater fish and fisheries."
