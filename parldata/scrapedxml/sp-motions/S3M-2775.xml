*S3M-2775 Pauline McNeill: Gael Power - BBC Alba, Publication of First Viewing Figures and Freeview—That the Parliament welcomes publication of the first viewing figures for BBC Alba of over 610,000, which is substantially larger than the audience of 250,000 that the BBC wanted to attract; believes that this is a good indication of the future success of the channel and congratulates BBC Alba for its variety and originality in programming, for example showing the Scotland versus Russia women’s football match; is concerned that BBC Alba is only available to those with subscriptions to Sky, Freesat and Virgin Media, but not on Freeview, the most popular digital system; further believes that the exclusion of BBC Alba from Freeview denies many Gaelic speakers, and those with an interest, a chance to view the channel and also to be included in the viewing figures, and calls on the BBC to address access to Freeview sooner than 2010 and to establish how many viewers are unable to view the channel but would if Freeview was available.
