*S3M-3817 Shirley-Anne Somerville: End the Burden of Housing Date—That the Parliament recognises the urgent need to increase the provision of affordable housing for rent in Scotland; welcomes the Scottish Government’s action to reverse decades of decline in council house building and the record investment of £644 million in its affordable housing programme for 2009-10; regrets that 45 pence in every pound of rent paid by council tenants in Edinburgh currently goes towards servicing the city’s £280 million historic housing debt; considers that resources would have been made available to write off this debt if tenants had not exercised their democratic right to reject stock transfer, and urges the UK Government to take action during this time of economic crisis to enable local authorities to invest in affordable housing by writing off the almost £2 billion of housing debt across the country.
