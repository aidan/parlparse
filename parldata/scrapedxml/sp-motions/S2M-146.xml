*S2M-146 Mr Adam Ingram: Combat Stress—That the Parliament commends the work carried out by the charitable organisation Combat Stress in helping to provide treatment for ex-service personnel suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD); acknowledges that PTSD is a pervasive illness that can affect every aspect of a person’s life, that prevents people from functioning properly, making even activities of daily living difficult, and that interferes with normal relationships, causing disharmony and breakdown of marriages and friendships and often leaving the victim socially isolated and family and friends badly affected as well; notes the comments made in the Parliament by the First Minister and others prior to, and during, the recent war in Iraq about supporting our troops and believes that this support should continue when military personnel return from war zones and once they leave the forces; deplores the fact that Combat Stress is left each year with a large funding gap as it only receives funding from clients who receive more than a 30% war pension despite providing medical help to men and women who are suffering psychological trauma due to their experiences in the forces, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review this situation to ensure that Combat Stress receives proper recompense for the specialist medical services it provides to a specialist group, both those on war pensions and those not, and to investigate the much more comprehensive services provided to ex-service personnel and their families in Australia, America, Canada and the Netherlands to ensure that those who join our armed forces are able to get help and support when they need it after they leave the service.
