 *S2M-416# Carolyn Leckie: Sexual Health Strategy-That the Parliament awaits with interest consultation on the Scottish Executive's Sexual Health Strategy; recognises that a holistic approach across the whole spectrum of sexual health is required and that a raft of measures will be necessary, and is concerned to ensure that the Executive will include in its proposals a commitment to provide free emergency contraception at all current outlets, increase availability across the board and ensure easy access for schoolchildren to professional advice and support and emergency contraception, supported by measures to address the reasons for young people commencing early sexual relationships, given the large numbers of people who report negative experiences.
