*S3M-1828 Sandra White: World Lupus Day—That the Parliament notes that World Lupus Day will take place on 10 May 2008 and that this year the annual Lupus UK conference is being held in Glasgow on 11 May 2008; recognises that around 50,000 people in the United Kingdom and over five million people worldwide, of whom around 90% are female, have lupus and that it is therefore likely that every MSP has a number of constituents who may be affected by this condition; further recognises that, while lupus can be mild, it can also be disabling and sometimes fatal, has no known cure and causes many different symptoms including joint and muscle pain, fatigue, depression and kidney, heart, lung and brain symptoms as well as recurrent miscarriages; acknowledges that there is an urgent need to increase awareness in Scotland, the United Kingdom and worldwide of the debilitating impact of lupus and the difficulty that can arise in gaining a diagnosis, given that it mimics a number of other diseases, and supports Lupus UK and other lupus organisations across the world in calling for increases in funding for medical research on lupus, targeted education programmes for health professionals and public and worldwide recognition of lupus as a significant health issue.
