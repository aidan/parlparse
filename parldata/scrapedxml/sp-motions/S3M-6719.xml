 *S3M-6719♦ John Scott: British Veterans National Defence Medal—That the Parliament honours the service given to the country by members of the armed forces; believes that full and proper recognition should be given to all those who have served in the armed forces, such as generations of service personnel from Ayrshire and the rest of Scotland; supports the British Veterans National Defence Medal (NDM) Campaign, which seeks to recognise and honour military service wherever undertaken from 1945 onwards, and hopes that the campaign to award a national defence medal is successful.
