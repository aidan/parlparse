*S2M-315# Brian Adam: Public Inquiry into Infections from Contaminated Blood Products Contracted by Patients who Suffer from Haemophilia-That the Parliament expresses grave concern about the recent revelations of the early knowledge of contamination of blood products administered to patients suffering from haemophilia; notes that minutes of meetings indicate that professionals were aware of problems related to commercial American supplies as early as 1974; further notes that this information was not disclosed to patients at the time or to the Parliament since, and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure justice, openness and accountability by holding a public inquiry into the issue. Supported by: Mr Stewart Maxwell*
