* S3M-6324 Aileen Campbell: Sunday Times Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement by News International Ltd, owned by Rupert Murdoch, that it intends to cut staff and cease publication of The Sunday Times Scotland as a standalone publication; considers that coverage of Scottish news and culture in The Sunday Times will be significantly affected by this decision and that this is an unfortunate example of continued contraction in the Scottish newspaper market, and regrets not only the loss of jobs but the loss of diversity and reader choice that this decision will mean. Supported by: Kenneth Gibson*, Christina McKelvie*, Bill Kidd*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*
