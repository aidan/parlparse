*S2M-3602 Patrick Harvie: Campaigners of the Yearâ€”That the Parliament warmly congratulates the pupils from Drumchapel High School, who have been named Campaigners of the Year at the Herald Diageo Politician of the Year Awards, and everyone in the school and the wider community who have supported them; recognises that the most fitting reward for their efforts would be for the children of asylum seekers to be given the same basic standards of protection that all other children are entitled to in Scotland and throughout the world, so that they can live in safety and without fear, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to redouble its efforts and deliver this protection as a matter of the utmost urgency.
