*S3M-5475.1 David Whitton: Privatisation of British Waterways—As an amendment to motion (S3M-5475) in the name of Stuart McMillan, leave out from first "British Waterways" to end and insert "the British Waterways board is in discussion with HM Treasury and the shareholder executive about creating a new business model for the business that could involve structures such as mutual or third sector but is not privatisation, which is opposed by the board; further notes that, whatever the final outcome, the continued maintenance and protection of the waterways and access to facilities such as the Southbank marina in Kirkintilloch will continue to be an important objective; also notes that the UK Government has stated that it will consult the Scottish Government should the preferred model chosen require changes to the governance of British Waterways’ activities in Scotland, and considers that attempts to suggest that British Waterways is being privatised are mistaken."
