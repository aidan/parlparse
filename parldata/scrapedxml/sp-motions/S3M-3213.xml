 *S3M-3213 Ken Macintosh: Upholding Good Inter-Faith Relations at Times of Tension—That the Parliament recognises that events elsewhere in the world often have repercussions for communities in Scotland; emphasises that it is particularly important at times of tension to uphold and deepen good inter-faith relations, and therefore endorses the recent statement from the Inter Faith Network for the United Kingdom calling for communities to talk together in ways that increase understanding rather than lead to suspicion and distrust, and, while praying for peace and working for justice at the present time of crisis in Gaza, also holds firmly to the principle of maintaining bonds of trust between our communities.
