*S3M-5642 Jackson Carlaw: Israelis and Palestinians Working Together—That the Parliament considers that there is an unfortunate record of one-sided motions on Israel/Palestine that tend to promote a perception that Israel’s influence in the region is entirely negative; observes, in the interests of balance, that Qalqilya was able to harvest its first ever strawberry crop in December 2009 thanks to training, irrigation equipment and pesticides provided by Israel, that Ruwabi, a new Palestinian city, is to be built north of Ramallah with the Israelis helping to plan public parks and other civic amenities and the Israeli charity, Jewish National Fund, helping to plant 3,000 seedlings for a forested area planned for the outskirts of this new city, that Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has said that "in the West Bank we have a good reality ... the people are living a normal life"; welcomes the recent Scottish Development International mission to Israel and believes that this afforded Scottish companies opportunities to explore potential partnerships with Israeli companies and attract direct foreign investment, and calls on politicians of all parties to make more of an effort to portray a balanced and more responsible view of what is going on in the region, placing an equal emphasis on the positive achievements made over recent times as a result of Israelis and Palestinians working together for a better and more peaceful future.
