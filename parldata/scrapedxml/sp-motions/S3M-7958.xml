*S3M-7958 Dr Richard Simpson: Tobacco and Alcohol in Scotland—That the Parliament acknowledges the damaging impact to Scotland’s public health caused by tobacco and alcohol in society; is aware of the devastating health and social impact that both substances can cause; recognises the huge cost to Scotland in dealing with both tobacco and alcohol; believes that both sectors can learn from each other in tackling the health problems that these substances cause; further believes that the first joint conference on the issue organised by ASH Scotland, Alcohol Focus Scotland and Scottish Health Action on Alcohol Problems will help explore the issues surrounding Scotland’s use of tobacco and alcohol, and urges the Scottish Government to consider any recommendations emanating from the conference that seek to reduce the harmful impact of tobacco and alcohol in Scotland.
