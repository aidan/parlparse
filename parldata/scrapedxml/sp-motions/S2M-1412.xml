*S2M-1412 Mary Scanlon: Scottish First Division Champions-That the Parliament fully condemns the decision taken on 1 June 2004 by the Scottish Premier League (SPL) to deny Scottish First Division champions, Inverness Caledonian Thistle, entry into Scotland's top league next season, meaning that, for the second successive year, the team finishing bottom of the SPL has not been relegated and the First Division winners have not been rewarded for their success by rightfully gaining promotion to the SPL; notes that this is despite the club reaching a suitable ground-sharing agreement with Aberdeen Football Club to play at Pittodrie Stadium for one season, and believes that the decision takes away the basic principle of being rewarded for success.
