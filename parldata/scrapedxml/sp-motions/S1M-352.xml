*S1M-352 Mr Brian Monteith: With-holding Lottery Money From Wembley—That the Parliament recognises that the rebuilt Wembley Stadium will be inadequate for hosting athletics, despite receiving £120 million from the UK lottery on the understanding it could hold such events including the World Athletics Championships and the Olympic Games; notes that this follows on from a similar funding crisis recently at the National Stadium, Hampden Park; and supports the withholding of lottery money until such a time as Wembley can hold athletic events, or the redistribution of these funds to more pressing sports needs throughout the United Kingdom.
