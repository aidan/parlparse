 *S3M-4461 Brian Adam: Halt the Decline of Local Radio Services—That the Parliament notes with regret the decision of Bauer Media to centralise many of its AM radio shows; notes the valuable service that local radio stations such as Northsound 2 have provided over a large number of years, especially for those away from home, for example working in the North Sea, or needing traffic reports and weather updates; believes that having the majority of a local radio station’s output broadcast centrally over five local stations is a worrying dilution in service, and calls on Bauer Media to preserve its radio stations from any further local cuts and look at ways in which it can maintain the links of Northsound 2, Tay AM, Forth 2, Clyde 2 and Westsound with their local communities under these new arrangements.
