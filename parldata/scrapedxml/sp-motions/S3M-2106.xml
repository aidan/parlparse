*S3M-2106 Christine Grahame: Newlands and People Power—That the Parliament congratulates unreservedly Newlands Community Development Trust on securing £1 million from the National Lottery to build a community centre attached to the existing school at Romano Bridge, thus helping secure the future of Newlands Primary School; applauds the community for its determination and inventiveness in its long struggle to resist closure of the local school by Scottish Borders Council; wishes the trust every success in the future, and commends it as a model of people power and an example to communities resisting rural school closure elsewhere.
