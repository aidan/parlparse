*S1M-4026 Michael Russell: The Antonine Wall—That the Parliament commends the decision of Historic Scotland to apply for World Heritage Status for the Antonine Wall as part of a joint bid with Austria, Germany and Slovakia that seeks to secure recognition of, and protection for, the remaining sites that mark the boundaries of the Roman Empire; applauds all those who have worked, often against the indifference of Historic Scotland and other bodies, to preserve the signs of, and evidence about, the Roman invasion and occupation of Scotland, and, in particular, salutes the efforts of Ronnie Guild for his Herculean efforts on behalf of the ruins at Cramond and the members of the Antonine Guard for their active concern, in and out of uniform, for the Antonine Wall and other sites.
