 *S3M-7501 Willie Coffey: Morag Ferguson, Science Teacher of the Year 2010—That the Parliament notes the importance of inspirational teachers who stimulate and motivate pupils to take an interest in the world around them and to pursue a better understanding of the world through the application of scientific enquiry; recognises that many teachers are dedicated to achieving this goal but considers that few are more dedicated than Morag Ferguson of Annanhill Primary School in Kilmarnock, winner of the Science Teacher of the Year Award 2010; welcomes the judges’ findings that Morag’s many different experiments and practical activities, explaining what is happening and why, had led to parents reporting that their children feeling excited on days when they are studying science, and considers Morag to be a valued member of the teaching profession and someone who inspires innovation, expression and creative thinking in the young people when she teaches.
