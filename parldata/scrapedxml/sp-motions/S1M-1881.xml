 *S1M-1881# George Lyon: Job Losses in Campbeltown—That the Parliament deeply regrets the closure of the Jaeger Factory in Campbeltown; notes that the loss of 200 jobs is a devastating blow to the Kintyre economy, and believes that the Scottish Executive should provide backing and support to allow local agencies to develop a rescue package for the area which recognises that the loss of the town’s largest employer is a further, serious blow to a town already affected by the downturn in traditional rural industries.
