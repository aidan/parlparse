 * S2M-2800 Jackie Baillie:Credit Union Funding—That the Parliament welcomes the recent European Commission ruling that will effectively remove the cap on government funding for credit unions, currently set at £68,000 over three years; notes that credit unions are eligible to apply for Service of the General Economic Interest status, allowing for government funding to provide simple financial products targeted at the financially excluded; welcomes the considerable efforts by the Scottish Executive to obtain this outcome, and acknowledges that, in the context of one in 10 Scottish households lacking basic financial products and the problems of over-indebtedness, credit unions have a critically important role to play in our communities.
