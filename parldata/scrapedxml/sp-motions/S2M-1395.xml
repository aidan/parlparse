*S2M-1395 Mr Jim Wallace: Economy of the Highlands and Islands-That the Parliament endorses the ambition to create a diverse, dynamic and sustainable economy in the Highlands and Islands; congratulates Highlands and Islands Enterprise on the progress it has made with local partners towards realising this ambition, particularly in the areas of telecommunications, research and development and renewable energy; further welcomes the significant investment in critical transport infrastructure in the Highlands and Islands; recognises that serious challenges still lie ahead for the Highlands and Islands economy, not least in terms of sustaining more fragile areas, but believes that these can best be addressed through continuing the approach set out in A Smart, Successful Scotland.
