*S2M-50 Mrs Margaret Smith: Men's Health Week, Scotland: 9-16 June 2003—That the Parliament pledges support for Men's Health Week, Scotland, from 9 to 16 June 2003; acknowledges efforts by all sectors to publicise Men's Health Week, Scotland; recognises that most diseases affecting men are preventable and that, as the population of Scotland declines and ages, the burden of treating and caring for increasing numbers of men living longer with chronic disease will be resource intensive; is aware that, by 2050, 60% of adults will be over 65 and that men visit their GPs less than half as often as women and are less likely to have chronic diseases identified and treated early, and calls upon MSPs to assist on-going collaborations by promoting positive messages about healthy ageing, men's health and Men's Health Week, encouraging more men to take responsibility for their own health and well-being.
