*S3M-962 Bashir Ahmad: National Deaf Children’s Society: Supporting Black and Minority Ethnic Families of Deaf Children Project—That the Parliament believes that childhood deafness should not be a barrier to participating fully in the life of a modern Scotland; notes that there are approximately 2,922 deaf children living in Scotland today; acknowledges that the diverse and dynamic nature of Scotland’s demographic means that a proportion of these children will be from black and minority ethnic (BME) families; acknowledges research which suggests that there is a greater prevalence of deafness among certain BME communities, with one study indicating the incidence of deafness to be 3.5 times greater for Asian children compared with non-Asian children; accepts that, without the appropriate support, deafness can make it harder for children to communicate, especially if English is not their first language; is aware that language and cultural differences can often restrict parents from accessing vital information from health and education professionals, preventing them from making informed choices about important issues in their deaf children’s development; recognises the National Deaf Children’s Society (NDCS) Scotland as the only Scottish charity dedicated to the support of all deaf children and young people, their families and professionals working with them regardless of their ethnic backgrounds, culture, and religion, and therefore congratulates NDCS Scotland on its Supporting Black and Minority Ethnic Families of Deaf Children project, which has initially been focused on families in Glasgow due to the high density volume of BME families in the city, on successfully establishing close links with organisations within BME communities and professionals working with deaf children, recruiting and training volunteer representatives from within BME communities who can further support families with deaf children and on ensuring that Scottish BME families have access to comprehensive information in order that they can make informed choices and get support with issues associated with childhood deafness.
