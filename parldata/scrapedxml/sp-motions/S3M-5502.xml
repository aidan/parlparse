 *S3M-5502 Sandra White: David Robertson Ross, a Giant of a Man—That the Parliament notes with great sadness the passing away of the historian, David Robertson Ross, at the age of 51, who became widely known as the Biker Historian as he toured around Scotland from the age of 17 in his quest for a better understanding of the places and events that helped shape our nation; further notes that, through his numerous works on William Wallace and Robert the Bruce among others, he is credited with bringing Scotland’s vibrant history to a new generation of ordinary people in Scotland and beyond; feels that David’s dream to see Wallace "brought home" for a symbolic funeral was realised in 2005 when, to mark the 700th anniversary of Wallace’s execution, David and supporters carried a coffin containing Wallace’s "spirit" from London to Scotland, and believes that as he journeys to join his kindred spirits the words by fellow Scottish patriot and author Linda MacDonald-Lewis - Mourn now, weep on my countrymen/For the man that stood/Steadfast to passioned principles/When few if any would./Call him giant, call him mad/Or Sir if you will/The Wallace and his Mighty Sword Stirs the young hearts still - originally penned to mark the Walk for Wallace ring true for this giant of a man.
