*S2M-541 Nicol Stephen: Scotland's Transport-That the Parliament recognises the importance of the Scottish Executive's proposals for improving transport in Scotland as set out in A Partnership for a Better Scotland, in particular its intention to set up a transport agency to secure delivery of the Executive's major investment programme to expand transport infrastructure and services across Scotland and to improve the integration of these services, the proposals to enhance the schemes of concessionary fares to benefit elderly and disabled people and the proposals to enhance the ability of local government to serve the travelling public through stronger regional transport partnerships, which should contribute to an effective transport system, central to a thriving economy and strong communities.
