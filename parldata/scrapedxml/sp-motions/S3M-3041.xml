*S3M-3041 Cathy Peattie: Forced Redundancies at Herald and Times Group—That the Parliament is extremely concerned about the action of Newsquest’s new editor-in-chief of the Herald and Times Group, Donald Martin, who has announced that all editorial staff on The Herald, Sunday Herald and The Evening Times will be made redundant; notes that, while some staff may be rehired on a new contract, it is feared that this will lead to the loss of 30 to 40 jobs, and that, in most cases, this will mean reduced pay and conditions, including loss of holiday entitlement and the introduction of new enforced shift patterns; further notes the comments of National Union of Journalists (NUJ) Scottish organiser Paul Holleran that "this is a brutal attempt at forcing changes" and, with regard to the adoption of new production technology, "every other media employer in Scotland is working with the union to try to handle these changes in a civilised manner"; also notes the existing concerns of staff about stress and other health and safety issues; believes that the actions of the group are unwarranted and unacceptable and can only harm the newspaper industry in Scotland, and further believes that the actions should be rescinded and that the group should seek to work with the NUJ to ensure that the introduction of technological change is subject to a properly negotiated agreement with the workforce.
