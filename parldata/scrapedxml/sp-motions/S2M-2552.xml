*S2M-2552# Margo MacDonald: Stamp Duty Rebate Scheme—That the Parliament welcomes "Homestake", the initiative announced by the Scottish Executive intended to help first-time buyers purchase property in Scotland; notes, however, that a recent Bank of Scotland survey showed that the average price paid for a house in Scotland by first-time buyers is now £82,654 and that the average stamp duty is £820; further notes that the stamp duty threshold has not risen from £60,000 since 1994 but that, if it had, the threshold would now be £156,000, and therefore calls on the Executive to consider a scheme that would discount the first £1,000 of council tax paid within the year of purchase, a figure which equates to a stamp duty rebate on property valued at £100,000 and draws the Executive’s attention to the benefit that could accrue to over 30,000 house buyers and that it would cost the Executive just over £30 million.
