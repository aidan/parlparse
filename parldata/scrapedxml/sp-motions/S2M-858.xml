*S2M-858# Carolyn Leckie: Approval of Inward Delegationâ€”That the Parliament believes that delegations representing governments and states throughout the world should be welcomed by the Parliament in general; recognises, however, that there may be regimes abhorrent to members that such members believe it inappropriate to welcome; is concerned to note that members may debate, in the chamber, the merits or otherwise of going to war on a state but currently have no facility to debate whether it is appropriate to welcome the representatives of that state to the Parliament; believes that these contradictions undermine the integrity of the Parliament and further believes that, where a member expresses an objection to a delegation, the Parliament should be able to vote on the matter.
