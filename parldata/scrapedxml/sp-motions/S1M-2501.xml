*S1M-2501# Mr Gil Paterson: Criminal Proceedings in Sexual Assault Cases—That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should investigate the fall in the number of cases of sexual assault and lewd and indecent behaviour which have proceeded to court in the last 10 years; believes that, in the light of the falling conviction rate for rape cases, an urgent review of the procedures used by the police and procurator fiscal’s office in cases of sexual assault is needed, and considers that the Executive should ensure that the Crown Office carries out proper tracking of all cases to make sure that certain crimes are not being proceeded against or having fiscal fines imposed more frequently than others and that proper action is taken in all cases.
