*S2M-1850# Colin Fox: Prison Conditions in Scotland—That the Parliament notes the Annual Report of HM Chief Inspector of Prisons for 2003-04 which suggests that overcrowding in our prisons seriously hampers our ability to challenge offending behaviour and reduce reoffending; believes therefore that Scotland sends too many people to prison; further believes that the pressure on the Scottish Prison Service to make budget cuts is inhibiting rehabilitation programmes and worsening already poor conditions; considers that overcrowding and slopping out remain the two most serious challenges facing the service, and believes that the continuation of slopping out tarnishes Scotland’s human rights reputation, especially for prisoners under 21 who have not been convicted of any crime.
