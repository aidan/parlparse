*S3M-1740♦ Cathy Peattie: World Asthma Day—That the Parliament notes World Asthma Day on 6 May 2008, which will see the launch by Asthma UK of its "Wish you were here?" campaign to highlight the significant variation in asthma services throughout the United Kingdom; recognises that asthma is a major public health issue, with 400,000 people in Scotland having asthma, resulting in over a quarter of a million GP consultations and thousands of hospital admissions each year; believes that every school should have an asthma policy to ensure that children with asthma are given every opportunity to take part in normal school life, and further believes that more effective diagnosis, treatment and management to put more people in control of their asthma should be prioritised as part of a national respiratory strategy, similar to strategies being adopted in Wales and Northern Ireland, that ensures sharing of best practice and a joined-up approach to respiratory conditions across Scotland.
