 *S2M-5768 Dr Jean Turner: In Praise of Hospices—That the Parliament praises Marie Curie Cancer Care’s campaign "Scotland Supporting the Choice to Die at Home"; understands that to enable this wish to be granted requires intensive nursing care at home and the appropriate number of highly trained district nurses to be maintained within primary care and working side by side with Marie Curie nurses; accepts that the choice to die at home cannot always be fulfilled and that patients may have to transfer to a hospice; considers, therefore, that it is imperative that hospices such as Marie Curie (Springburn) and St Margaret of Scotland (Clydebank), within the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde board area, should be realistically funded by the board since the NHS could not function without their nursing expertise and beds, and acknowledges that it is extremely unfair that staff have to dedicate so much time to fundraising in addition to nursing very sick patients in order to cover the ever-increasing gap between the funding that the NHS board allocates hospices and the total cost of running hospice services which are second to none.
