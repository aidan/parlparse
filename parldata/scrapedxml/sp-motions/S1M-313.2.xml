*S1M-313.2 Mr Alex Salmond: Land Reform—As an amendment to motion (S1M-313) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from "commends" to end and insert "notes the progress of the Scottish Executive’s consultation on the Land Reform White Paper; welcomes the commitment to a community right to purchase contained within the proposals; nevertheless is concerned that these proposals remain too narrowly focused, and therefore agrees that they should be widened to include proposals which would increase community involvement in local land management throughout Scotland."
