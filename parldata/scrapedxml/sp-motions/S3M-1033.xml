*S3M-1033♦ Alison McInnes: Regional Transport Strategies—That the Parliament notes the early successes of regional transport partnerships (RTPs) in planning and delivering effective transport infrastructure and services to meet the needs of people and business across Scotland, such as the bus improvement initiatives delivered in the north east under Nestrans; recognises that RTPs can play a unique role in delivering cohesive transport strategies across local authority boundaries by working in partnership with local authorities, the Scottish Government and the wider transport industry; welcomes the view of the SNP in opposition that RTPs must be given "the maximum possible powers" and secure funding; notes that seven regional transport strategies were submitted to the government by 31 March 2007, due to be approved or returned within the three month period stated in Scotland’s Transport Future: Guidance on Regional Transport Strategies; regrets that the Scottish Government has failed to approve or return any of the strategies; further regrets that the Scottish Government’s budget shows that the levels of capital and revenue that have either been allocated to transport or rolled up in the local authority settlement from previous transport budgets falls far short of that required to make significant improvements to transport, and therefore considers that the uncertainty over the future of regional transport in Scotland can be ended by approval or return of the regional transport strategies, with adequate explanation being given if strategies are returned, and provision to RTPs of sufficient capital and revenue funding to deliver transport improvements effectively.
