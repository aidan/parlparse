*S1M-1891 Mr Brian Monteith: Insensitivity of Stirling Council over Education Trip—That the Parliament notes the decision by the Labour administration running Stirling Council to send senior education officials on a £1,800 overnight "workshop" session outside the area of the authority to the four-star Inchyra Grange Hotel in Falkirk and recognises the insensitivity of this decision at a time when the administration has just announced that it is to implement £250,000 of cuts to the budgets of local schools in the area and when hotels and other hospitality locations in the Stirling district are themselves suffering from the effects of the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak.
