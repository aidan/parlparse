*S1M-3513 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Edinburgh Hogmanay "Eurozone"—That the Parliament commends the initiative of the Scotland in Europe campaign to have Edinburgh designated a temporary "eurozone" during the period of the upcoming Hogmanay celebrations, whereby local businesses, shops, hoteliers and pubs would be encouraged to accept euros as payment from visitors; notes that a similar scheme in the Welsh town of Llangollen during the Eisteddfod this year was a great success and of huge benefit both to Llangollen and to Wales as a whole; believes that Edinburgh, too, would benefit from a eurozone period through the enhanced enjoyment of the festival, the boost to local tourism and the further promotion of Edinburgh’s reputation as a great European city, and urges all political parties, Edinburgh City Council, local businesses and tourist organisations to work together in pursuing the Hogmanay eurozone project to a successful conclusion.Supported by: Tricia Marwick*, Linda Fabiani*
