*S2M-959 Eleanor Scott: Highland Peace Movement-That the Parliament welcomes the Lochinver Declaration for Peace launched on 14 February 2004; commends all those people who have signed up to it and pledged to act for peace; supports the growing movement for peace across Scotland; notes that this movement will converge on Inverness on 28 February 2004 to urge Tony Blair to do more to find non-violent resolutions to international conflicts, and deplores Highland Council's imposition of charges on the Highland Coalition for Justice not War for the demonstration.
