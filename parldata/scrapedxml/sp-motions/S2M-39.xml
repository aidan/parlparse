 *S2M-39 Rosie Kane: Advertising in Schools—That the Parliament expresses deep concern at the increasing trend for private companies to advertise their brands in schools, hoping for a captive target market of young people who will stay true to their products in later life, often to the detriment of the young people’s nutritional health; believes that Scotland’s schools should be brand-free zones and should not have to rely on the franchises, vouchers or other marketing deals offered by such companies to provide computers or other teaching materials, and calls on the Scottish Executive to engage with local authorities across Scotland to ensure that all advertising and branding is removed from schools and to provide local authorities with sufficient funds to cover all the educational and nutritional needs of Scotland’s schoolchildren. Supported by: Mark Ballard*, Chris Ballance*
