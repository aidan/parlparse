 *S3M-496 Cathie Craigie: Access to Scottish Executive Initiatives for Those with Low Incidence Disabilities—That the Parliament shares Deafblind Scotland’s concerns that access to Scottish Executive initiatives is currently compromised for those with low incidence disabilities such as deafblindness through the growing emphasis on and move to community planning; believes that national organisations are a vital support to those with low incidence disabilities, as the low numbers involved by definition make localised assistance difficult, and asks the Executive to consider an alternative to disbursing all funds for Choose Life and other initiatives, such as those for quality of life and numeracy and literacy, to local authorities only as this inhibits access to central funding for national organisations supporting those with low incidence disabilities across Scotland.
