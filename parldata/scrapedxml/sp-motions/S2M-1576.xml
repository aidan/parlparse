*S2M-1576 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Cancer Patients &amp; Unclaimed Benefits-That the Parliament strongly congratulates Macmillan Cancer Relief on funding financial advice and support for cancer patients in Scotland; is concerned that 64% of cancer sufferers in Scotland do not claim the benefits to which they are entitled, amounting to almost Â£15 million in unclaimed benefits; considers it a disgrace that the benefit system is so confusing and hostile that charitable organisations have to fund guidance on claiming for cancer sufferers, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take swift action to guarantee that those people in Scotland who suffer from cancer receive the full support to which they are entitled and to make immediate and strong representations to Her Majesty's Government in support of simplifying the benefits system for people diagnosed with serious illnesses.
