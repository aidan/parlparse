*S2M-4359 Fergus Ewing: Birds Eye Skew - Misleading and Cynical Advertising Campaign by Unilever plc—That the Parliament expresses its continued support for the Scottish salmon industry which employs around 10,000 people, many in areas where there are no alternative sources of work, and generates around £700 million annually for the economy; notes that Unilever plc, which owns the "Birds Eye" brand of processed food, is paying for a television advert which contains an unwarranted and unjustified attack on the Scottish salmon industry by falsely suggesting that Scottish farmed salmon is inferior; notes that the Scottish Salmon Producers Organisation has described this advert as "melodramatic and cynical" and endorses this criticism, and believes that Patrick Cescau, Chief Executive of Unilever plc, who is ultimately responsible for the continuing running of this advert, should intervene and cancel it now or explain why he is authorising negative coverage for an industry and product of Scottish farmed salmon, which is affordable as well as nutritious and which has been awarded the prestigious "Label Rouge" award in France.
