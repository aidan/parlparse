*S3M-5457 Pauline McNeill: Gaza Now Exhibition Marks the Anniversary of the War on Gaza—That the Parliament marks the first anniversary of the bombing of Gaza during the 22-day war that took place between 27 December 2008 and 18 January 2009 by exhibiting the Gaza Now exhibition, hosted by Edinburgh Direct Aid and the Cross-party Group on Palestine; notes with concern that the Gaza war resulted in 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis losing their lives, leaving in its wake a massive humanitarian disaster, with more than 400,000 Gazans left without running water while 4,000 homes were destroyed or damaged, leaving tens of thousands of people homeless; believes that all perpetrators of war crimes during Operation Cast Lead should be brought to justice; recognises the importance of the Goldstone report, which states that facts discovered during the mission led the team to conclude that Israel’s objective in the attack was to punish, humiliate and terrorise a civilian population; supports the recommendation in the Goldstone report that, to uphold respect for human rights and show no tolerance of state impunity from international law, there must be an independent and credible investigation of war crimes; reaffirms its support for Israel to withdraw from the occupied territories, and supports the creation of a viable independent Palestinian state. Supported by: Michael Matheson*, Cathy Jamieson*, Bill Kidd*, Jackie Baillie*, Bill Butler*, David Stewart*, Patricia Ferguson*, Bob Doris*, Malcolm Chisholm*, Jim Tolson*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Sandra White*, Robin Harper*, Marlyn Glen*
