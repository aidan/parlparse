 *S3M-6874 Alasdair Allan: 80th Anniversary of St Kilda Evacuationâ€”That the Parliament notes that 29 August 2010 marks the 80th anniversary of the evacuation of St Kilda when the last 36 islanders were removed from the island at their own request; recognises what is considered to be the huge importance of St Kilda culturally to Scotland and the Western Isles; notes that St Kilda is one of only a few World Heritage Sites to hold joint status for its natural and cultural environments, and believes that the physical beauty, historic traditions and remoteness of St Kilda provides a continuing source of fascination for generations of people around the world.
