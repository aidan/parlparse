*S1M-1996# Christine Grahame: Residential Home Closures—That the Parliament notes with concern the closure and threatened closure of many residential homes in the voluntary, charitable and private sectors; considers that this is directly attributable to under-funding by local authorities over a period of years; notes that the Church of Scotland, with 34 homes with 900 residents, has an overall running deficit of £1.5 million per annum, with losses last year alone amounting to £3.5 million, and that the spokesman for the Church’s Board of Social Responsibility has stated that the situation is at crisis point, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should address this situation immediately. Supported by: Michael Russell*, Dorothy-Grace Elder*
