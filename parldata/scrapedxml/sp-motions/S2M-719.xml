 *S2M-719 John Swinburne: VIP Radio-That the Parliament welcomes the introduction of VIP Radio, the first radio station aimed at breaking down social isolation faced by people with sight problems, which in the first instance will help 10,000 people with sight problems in the Greater Glasgow area; congratulates the station on employing a mix of sighted, blind and partially sighted people; welcomes the potential for this radio station, although initially broadcasting via an internet channel, to extend the service, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to support all public service organisations to ensure that their services and information are fully accessible to people with sight problems and other disabilities.
