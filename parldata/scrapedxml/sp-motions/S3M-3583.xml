*S3M-3583 Pauline McNeill: Daily Record and Sunday Mail Newspapers—That the Parliament notes with extreme concern the announcement that up to a quarter of journalists at the Daily Record and Sunday Mail newspapers are to lose their jobs following the decision by Trinity Mirror to merge the two newsrooms; notes that the Daily Record and Sunday Mail are iconic titles and among Scotland’s most read newspapers and that these job losses are occurring despite the titles representing one of the more profitable parts of the industry; believes that such a reduction in staffing is likely to affect the quality of journalistic output; recognises that this is a turbulent period in the newspaper industry and that a longer-term review of the needs of the media industry should be looked at; welcomes the recent summit facilitated by the Minister for Enterprise, Energy and Tourism and calls on the Scottish Government to continue to have dialogue with the industry in order to ensure that Scotland has a vibrant newspaper sector; welcomes the BBC’s decision not to proceed with a local online news service as it would have impacted on the newspaper industry and local newspapers in particular, and calls on the industry not simply to respond to new technologies and challenges by cutting jobs but to consider longer-term solutions that maintain quality of output and a diverse newspaper industry.
