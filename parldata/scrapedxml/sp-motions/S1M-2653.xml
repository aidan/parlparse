 *S1M-2653 David McLetchie: New Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh-That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in the new Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh project, which has now started to treat patients and was completed on time and within budget; notes that this essential development would not have proceeded without the foresight of successive Conservative Secretaries of State for Scotland nor without the use of the innovative PFI scheme, and calls on Lothian University Hospitals NHS Trust to retain the historic name of "Simpson" for its maternity unit.
