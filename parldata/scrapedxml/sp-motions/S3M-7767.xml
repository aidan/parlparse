*S3M-7767♦ Christine Grahame: BBC UK Network Fails Devolution—That the Parliament believes that there ought to be an end to what it considers to be the misleading and distorted coverage on the BBC news and current affairs network that is continuing to fail to accurately reflect the constitutional changes resulting from the introduction of devolution 12 years ago; considers that presenters and news reports from London broadcast on the UK-wide network regularly fail to make clear that policy changes to issues such as education, health, justice and social services among others relate only to England and are often not relevant, or are completely different, to policy in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, where devolved issues and the public policy agenda are for the most part completely different to that occurring in England; believes that this causes confusion to Scottish audiences such as those in the Scottish Borders who are given the impression that changes to England only will affect and impact on services across the UK, and believes that consideration should be given to establishing main news output from Scotland, covering accurately policy changes in the nation and that also gives a Scottish perspective on international affairs and issues.
