*S2M-4790 Eleanor Scott: Organic Aid Scheme—That the Parliament notes with concern that, out of 314 applications to the Organic Aid Scheme in 2006, only 157 applications were approved, of which only 55 were for ongoing maintenance payments as compared to 102 for conversion from conventional to organic agriculture; compares and contrasts this 50% approval rate with 97% for the preceding year; questions whether this decrease in the approval rate can be reconciled with the aspiration in the Scottish Executive’s Organic Action Plan "to see Scottish organic products grow in market penetration so that they can meet at least 70% by value of overall Scottish consumer demand for organic products which can be sourced in Scotland", and calls on the Executive to take immediate action, both to support farmers and to meet market demand for Scottish organic produce.
