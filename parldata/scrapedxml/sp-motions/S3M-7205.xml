 *S3M-7205 Bill Wilson: Media Diversity and Democracy—That the Parliament believes that meaningful democracy depends on an educated and informed electorate and that an important element in this is a vibrant and diverse media, unafraid of voicing opinions that do not necessarily accord with the opinions of those who wield political or economic power; expresses the wish, therefore, that the UK Government oppose Rupert Murdoch’s attempt to increase his company’s share of BSkyB, and considers that he already has several newspapers and the Fox channel and so the public are adequately acquainted with the Murdoch perspective. Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Bill Kidd*, Christopher Harvie*, Angela Constance*, Robin Harper*
