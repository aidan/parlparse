*S3M-5424 Michael McMahon: Save Our Steelworks—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision by Corus, a company owned by Tata Steel, to mothball the Teesside Cast Products factory; supports the efforts of Community, the union, to reverse this premature decision; believes that this decision could have an impact on steel production in Scotland; recognises that the Scottish and British steel industry still has the ability to deliver world-class products; values a future for a steel industry in the United Kingdom, and believes that if public works and the Forth crossing in Scotland are to create local jobs then there must be a future for both Scottish and British steel.
