 * S2M-2881 Mr Frank McAveety:Support for the London Olympic 2012 Bid—That the Parliament sends its best wishes to the London Olympic 2012 bid; believes that the legacy of a successful London Olympics bid will benefit the United Kingdom as a whole; hopes that the bid team will maximise opportunities for competitions and events to be held throughout the United Kingdom; notes that the Olympic Games would provide an excellent opportunity to showcase Scotland’s arts and culture to a global audience; recognises that Australia is still benefiting from the boost in tourism brought about from the Sydney Olympics in 2000 and believes that the Scottish tourism industry could benefit similarly; further believes that a successful bid would undoubtedly increase interest and boost participation in sport, both in Scotland and throughout the United Kingdom, and would strengthen Scotland’s ambition to host the Commonwealth Games, and calls on all parties within the Scottish Parliament to offer their full support to the British Olympics bid.
