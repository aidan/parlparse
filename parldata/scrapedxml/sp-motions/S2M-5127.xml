 *S2M-5127 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Community Ownership of Land—That the Parliament congratulates the community of Sealladh na Beinne Moire on receipt of over £2 million towards the purchase of the South Uist Estate, covering 92,000 acres and taking up virtually all of South Uist, Benbecula and Eriskay; notes that this proposed community buy-out is the biggest ever in terms of land mass and population (2,700), and the biggest in terms of finance since Gigha; notes that the £2 million, representing 44.22% of the cost of the acquisition, will go towards the acquisition of shares in the companies that collectively own the assets of the vast estate; commends the community of Sealladh na Beinne Moire on its hard work on the community buy-out; recognises that community buy-outs represent the taking back of common land into community ownership and control; notes, however, that approximately 84% of Scotland’s land remains in private hands, that 25% is owned by 66 landowners in estates of 30,700 acres or larger, that 33% is owned by 120 landowners in estates of 21,000 acres or larger, that 50% is owned by 343 landowners in estates of 7,500 acres or larger and that 66% is owned by 1,252 landowners in estates of 1,200 acres or larger; condemns the undemocratic pattern of land ownership in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to initiate an immediate review of land ownership with a view to common land being taken back into community control.
