*S3M-6896 John Park: A Step Backwards for Asbestos-related Conditionsâ€”That the Parliament regrets the recent decision taken by the UK Government to cut planned investment into creating a UK-wide research centre into asbestos-related diseases; believes this move to be a step backward in assisting further research into the causes and treatment of such diseases; considers that there is a need for a UK-wide approach to research on asbestos-related diseases; notes with deep concern that, according to the Health and Safety Executive, a total of 2,617 Scottish men died from mesothelioma between 1981 and 2005 ; believes that the Scottish Government should give urgent attention to raising this issue with the UK Government, and further believes that the Scottish Government should consider ways in which greater support can be given for research into asbestos related diseases.
