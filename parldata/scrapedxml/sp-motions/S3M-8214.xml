*S3M-8214 Elaine Smith: Breastfeeding Awareness, Support and Promotion—That the Parliament recognises the importance of preventative spending in the area of breastfeeding support and promotion; is concerned by reports that 22 breastfeeding support nurses in Lanarkshire are under threat of losing their jobs as the funding from the Scottish Government pilot ends in March 2011; notes that breastfeeding rates at birth and hospital discharge increased over the pilot period and that the evaluation of the pilot showed that both mothers and staff reported that they valued the input of the support nurses; understands that spending on breastfeeding projects results in significant cost savings in both the short term and the long term due to the obvious and undisputed health benefits associated with it for mothers and children; considers that training and awareness raising about the Breastfeeding etc. (Scotland) Act 2005 and the seriousness of breaking the law is necessary following an incident in a TK Maxx store in Glasgow whereby it considers there was a clear breach of the Act causing trauma to a mother and baby and in which charges were brought by the police but resulting only in a warning letter from the procurator fiscal service to the store owners, and believes that more requires to be done to support and promote breastfeeding in Scotland.
