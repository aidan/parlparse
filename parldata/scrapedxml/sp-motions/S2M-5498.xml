 *S2M-5498 Jackie Baillie: Animal Welfare and Transportation—That the Parliament regrets any incidence of animal cruelty and recognises that in many cases this arises from simple neglect; welcomes the positive work of organisations like the SSPCA (Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals) in providing a safe haven for animals; notes the concerns that continue to be expressed about the transportation of livestock, in particular that the capacity of containers is inappropriate for the health and welfare of the animals, and considers that the Scottish Executive should review the minimum standards that apply to the transportation of livestock.
