*S3M-1800 Robin Harper: Dutch Organic Foods Public Procurement Standards—That the Parliament notes that, in addition to encouraging consumers to buy organic products, the Dutch Government will play its own part in boosting demand for organic products by ensuring that all government procurement must be sustainably sourced from 2010 onward with a minimum of 40% organic content and that the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture has agreed to source 75% of food at its canteens from organic suppliers; further notes that the previous administration agreed an organic farming action plan in 2003, and calls on the Scottish Government to set the same standards in public procurement across Scotland as are now being set in the Netherlands.
