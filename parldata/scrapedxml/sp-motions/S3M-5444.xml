*S3M-5444 Patrick Harvie: Brokenhagen—That the Parliament condemns the disgraceful sham, known as the Copenhagen Accord, agreed by certain governments at the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP15), an accord that has no legally binding status and that contains no date for the peaking of global emissions, no global or national targets for subsequent cutting of emissions and no commitment to provide new financial resources from wealthy countries; condemns in particular the governments of the United States, China, Brazil, India and South Africa for brokering this accord and the UK Government for failing to condemn it; further condemns the decision to exclude key non-governmental organisations from the COP15 venue and the decision to announce this sham agreement to the US media before the parties to the conference had seen it; agrees with the words of President Barak Obama when he said that the ability of the world’s political leaders to take collective action against climate change was in question and considers that, by his own actions, the President has provided a starkly negative answer to this question, and believes that the outcome of the COP15 summit, once hailed as Hopenhagen, in fact demonstrates the abject failure of the current generation of political leaders in major nations around the world.
