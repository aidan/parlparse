*S2M-3684.3 Frances Curran: Future Arrangements for Health Services in the Argyll and Clyde Area—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3684) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from first “supports” to end and insert “believes that the Scottish Executive’s decision to dissolve Argyll and Clyde NHS board was hasty and the subsequent consultation document issued concerning the new boundary options for the services provided by NHS Argyll and Clyde was completely inadequate, lacking both financial information and possible impact assessment on service provision from a reallocation of resources to NHS Highland and NHS Greater Glasgow; further believes that no-one responding to the consultation could reach an informed view on these issues; therefore calls for this information to be placed in the public domain before any decision, which could have a major impact on jobs and services within the existing Argyll and Clyde NHS board area, is taken by the Executive, and applauds the work of the existing staff to continue to provide health care services within NHS Argyll and Clyde despite the enormous uncertainty that they feel about their own employment.”
