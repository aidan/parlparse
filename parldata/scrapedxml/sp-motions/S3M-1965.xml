*S3M-1965 Rob Gibson: Safeguarding Scotland’s Fishing Rights—That the Parliament welcomes the launch by the Scottish Government of the consultation, Safeguarding Scotland’s Fishing Rights, which will review the management of Scotland’s fish quota in order to ensure that Scotland’s fisheries have a sustainable future, prevent the introduction of individual transferable quotas which would effectively privatise Scotland’s fishing quota, open up opportunities for new entrants to fisheries and ensure that fishing quotas are held by active fishermen, not so-called "slipper skippers" who do not use their quotas or who speculate in fishing quotas; urges Scotland’s fishing community to engage with the consultation to deliver the best possible future management of Scotland’s fisheries, and welcomes this new and innovative approach.
