 *S3M-277 Robin Harper: Local People Leading—That the Parliament congratulates Local People Leading on the publication of its manifesto; recognises the importance of putting power in the hands of local communities and, committing to the principle of decentralisation, calls on the Scottish Executive to review and extend the scope of land reform with a view to extending the right to buy so that all communities can benefit, and asks that consideration be given to extending discretion for public sector bodies to dispose of assets into community ownership without seeking ministerial approval, on the new English model.
