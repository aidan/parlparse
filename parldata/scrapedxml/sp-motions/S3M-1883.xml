*S3M-1883 Elaine Smith: No to Nestlé—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision to award the contract for Scotland’s local authorities’ bottled water to Nestlé; considers this decision to be, at the very least, misguided given Nestlé’s previous involvement in a number of aggressive marketing campaigns to promote formula milk; notes that Nestlé utilises marketing practices which appear to be in direct violation of the WHO/UNICEF International Code of Marketing of Breast Milk Substitutes; further notes Nestlé’s powerful influence over market trends, governments and other companies, culminating in the adoption of questionable marketing practices which could weaken legislation designed to protect infant health; views with interest report findings published by International Baby Food Action Network which shows Nestlé to be the largest single source of violation of the marketing code worldwide, and calls for an obligation to be placed on local authorities to thoroughly research companies to ensure that a positive ethical choice is made when spending taxpayers’ money.
