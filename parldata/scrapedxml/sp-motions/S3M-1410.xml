*S3M-1410 John Park: Strengthening of Offshore Workers’ Rights—That the Parliament welcomes the recent tribunal decision that ruled that offshore workers are entitled to four weeks paid leave which on a pro rata basis equates to 14 days annual paid leave under the European Working Time Directive; notes that previously offshore workers have been unable to claim such a right when working a "two weeks on, two weeks off" shift pattern; recognises that this victory is due to the hard work and campaigning of the trade unions representing offshore workers, Unite, RMT and OILC, and looks forward to this decision being the starting point for the further strengthening of workers’ rights in the offshore industries.
