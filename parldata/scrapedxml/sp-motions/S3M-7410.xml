*S3M-7410 Sarah Boyack: Aung San Suu Kyi, an International Inspiration—That the Parliament welcomes the release of Aung San Suu Kyi, Burma’s best-known prisoner of conscience; notes that Aung San Suu Kyi has spent more than 15 of the past 21 years under house arrest; further notes that she was last detained in May 2003 after the Burmese Government reportedly attacked her motorcade in Depayin, having been previously detained from 1989 to 1995 and from 2000 to 2002; notes that, in the 1990 general election, Aung San Suu Kyi’s National League for Democracy party won 59% of the national votes and 80% of the seats in the Burmese Parliament, a result that would normally have assured her the role of Prime Minister but was instead nullified by the military junta, resulting in an international outcry; commends what it considers the bravery and dignity that the Nobel Peace Laureate has shown throughout her years in house arrest; considers that her leadership gives hope and inspiration to thousands of political prisoners currently being held in deplorable conditions for simply exercising their right to peaceful protest, and wishes her well in her quest to deliver freedom of speech, democracy and human rights to the people of Burma.
