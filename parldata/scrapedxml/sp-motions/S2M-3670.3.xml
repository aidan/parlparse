*S2M-3670.3 Frances Curran: Violence Against Women—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3670) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end “recognises that the normalisation of sexualised images of women and girls in magazines that are on general sale promotes sexist attitudes about women and girls and contributes to ideas that allow violence towards women to occur without challenge, and further recognises that the Violence Against Women Fund is grant allocated and that mainstream funding is still not a reality for many non-governmental organisations, local authorities and the NHS and therefore that violence against women initiatives are treated as fringe activities as opposed to core strategic planning.”
