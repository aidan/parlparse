*S3M-6908 Rob Gibson: Scotland’s First Housing Expo—That the Parliament praises the delivery of Scotland’s first Housing Expo, which attracted well over 30,000 visitors in August 2010 at Balvonie Braes, on the southern outskirts of Inverness; also applauds the organisers from Highland Council who it considers showed tenacity in the face of the economic recession and achieved a highly successful outcome with full backing from the Scottish Government; notes that 52 cutting-edge houses designed with the future in mind were seen to stimulate house buyers, architects and builders who now know that this climate change age demands house designs with as low carbon impact as possible; welcomes the support of experts from Finland for the achievements of the Scottish Housing Expo and notes that the inspiration from that Baltic Sea country has raised the standards of house design there in over 40 years of such events; calls on other local authority areas, architects and builders to join in planning the next Scottish Housing Expo to display the gold standard of house designs that needs to be available for affordable housing and private housing in future; is encouraged by the considerable number of enquiries by potential buyers of the private houses built on the site, and wishes all who live at Balvonie Braes including those allocated one of the 20 houses built by Albyn and Cairn Housing Associations for affordable rent and low cost ownership a comfortable, low carbon future.
