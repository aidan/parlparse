*S3M-4589 Alex Johnstone: Aberdeen Bus Strikeâ€”That the Parliament expresses concern at the possibility of strike action by First Aberdeen staff; notes that public transport is a lifeline to many people in the city of Aberdeen, especially the elderly and vulnerable; further notes that passengers may be obliged to leave buses and be left at the side of the road; urges the union not to undertake strike action, and hopes that all parties will negotiate an amicable solution that avoids a detrimental impact on communities.
