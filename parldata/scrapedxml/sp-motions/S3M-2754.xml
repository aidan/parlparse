*S3M-2754 Jim Hume: Save Sheuchan Street Postal Servicesâ€”That the Parliament deplores the decision taken by Post Office Ltd to remain committed to its original post office branch closure programme across the South of Scotland despite the numerous strong objections made by individuals, businesses and community groups; further deplores the loss in particular of Sheuchan Street Post Office in Stranraer; notes with deep concern the detrimental impact that this loss of service provision in Stranraer will have on the economy of the immediate local community and surrounding area, individuals and small to medium-sized businesses reliant upon a service that is very localised and customised to their specific needs and that provides face-to-face personal support and advice to elderly, disabled and vulnerable people, and calls on the Scottish Government to take urgent action to retain effective and comprehensive postal services in Stranraer and the rest of the South of Scotland.
