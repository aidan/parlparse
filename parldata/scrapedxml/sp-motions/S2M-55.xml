 *S2M-55 Christine Grahame: The "Miss X" Case and the Failings of Scottish Borders Council—That the Parliament notes with concern the findings in the report of 8 October 2002 by David Stallard for Scottish Borders Council into the council's handling of the "Miss X "case which found, inter alia, the lack of a clear plan for the social work role, no recent recorded assessment of the needs of Miss X, an inadequate supervision of Miss X and Mr B for the crucial period of 3 September 2001 to 21 January 2002, that the vulnerable adult protection procedures should have been used on 24 or 25 January 2002, that there was no adequate written guidance for lifelong care staff on guardianship and, crucially, that workloads were very high for social workers, senior social workers and the locality manager involved; is concerned that, following this, the report of 25 April 2003 by Miss Anne Black for the council, although finding failings of staff at a number of levels, did not recommend disciplinary hearings despite the fact that Miss X’s vulnerability had been reported and had not been acted upon causing her to endure brutal and heinous assaults, and believes that individual responsibility for failing Miss X should not hide behind systems that fail and that those responsible for the failed management systems should be held to account.
