*S3M-3674.3 Stewart Stevenson: Aberdeen Crossrail—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3674) in the name of Alison McInnes, leave out from "which would" to end and insert "which is being tackled incrementally by the introduction of new services from Inverurie, the opening of Laurencekirk station, the re-timetabling of other services and the bringing forward of work on Kintore station; believes that this incremental approach delivers early and cost-effective benefits to rail services across Aberdeen; recognises that the introduction of additional stops increases journey times and can, in certain circumstances, reduce the viability of services overall; welcomes the real progress being made by the Scottish Government after years of inaction, and looks forward to further rail investment in the north as announced in the Strategic Transport Projects Review." Supported by: John Swinney*
