S3M-3559*#* Kenneth Gibson: The Future of the Sunday Mail and Daily Record—That the Parliament notes with deep concern the decision of Trinity Mirror to merge the editorial content of the Daily Record and Sunday Mail with the loss of up to 30% of journalistic staff, based primarily in Glasgow and the West of Scotland; recognises that both newspapers are an integral part of Scottish culture and that to diminish their individual identities would be a serious blow to the diversity, vibrancy and quality of the Scottish media; believes that the loss of their separate identities would undoubtedly lead to the erosion of circulation at both titles, leading inevitably to further job losses; considers that Trinity Mirror is highly profitable and that there is no need to undertake such drastic restructuring, and therefore very much hopes that good sense may prevail over the future of two of Scotland’s leading titles.
