*S3M-5389# Marilyn Livingstone: Save Our Car Park Campaign, Kirkcaldy—That the Parliament supports the Save Our Car Park campaign in Kirkcaldy in which High Street retailers, members of the public, politicians and The Fife Free Press have rejected a proposal by Fife Council to build a local swimming pool on the busiest public car park serving Kirkcaldy High Street; considers that space restrictions on the site mean that the pool could not be extended to include fit-for-purpose dry sports facilities when funding became available; also considers that having the pool in this location will take away key car parking facilities for the town centre and will be detrimental to the work that has been done by retailers on the High Street to boost the local economy; further considers the overwhelming opposition to Fife Council’s decision, with campaigners collecting over 2,000 signatures in support; recognises that those opposing the choice of location include large and small town centre traders, shoppers, car park users, Kirkcaldy Area Sports Council, sports clubs, pool users and individuals throughout Kirkcaldy, and believes the scope of the consultation conducted by Fife Council to have been inadequate, as demonstrated through widespread public opposition to the decision.
