*S2M-4056 Christine Grahame: Abbotsford House - Home of Sir Walter Scott—That the Parliament notes the internationally recognised literary talent of Sir Walter Scott (1771-1832), author of novels, among others, such as Waverley, Guy Mannering, The Heart of Midlothian and Redgauntlet, and poems, such as the renowned "The Lady of the Lake", which in its day sold 25,000 copies in eight months; further recognises the historic significance of his home, Abbotsford House, built by him on the site of Cartleyhole farmhouse and completed in 1824, incorporating eclectic architectural features, such as a gateway from Linlithgow Palace, roof designs from Rosslyn Chapel, a mantelpiece from Melrose Abbey and oak panelling from the Auld Kirk in Dunfermline, and notes that he also landscaped the grounds; expresses concern that the house and its contents, which include such artefacts as Rob Roy’s gun, a lock of Bonnie Prince Charlie’s hair and Montrose’s sword, may be forced to close down in the next few years through lack of funding support, and calls on the Scottish Executive, in light of the house’s literary and historic significance and indeed as an asset to the Borders and Scottish tourist industry, to intervene now and work with concerned parties, including the National Trust, to ensure the preservation of both the house itself and the idiosyncratic collections which reflect the personality of this talented and romantic Scot.
