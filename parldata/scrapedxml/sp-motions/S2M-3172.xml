*S2M-3172 Carolyn Leckie: Support for an Independent Inquiry Into the Killing of Jean Charles de Menezesâ€”That the Parliament is extremely concerned to note the contents of the leaked documents relating to the Independent Police Complaints Commission investigation into the killing of Jean Charles de Menezes by persons under the command of the Metropolitan Police; is alarmed at the gross disparity between those details and those circulated by police in the immediate aftermath of the shooting; considers that there is such disparity that the veracity of the command structures of the police is in serious doubt and that confidence in the police to assume innocence until guilt is proven and to treat people accordingly has been seriously undermined; supports the de Menezes family in their pursuit for truth and justice and call for a full, open, independent inquiry, and believes that a criminal investigation must take place, as it would in any other case where a person is shot down in cold blood by individuals who are not employed by the state.
