 *S2M-789# Colin Fox: Scots Poet Laureate as National Burns Tribute-That the Parliament recognises that in Robert Burns, Scotland gave the world one of its finest poets and that his attraction to people the world over is in part due to the humanitarian values his work espoused; believes that it is time to consider a fitting national tribute, and considers therefore that a position of Scots Poet Laureate, elected each January, should be established to produce verses in the modern Scots tongue true to Burns' egalitarian beliefs to honour his enormous contribution to Scottish life.
