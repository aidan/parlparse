 *S3M-5551 Christina McKelvie: A New Campus for Motherwell College and a New Era for Ravenscraig—That the Parliament welcomes the official opening on Friday 15 January 2010 of Motherwell College’s new campus on the site of the former Ravenscraig steelworks; notes that the £70 million project provides state-of-the-art facilities for learners in Lanarkshire, including an automotive shop, a dance studio, training kitchens and an onsite nursery; congratulates the Motherwell College Board of Management, staff, students and College Principal, Hugh Logan, on the time and effort that they have put into the realisation of this inspiring learning environment; believes that the opening of the campus marks a milestone in the regeneration of the iconic Ravenscraig site, and looks forward to Motherwell College continuing to produce high quality graduates who have the skills and knowledge that Scotland needs to flourish in the years to come.
