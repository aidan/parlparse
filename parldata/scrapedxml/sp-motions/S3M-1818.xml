*S3M-1818 Aileen Campbell: Roads in the Clydesdale Area—That the Parliament congratulates Lesmahagow Community Council, Carluke Gazette and Lanarkshire-based businessman David Menzies on their campaign to improve the quality of roads in the Clydesdale area; believes that the number and size of potholes on key roads in the area is completely unacceptable, especially with a growing population and the importance of the road network for agricultural transport and tourist travel; welcomes South Lanarkshire Council’s long overdue decision to consider additional funds for road maintenance, and believes that such funds should be made available as a matter of urgency.
