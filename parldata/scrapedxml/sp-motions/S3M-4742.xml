*S3M-4742 Bill Kidd: The PATH (Scotland) Leadership Programme—That the Parliament welcomes the PATH (Scotland) Leadership Programme, which has been developed by PATH (Scotland) with funding from the Race, Religion and Refugee Integration Fund as a positive action measure to address the under-representation of black and minority ethnic (BME) communities in management roles; notes that this course is free to successful applicants and aims to examine power inequalities, the impact of racism on Scotland’s culture and the implications for people from BME communities while allowing participants to recognise and further develop their own skills and abilities as managers and leaders, and commends the work of PATH (Scotland) in tackling existing disadvantage because of colour, race, nationality or ethnic origin and in further promoting equality of opportunity for a fairer Scotland. Supported by: Hugh O’Donnell*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Aileen Campbell*, Christine Grahame*, Sandra White*
