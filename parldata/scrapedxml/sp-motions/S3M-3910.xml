*S3M-3910 Cathy Jamieson: National Osteoporosis Society Manifesto for Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the National Osteoporosis Society’s manifesto for Scotland; is concerned that osteoporosis is a long-term condition that is currently putting around 250,000 people in Scotland at risk of painful fractures, which are costly for the NHS to treat; notes that much can be done to prevent these fractures through the proper identification, treatment and care of people who have osteoporosis; considers that a fracture liaison service linked to every hospital that receives fragility fractures would ensure that every fragility fracture patient gets the treatment and care that they need; calls for coherent clinical guidance on the prevention, diagnosis and care of falls, fragility fractures and osteoporosis; also calls for the quality and systems of care for people at risk of falls, fragility fractures and osteoporosis to be measured on a regular basis to stimulate best practice; further calls for healthcare professionals working in primary care to be offered meaningful financial incentives to identify and treat people at a high risk of fragility fractures, and finally calls for measures to improve understanding of bone health among individuals of all ages and especially among children in primary and secondary school settings.
