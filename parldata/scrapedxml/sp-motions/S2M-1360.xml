*S2M-1360 Carolyn Leckie: Salute to the Nursery Nurses-That the Parliament salutes the struggle of nursery nurses, the majority of whom enter their 13th week of all-out indefinite action; is dismayed by the intransigence and lack of care displayed by COSLA, the individual local authorities and the Scottish Executive, despite the nursery nurses having an obviously just case and the spectre of thousands of children not receiving an education for over three months; believes that nursery nurses have demonstrated great dignity in the pursuit of their campaign, in direct contrast to their employers and the Executive who have treated them with contempt by refusing to use the power and means at their disposal that would have resolved this dispute without the costs incurred by nursery nurses, children and parents, and further believes that the Executive should take immediate steps to ensure that a national pay and grading structure is put in place for nursery nurses.
