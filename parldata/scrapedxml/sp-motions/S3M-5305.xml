*S3M-5305 Margaret Mitchell: Happy 10th Anniversary, PCG—That the Parliament congratulates the Professional Contractors Group (PCG) on the success of National Freelancers Day, held on 23 November 2009, which marks the 10th anniversary of the organisation; recognises that the PCG is an independent, not-for-profit, professional association with around 20,000 members from a wide range of sectors, including oil and gas, engineering, IT, management consultancy, marketing and telecommunications, many of them living, working and based in Scotland; pays tribute to the estimated £82 billion that the 1.4 million freelance workers contributed to the UK GDP in 2008, which represents an enormous contribution to the Scottish and UK economies; considers that freelancers provide a flexible and expert resource to businesses across a range of sectors, and calls on policymakers at all levels of government to ensure that the interests of Scotland’s freelancers are supported.
