*S1M-1591 Michael Russell: Mrs Helen Liddell—That the Parliament notes the appointment of Helen Liddell as what will presumably be the final Secretary of State for Scotland; regrets that the government continues to spend public money on an appointment that seems solely devoted to political campaigning for Labour; is relieved that Mrs Liddell will have no responsibility for education given that, during her previous tenure as Education Minister, she was considered by many to have alienated the entire Scottish teaching profession and to have added to the confusion surrounding the implementation of Higher Still, and calls upon the Minister for Education, Europe and External Affairs to do what he can to ensure that Mrs Liddell takes no role in, and expresses no opinion on, this and other devolved matters.
