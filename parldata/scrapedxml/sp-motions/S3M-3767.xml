 *S3M-3767 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Protect our Urban Villages—That the Parliament supports the campaigns established against the opening of a Sainsbury’s in Stockbridge and a Tesco in Broughton; is concerned about the impact that the opening of these stores would have on local retailers in the area; notes that both areas are already well served by larger supermarkets as well as a variety of quality local food retailers, and adds its backing to the local residents and businesses in these areas who are fighting to protect the future of their urban villages.
