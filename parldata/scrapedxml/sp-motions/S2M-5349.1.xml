*S2M-5349.1 Murdo Fraser: Post Officesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-5349) in the name of Mr John Swinney, after first "Government" insert "notes that decisions taken by the UK Government have themselves contributed to the losses being made by the post office network and that it is therefore disingenuous for ministers to justify the extensive scaling down of the network on the basis that it is losing money; believes that the UK Government should seek to bring new business opportunities to the network rather than merely manage its decline".
