 *S2M-1583 Robin Harper: ScottishPower, Salmon and North American Indian Tribal Nations-That the Parliament welcomes to Scotland a delegation of representatives from North American Indian tribal nations and US fishermen's and environmental organisations; recognises their quest to obtain justice from the Scottish-based multi-national, ScottishPower; backs their campaign to oblige ScottishPower to establish the highest environmental standards in its operation in North America; regards the damage done by dams now owned by ScottishPower on the River Klamath in California and Oregon, which have blocked 350 miles of historic salmon spawning grounds, as unacceptable; recognises that this damage has had a serious and detrimental impact on the native peoples' social, cultural and economic situations; regards ScottishPower's failure to include salmon restoration strategies in its future plans as a failure, and calls on ScottishPower to lead the way in taking active measures to reverse the decline in salmon numbers in what was once America's third greatest salmon river.
