*S3M-2141 Kenneth Gibson: "Campus Cops"—That the Parliament recognises the excellent work being carried out in schools throughout Scotland by "campus cops"; supports the view of Detective Chief Superintendent John Carnochan, Head of Strathclyde Police’s Violence Reduction Unit, that the role carried out by such officers is unique in its success in building stronger community relationships; is delighted that "campus cops" act as positive role models for some young people who may lack such figures in their lives; congratulates the work done by "campus cops" which, in some cases has resulted in as much as a 14% reduction in street crime such as vandalism, a reduction in pupil absence, truancy, staff absence, the number of young people getting into trouble with the police outside school hours and a reduction in bullying and an increase in attainment where they have been deployed; notes that "campus cops" interact with primary schools to carry out road traffic, anti-litter, anti-graffiti and stranger-danger work; understands that, where they have been deployed, "campus cops" can gather intelligence; and become an integral part of the school community in a way that is valued and respected by both staff and pupils, often assisting pupils with difficult home lives, and looks forward to the national evaluation which will undoubtedly echo preliminary evaluations and vindicate the vital role that "campus cops" play in Scottish schools in the 21st century. Supported by: Alasdair Allan*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Stuart McMillan*, Alex Neil*, Christina McKelvie*
