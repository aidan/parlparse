*S2M-4390 Shiona Baird: Increased Support for Home Renewables Needed—That the Parliament notes with concern the continuing freeze on grant funding by the Scottish Community and Householder Renewables Initiative (SCHRI); recognises that the continuing delay will inevitably have a negative effect on many Scottish companies registered to supply and install home renewables under the SCHRI, threatening jobs and foregoing employment opportunities; acknowledges the recent announcement of a £59.2 million fund for renewables and micro-renewables in Northern Ireland, a significantly more generous package than the funding hitherto available in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to act without delay to reinstate the SCHRI with increased funding sufficient to meet the growing demand for home renewables in Scotland and to restore confidence in the Scottish home renewables industry.
