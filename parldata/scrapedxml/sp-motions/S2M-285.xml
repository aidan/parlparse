*S2M-285 Rosie Kane: Bechtel and Britain's Nuclear Wasteâ€”That the Parliament condemns Her Majesty's Government's decision to involve the Bechtel Corporation in the establishment of Britain's nuclear waste Liabilities Management Agency; notes that this corporation has on at least four occasions penalised workers for exposing safety risks in its American nuclear plants; further notes that this corporation aided the construction of a chemical plant in Iraq prior to the first Gulf War; notes that Bechtel was proposed by Donald Rumsfeld to Saddam Hussein for the construction of an Iraqi pipeline, and in light of these points calls on Her Majesty's Government to reconsider its position with regard to the Bechtel Corporation's involvement in the safe handling of Britain's nuclear waste.
