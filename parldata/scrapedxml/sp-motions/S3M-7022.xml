*S3M-7022 John Wilson: Benefit Cuts to Mortgage Interest Paymentsâ€”That the Parliament condemns the announcement of a draft proposal to cut the payment of mortgage benefits; notes that the Department for Work and Pensions is suggesting cuts to mortgage interest payments by as much as 40%, and considers that this will have a detrimental impact on potentially 20,000 vulnerable homeowners in Scotland during a time of recession and would potentially add greater pressure on local authority waiting lists that are already struggling to keep up with increased demand.
