 S3M-4671 Aileen Campbell: Surviving the Recession, A Lesson from Scandinavia—That the Parliament notes the comments of Christian Ketels, economist at Harvard Business School and Stockholm School of Economics, in a recent Guardian newspaper article saying that Sweden, Denmark and Norway will return more quickly and in better shape economically than most countries in the world due in part to the tighter banking regulations put in place in those countries in the 1990s and their strong welfare and public sectors; notes with interest that Norway, due to its oil and gas revenues, currently possesses a sovereign wealth fund now worth 2.384 trillion Kroner (£228 billion), 1.4 times its GDP, and is able to stimulate its economy without having to cut public spending as the UK Government is set to do; believes that if an independent Scotland was in control of its oil and gas revenues and every other power that normal independent countries possess, Scotland would be facing a brighter economic future beside its Scandinavian counterparts than it does inside "bankrupt Britain", and welcomes the publication of the Scottish Government’s discussion paper, An Oil Fund for Scotland: Taking forward our National Conversation.
