 *S3M-2517 Bill Kidd: Nuclear Non-Proliferation Damaged—That the Parliament expresses concern over the decision of the Nuclear Suppliers’ Group (NSG) to approve the deal between the United States of America and India to conduct civilian atomic commerce while India retains its strategic weapons programme and is not required to sign the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty; considers this decision ironic given the fact that the NSG, formerly known as the London Suppliers’ Group, was set up to prevent atomic proliferation following India’s first underground nuclear explosion in 1974 and has, 34 years later, presided over Delhi being granted the very waiver its founding principles had opposed, and believes that this decision will encourage other countries to disregard international pressure in their desire to develop nuclear weapons.
