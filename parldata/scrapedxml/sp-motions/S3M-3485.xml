*S3M-3485 Brian Adam: ICE for Emergencies—That the Parliament welcomes the joint initiative by Grampian Police, Grampian Fire and Rescue and the Scottish Ambulance Service in their promotion of ICE, In Case of Emergency; notes the special contribution to emergency care by Bob Brotchie, a paramedic with East Anglian Ambulance Service, who first promoted this campaign; further notes that mobile phones are now carried by the majority of people and that, if an accident or emergency were to occur, having a next of kin’s phone number under the name ICE would mean that emergency service personnel or hospital staff could quickly contact a loved one or relative, who could be able to provide life saving information about the patient; believes that this simple action can save much angst and worry, and encourages everyone to store an ICE number in their phone.
