*S1M-1576 Mr Lloyd Quinan: MMR Triple Vaccine—That the Parliament acknowledges the research carried out by Dr Andrew Wakefield and the subsequent report in the medical journal, Adverse Drug Reactions; believes that this report and the fall in the current level of vaccines being administered requires immediate attention, and further believes that, until a full study is carried out into Autistic Spectrum Disorders and any possible link with the MMR vaccine, single vaccines should be made available as an alternative for parents and carers.
