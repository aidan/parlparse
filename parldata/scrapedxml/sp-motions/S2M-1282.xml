*S2M-1282# Irene Oldfather: Regulation of Care-That the Parliament expresses its shock and disappointment at the alleged abuse suffered by residents of nursing homes as detailed in recent newspaper reports; expresses concern at the apparent disregard of the appropriate vetting procedures on prospective care workers before commencing employment; notes that there are many private care companies providing care for elderly and disabled people, both in their own homes and in residential care homes; considers that such agencies should ensure that staff in their employment are appropriately trained for the tasks that they undertake; recognises, however, that the vast majority of care workers are suitably qualified and experienced and treat elderly and disabled people with the care, dignity and respect that they are rightly due; acknowledges that the Care Commission is responsible for regulating standards of care, and considers that the Scottish Executive should take measures to increase awareness amongst the general public of the National Care Standards and the Care Commission's role in monitoring adherence to these standards.
