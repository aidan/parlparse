 *S3M-7589 Mary Mulligan: The Historic Reopening of the Airdrie to Bathgate Rail Link—That the Parliament warmly welcomes the completion of the Airdrie to Bathgate rail link, the longest passenger route to be opened in Scotland for more than 100 years; commends the efforts of all involved in this project, in particular Network Rail, for delivering the project on time and on budget and the previous administration for what it considers was its vision; further notes what it believes will be the significant economic, environmental and social benefits that the line will bring for communities along the route in wider West Lothian, North Lanarkshire and across Scotland, and praises the local communities along the route for what it considers was their patience during the construction of the new line.
