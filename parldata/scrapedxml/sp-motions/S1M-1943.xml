*S1M-1943 Christine Grahame: The Disability Claim Form—That the Parliament notes that the 5th issue of Inform, Citizens Advice Scotland’s Quarterly Social Policy Briefing, identifies social security benefits as the biggest category of problems dealt with by bureaux, with 133,272 enquiries; further notes that, of these, disability benefits amounted to 20,244 enquiries, income support 16,524 and housing benefit 12,274; recognises that disability benefits are a particular concern because of the complexity of the form and because decisions are sometimes contradictory, leading to some entitlement being removed altogether; notes that applicants may be charged up to £40 by their GP for a medical assessment; notes that the complexity of the application system is evidenced by the 10,510 repeat enquiries which bureaux dealt with in this area; commends the citizens advice service on representing 638 clients at disability appeals tribunals, two thirds of which had positive outcomes, and urges the Scottish Executive, against this background, to make representations to Her Majesty’s Government requesting that the application system be reformed without delay.
