*S3M-1325 Bill Kidd: Averting Humanitarian Disaster in Afghanistan—That the Parliament welcomes Oxfam’s report of January 2008, Afghanistan: Development and Humanitarian Priorities, outlining the need for urgent action to address immediate challenges in Afghanistan and to avert humanitarian disaster, and particularly notes the recommendations, with respect to narcotics, that the Afghan government and donors should support a long-term, multi-sectoral approach which above all seeks to achieve sustainable rural development and, with regard to peace-building, that it be approached in a way that is participatory and bottom-up, that strengthens community capacities to resolve disputes and conflicts, developing trust and social cohesion within and between communities, and that promotes inter-ethnic and inter-group dialogue.
