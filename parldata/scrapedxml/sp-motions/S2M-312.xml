 *S2M-312# Fiona Hyslop: Post Office Card Accounts Failure to Recognise Scottish Bank Holidays-That the Parliament deplores the operation of the post office card accounts which allows double payment to be paid into card accounts to cover post office closures for English bank holidays but fails to recognise the operation of Scottish bank holidays; recognises that the traditional system of payment book and cash account operation by individual post offices coped easily with Scottish and local holidays, and notes that the new system, unless altered to cater for Scottish holidays, acts as yet another disincentive for Scottish customers to use post office card accounts to support their local post office.
