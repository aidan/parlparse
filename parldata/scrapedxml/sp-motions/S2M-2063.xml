 *S2M-2063 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Scotland’s Decisions Must be Made in Scotland’s Parliament—That the Parliament regrets the continual use of Sewel motions which curtails parliamentary scrutiny on issues of great importance to the people of Scotland; recognises that the Scottish Parliament is the right forum for discussion and scrutiny for all matters devolved to it; notes that Lord Sewel, who proposed this mechanism, admitted that this convention was set up to deal solely with "minor, non-controversial" issues yet, since 1999, there have been 51 Sewel motions involving such serious issues as asylum law, higher education and the law reform bill, and looks forward to Sewel motions no longer being used as a method of avoiding parliamentary scrutiny and to a full debate and vote on issues mentioned in the recent Queen’s Speech that have particular relevance to Scotland.
