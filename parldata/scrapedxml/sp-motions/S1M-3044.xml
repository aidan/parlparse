*S1M-3044# Helen Eadie: Westfield Development Proposals-That the Parliament applauds the Scottish Executive's determination to produce an effective and sustainable National Waste Strategy and the First Minister's support for "environmental justice" principles; notes that environmental justice principles were promoted by Dr Robert Bullard following a study of waste disposal in the USA; considers that Dr Bullard's conclusions highlighted the fact that the poorest areas of a nation carried the major burden of "toxic pollution"; further notes that, in any implementation plans for recycling and waste disposal, the poorest and most deprived communities should not become "dumping grounds" for other major areas of Scotland; expresses concern at potential health issues, and regrets that current proposals for Fife's Westfield Recycling initiative by Alba will have major adverse implications for the surrounding towns and villages as a result of heavily increased road traffic pressurising in an unacceptable way already over-committed local authority roads budgets, further endangering numerous weak bridges scattered right across Fife, adding new traffic volumes to an already severely congested Forth Rail Bridge and causing unacceptably high levels of noise pollution and diminished air quality and visual amenity to a countryside that has the potential for a major green-field project similar to the widely acclaimed land restoration project at Lochore Meadows, which has been in place for more than 20 years and was a former major pit bing site.
