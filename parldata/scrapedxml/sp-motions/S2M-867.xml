*S2M-867 Shiona Baird: Recycling Figures-That the Parliament deplores the disappointing figures on waste and rates of recycling published by Audit Scotland on 5 February 2004; notes the very poor overall increase in recycling and composting rates; is concerned by the fact that 200,000 tonnes more of Scotland's waste has gone to landfill in the last year than in the previous year; urges the Scottish Executive to show the necessary leadership to local authorities to ensure that they dramatically increase the amount of kerbside recycling and composting currently carried out in order to reach the target of 25% by 2006, and calls on the Scottish Executive to move immediately to adopt a policy of zero waste, with timetables, in order to stem the flow of waste being produced.
