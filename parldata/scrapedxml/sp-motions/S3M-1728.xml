 *S3M-1728 Patrick Harvie: Scotland’s Approach to Biofuel—That the Parliament recognises the urgency of the climate change issue and understands that this urgency has driven international moves to back biofuels; however, notes the Losing Ground report published by Friends of the Earth and LifeMosaic which sets out the social and environmental costs often associated with biofuel plantations in the developing world; acknowledges the concerns of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds and others that wholesale moves to biofuel crops can jeopardise biodiversity both overseas through loss of rainforest and in Scotland through economic pressures leading to loss of field margins and reduced set-aside land; further notes the comments from the UK’s Chief Scientific Adviser that the current approach to biofuels is insufficiently sustainable; recognises that Scottish-grown biofuel crops are often transported significant distances for processing, leading to increased carbon emissions; notes the risk to food prices at home and abroad associated with increased use of agricultural land for fuel crops, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that Scottish measures to comply with the Renewable Transport Fuel Obligation are consistent with real cuts in carbon emissions and with both social justice and economic sustainability in Scotland and across the developing world.
