 *S3M-6471 Christine Grahame: Supermarket Boycott of Israeli Produce—That the Parliament supports calls for peaceful direct action to be taken against the state of Israel for what is considered its ongoing flagrant disregard for international law and failure to uphold international standards of behaviour in its efforts to destabilise the entire Middle East region through its actions and policies; supports calls for a complete withdrawal of Israeli produce from Tesco, Asda, the Co-operative, Marks and Spencer, Sainsbury’s, Somerfield and Waitrose and considers that Scots consumers can make a real difference by refusing to purchase Israeli produce from these UK-based companies, and calls on those supermarket chains to refuse to buy produce from Israel until it has demonstrated its commitment to peace and the rule of law.
