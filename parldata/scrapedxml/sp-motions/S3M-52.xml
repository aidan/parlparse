*S3M-52 Jamie Hepburn: Cumbernauld and Kilsyth Area Committee—That the Parliament notes the decision of North Lanarkshire Council to re-establish its north area committee and north area partnership; further notes that a proposal was unsuccessfully presented to establish a Cumbernauld and Kilsyth area committee; believes that Cumbernauld and Kilsyth is a distinct part of the North Lanarkshire area, with neither community a part of Lanarkshire historically, and was formerly a local authority area in its own right; further notes that the other area committees established in North Lanarkshire cover much smaller populations and that Cumbernauld is the most populated town in the local authority area; considers that it would be in the best interests of Cumbernauld and Kilsyth if they either formed a distinctive area committee or had an area committee for each community, and calls on North Lanarkshire Council to reconsider its decision.
