*S1M-2512 Mr Gil Paterson: Breaking the Organised Child Sex Ringsâ€”That the Parliament recognises that well organised and financed people are systematically abusing children in the sex trade using games, alcohol and drugs to groom and coerce children into sex rings who are then exploited, degraded and abused by paedophile adults for money and calls on the Scottish Executive to resource the police to allow them to set up a task force to combat child abuse in the sex trade, tackle the provision of children for sex and paying for sex with children by adults and target crimes against children on the internet in order to ensure a course of action is followed that will break organised child sex rings and bring the perpetrators of child sex abuse to justice.
