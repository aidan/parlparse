*S3M-2296 Kenneth Gibson: Glasgow East By-Election—That the Parliament condemns the Labour Party for its decision to call the Glasgow East by-election on 24 July 2008 in the middle of the Glasgow Fair, when Glaswegians are traditionally on holiday; is aware that such a decision will disenfranchise thousands of voters who will be unable to secure a postal or proxy vote in a constituency that already has a history of low electoral turnouts; believes that Labour’s decision to call the by-election so quickly is due to a chronic fear of the SNP winning one of its safest seats; considers that calling a by-election so swiftly does not allow voters time to effectively assess the merits of individual candidates and policies, and is of the view that for the democratic process to work effectively by-elections should be held not less than eight weeks after the writ is moved. Supported by: Stuart McMillan*, Keith Brown*, Christina McKelvie*
