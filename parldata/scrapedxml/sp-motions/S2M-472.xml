 *S2M-472# Carolyn Leckie: Closure and Rationalisation of Maternity Services—That the Parliament is extremely concerned at the increasing numbers of proposed closures of maternity hospitals and rationalisations of maternity services with consultations held in isolation and without reference to cross-boundary and pan-Scotland impact; notes that claimed benefits of centralisation in relation to morbidity and mortality are unproven; is concerned that there are no minimum standards for staffing establishments of midwives across the service and that models for calculating staff numbers and ratios are outdated and outmoded; notes that expectations of staff by the public and demands of government have increased dramatically over the years which has created more work for all staff providing maternity services despite a declining birth rate, and considers that the Scottish Executive should implement a moratorium on maternity closures and conduct a review of the provision of maternity services across Scotland that involves the public and all trade union and professional organisations with the aim of establishing agreed minimum staffing establishments in a safe, co-ordinated service that meets the needs of all women and families across the whole of Scotland and maintains the expertise and excellence already established in the provision of these services.
