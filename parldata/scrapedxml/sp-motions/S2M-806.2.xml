*S2M-806.2 Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Comprehensive Programme of Education Reforms-As an amendment to motion (S2M-806) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from first "and" to end and insert " for school education, but believes that the Scottish Executive's reform programme for school education is insufficient to deal with the inherent problems thrown up by Scotland's comprehensive system and that the Scottish educational system needs radical reform, and would therefore support any visit by the Minister for Education and Young People to New Zealand in order that he can be inspired by New Zealand's devolved and diverse system, where, for the last 16 years under Labour and Conservative governments, schools have been managed by local school boards and parents have chosen the schools that their children attend, similar to the schools passport policy advocated by Scottish Conservatives."
