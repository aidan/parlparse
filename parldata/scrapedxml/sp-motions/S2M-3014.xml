 *S2M-3014 Mr Mark Ruskell: European Greenhouse Gas Emissions - No Cause for Celebration—That the Parliament notes with grave concern the new report by the European Environment Agency, Annual European Community greenhouse gas inventory 1990-2003 and inventory report 2005, which shows that European greenhouse gas emissions are rising; further notes that European countries which accept the need for urgent action on climate change but are failing to reduce their own greenhouse gas emissions have little moral authority to negotiate emissions reductions with the United States of America (USA); believes that, in advance of the G8 summit, a commitment to more serious action by all nations in Europe is vital so that maximum pressure can be applied on the G8 countries, and especially the USA; acknowledges that it is the poorest countries which will be hit hardest by droughts, water shortages, crop losses, major storm events, flooding and disease, and strongly believes that Scotland should show a lead by committing itself to reducing greenhouse gas emissions as a matter of urgency.
