 *S3M-1848.3 Jim Tolson: Meeting Scotland’s Housing Needs—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1848) in the name of Johann Lamont, insert at end "regrets that after two parliamentary debates on the subject since the budget was passed, the Scottish Government has still failed to come forward with clear figures on its housing plans across all sector and tenure types including the number of affordable rented houses to be built from 2008 to 2011, and has further failed to produce a clear trajectory for how it intends to meet its commitment to abolish unintentional homelessness by 2012; calls for improved energy efficiency to be a key objective in plans for new housing, and opposes the Scottish Government’s proposals for large scale procurement put forward in Firm Foundations."
