 *S3M-35 Iain Gray: Cleaner Coal Technology Feasibility Study—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by ScottishPower of a feasibility study into converting Cockenzie and Longannet power stations to cleaner coal technology; welcomes the fact that investment in new supercritical turbines and boilers could cut carbon emissions at the two stations by 20%; notes the flexibility that coal-fired plants provide as part of a diverse energy mix, and welcomes the consideration of extended life-spans for Cockenzie and Longannet, which could secure continuing employment for hundreds of skilled workers in East Lothian and Fife and help to maintain those counties’ contribution to Scotland’s baseload energy needs and address climate change. Supported by: Pauline McNeill*, Kenneth Gibson*, Claire Baker*, Charlie Gordon*, Brian Adam*, John Park*, Rhona Brankin*
