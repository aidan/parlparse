*S2M-5439 Shona Robison: Protect the Use of Xolair for Asthma Sufferers—That the Parliament regrets the decision by the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) not to recommend the use of Xolair for people with severe allergic asthma; notes that, for 90% of people with asthma, their asthma symptoms should be controllable if they are on the right levels of existing asthma drugs but, for those who have difficult-to-control asthma and continue to experience poor quality of life and continuous symptoms, Xolair is the only treatment that may be able to reduce the impact of asthma on their lives by reducing symptoms and hospitalisation; notes that Xolair has been shown to reduce emergency admissions to hospital, reduce asthma exacerbations, improve lung function and improve quality of life, and urges the SMC to reconsider its decision not to recommend Xolair in Scotland, a drug which has been described by Donna Covey, Chief Executive of Asthma UK, as "the only hope that some people in Scotland currently have."
