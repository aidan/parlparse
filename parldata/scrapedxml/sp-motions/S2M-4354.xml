*S2M-4354 Pauline McNeill: Official Opening of British Heart Foundation Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre—That the Parliament warmly welcomes the official opening by Her Royal Highness the Princess Royal of the British Heart Foundation (BHF) Glasgow Cardiovascular Research Centre at the University of Glasgow on 25 April 2006; congratulates the BHF and the university for co-ordinating a fundraising effort that generated £12 million in donations from more than 1,200 donors, including a core gift of £5 million from the BHF; notes that the establishment of the centre will bring together numerous diverse areas of cardiovascular research in one world-leading facility in Glasgow; remains aware that, in spite of the significant progress that has been made in reducing premature mortality from heart and circulatory disease in Scotland in the last decade, the west of Scotland still has a disproportionately high level of premature death associated with these conditions, especially in its most deprived communities; is encouraged that the presence of the centre in Glasgow will position the city as a crucial and integral part of finding solutions to tackle coronary heart disease as a cause of premature death in the west of Scotland and throughout Scotland, the United Kingdom and the world, and wishes Centre Director, Professor Anna Dominiczak, and her team every success for the future.
