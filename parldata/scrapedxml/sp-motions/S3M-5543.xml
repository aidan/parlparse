S3M-5543 Dave Thompson: Decision to Close the Beechwood House DP—That the Parliament notes with dismay the decision to close the designated place (DP) at Beechwood House in Inverness, which, for 19 years, has been open to over 900 referrals annually by the police, the NHS and other agencies for people struggling with the impact of alcohol; notes that the Beechwood House DP provides, as an alternative to police custody, a safe place for recovery and rehabilitation for those deemed drunk and incapable and is one of only two in the whole of Scotland, of which the HM Inspectorate of Constabulary for Scotland thematic inspection report of October 2008, Medical Services for people in police custody, noted "Throughout the Scottish police service both are considered to be examples of good practice that could usefully be extended across Scotland."; considers that the decision by the Highland Alcohol and Drugs Partnership to remove support from the Beechwood House DP without identifying any alternative options will have a dramatic knock-on effect on the NHS and on the police service, which will be forced to use police cells and other resources to manage drunk and incapable people who need only a safe place to recover, and, finally, calls on the board of NHS Highland, which received a 45% increase in funding in 2009-10 (to £2,267,711) to deal with alcohol misuse, to now urgently consider taking responsibility for the DP as recommended in the 2009 Scottish Government report, Managing the Needs of Drunk and Incapable People in Scotland: a Literature Review and Needs Assessment.
