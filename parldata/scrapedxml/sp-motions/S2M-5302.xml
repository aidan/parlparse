*S2M-5302 Robin Harper: Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Bill - Removal of Part 3—That the Parliament urges the Scottish Executive to remove Part 3 of the Protection of Vulnerable Groups (Scotland) Bill to allow for full consultation; agrees that there are likely unintended consequences of a statutory duty to share child protection information, including reluctance to access services, information overload and unnecessary invasion of privacy; acknowledges the problems that could be caused by the wide definition of harm, lack of scope for professional discretion and lack of provision for informed consent; agrees that there is no significant reason for rushing through this legislative duty and that a legal duty without training to recognise and act on relevant information will not be effective in protecting children, and recommends that Part 3, "Sharing Child Protection Information", be removed from the Bill and that the Executive should be encouraged to research, consult and consider in more depth the best way to ensure that agencies share appropriate information.
