*S2M-2469 Tommy Sheridan: Drop Charges Against Martin Gleesonâ€”That the Parliament notes the decision of Greater Manchester Police to prosecute Oldham Trades Council leader and Amicus trade union activist, Martin Gleeson, for criminal damage for placing a wreath on top of one previously laid by the fascist British National Party (BNP) during Holocaust Memorial Day in Oldham; recognises that the fascist BNP propaganda seeks to deny the Holocaust; believes that removing or covering a wreath laid by this deeply offensive and racist party does not constitute criminal damage but is the reasonable action of any committed anti-fascist, anti-racist and trade union member, and calls for charges against Martin Gleeson to be dropped immediately and the fascist and racist character of the BNP to be exposed at every opportunity.
