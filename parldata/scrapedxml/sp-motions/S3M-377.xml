 *S3M-377 John Scott: Fair Pay for Police—That the Parliament notes the fair pay for police campaign; regrets that reconciliation talks between the Official Side and Staff Side of the Police Negotiating Board have failed to reach an agreed pay settlement and notes that the matter of a pay settlement will now be referred to the Police Arbitration Tribunal; further notes that the settlement proposed by the Official Side represents a real terms reduction in pay, and urges the Scottish Executive, through its membership of the Police Negotiating Board, to press for a fair pay agreement which recognises the hard work of Scotland’s police officers on behalf of the public.
