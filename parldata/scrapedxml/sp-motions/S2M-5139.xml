*S2M-5139 Dave Petrie: Congratulations to the Inverness Streetwork Projectâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the Streetwork Project in Inverness for the award it has received from Highland Council for the work it does in the city giving advice and support to homeless people; recognises the invaluable contribution which voluntary organisations such as Streetwork make in respect of the alleviation of homelessness; further recognises the need to increase the autonomy and financial security of the voluntary sector as a whole; recognises that homelessness has risen by 19% since 1999, and calls on the Scottish Executive to focus on effectively reversing this trend and to promote initiatives such as Streetwork in Inverness in other local authority areas throughout Scotland in a bid to provide the support necessary to ease the devastating homelessness figures which Scotland experiences.
