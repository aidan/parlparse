 *S1M-3078.1 Nicola Sturgeon: Action to Recruit, Retain and Value Nurses-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3078) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end "; notes that a newly registered nurse's salary, at Â£16,005, is 9.7% less than that of a newly qualified police constable and 11% less than that of a qualified teacher; believes that addressing low pay levels is central to addressing the problem of recruiting and retaining nurses; further welcomes the work of the Scottish Integrated Workforce Planning Group, and notes that the development of an adequately resourced workforce planning strategy is essential if NHS employers are to offer nurses the flexible working patterns and meaningful career paths that they are entitled to expect from a 21st century employer and that will enable them to continue working in the NHS."
