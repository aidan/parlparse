 S3M-4682 Pauline McNeill: Burma Court Finds Aung San Suu Kyi Guilty—That the Parliament expresses its deep concern at the news that Burmese pro-democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi has been sentenced to 18 months of house arrest; notes that Ms Suu Kyi, a Nobel peace laureate, has spent nearly 14 of the last 20 years in detention following her National League for Democracy (NLD) party’s victory in the 1990 elections and that the NLD was never allowed to take power; further notes the international condemnation of the sentence and the belief that the verdict is designed to prevent Ms Suu Kyi from taking part in next year’s planned multi-party elections, and calls on the international community to continue to apply pressure on Burma’s military junta in order that human rights and democracy can properly flourish in the country.
