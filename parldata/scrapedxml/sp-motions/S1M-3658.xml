*S1M-3658# Cathie Craigie: Creating Linguistic Access for Deaf and Deafblind People—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Scottish Association of Sign Language Interpreters Training Strategy Group' s report, Creating Linguistic Access for Deaf and Deafblind People: A Strategy for Scotland; notes the report’s findings that deaf people are currently excluded from many aspects of everyday life in Scotland because of a lack of linguistic access and that the chief barriers to inclusion are (a) a lack of personnel with appropriate linguistic skills including a lack of British Sign Language/English Interpreters, tutors of British Sign Language and lipspeakers, (b) a lack of resources and materials, and (c) the lack of awareness and understanding of the relevant linguistic issues among employers, service providers and local and national government personnel; further notes the recommendation of the report that, to bring about change, a long-term integrated strategy is needed with collaboration between the statutory and voluntary sector, and considers that the Scottish Executive should work with key deaf organisations to establish a Scottish Centre for Deaf Studies.
