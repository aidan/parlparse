 *S2M-919 Brian Adam: Aberdeen Social Work Funding Crisis-That the Parliament recognises that Aberdeen City Council spends £3.077 million more on community care than it receives in grant aided expenditure (GAE) and also spends £10.145 million more on care of children than it receives in GAE; notes that Aberdeen City Council now ranks 32nd out of 32 local authorities in terms of central government grant per head of population, and calls on the Scottish Executive to provide Aberdeen City Council with the funding that it needs and deserves to provide social care for its most at risk citizens.
