*S3M-6297 Kenneth Gibson: Faroe Islands Shame—That the Parliament condemns what it considers the barbaric, cruel and wholly unnecessary behaviour of certain communities in the Faroe Islands that annually take part in the brutal culling of Calderon dolphins and believes that the bloody and inhumane slaying of these intelligent animals is completely unnecessary on the grounds of food production; understands that the Faroe Islands are prosperous and that islanders have a more stable source of food than in previous generations and considers that there is no possible justification for this behaviour in the 21st century; acknowledges that the meat from these animals is potentially harmful to islanders due to the presence of toxins; further recognises that this practice has been roundly condemned internationally by many organisations, including Greenpeace, and believes that the Faroese Parliament, the Løgting, should act to prevent this dreadful tradition from happening in future.
