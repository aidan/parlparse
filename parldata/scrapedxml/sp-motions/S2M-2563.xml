 * S2M-2563 Jackie Baillie:Helensburgh Blossom Festival, 23 and 24 April 2005—That the Parliament welcomes the creation of Helensburgh’s first Blossom Festival, which will take place on 23 and 24 April 2005; recognises that the festival follows in the Japanese tradition of Hanami, or flower viewing, and celebrates the beautiful 200-year-old Clyde coast town’s large and stunning display of cherry blossom trees along with other distinctive trees; notes that the theme of the festival is “Japan-Scotland”, chosen because of the benefits from this year’s EU-Japan Year of People to People Exchange; further notes that the People Exchange programme has given funds and support to the festival, including Japanese Consul, Takahashi, to open the festival; recognises that all things oriental will be brought together with Scottish traditions at the festival, including tea ceremonies, Mugenkyo Taiko drumming and Scottish bagpipes, a food trader’s market, with sushi, saki and whisky, and origami and ikebana demonstrations which form part of the various festival activities taking place around Helensburgh, and congratulates the organisers on their efforts to put Helensburgh firmly on the tourist map.
