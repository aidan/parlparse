 *S3M-3637 John Lamont: Bethany Christian Trustâ€”That the Parliament applauds the difficult but rewarding work carried out by Bethany Christian Trust for homeless and vulnerable people throughout Scotland; notes that the Care Shelter provides emergency accommodation in Edinburgh for people who need somewhere to sleep during the winter months; further notes that the Care Shelter provided a bed and meal for around 500 homeless people in 2007-08; recognises that this work is reliant on the support of hundreds of volunteers and dozens of churches that are integral to the running of the shelter, and urges MSPs to consider supporting the Bethany Trust in this vital work.
