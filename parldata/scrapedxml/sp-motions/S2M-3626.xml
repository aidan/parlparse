*S2M-3626&lt;&gt; Cathy Peattie: 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence—That the Parliament congratulates all those involved in the 16 Days of Activism Against Gender Violence Campaign; notes that, since 1991, approximately 1,700 organizations in 130 countries have participated in the 16 days campaign; notes that the theme of this year’s campaign is “For the Health of Women, For the Health of the World: No More Violence”, and believes that, while in recent years much has been done in Scotland to increase awareness and improve and extend services, including broadening the focus of the Scottish Executive’s strategy to encompass all forms of violence against women, there is clearly still much to do in all these respects, both within Scotland and as part of the international movement for the elimination of violence against women. Supported by: Jackie Baillie*, Marlyn Glen*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Bruce Crawford*, Frances Curran*, Irene Oldfather*, Bill Butler* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
