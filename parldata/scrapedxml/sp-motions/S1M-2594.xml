*S1M-2594 Mr Andrew Welsh: Nuclear Test Veterans-That the Parliament welcomes last month's ruling by the Pensions Appeal Tribunal on Tom Duggan, a nuclear test veteran who served in the armed forces during Britain's first A-bomb programme on Christmas Island in 1958 and contracted lymphatic cancer following exposure to radiation; notes that the tribunal's decision could finally prove to be the decisive case that overturns decades of claims by Her Majesty's Government that the Christmas Island explosions could not have harmed British servicemen; further notes the Ministry of Defence's refusal to grant funding to a test pioneered at Dundee University that would determine the effects of radiation on servicemen, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to demand justice for all test veterans and take action where Her Majesty's Government has failed by granting the £300,000 necessary to carry out these tests.
