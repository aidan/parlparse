*S2M-326# Margaret Mitchell: Private Escorting of Abnormal Loads-That the Parliament recognises the importance to the Scottish economy of the ability of the haulage industry to safely and efficiently transport abnormal loads on Scotland's road network; notes the present difficulties being experienced by the industry in relation to the operation of police escorts for HGVs carrying abnormal loads; believes that the use of private escorting services which operate in parts of England would improve the efficiency of the haulage industry and reduce the burden on our police force, and considers that the Scottish Executive should facilitate this in consultation with chief constables, police boards and Her Majesty's Government.
