*S3M-5396 Christina McKelvie: Rethink Afghanistan—That the Parliament notes the recent screening at Edinburgh’s Filmhouse of campaigning filmmaker Robert Greenwald’s acclaimed real-time documentary, Rethink Afghanistan, which is also available to watch for free online at www.rethinkafghanistan.com; further notes that the film’s makers have interviewed Afghan MPs, women’s groups, peace campaigners, members of the armed forces and others on the ground in Afghanistan with the aim of informing and redirecting political thinking about the purpose and objectives of the intervention in Afghanistan; further notes that the war in Afghanistan has now lasted for over eight years and has claimed the lives of over 230 UK troops and an estimated 7,000 Afghan civilians, and calls on the UK Government to rethink the United Kingdom’s role in Afghanistan, the objectives of the intervention and the timescale within which the government believes that these goals will be achieved.
