*S1M-1251# Mr Kenneth Gibson: Discrimination Against Teaching Centres of Artistic Excellence-That the Parliament notes the decision of the Department for Education and Employment to introduce Dance and Drama Awards for students to study at institutions in England and Wales; is aware that Scottish students compete on equal terms for places at such institutions with their counterparts from other parts of the United Kingdom and the European Union (EU); is concerned that tuition fees are only paid if students study in England and Wales and regrets that no parallel funding scheme exists for students who wish to study in Scotland; believes that this discrimination against Scottish institutions can only harm them and in the case of Ballet West may force it out of business or to relocate from Taynuilt to outwith Scotland, to the detriment of the local economy and employment; notes that Ballet West attracts students from across the United Kingdom, the EU and as far afield as Guatemala, Japan and Malaysia and outperforms competitor schools from south of the border in ballet competitions and quality of training; is puzzled by the Minister for Children and Education's view that "there is no evidence of significant demand for Dance and Drama training for young people aged 16 and over in Scotland" when 613 applications were received by Ballet West for 23 places; regrets that 34 students withdrew or rejected offers from Ballet West due to lack of funding, compared with only two students doing so at English institutions; notes that the Excellence Fund supports and encourages talented secondary school dancers in Scotland but that the only progression into tertiary training encouraged by the Scottish Executive is in England; is concerned that Scotland will become denuded of teaching centres of artistic excellence and be drained of artistic talent as a result of this discrimination; believes that the current position of the Scottish Executive on this issue contradicts its own cultural strategy that has as its key themes "widening opportunities, promoting education, developing and celebrating excellence", and believes that the Scottish Executive should act in order that students from across the UK can choose where to study dance, drama or stage management based on the quality of course offered rather than on whether or not tuition fees will be paid.
