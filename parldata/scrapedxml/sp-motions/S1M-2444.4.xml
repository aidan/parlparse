*S1M-2444.4 Robin Harper: The Executive's Vision for the Protection and Promotion of Scotland's Natural Heritage—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2444) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "notes" to end and insert "calls upon the Executive to publish a draft Bill on this issue before the end of 2001 with a view to legislation being enacted before July 2002; notes the widespread support for this proposed reform and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to set up a working group, which includes members of the Transport and the Environment Committee, non-governmental organisations and other experts as a matter of urgency to co-ordinate the drafting and wider consultation on the Bill; agrees that the improved protection of nature requires a combination of both new legislation and integrated land use policies and incentives currently being developed by the Executive; further notes that the protection of Scotland’s natural heritage will require the practice of environmentally sustainable development to be applied across all departments of the Executive, and, to that end, calls for the Ministerial Group on Sustainable Scotland and the Executive’s Sustainable Development Unit to be given a central role within the Executive and for the re-instatement of a dedicated Environment Minister with responsibility for championing sustainable development."
