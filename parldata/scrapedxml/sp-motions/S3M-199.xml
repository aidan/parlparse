*S3M-199 Mary Scanlon: Moray Firth Flotilla, 24 to 29 June 2007—That the Parliament supports the efforts of the organisers of the first ever flotilla of ancient craft from Wick to Portsoy which will involve 34 vessels, some of which are restored 19th and early 20th century fishing boats, and dozens of following yachts; notes that they will be greeted by an estimated 25,000 visitors who will follow the fleet, which departs from Wick on Sunday 24 June 2007 and calls at Lybster, Helmsdale, Cromarty and Buckie before arriving at Portsoy on Friday 29 June, signalling the start of the 14th Scottish Traditional Boat Festival; further notes the long voyages made by vessels coming from Norway, the Faroe Islands and the south of England and the estimated £5 million boost that this event will provide to the local economy, and acknowledges that the festival is expected to be the biggest maritime event in Europe this year.
