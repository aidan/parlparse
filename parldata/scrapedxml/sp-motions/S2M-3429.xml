 *S2M-3429 Robin Harper: PPP Schools Projects and the Loss of Open Space in Scotlandâ€”That the Parliament recognises the report from the Holmhills Wood Community Park Action Group on PPP school modernisation projects and the loss of open space in Scotland; expresses concern at the figures showing possibly over a hundred open community spaces in the process of being lost, or already lost; expresses alarm at the lack of reliable information available from local authorities, in particular that 29 out of 32 authorities hold no collated records of information on loss of open space and only five authorities were able to provide any information at all on open space loss over the last six years; notes the lack of auditing, failures of the planning system, failures of the statutory consultation system, failure of the Scottish Executive to effectively monitor PPP projects in relation to loss of open space and failure of the procurement document for PPP schools to make any mention of environmental sustainability, and calls on the Executive to institute a moratorium on all PPP schools projects still in the planning stage, or proposed, until such time as a proper audit of open space loss has taken place and strict new guidelines have been issued to all Scottish local authorities on future and present PPP schools projects, especially in relation to open spaces and environmental sustainability.
