*S2M-5134 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Keeping Young People Off the Streetsâ€”That the Parliament agrees that it is vital to keep young people off the streets and provide activities that build their confidence and self-esteem and let them see that there are many ways to enjoy themselves, other than drug and alcohol misuse, and further agrees that the project, funded by Gretna Football Club and run by the First Base Agency in Dumfries, which provides football training for all over 16-year-olds and under-16s is the kind of model that should be funded by the Scottish Executive and rolled out across Scotland.
