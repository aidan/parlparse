*S3M-2422Margaret Curran:£42 Million of Cuts by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde—That the Parliament notes with deep concern the proposed £42 million of cuts by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde; further notes the comments of Finance Director, Douglas Griffin, in a letter to senior officials that such drastic measures are required as the SNP government’s NHS funding settlement for 2008-09 is "significantly lower" than in previous years; is particularly concerned at the impact that such large-scale cuts could have on front-line patient care; condemns the SNP government for its apparent refusal to match the NHS spending increases of both the UK Government for England over the current budget review period and the year-on-year spending increases by the previous Labour-led Scottish Executive, and calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to step in and provide sufficient funding to ensure that Scotland’s sick and infirm are not made to pay for the Scottish National Party’s poor sense of priorities in government.
