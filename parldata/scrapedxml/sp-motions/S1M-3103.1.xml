 *S1M-3103.1 Tommy Sheridan: The Golden Jubilee-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3103) in the name of Mr Jack McConnell, leave out from "congratulates" to end and insert "believes that the position of Her Majesty the Queen and the monarchy represent the worst excesses of the extreme inequality of wealth and power which undermine society as a whole; calls on Her Majesty the Queen to pay full inheritance tax on the estate left to her by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, and believes that Scotland's future is as an independent republic where the people are sovereign and are recognised as citizens, not subjects as is the case currently under our archaic and outdated monarchy arrangement."
