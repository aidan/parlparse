 *S2M-3127 Sarah Boyack: Unveiling of Plaque in Honour of John Miller CE FRSE—That the Parliament welcomes the unveiling of a commemorative plaque at Haymarket station in tribute to Scottish railway pioneer, John Miller, on the occasion of the bicentenary of his birth on 26 July, presented by the Institution of Civil Engineers; notes that Miller engineered most of Scotland’s early main lines, including the first cross-border line and the Edinburgh to Glasgow line for which Haymarket was the capital’s terminus; congratulates Professor Roland Paxton of Heriot-Watt University on his efforts to secure the recognition Miller deserves as one of the outstanding British railway engineers, and calls on all stakeholders to honour his legacy by continuing improvements to make Haymarket a modern, accessible transport hub fit for the 21st century.
