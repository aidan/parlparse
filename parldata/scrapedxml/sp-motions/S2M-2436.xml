*S2M-2436 Christine Grahame: Funding for Free Personal Care—That the Parliament notes with concern the terms of a recent report produced by the Fraser of Allander Institute, Free Care of the Elderly, by Margaret and Jim Cuthbert which identifies, inter alia, that the Scottish Executive failed to identify the number of disabled persons aged over 65 in private households and that the Care Development Group’s (CDG) estimate of 142,000 fell short of the Cuthberts’ estimated figure of 350,000 based on Department for Work and Pensions’ research and figures from the Registrar General for Scotland, that the effect of this error increases the required allowance by at least £50 million per annum, that the CDG work underpinning the costing wrongly assumed that 45% of provision made for elderly in their homes by local authorities related to personal care whereas the Cuthberts believe that the figure should have been around 60% implying an additional £3 million in costs per annum and that, therefore, the overall cost has been underestimated by some £60 million; further notes that the Executive failed to secure a clawback of some £20 million in saved benefits from Westminster which would have provided additional funding for the programme, and seeks reassurances in all circumstances that free personal care for the elderly will be properly funded so that the frail elderly can feel secure and supported in their own homes.
