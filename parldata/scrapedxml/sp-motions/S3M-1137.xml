*S3M-1137 Helen Eadie: Welcoming the Small Claims (Scotland) Amendment Order—That the Parliament welcomes the Small Claims (Scotland) Amendment Order 2007 (SSI 2007/496) which has the effect of now making it possible for claims of up to £3,000 to be made in the small claims court; acknowledges that many campaigners across Scotland have worked for this change which reflects the reality confronted by individuals and families when they purchase goods and services such as computers, three-piece suites and holidays, and hopes that the limits will be reviewed regularly with a view to revising them to match real costs for consumers.
