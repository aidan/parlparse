*S3M-1115 Joe FitzPatrick: Disability Poverty in Scotland—That the Parliament notes that the Leonard Cheshire Disability report, Disability Poverty in the UK, finds that disabled people are twice as likely as non-disabled people to live in poverty; further notes that in Scotland 48% of disabled people are in employment which compares unfavourably with the fact that 80% of non-disabled people are in employment and that disabled people who are not expected to work are often trapped in inescapable poverty; further notes that disabled people can experience poverty in a number of ways including financial poverty, poverty of aspiration and poverty of opportunity; believes that the extent of disability poverty is unacceptable, and calls on all parties to work together to bring about change to tackle as a priority disability poverty in all its guises. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Bob Doris*, Aileen Campbell*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Gil Paterson*, Elaine Smith*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Mary Scanlon*, Alex Neil*, James Kelly*, Bill Kidd*, Robin Harper*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Mike Pringle*, Rob Gibson*, Christine Grahame*
