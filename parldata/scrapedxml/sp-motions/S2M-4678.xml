 *S2M-4678 Murdo Fraser: Gay Police Association Advertisement—That the Parliament condemns the use of the phrase "in the name of the father" and the image of a Bible next to a pool of blood in the advertisement placed by the Gay Police Association in Scotland in the 29 June 2006 issue of The Independent newspaper, which thereby inferred that faith in the Bible is the cause of a 74% rise in homophobic incidents and crimes; rejects this inference as totally erroneous; values Scotland’s Christian community and the contribution it makes to our society and our culture; deeply regrets that any police officer would choose to place an advertisement in any medium to make such a gratuitous insult to a section of the Scottish population, and hopes that all police officers will act in a manner that reflects fully the attitudes, values and beliefs which Scotland, as a modern society founded on the Christian faith, encompasses. Supported by: Mr Alasdair Morrison*, Karen Gillon*, Phil Gallie*
