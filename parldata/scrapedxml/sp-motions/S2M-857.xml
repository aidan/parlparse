*S2M-857# Bristow Muldoon: Livingston Football Clubâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the news that Livingston Football Club has been placed in administration; recognises the considerable success that the club has achieved both on the field and in promoting West Lothian; hopes that all relevant parties work to bring the club out of administration at the earliest opportunity, and believes that the Scottish Executive should enter into discussions with the Scottish Premier League and other relevant bodies to identify ways in which the current crisis situation facing many Scottish clubs can be resolved.
