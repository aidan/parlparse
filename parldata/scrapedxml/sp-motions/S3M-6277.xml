 *S3M-6277 David Stewart: Frequent Passenger and Vehicle Ferry Service between Gourock and Dunoon Town Centres—That the Parliament notes the finding of the Deloitte Touche report published by the previous Scottish administration and carried out in conjunction with Western Ferries and CalMac that indicates that the most efficient and least subsidised method for transportation of passengers between Gourock and Dunoon town centres would be a frequent passenger-vehicle ferry service; notes the finding by Washington State Ferries that passenger-vehicle ferries are a more efficient means of transporting passengers on higher density routes than passenger-only ferries; further notes the frequently expressed wishes of dependent communities through petitions, public meetings and elected representatives for the retention and improvement of the passenger-vehicle Gourock-Dunoon town centre service; considers that such a frequent passenger-vehicle service would have benefits in terms of competition, reduced burden on the taxpayer, community and user welfare and local economic development, and calls on the Scottish Executive to implement its commitment to deliver a frequent passenger and vehicle service between Gourock and Dunoon town centres.
