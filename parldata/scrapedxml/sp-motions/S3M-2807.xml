 *S3M-2807 Hugh Henry: South Primary, Paisley—That the Parliament notes with concern that South Primary School in Paisley is being considered for closure by Renfrewshire Council; recognises the level of commitment from the teaching staff and parents at South Primary; further recognises the positive HM Inspectorate of Education report in September 2008 commending the school’s strengths, including attainment in mathematics, the strong sense of staff teamwork and staff commitment to the care and welfare of all pupils, high quality accommodation, which provided a stimulating learning environment, very positive relationships with parents, the wider community and a range of agencies, which supported pupils’ learning; believes that the closure will result in larger class sizes for those schools that will have to absorb the displacement of pupils from South Primary; understands the anxiety that this proposed decision will cause pupils, parents and staff; regrets the educational budget cut proposals within Renfrewshire Council, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that the education needs of the children who attend South Primary and, indeed, across the whole of Renfrewshire are safeguarded.
