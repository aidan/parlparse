*S3M-7637 Ian McKee: Dario Franchitti—That the Parliament congratulates Tony McCoy on winning the BBC Sports Personality of the Year 2010 award but regrets that the Bathgate-born motor racing champion, Dario Franchitti, was not nominated by any of the 30 newspapers, with the exception of The Herald, for this year’s Sports Personality of the Year; notes that Franchitti is the first ever British driver to win his second Indianapolis 500 race and considers that he clawed back a 60-plus-point deficit to secure his third IndyCar championship in the United States of America in 2010, and encourages the press and the BBC to give more consideration and coverage to Scotland’s world-class sportsmen and women. Supported by: Kenneth Gibson*, Jamie McGrigor*, Gil Paterson*, Bill Kidd*
