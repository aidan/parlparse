*S3M-1090 Bill Kidd: Scottish Parliament Nominated as "Arms Control Person of the Year"—That the Parliament welcomes with gratitude its nomination as Arms Control Person of the Year by the Arms Control Association in Washington DC; notes that the wording of the nomination states that the Scottish Parliament has been nominated for its 14 June 2007 vote in opposition to the UK Government’s replacement of the Trident nuclear-armed submarine system, and, notwithstanding the rare honour of the Parliament being regarded as a "person", encourages all to visit http://survey.armscontrol.org/index.php?sid=5, the Arms Control Association website, where a full list of nominees may be viewed, to vote for the Scottish Parliament.
