*S1M-2838.2 Mr Kenneth Gibson: Final Report of the Homelessness Task Forceâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-2838) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the final report of the Homelessness Task Force, Homelessness: An Action Plan for Prevention and Effective Response; regrets that, five years after the election of New Labour, homelessness in Scotland is higher than when they took office; seeks a commitment from the Scottish Executive to produce an action plan for implementation of the 59 recommendations within six months; believes that, for homelessness to be eradicated, the recommendations in the report must be fully resourced, and acknowledges than an independent Scotland, with full control over the benefits system, would be much better placed to tackle homelessness than an Executive dependent on the decisions and goodwill of Westminster."
