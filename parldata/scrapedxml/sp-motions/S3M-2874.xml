 *S3M-2874 George Foulkes: SNP in a Spin over HBOS Takeover—That the Parliament notes with concern the moves by a small group of people within the Scottish financial sector to promote an unspecified alternative to the Lloyds TSB takeover of HBOS; considers that the Lloyds TSB deal is the only substantive option that will guarantee the future of HBOS; unites with all parliamentarians, across parliaments, on the common purpose of securing headquarter functions in Scotland, preserving the thousands of jobs reliant on a strong recapitalised bank, both in the Lothians and across Scotland; further considers that there is a lack of coherent and transparent Scottish Government policy towards the takeover and a fast and loose approach adopted by some sections of the media to reporting the credibility of alternative options; considers that the whole scheme is deeply irresponsible, and believes that Alex Neil MSP is acting as a proxy for the First Minister in promoting the scheme and that his actions are politically motivated to allow the SNP to look both ways on this issue.
