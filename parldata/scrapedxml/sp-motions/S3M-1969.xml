*S3M-1969 John Farquhar Munro: Housing and Homelessness Legislation Displacing Local Highlandersâ€”That the Parliament notes the plight of an increasing number of local highlanders who are finding it difficult to secure social housing in their own areas; recognises the wider benefits of family support systems that lessen the burden on state-run care services, and believes that the Scottish Government should urgently revisit housing and homelessness legislation so that the Highland Council and housing associations can give proper recognition and priority to the housing requirements of locals in need.
