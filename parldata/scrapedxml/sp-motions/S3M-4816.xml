*S3M-4816 Bob Doris: Disappointment at Diageo Decision—That the Parliament expresses disappointment at the announcement that Diageo has rejected Scottish Government task force proposals to save jobs at Port Dundas and Kilmarnock; praises the campaign efforts of workers, unions and politicians of all parties; considers that where jobs are at risk it is appropriate that the Parliament unites across party divides to steer corporate decision making in the direction that protects the Scottish national interest, and looks forward, despite the bad news, to the continuation of political unity as we strive to get the best deal from Diageo for redundant workers and to ensure the best support for retraining and the provision of employment services.
