*S1M-3938 Brian Adam: Social Inclusion Partnerships - New Audit Arrangements-That the Parliament condemns the changes in social inclusion partnership (SIP) audit arrangements imposed by Communities Scotland, which will lead to SIPs having to employ private firms of chartered accountants to undertake future audit work; notes that this will cost the Great Northern Partnership in Aberdeen at least £3,500 per annum, which will reduce the amount of work done in the communities of Middlefield, Tillydrone, Fersands and Printfield as it will in other socially excluded areas throughout Scotland, and calls on Communities Scotland to either abandon this imposition or fully fund the cost of the new arrangements.
