 *S2M-266 Tommy Sheridan: Visit of Vlaams Blok Chairman to the Parliament—That the Parliament applauds the Welsh Assembly’s decision to ban the visit of a delegation of Flemish MPs, which includes Dominiek Lootens-Stael, chairman of the Vlaams Blok group; recognises that the Vlaams Blok group is well known as a far right, racist organisation; believes that it brings shame on the Scottish people and the Parliament that it should provide a platform to a known fascist, and calls on the Presiding Officer to reverse his decision to extend the Parliament’s hospitality to this delegation and on all MSPs to boycott the visit if it proceeds.
