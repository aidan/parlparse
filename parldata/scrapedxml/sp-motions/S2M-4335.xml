*S2M-4335 Christine Grahame: Release of Ministerial Briefing Note on "Fiscal autonomy - full fiscal powers - financial independence"—That the Parliament notes the decision by coalition ministers to withhold from public scrutiny the Executive briefing note entitled "Fiscal Autonomy – full fiscal powers – financial independence" which was requested under the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 and suggests that the reason that ministers are so coy over its release is that such a document will be likely to support the case for a free and sovereign Scottish nation; believes that its release is fundamentally in the public interest to inform the debate over Scotland’s destiny, and acknowledges that only through independence can Scotland flourish.
