*S2M-5519♦ Ms Sandra White: Time to Act—That the Parliament expresses concern that, despite the many advances made in ending discrimination, removing barriers and creating opportunities for people with disabilities and learning difficulties, the recent tragic accident in Glasgow, where a girl with learning difficulties threw herself in front of a train after reportedly being bullied and treated without due regard to her condition by staff and management at her work, highlights the need to initiate a parliamentary debate into the need for support systems, such as buddy systems which have been highly effective elsewhere, to be introduced in the workplace and for companies to be required to implement specific policies and training to ensure that tragic accidents like this are avoided.
