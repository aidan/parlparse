*S1M-1622 Mr Brian Monteith: Increased Water Charges—That the Parliament notes with concern the huge increases in charges for water and sewerage services announced by East of Scotland Water Authority which will particularly hit those on fixed incomes such as pensioners; further notes that Scots are already paying an extra £154 million each year for these services compared to 1997, and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward proposals to give water authorities greater commercial freedom as part of a strategy to alleviate the problem in future years.
