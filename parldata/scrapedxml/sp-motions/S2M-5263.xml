*S2M-5263♦ Mr Andrew Arbuckle: Towards a Litter-Free Scotland—That the Parliament supports the work carried out by various agencies involved in the collection of litter from our roads, railway verges, streets, shores and parks; supports initiatives that will reduce the unnecessary expense of employing people to collect litter, and accepts that, despite the incredible efforts of volunteers in removing litter, more than £3 million is spent annually on this non-productive exercise but congratulates the voluntary groups in Fife, Perth, Stirling and Clackmannan for the work they have already carried out.
