*S1M-2826 Christine Grahame: Coalition Underspend—That the Parliament notes that the Minister for Finance and Public Services in a letter of 25 February 2002 to the COSLA Finance spokesman identified £200 million as the "true" End Year Flexibility for the year 2001-02; requests that these monies be immediately distributed, in particular to hard-pressed local authorities, including Scottish Borders Council who require some £3-4 million to avoid swingeing cuts to services, cuts which will impact on the most vulnerable; further notes that the Minister states that, "I fully understand that there are areas in government where additional monies that might be a direct benefit to the people of Scotland could be spent quickly"; identifies the crisis in the Borders as just one such instance, and therefore calls upon the Minister for Finance and Public Services to take the appropriate steps now.
