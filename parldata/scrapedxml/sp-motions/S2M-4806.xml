*S2M-4806 Mr Mark Ruskell: The Future Starts Here - The Route to a Low Carbon Economy—That the Parliament welcomes the report, The Future Starts Here: The Route to a Low Carbon Economy, based on research commissioned by the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research; recognises the report as the United Kingdom’s first comprehensive roadmap to a low-carbon economy which would deliver on government commitments to keep temperatures from rising beyond a critical point; acknowledges the report’s conclusion that the UK Government has only four years to implement a major new programme of action to cut carbon emissions if the UK is to play its part in keeping global temperatures below danger levels; notes that UK carbon emissions have not fallen since 1990 if emissions from international shipping and aviation are taken into account; notes that, as a first step towards a low-carbon economy, Friends of the Earth is calling for a climate change bill to be introduced at Westminster which would commit the Government to reducing the carbon dioxide emissions by at least 3% year on year; recognises the parallel proposal by Mark Ruskell MSP for a climate change bill in the Scottish Parliament, and calls on MSPs of all parties to back calls for Scottish Ministers to commit to a 3% annual reduction in climate change emissions.
