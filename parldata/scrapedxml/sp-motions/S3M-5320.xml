 S3M-5320 Michael Matheson: Falkirk Council Cuts Arts Again—That the Parliament regrets the decision by the Labour/Tory-led administration of Falkirk Council to scrap the Big in Falkirk festival; believes that this decision is short-sighted; acknowledges the work of the people of Falkirk in making Big in Falkirk Scotland’s national street festival over the last 10 years, and also considers that this decision, together with the closure of the Park Gallery, does not help Falkirk’s reputation as a friend of the arts.
