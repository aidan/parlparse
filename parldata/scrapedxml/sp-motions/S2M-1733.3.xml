 *S2M-1733.3 Mr Jamie McGrigor: A Sporting Scotland is a Successful Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1733) in the name of Mr Frank McAveety, leave out from first "recognises" to end and insert "laments the lack of significant progress made since devolution in increasing participation in sport; congratulates Scotland’s sportsmen and women, particularly the medallists at the recent Olympics and those competing for medals at the Paralympics currently under way in Athens, Andrew Murray at the US Open and most recently Colin Montgomerie as part of the successful European team in the Ryder Cup; endorses the Scottish Executive’s ambitions to attract major sporting events in Scotland, building on the successful rugby U21 World Cup; believes that the Executive’s fixation with arbitrary targets and control of sport is counter-productive, and believes that, rather than over-spending on consultations, initiatives and glossy brochures, funding should be channelled directly to schools and national governing bodies to be spent on facilities and training."
