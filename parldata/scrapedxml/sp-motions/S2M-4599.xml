 *S2M-4599 Carolyn Leckie: Cetacean Protection from Sonar—That the Parliament notes with concern the increasing use of military sonar which is detrimental to the health and well-being of cetaceans; believes that urgent action to combat this must be initiated; calls on the Scottish Executive to participate in the drafting of international law to regulate marine noise pollution and the establishment of an international body to initiate, promote, monitor and fund marine noise research, and further calls on the Executive to introduce or promote legislation that requires all major developments in the Scottish marine environment, including those of an industrial and military nature, to be subject to a strategic environmental assessment in terms of their impact on noise pollution and ensures that these developments are only permitted where the companies involved mitigate their effects relating to noise, including the development of alternative technologies, that all navies using Scottish waters are compelled to mitigate their noise-producing activities effectively and further that Scotland establishes a marine national park in which sonar is not deployed and that its propagation beyond the park boundaries is mitigated with the use of buffer zones.
