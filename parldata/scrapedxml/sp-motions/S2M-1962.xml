*S2M-1962# Colin Fox: Privatisation of our Prisons—That the Parliament notes plans to build two new prisons in Scotland; believes that they should both be publicly-owned and run; further believes that making money out of the incarceration of offenders is both immoral and a blight on our justice system, and considers that the Scottish Prison Service should ensure that both contracts to run these new prisons remain in the public sector.
