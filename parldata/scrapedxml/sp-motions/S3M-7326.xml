 *S3M-7326 Robin Harper: River Basin Management Plansâ€”That the Parliament notes the progress being made in reducing flood risk as a result of the Flood Risk Management (Scotland) Act 2009; further notes that the act is designed mainly to make sure that those at risk from flooding are kept aware of the dangers and up to date with events; notes that, under the terms of the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003, river basin management plans should by now have identified and begun to implement what soft engineering options are available in upriver catchment control of the water environment, and urges the Scottish Government to review and comment on what progress has been made through river basin management plans to provide long-term embedded reduction in flood risk.
