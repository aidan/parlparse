S2M-1868 Margo MacDonald: Deployment of British Troops in Iraq—That the Parliament notes the United States Administration’s request to send British troops into areas currently patrolled by American-led forces; is aware of the statement by the Secretary of State for Defence that he is inclined to comply; believes that such a move would significantly increase the danger to British troops in Iraq, and therefore calls for a vote in the House of Commons before Her Majesty’s Government takes a final decision on this matter.
