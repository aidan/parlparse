*S2M-3842 Brian Adam: Keep Aberdeen’s School Playgrounds and Playing Fields Open—That the Parliament condemns Aberdeen City Council’s Liberal Democrat/Tory administration for attempting to restrict access to school playgrounds and playing fields after school hours; commends the SNP and Labour groups and the external members of the Education and Leisure Committee for voting against this ludicrous idea and congratulates them on their victory; notes that the closing of playgrounds and playing fields goes against the grain of health policies that are being promoted, and calls on the Liberal/Tory administration to abide by this democratic decision and not to attempt to overturn it at full council.
