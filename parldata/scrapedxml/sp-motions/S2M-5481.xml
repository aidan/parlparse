*S2M-5481# Phil Gallie: Clyde Fishermen Ahead of the Game on Conservation!—That the Parliament applauds the intention of the Clyde Fishermen’s Association to stop, voluntarily, trawling in areas of Upper Loch Fyne and Loch Shira in the interests of biodiversity and conservation and notes that such action provides a further example of the fishing industry’s commitment to a sustainable environment by adding to the association’s weekend ban on fishing in the Clyde estuary, self-imposed some 20 years ago when its awareness of the need for conservation preceded the anxieties now expressed by politicians at European, UK and Scottish government levels.
