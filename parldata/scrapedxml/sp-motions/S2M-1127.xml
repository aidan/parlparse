*S2M-1127 Donald Gorrie: GATS and Water-That the Parliament welcomes Her Majesty's Government's commitment to the UN's pledge to halve the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water by 2015; notes that access to water is the most basic of human rights; notes concern that "water for human use" is included as a proposal under current negotiations of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) at the World Trade Organisation and that once a country commits its water sector to GATS, this commitment is effectively irreversible, irrespective of the consequences; further notes that current GATS negotiations could threaten the extension of clean water supply to the poorest communities by undermining pro-poor policies such as the preference for public or not-for-profit providers, and calls on Her Majesty's Government to persuade our EU counterparts to withdraw the proposal to bring "water for human use" into the GATS negotiations.
