 * S2M-3088 Chris Ballance: Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty—That the Parliament welcomes the opening statement from the UK delegation to the Non-Proliferation Treaty Review Conference at the United Nations on 5 May 2005 of “our unequivocal undertaking to accomplish the elimination of nuclear arsenals”; recognises that such a worthy commitment is incompatible with plans to build a successor to the existing Trident nuclear missile system, and calls on the UK Government to abandon any such plans.
