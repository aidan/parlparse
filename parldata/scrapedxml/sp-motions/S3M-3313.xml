*S3M-3313 John Park: Monthly Bin Collections in Fife—That the Parliament notes plans by Fife Council to pilot monthly bin collections; is concerned that these proposals are the latest in a series of cuts by the local authority, such as the increase in care charges, that are impacting on Fife residents; understands that efforts to reduce waste are important for a sustainable future but is concerned that four-weekly collections of residual waste will lead to an increase in overflowing bins and on-street litter; believes that efforts to increase recycling and the green disposal of food waste should be encouraged but not at the expense of local communities’ quality of life, and calls on Fife Council to reconsider its proposals. Supported by: David Whitton*, Trish Godman*, Michael McMahon*, Hugh Henry*
