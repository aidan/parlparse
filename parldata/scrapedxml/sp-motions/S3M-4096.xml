*S3M-4096 Kenneth Gibson: Stop the Failed ID Card Scheme—That the Parliament notes with concern the continuing roll-out of the ID card scheme, which it considers to be a baseless unproven policy, which is estimated to cost in excess of £5 billion; denounces unchecked executive powers whereby individuals would be managed by executive order and could be added to the national identity register by the Home Secretary without their consent; condemns excessive accumulation of personal data, which will lead to lifelong surveillance in a database state; joins with David Blunkett MP, the former Home Secretary who introduced the ID card scheme, in insisting that the UK Government scrap this unnecessary scheme, described by some as an ineffective plastic poll tax; questions this use of resources at a time when the Scottish Government is being asked to make cuts in vital public services, and hopes that UK ministers will appreciate a citizen’s right to privacy, freedom and trust, which seemingly has again been disregarded under Labour.
