*S3M-8205 Anne McLaughlin: Creating a Loan Crisis—That the Parliament condemns the UK Government’s proposed cuts to crisis loans; understands that over two million such loans were made in 2010-11 and that many of these were made to vulnerable groups such as disabled people, lone parents and pensioners; shares the concerns of charities such as the Child Poverty Action Group that children and vulnerable adults will be affected; believes that cutting these loans is another attack on the principles of the welfare state and society’s obligation to help vulnerable people in the name of neo-liberal ideology; further believes that the cuts risk driving people on low incomes into the arms of loan sharks, and calls on the UK Government to reconsider these proposals.
