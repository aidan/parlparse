 *S3M-4667 Patricia Ferguson: Maryhill and Possilpark, Town Centre Regeneration—That the Parliament welcomes the award of £1.8 million to Maryhill Burgh Halls from the Town Centre Regeneration Fund; notes that this completes the funding package for the regeneration of the Burgh Halls that will see the building restored to its former glory for community use; further notes that a working group is drawing up a bid for the regeneration of Saracen Street in Possilpark in the second round of Town Centre Regeneration Fund applications; welcomes the community support that this has received through petition signatures and community consultation; hopes that this bid will succeed in order to complement the regeneration of the wider Possilpark community, and further hopes, given the huge demand for town centre regeneration funding across Scotland, that the Scottish Government will continue this fund into future years.
