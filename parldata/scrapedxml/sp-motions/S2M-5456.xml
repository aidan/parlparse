*S2M-5456 Rosie Kane: Rescue Package for One Plus—That the Parliament recognises the vital contribution that the lone-parent organisation, One Plus, makes in working in partnership in over 100 projects, employing over 600 people, offering advice and support, mainly to women and their children, providing training, employment and care-based services to 1,000 families and individuals every week, while contributing to the regeneration of local communities; notes that the Scottish Executive has rejected a request by One Plus for £2 million to bridge the funding gap which has plunged the organisation into a financial crisis, forcing it into liquidation and meaning the loss of those 600 jobs, childcare services, training and employment facilities; considers that, if the Executive is prepared to give millions of pounds for retraining support to the same number of NCR workers, which may not create a single new job, what is good enough for NCR must be good enough for One Plus and could actually save 600 desperately needed jobs; believes that a rescue package for One Plus makes better economic sense than liquidation, which is estimated to cost up to £10 million in terms of the liquidator’s costs, redundancy and severance payments for employees losing their jobs and knock-on impacts, and calls on the Executive to reconsider urgently its decision not to help One Plus out of its financial crisis and to reconvene negotiations with the financial management and the board of One Plus, One Plus’ main client Glasgow City Council and independent auditors with a view to saving One Plus, a vital service to ten thousand lone parents and their children in Glasgow and the west of Scotland.
