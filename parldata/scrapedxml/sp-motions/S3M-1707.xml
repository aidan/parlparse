*S3M-1707♦ Tavish Scott: Equal Access to Rural Priorities Funding—That the Parliament notes that applicants in Shetland and elsewhere across Scotland seeking full information on the Rural Development Contracts - Rural Priorities programme can only obtain the information online and that applications for funding from the programme also have to be made online; further notes that many potential applicants do not have ready access to the internet or familiarity with its use and that, in addition, the application system for the programme is reported to be incompatible with web browsers on Apple Mac computers; is concerned that this will at best make it difficult for many potential applicants both to investigate the options open to them under the programme and to make applications and in some cases will make it impossible; strongly believes that all potential applicants for agricultural support should have equal access to information and that the application process should allow all applicants to submit their application by a means that is easily accessible to them, and considers that paper copies of the programme details should be made available to all who request them, that applications to the programme made on paper should be accepted and that such applications should be treated equally to those made online.
