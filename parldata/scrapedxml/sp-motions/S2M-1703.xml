*S2M-1703# Mark Ballard: Current Account Access at Post Offices—That the Parliament notes the agreement announced on 15 September 2004 that Clydesdale Bank customers will, from 1 October 2004, be able to withdraw and deposit cash, check their account balances and deposit cheques at any of the 1799 post office branches in Scotland; believes that this will improve access to banking facilities for geographically-remote and socially-excluded communities in Scotland, while ensuring the viability of post offices in such areas, and considers that other banks should follow the lead of Clydesdale, the Co-operative Bank, Smile, Lloyds TSB, Barclays, Alliance and Leicester plc, Cahoot and First Direct in forming an alliance with the Royal Mail to offer banking services.
