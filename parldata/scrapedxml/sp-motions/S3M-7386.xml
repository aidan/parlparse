*S3M-7386 Marilyn Livingstone: Fife Tourism Beats the Recession—That the Parliament welcomes the recent findings by Historic Scotland suggesting that Fife’s tourism industry appears to be beating the recession, with increases in footfall across visitor hotspots throughout the kingdom; notes that Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery is one such facility that is drawing in large crowds despite the economic downturn; notes that visitor numbers from April to October 2010 were recorded at 69,340 compared with 44,679 over the same period last year; understands that Days of Wine and Roses, the new work by Jack Vettriano, and McTaggart’s Children, a centenary celebration, both proved extremely popular, attracting many people to the gallery for the first time; notes that over half of the visitors to the gallery travelled from beyond Fife, and believes that venues such as Kirkcaldy Museum and Art Gallery are an asset to the community and Fife’s tourism industry, offering high-quality experiences free of charge.
