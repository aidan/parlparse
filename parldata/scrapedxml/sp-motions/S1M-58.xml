*S1M-58 Mr David Davidson: That the Parliament agrees that the current expensive implementation proposals for the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive (91/271/EEC), in so far as they apply to the Scottish fish processing industry in North East Scotland, will effectively close many of the companies engaged in the industry, which provide thousands of skilled jobs; and calls upon Scottish Ministers to seek to delay implementation of these proposals to allow for proper consideration of the technical review currently being undertaken to produce cost effective solutions for the industry, enabling the industry to continue as a major employer in Scotland.
