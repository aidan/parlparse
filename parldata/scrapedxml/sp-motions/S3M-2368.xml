 *S3M-2368 Bob Doris: Save Wallace Street Post Office—That the Parliament notes the looming deadline of 1 September 2008 for constituents to have their say on post office closures in the area plan for Ayrshire, Inverclyde, Lanarkshire and Renfrewshire; encourages customers of the post offices in these areas to make their views known by taking part in this consultation process by Post Office Ltd; notes that Postwatch has a number of concerns about the proposed closures, which total 44 in this area alone, in what is the latest round of cuts to the post office network; believes that locals should oppose such closures including opposing the closure of the post office at Wallace Street, Rutherglen, where Postwatch Scotland believes that the proposed closure could have a negative impact on quality of service currently being provided; recognises that the post office in Wallace Street is not only a vital facility for many local elderly customers and others but also an integral part of the local economy in that area, which has a number of other small businesses located beside the post office; welcomes South Lanarkshire Council leader, Eddie McAvoy’s, concerns over these closures but believes that the Labour Party cannot escape the blame for the closure programme which it pushed through the UK Parliament and which the SNP opposed, and further believes that local Labour MP, Tommy McAvoy, should apologise to constituents for these ill-thought out, risky and brutal reforms and join SNP calls for the closure programme to be halted immediately.
