*S3M-7164.3 Margaret Smith: Refresh of the Skills Strategy—As an amendment to motion (S3M-7164) in the name of Keith Brown, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the publication of the refreshed Skills for Scotland skills strategy, three years after the original strategy was rejected by the Parliament; regrets the confusion and bureaucracy in the Scottish Government’s approach to the skills system and meeting the needs of the key economic sectors and industries of the future, and believes that the priority given by the Scottish Government to the new centralised skills quango, Skills Development Scotland, which has £22 million of administrative expenses, has not added any clarity to the Scottish Government’s skills agenda."
