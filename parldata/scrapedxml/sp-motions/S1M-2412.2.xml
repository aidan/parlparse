*S1M-2412.2 Mr John Swinney: Conduct of the First Minister-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2412) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from "regrets" to end and insert "believes that the First Minister has failed to respect these principles in his actions during the last few months in relation to the issue of his constituency office expenses; further believes that this has severely damaged the credibility of the First Minister and has broken the bond of trust that must exist between the First Minister and the Scottish public and that this, added to the incompetence which he has exhibited during this affair, renders his position untenable, and calls upon him to resign."
