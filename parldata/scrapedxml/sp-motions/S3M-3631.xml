 *S3M-3631 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Edinburgh World Justice Festival—That the Parliament notes that the fourth Edinburgh World Justice Festival takes place from 21 to 31 May 2009 on the theme of building justice out of crisis; further notes that this annual event was founded by a small group of Edinburgh citizens inspired to do something to maintain the momentum of the Make Poverty History demonstration in Edinburgh in July 2005; supports the aims of the festival to raise awareness of the causes of some of the major global justice issues including poverty, disease and war, and believes that this festival makes a unique and positive contribution to the city’s festival programme, providing an engaging forum for Edinburgh citizens to explore the issues, debate the potential solutions and identify ways to get involved, both individually and as a community, in the advancement of justice globally.
