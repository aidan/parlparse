 *S3M-633 Patricia Ferguson: North West Women’s Centre—That the Parliament notes the vital contribution made by the North West Women’s Centre to the lives of women in the city of Glasgow; notes the work done by the centre to support and encourage women, often when they are at their most vulnerable, and expresses concern that the centre is once again facing an uncertain future due to a shortfall in core funding.
