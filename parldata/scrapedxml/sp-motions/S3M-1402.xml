 *S3M-1402 James Kelly: Funding of Supporters Direct—That the Parliament notes the comments of the late Scotland football manager, Jock Stein, that "football without fans is nothing"; believes that this sentiment epitomises the work of Supporters Direct; applauds the work of Supporters Direct in saving six clubs, facilitating £2 million cash input to clubs and establishing 35 supporters’ trusts with 15,000 members; recognises the cross-party support for the work of Supporters Direct but notes that its funding is due to run out in March 2008; expresses disappointment that the SNP administration has failed at this point to provide any new funding to Supporters Direct, and calls on the Minister for Communities and Sport to make funding available from April 2008 to allow Supporters Direct to continue its excellent work on behalf of Scotland’s communities.
