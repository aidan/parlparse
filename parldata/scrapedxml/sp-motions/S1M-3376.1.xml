 *S1M-3376.1 Miss Annabel Goldie: Performance of the Scottish Economyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-3376) in the name of Andrew Wilson, leave out from "this recession" to end and insert "economic growth is the key to raising personal living standards, providing opportunity and security for all and the means by which we improve our public services and quality of life; further recognises that this prosperity can only be created on a sound entrepreneurial base, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to increase investment in our transport infrastructure and to return Scotland to a uniform business rate poundage throughout the United Kingdom, these being two essential factors in providing the right framework for the creation of wealth and jobs."
