*S3M-861♦ Aileen Campbell: 18 Years of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child—That the Parliament notes the "coming of age" of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on 20 November 2007, which since its adoption in 1989 has been ratified more quickly and by more governments, all except Somalia and the United States of America, than any other human rights instrument; recognises that it is the most far-reaching and comprehensive of all human rights treaties and has transformed the status of children as rights holders; supports its basic premise that children are born with fundamental freedoms and the inherent rights of all human beings; recognises that much work still needs to be done to ensure that the convention is fully implemented; further notes that in 2008 the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child will examine a report by the UK Government on its implementation of the convention; welcomes the Scottish Government’s engagement in that reporting process and its commitment to improving the lives of young people, and continues to support the work of Kathleen Marshall, Scotland’s Commissioner for Children and Young People in promoting and safeguarding children’s rights in Scotland.
