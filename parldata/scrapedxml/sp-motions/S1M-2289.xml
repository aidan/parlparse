 *S1M-2289# Mr Brian Monteith: Closure of Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department Offices in Stirling, Dundee and Forfar—That the Parliament regrets the decision of the Scottish Executive to close its Environment and Rural Affairs Department offices in Stirling, Dundee and Forfar; notes that this decision has been taken for financial reasons to reduce annual running costs at a time when the department has admitted to a £66 million underspend in its budget and that it will mean the transfer of staff to a centralised regional office in Perth, and deplores the failure of ministers to consult with the local farming communities on the closure of these offices. Supported by: Alex Fergusson*, Mr Keith Harding*, Lord James Douglas-Hamilton*
