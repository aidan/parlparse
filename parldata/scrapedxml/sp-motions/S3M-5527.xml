*S3M-5527 David Stewart: Congratulations to the Isle of Eigg, Winner of the Big Green Challenge—That the Parliament congratulates the Isle of Eigg community on being named a winner of the Big Green Challenge and awarded £300,000 from the £1 million prize fund that encourages community-led carbon emission reductions; notes that the Isle of Eigg team slashed CO2 emissions by an impressive 32% in the last year alone, making a significant impact on the United Kingdom’s 2020 emissions reduction target of 34%; further notes that the Isle of Eigg project fought off competition from over 350 community groups across the UK as a result of its achievements over the course of a year in four areas: CO2 reductions achieved, the innovative nature of its initiatives, the longevity and scalability of the project and the level of community engagement, and commends the ambitions of the Eigg community to go even further and use the prize money to fulfil its ambitions to reduce Eigg’s carbon footprint to ensure a low-carbon future for the island.
