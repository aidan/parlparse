*S1M-1912 Mr Jack McConnell: Impact of the European Union on Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the events being organised to celebrate Europe Day and the emphasis given in those celebrations to working with the future partners in Central and Eastern Europe; acknowledges the crucial importance of the European Union to investment and jobs in Scotland, as a driving force for rising environmental standards and as a source of support for economic development; welcomes enlargement and the benefits of peace, stability and enhanced prosperity it will bring; recognises, in supporting enlargement, the need for preparatory reforms of the EU institutions and calls for a debate on governance, and welcomes the Executive’s joint paper with CoSLA and the forthcoming inquiry by the European Committee as two important contributions to that debate.
