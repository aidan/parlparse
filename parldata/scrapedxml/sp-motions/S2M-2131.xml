 *S2M-2131 Bristow Muldoon: Fire Safety—That the Parliament notes with concern the unacceptably high level of fire deaths and injuries within Scotland, 84 fatal casualties and 1,718 non-fatal casualties, as reported in HM Chief Inspector of Fire Services for Scotland – Annual Report 2002-03; believes that the most effective way to reduce this unacceptable level of human suffering is to ensure that the fire and rescue services develop more effective community safety initiatives; recognises the excellent work carried out within West Lothian where Lothian and Borders Fire Brigade carried out a home safety fire risk assessment in every home within the area; further recognises the quality of the success of this initiative, where over 94% of respondents were very satisfied with the home safety check, 92% stated that they now felt safer from fire in their home, 95% of the firefighters involved in the project agreed that the community welcomed their efforts to reduce the number of fire fatalities occurring within the home and 85% agreed that it should be the fire brigade’s responsibility to give home fire safety advice to the community; confirms that fire safety is high on the agenda of the Parliament, and encourages the Scottish Executive in its determination to make community fire safety a statutory duty for fire authorities.
