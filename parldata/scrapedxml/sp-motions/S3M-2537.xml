*S3M-2537 Cathy Peattie: Mind the Gap - The Next Step—That the Parliament welcomes the report on disabled people’s experiences of Scottish public transport, Mind the Gap: The Next Step, by Leonard Cheshire Disability; notes the findings that problems with transport create barriers to education, work and leisure, and that problems arise not only from physical inaccessibility but also from attitudes; further notes that these and other conclusions were also reached in Session 2 by the Equal Opportunities Committee in its report on its disability inquiry, Removing Barriers and Creating Opportunities; supports Leonard Cheshire Disability’s call for a public awareness campaign and robust disability equality training for staff, and believes that the other recommendations made in Removing Barriers and Creating Opportunities should be built on and developed in this parliamentary session.
