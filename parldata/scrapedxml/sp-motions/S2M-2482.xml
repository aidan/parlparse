S2M-2482# Scott Barrie: Quality of Fife’s Train Services—That the Parliament notes the importance of the rail network to an efficient public transport system in east central Scotland; notes previous debates in the Parliament that highlighted the poor service offered to Fifers by train operators in respect of reliability and punctuality; regrets that the improvements made to the rail infrastructure in Fife, including longer platforms and increased capacity, are still not meeting the level of demand; notes that the service has failed to improve under the new franchisee; believes that the current level of train cancellation and late running is unacceptable, and further believes that First ScotRail, in particular, must ensure that it improves its performance so that a viable alternative to car usage is available.
