*S1M-2916 Johann Lamont: Launch of Burnbrae Primary School Drug Free Zone—That the Parliament congratulates Burnbrae Primary School on becoming a drug-free zone; notes the hard work of the Task Force, which was entirely made up of pupils, in making it happen; applauds the staff, parents, pupils, police, Glasgow City Council and Scotland Against Drugs for the commitment shown in participating in this initiative, and urges the Scottish Executive and the appropriate committees of the Parliament to do all they can to promote initiatives such as this, which place young people at the centre of the process and empower them to make positive choices in their lives.
