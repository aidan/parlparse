*S3M-2249 Kenneth Gibson: Withdrawal of School Transport in Glasgow—That the Parliament notes with concern the decision of Glasgow City Council’s ruling Labour executive to withdraw free transport from 1,500 pupils from August 2008; believes that this decision is completely unnecessary, given that the council had a £15.2 million underspend in 2007-08 while retaining this vital service would cost only £640,000; is concerned that the council spends a smaller share of its total budget on education than any of Scotland’s 32 local authorities, despite having Scotland’s lowest level of educational attainment; is disappointed that this decision was carried out without any consultation whatsoever with parents, staff or pupils who use the service and was announced to them only at the end of the school year, leaving parents, pupils and staff with little time to react; is perturbed that the ruling Labour group in the council is using this important issue as a political pawn to give the impression that it does not receive adequate funding from the Scottish Government when it is failing to spend resources already allocated, and believes that the council’s ruling Labour group should rescind this decision at the earliest possible opportunity and invest some of its underspend on improving services to Glaswegians, particularly in education, and not least by making progress towards reducing class sizes.
