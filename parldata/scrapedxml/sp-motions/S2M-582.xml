*S2M-582 Mike Pringle: Scottish Natural Heritage Vote Against Relocation-That the Parliament notes that 70% of the staff balloted by the Public and Commercial Services Union at Scottish Natural Heritage's (SNH) headquarters in Edinburgh expressed their opposition to the forced relocation to Inverness and will not transfer when their jobs move; notes that the remaining 30% will only move with improved and enhanced conditions; further notes that this lack of staff support will impose a serious threat to the long-term effectiveness and efficiency of SNH to carry out its core function of protecting Scotland's natural heritage, and calls on the Scottish Executive to stop this move before it brings the Executive's worthwhile relocation policy further into disrepute.
