 * S2M-2419 Margaret Jamieson:Responsible Development of Onshore Wind Farms—That the Parliament notes with concern the continued scaremongering on the subject of onshore wind farms; regrets the tactics being used by some members of the Scottish Parliament to promote the view that all wind farm proposals are in very remote areas; recognises the proposal to build Whitelee wind farm, which crosses the boundaries of East Ayrshire, East Renfrewshire and South Lanarkshire local authority areas and which, if approved, would be the largest onshore development in Europe, providing almost half of the Scottish renewable target, and would be immediately adjacent to a major centre of power demand; welcomes the potential 300 construction jobs over a phased 30-month construction period, the £250 million of contracts that could be tendered for by Scottish companies and the provision of an easily-accessible visitor centre, and calls on all interested bodies involved in this exciting project to work towards a successful outcome to coincide with the G8 summit’s focus on climate change when the eyes of the world will be on Scotland.
