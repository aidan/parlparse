 S3M-4687 Ian McKee: Edinburgh Has Got What it Takes—That the Parliament welcomes the four progress reports submitted to the City of Edinburgh Council’s Economic Development Committee, showing that the capital has not been as seriously affected by the economic recession as other comparable cities across the United Kingdom on the following four of five main indicators: house prices, city centre footfall, airport passenger numbers and new business formation; considers that the tourism sector has thrived in Edinburgh thanks to the success of Homecoming, the Royal Highland Show and, more recently, the Edinburgh festivals, which have boosted a wide range of businesses, including hotels, restaurants and other local businesses; further notes that the number of new start-up businesses registered for VAT rose by 26% over the April to June quarter and that the city has attracted more foreign investment packages in the first half of the year than in the whole of 2007 and 2008; highlights that, although Edinburgh’s labour market has been badly affected by the recession, the unemployment rate, at 3.1%, remains lower than the UK average, and believes that the people of Edinburgh have got what it takes to fight back against the economic recession.
