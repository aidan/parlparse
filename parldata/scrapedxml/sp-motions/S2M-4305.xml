*S2M-4305 Rosie Kane: Charles Clarke Should Resign—That the Parliament is shocked by the announcement this week that the Home Office has not followed procedure regarding the release of foreign prisoners who have been convicted of murder, rape, sexual assault and paedophilia; is concerned that Charles Clarke, the Secretary of State for the Home Office, has accepted responsibility but has not yet resigned; demands a full and thorough independent investigation into these matters; questions the fact that often 20 agents from the Home Office are involved in every dawn raid, arrest and removal of asylum seekers where innocent women, men and children are taken into detention, many of whom are tagged, where cautioners are forced to pay substantial amounts of bail money to have asylum seekers released from detention and where these innocent individuals and families who have harmed no one are forced to sign on every week at the Home Office building in Brand Street, Glasgow, or at local police stations, and believes that this misplaced use of resources and poor management has contributed to the current situation and that Charles Clarke should resign immediately.
