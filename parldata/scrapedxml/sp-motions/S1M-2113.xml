S1M-2113# David Mundell: Disabled Access to Railway Station Platforms—That the Parliament notes with concern the continuing difficulties disabled citizens experience in accessing railway station platforms and the adverse impact this has on their freedom to travel; notes in particular the difficulties with access to and from the southbound platform of Lockerbie station, the only mainline station in south-west Scotland, which means disabled passengers have to travel south to Carlisle and return north on another train in order to be able to leave the station premises, and believes that the Scottish Executive should do all it can to work with Railtrack, train operating companies and any other relevant bodies to ensure that the necessary funding is available and priority given to providing appropriate disabled access to railway station platforms in Scotland and Lockerbie in particular.
