*S2M-3787 Christine Grahame: A Better Deal Campaign—That the Parliament congratulates Macmillan Cancer Relief on the launch of its A Better Deal campaign on 9 January 2006 which aims to raise awareness of the financial help available to cancer patients and their families; expresses concern, however, that such campaigns continue to be necessary, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make greater efforts to publicise the Hospital Travel Costs Scheme and NHS Low Income Scheme and, indeed, extend the financial assistance available to meet costs which, particularly in rural areas, can be prohibitive.
