 * S2M-2691.3 Chris Ballance:Nuclear Power—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2691) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert after fourth “waste” “notes that the industry proposal to base electricity supply on identical reactors of the unproven AP1000 design would undermine the security of electricity supply; notes that the amount set aside from nuclear generation revenues over the last 50 years to pay for decommissioning of existing nuclear power stations is only sufficient to fund the first two years of the Nuclear Decommissioning Agency’s 30-year programme and therefore that the multi-billion cost of decommissioning existing nuclear power stations will have to be paid for by future generations of tax payers and therefore considers that nuclear power is economically unsustainable; further notes that, over its whole life cycle, nuclear power is not carbon-neutral and agrees with the Chief Executive of the Energy Saving Trust that “to present nuclear power as one of the main ways of combating climate change is short-sighted”; believes that renewable energy and energy efficiency offer a truly secure and sustainable energy future”.
