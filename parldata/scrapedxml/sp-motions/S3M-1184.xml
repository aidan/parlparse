 *S3M-1184# Ian McKee: Torphin Hill Golf Club—That the Parliament notes with approval the initiative of the Torphin Hill Golf Club, Edinburgh, in encouraging young but possibly financially impoverished young people under the age of 25 to take up golf by allowing them to become full members of the club at half the usual membership fee; congratulates the club on encouraging its members to speak to their employers, as many do not realise that a growing number of companies are willing to subsidise sports club membership as part of their health at work policy, and, in light of the Scottish Government’s healthy living priorities, considers that this type of initiative should be given the widest possible support and publicity.
