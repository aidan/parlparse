*S3M-322 Pauline McNeill: Futures Through Music—That the Parliament welcomes the appointment by UK Government ministers of Undertones frontman and former chair of the UK Live Music Forum, Feargal Sharkey, to spearhead the setting up of a rehearsal studio network to encourage young musicians; notes that 43% of young people who want to participate in music are unable to do so due to lack of facilities and prohibitive costs; calls on the Scottish Executive to continue the work started by previous Scottish ministers in setting up initiatives such as the Scottish Music Futures Fund which was promoted by the Cross-Party Group on the Scottish Contemporary Music Industry, and congratulates the cross-party group for the extensive and valuable work it has done to promote the contribution of contemporary music to Scotland’s economy and for its Scottish Music Manifesto, published last year, detailing steps that could be taken to improve conditions for artists and to encourage new talent and increase the accessibility of live music for young people regardless of their background.
