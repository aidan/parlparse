 *S3M-4640 Dr Richard Simpson: Congratulations to Kinross Otters Swimming Club—That the Parliament notes the recent Stars of the Future swimming gala at Dundee’s Olympia pool; congratulates all those who were winners of medals and all those who achieved personal best times; in particular congratulates the many members of the Kinross Otters swimming club, which goes from strength to strength, and calls on the Scottish Government both to honour its free swimming-for-children manifesto pledge and to match England’s achievements where 250 local authorities have now delivered free swimming.
