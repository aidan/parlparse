*S3M-7543 Cathy Peattie: 42% Better—That the Parliament welcomes publication of Friends of the Earth Scotland’s report, 42% Better, looking at the achievability of Scotland’s climate targets; agrees with what it considers to be its key message that not only are the climate targets achievable but measures to tackle climate change can have significant social and economic benefits; in particular notes its conclusions that, by eliminating fuel poverty, an energy efficiency programme could prevent up to 180,000 cases of anxiety and depression each year, reduce the amount of time people are off work due to asthma and breathing problems by up to 25% and, when coupled with delivery of renewable heating systems, create 99,000 person-years of employment between now and 2020; further notes its findings that, by improving cycling rates, increased investment in active travel could save up to 1,672 lives a year, save a substantial chunk of the £170 million NHSScotland spend each year tackling obesity and, through higher productivity and less ill health, save the Scottish economy an estimated £23 million a year, and therefore calls on members to work together to strengthen the Report on Proposals and Policies to ensure that it gives the utmost confidence that Scotland will meet its climate targets while simultaneously delivering the maximum social and economic benefit to its people.
