*S3M-7630# Joe FitzPatrick: Scotland’s Science Centres—That the Parliament congratulates what it sees as the excellent work of Scotland’s science centres in Glasgow, Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen; welcomes in particular the official launch of the Dundee Science Centre Science Learning Institute in support of the Curriculum for Excellence and lifelong learning, through which the science centre has formed what is considered a unique partnership with the University of Dundee and Dundee College; considers that this initiative, which will offer interprofessional science communication training for cross-sector audiences, will bring more science to the people of Tayside, promoting public engagement with scientific research and discovery and supporting science-sector skills development, and wishes all four centres and their partners every success in such ventures in the future. Supported by: Kenneth Gibson*, Robert Brown*, Nanette Milne*, Rob Gibson*, Alasdair Allan*, Bill Kidd*, Patrick Harvie*
