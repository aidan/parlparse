*S2M-5033 Ms Sandra White: Her Majesty the Queen Praises Independence—That the Parliament welcomes comments made by Her Majesty the Queen on a recent visit to Estonia where she praised Estonia’s struggle for independence, stating "Estonia’s development since regaining its independence has been remarkable. Your entrepreneurial spirit, your innovative use of information and communication technology, and your open and transparent economic climate has resulted in dramatic growth, led by international trade and investment ... It is that indomitable spirit, which was able to keep alive the flame of independence, despite all attempts to extinguish it, during the very worst of times. It is this spirit which has driven forward the rapid political, economic and social change in all your countries, change which is not something to be measured simply by statistics, but in the freedom, peace and prosperity which all your peoples now enjoy"; notes that the successful example of Estonia and subsequent comments from Her Majesty mirror the historic and current situation in Scotland, while expounding the many benefits independence brings, and hopes to receive similar praise from Her Majesty in the near future.
