*S3M-1181 Tavish Scott: Shetland Islands Council Appeal Against State Aid Ruling—That the Parliament notes with deep concern the ruling by the European Commission, under State Aid regulations, that Shetland Islands Council must recover monies invested in the local fishing industry using funds paid to Shetland Islands Council by the oil industry as compensation for the disruption caused by the construction of Europe’s largest oil terminal at Sullom Voe; further notes that, if the monies have to be repaid, this will impact directly on 78 individual Shetland fishermen who received grants to allow them to invest in boats; is disappointed that the UK Government, as the Member State, is not to lodge an appeal, but welcomes the decision by Shetland Islands Council to appeal this decision to the European Court of Justice, and calls on both the Scottish and UK governments to support and assist Shetland Islands Council, both with the appeal and in discussions with the European Commission, in order to bring this matter to a successful outcome for Shetland and allow the council to continue to build, maintain and sustain the local fishing industry.
