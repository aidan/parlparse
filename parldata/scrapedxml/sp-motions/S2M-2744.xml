*S2M-2744# Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Anglo Beef Processing Plant at Bathgate—That the Parliament deeply regrets the closure of the Anglo Beef Processing plant at Bathgate; believes that such a closure is detrimental to the interests of the Scottish lamb industry from both an added-value and animal welfare perspective; expresses concern that this adds to the number of recent closures of food and drink processing facilities in Scotland, and believes that the Scottish Executive should ascertain the reasons why such detrimental developments are taking place.
