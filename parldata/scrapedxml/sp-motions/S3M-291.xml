*S3M-291 Sandra White: Defending the Welfare of Animalsâ€”That the Parliament commends the invaluable work done by the Scottish SPCA which, over the last year, has cared for over 12,000 animals in its 12 centres in Scotland, investigated nearly 10,000 incidents of animal cruelty and, through its School Outreach Programme, taught over 22,000 pupils across Scotland about topics ranging from animal cruelty and choosing and looking after pets to animal experimentation and farming; recognises the central role that the Scottish SPCA has played in the formation and implementation of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Act 2006 which has been seen as bringing the welfare of animals into the 21st century by introducing a duty of care for all animal owners and more severe sentencing for those found guilty of animal abuse, and supports the Scottish SPCA in seeking reassurance from the Scottish Executive that courts are using their full powers under the Act.
