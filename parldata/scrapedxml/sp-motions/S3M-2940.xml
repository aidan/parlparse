*S3M-2940 Marilyn Livingstone: Adam Smith College and Abertay University in Partnershipâ€”That the Parliament warmly welcomes the joint announcement by Adam Smith College, Fife, and University of Abertay Dundee of their intention to deliver enhanced degree education for learners in Kirkcaldy and Central Fife; congratulates both principals, Dr Craig Thomson of Adam Smith College and Professor Bernard King of University of Abertay Dundee for their vision on the future direction of further and higher education in Fife; believes that this partnership will offer students a greater range of degree choices and advanced study options than ever before, and believes that this unique collaboration between further and higher education establishments will enable students in Fife from less well-off backgrounds to access higher education that would otherwise be out of their reach and will in the longer term help Fife as a whole to face the challenges of an ever-changing economy and to grasp the opportunities that come from having a highly-motivated, well-educated and trained local population.
