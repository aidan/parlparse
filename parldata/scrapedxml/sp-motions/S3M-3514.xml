*S3M-3514 Ian McKee: Smoking Kills, Irrespective of Social Class—That the Parliament welcomes the recent study carried out by Health Scotland’s Director of Public Health Science, Dr Laurence Gruer, and published in the British Medical Journal, which examines the long-term impact of smoking on older men and women, showing that smoking itself is a greater source of health inequalities than social position; welcomes the findings that death rates of ex-smokers were close to those of never-smokers, demonstrating that quitting does make a difference regardless of social position, and considers that this research reinforces the Scottish Government’s stance and commitment to target smoking prevention among young people and provide effective support to encourage smokers to quit, taking us along the path to a non-smoking Scotland and improving the nation’s public health.
