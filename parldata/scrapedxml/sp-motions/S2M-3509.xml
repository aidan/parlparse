*S2M-3509 Bill Butler: Announcement of Clydesdale Bank Branch Closures—That the Parliament deeply regrets the decision announced by the National Australia Bank Group on 2 November 2005 to close 11 full-time and 21 part-time branches between 10 January and 30 March 2006; notes that the closure of branches will prove detrimental to economic activity and will damage the affected communities; believes that the negative impact of this decision will prove most severe in less prosperous areas, and calls on the National Australia Bank Group, even now, to reconsider its decision, especially where a closure would leave a community without any local bank. Supported by: Pauline McNeill*, Margaret Smith*
