 *S3M-3878# Bob Doris: Peaceful Protest at Wyndford and St Gregory’s—That the Parliament commends the courage and determination of the parents at Wyndford and St Gregory’s primary schools in Maryhill who are currently involved in a peaceful protest at both schools by occupying them over the Easter school holidays to draw attention to the threat of closure that they face; believes that there is a powerful case to maintain schooling in the Wyndford estate as well as in other local communities across Glasgow, and considers that each school that is saved from closure will not signify defeat for Glasgow City Council but rather a victory for parents and communities and for effective local democracy.
