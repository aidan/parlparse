 *S3M-3157 Kenneth Gibson: Cut Power Bills Now—That the Parliament notes that the forward price of gas for delivery in winter 2009 has plummeted from 109p per therm in July to 63.6p per therm in the last days of 2008, a decline of almost 42%; further notes that the forward price of electricity fell from £94.50 per MWhour to £56.65 over the same period, a decrease of over 40%; is concerned that power companies that were so keen to raise prices rapidly and in full during 2008 are much more reluctant to pass on full price cuts quickly, with consumers expected to wait until February or March for probable price cuts of only 5% or 10%, with 20% cuts at best; acknowledges that the wholesale cost of gas and electricity represents about two thirds of the total cost of supply borne by energy providers, and believes therefore that hard-pressed energy consumers, both domestic and business, should receive full price cuts and swiftly or that energy providers should be compelled by the UK Government to make the cuts.
