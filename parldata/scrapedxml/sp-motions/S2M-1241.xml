*S2M-1241 Tommy Sheridan: Withdrawal of Spanish Armed Service Personnel from Iraq-That the Parliament congratulates the newly-elected socialist government in Spain for honouring its pre-election promise to the Spanish electorate to withdraw Spanish armed service personnel from Iraq if elected; notes the increased voter turnout that led to the election of the Spanish socialists, and believes that Her Majesty's Government should follow their example by withdrawing all armed service personnel from Iraq in recognition that they are part of an illegal occupation force which took part in an illegal US invasion.
