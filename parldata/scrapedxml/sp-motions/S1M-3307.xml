*S1M-3307# Shona Robison: Diabetes and Tropical Diseases Research Centre, Dundee-That the Parliament congratulates the efforts of Sir Philip Cohen and other eminent scientists in trying to secure funding for the new medical research centre into diabetes and tropical diseases to be based in Dundee; believes that such a development could be a world centre of excellence and may lead to a breakthrough in understanding the causes of diabetes; notes with concern that the Scottish Higher Education Funding Council has refused to make up the shortfall in funding of Â£3.5 million required for the centre; further notes that public spending on scientific research has fallen by over one tenth in the last ten years, and therefore invites the Scottish Executive to reconsider this decision and agree to make up the funding shortfall to help put Dundee and Scotland at the forefront of diabetes research.
