S2M-04039.2 Cathy Jamieson (Carrick, Cumnock and Doon Valley) (Lab): As an amendment to motion S2M-04039 in the name of Nicola Sturgeon (Shirley McKie), leave out from first "with" to end and insert "that action needs to be taken to restore public and professional confidence in the Scottish Fingerprint Service; acknowledges that in 2000 the SCRO Fingerprint Bureau was the subject of an independent inspection by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC); notes that following three further inspections HMIC reported that its 25 recommendations had been fully discharged; notes that further reforms are being taken forward; that the Minister for Justice has instructed the interim Chief Executive of the Scottish Police Services Authority to bring forward, by the end of March, a comprehensive action plan drawing on the best available international scientific advice and management expertise; notes that this action plan will be reported to the Parliament; believes that a public inquiry is not appropriate; notes that it is the responsibility of the Parliament to hold the Scottish Executive to account; welcomes the work already commenced by the Justice 1 Committee, and confirms the Executive’s commitment to co-operate with any inquiries that the Parliament may decide to take forward in scrutinising these reforms."
