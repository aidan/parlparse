*S1M-3762# Sarah Boyack: New Investment for Dumbiedykes—That the Parliament regrets the withdrawal of Old Town and Hillcrest, the preferred housing associations, from the proposed housing stock transfer of Dumbiedykes in Edinburgh; notes the lack of investment in upgrading the housing stock in the area in the last six years; welcomes the development of key community facilities such as the IT learning centre, the community food co-operative, the Crags Sports Centre and the new Braidwood Community and Youth Centre; believes that there is a need for urgent action from the City of Edinburgh Council and the Scottish Executive to identify and deliver a new investment strategy for housing and improvements to the area in partnership with local residents, and considers that the Executive should urgently review the procedures and timescales for stock transfer in the light of the Dumbiedykes experience.
