 *S2M-3104 Robin Harper: Energy Efficiencyâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the House of Lords Science and Technology Committee on the publication of its latest report on energy efficiency; welcomes the findings of the report, in particular the finding that the UK Government is currently providing neither clarity nor leadership in promoting energy efficiency; notes that over 60% of the energy content of power station fuel is lost as waste heat or through losses of conversion or transmission; further notes that all sectors currently use energy inefficiently and wastefully; believes that drastically improved energy efficiency, particularly in the domestic sector, must be at the heart of any strategy to tackle climate change, and urges Scotland to become a nation of efficient energy generators and users.
