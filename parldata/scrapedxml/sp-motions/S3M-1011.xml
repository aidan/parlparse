 *S3M-1011 Christine Grahame: Robbing Peter to Pay Paul—That the Parliament notes the publication of Save the Children’s latest report, Robbing Peter to Pay Paul; expresses concern at the findings that nearly 60% of low-income families have no savings, 42% are seriously behind with bill and credit repayments and 36% have suffered penalty charges; agrees that this represents a poverty premium paid by the most vulnerable in society for access to credit and in servicing debt; expresses further concern at the conclusion that lack of access to affordable credit adversely affects children living in poverty, and urges the Scottish Government to take steps to improve access to affordable credit, such as credit unions, for those on the lowest incomes.
