*S1M-3216 Tommy Sheridan: Financial Disadvantage of Glasgow City Council—That the Parliament notes the continuing damage to the city of Glasgow as a direct result of the Tory reorganisation of local government in 1996; further notes that Glasgow’s first budget after reorganisation in 1996-97 resulted in a £63 million reduction in expenditure and a 19.1% increase in council tax, that the following two years’ budgets increased the council tax by 22% and 9.4% respectively while reducing local authority jobs by over 5,000 since local government reorganisation, that Glasgow’s budget has increased by 14.5% (only 1.2% in real terms) compared to a Scottish average of 22.5% (8.2% in real terms) and its council tax has increased by 39% compared to a Scottish average of 31% and that the "mismatch" of funding caused by reorganisation is a major cause of Glasgow’s reduced expenditure but higher council tax; is aware that Glasgow City Council is still compelled to spend £36 million more on education and social work than it receives in government support, such is the high level of deprivation and poverty within the city, while its council tax at £1,141 for Band D is the highest in Scotland; calls on the Scottish Executive to respond positively to the report by Professor Arthur Midwinter which highlights the need for Glasgow to receive £32.6 million in supplementary grant as its share of the £50 million owed to all local authorities financially disadvantaged by the "mismatch" of funds after local government reorganisation, and believes that Glasgow and the other affected local authorities should receive the supplementary grants within the current financial year.
