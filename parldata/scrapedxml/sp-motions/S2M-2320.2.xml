 * S2M-2320.2 Richard Lochhead:Energy Policy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2320) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from “is concerned” to end and insert “believes that Scotland is well placed to be Europe’s energy powerhouse given our massive energy resources; believes that onshore and offshore wind energy is an important element in a balanced renewables policy but that the development of other renewables must be accelerated; shares the frustration expressed by many others, including Highland Council and the Parliament’s Enterprise and Culture Committee, who are calling for a national strategic framework for wind farm developments; calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that the UK Government does not introduce any charging scheme for access to the grid that discriminates against renewables in Scotland; believes that no new nuclear power stations should be built in Scotland, and calls for the Scottish Parliament to have control over energy policy and oil and gas revenues.”
