 *S3M-3275 Alasdair Allan: Siadar Wave Power Scheme—That the Parliament welcomes the planning permission granted by the Scottish Government for the innovative and exciting Siadar wave power scheme on the Isle of Lewis; notes that this is set to become one of the first and largest wave power projects of its kind anywhere in the world and will be capable of generating up to four megawatts of energy, powering 1,800 homes and will provide up to 70 jobs on the Isle of Lewis; recognises that, at a time when more and more people are focussing on ways to help preserve the planet and produce energy for future generations, schemes like this are vitally important for meeting our future energy needs, and recognises that the approval for this ground-breaking proposal is testament to the hard work of all those who have been involved in getting this project off the ground. Supported by: Stuart McMillan*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Kenneth Gibson*, Rob Gibson*, Patrick Harvie*, Mike Pringle*, Brian Adam*, Michael Matheson*, Bob Doris*, Alex Neil*, Bill Wilson*, Robin Harper*, Bill Kidd*
