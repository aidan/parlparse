*S3M-6336 Lewis Macdonald: Aberdeen Heat and Power Ltd CHP Extension—That the Parliament congratulates Aberdeen Heat and Power Ltd on its announcement of plans to extend the combined heat and power (CHP) scheme in the Seaton area of Aberdeen to include Aulton, Northsea, Bayview and Beachview Courts in this financial year; notes the company’s commitment to a further extension of the scheme to include Lord Hays, Balgownie, Inverdon and St Ninian Courts in Spring 2011; recognises the benefits of CHP schemes both in reducing carbon emissions and in reducing fuel bills for residents, and believes that the Scottish Government should support the further development of such existing schemes and support investment in new CHP schemes in Scotland’s towns and cities.
