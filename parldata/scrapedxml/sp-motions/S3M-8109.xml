 *S3M-8109 Dr Richard Simpson: Waterwatch Scotland—That the Parliament notes that, by the casting vote of the Presiding Officer at stage three of the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Bill, it was decided that Waterwatch Scotland was to be terminated and its functions dispersed to the Scottish Public Services Ombudsman (SPSO) and Consumer Focus Scotland (CFS); notes that CFS is now itself to be disbanded; understands that, although the order has not yet been laid to terminate Waterwatch Scotland, the Scottish Government has already begun to deconstruct Waterwatch Scotland with the loss of around 13 jobs in Clackmannanshire to date; further understands that ministers have requested Scottish Water, the Water Industry Commissioner for Scotland and CFS to jointly work on proposals to replace some of the consumer consultation processes hitherto undertaken by Waterwatch Scotland and proposed a consumer forum at a cost of £210,000 annually; understands that there are at least two remaining functions of Waterwatch Scotland, consultation on prices and consultation on investment, that have yet to be placed with other existing or new organisations; further understands that the proposed budget for the elements of Waterwatch Scotland to be disaggregated to the SPSO and CFS and this forum so far totals £880,000 and the other functions yet to be decided on have not yet had budgets attached; expresses concern that the proposed budgeted costs of the dispersed elements so far exceed the maximum previous costs of Waterwatch Scotland by around £130,000 or 17% and exceed the current annual costs by around £275,000 or over 40%, and calls on the Scottish Government to desist from deconstructing Waterwatch Scotland until an order is laid after 28 April 2011 as required.
