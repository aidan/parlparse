 *S3M-1070 Jim Tolson: Tackling Discrimination—That the Parliament notes the publication of Attitudes to Discrimination in Scotland: 2006 Scottish Social Attitudes Survey; welcomes the findings that a clear majority of Scots say that Scotland should do everything that it can to get rid of all kinds of prejudice but is concerned that 29% say that sometimes there is good reason to be prejudiced; further acknowledges that discriminatory attitudes are most commonly expressed towards Gypsies/Travellers and transsexual people in Scotland, and consequently calls on the Scottish Government to work with the Parliament and civil society to help to address the views of this sizeable minority who believe that discriminatory attitudes are acceptable.
