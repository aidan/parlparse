 *S2M-574 Donald Gorrie: Scottish Opera's Financial Situation-That the Parliament expresses its concern at the financial crisis facing Scottish Opera; acknowledges the great critical and artistic standard the company has achieved recently, particularly with the production of Wagner's Ring cycle; understands the complexity and expense of staging high quality music drama but believes that Scotland should be able to fund an international standard opera company; notes that Scottish Opera has had a four-year standstill in its funding, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that the current financial crisis at Scottish Opera is solved, both by making sure that the company rigorously examines its expenditure and working practices in line with other major arts bodies and by establishing a four-year funding plan that will give Scottish Opera the guarantees required to continue to excel in the future.
