*S3M-3803 Bob Doris: Ofgem Proposals and Prepayment Meters—That the Parliament welcomes proposals by Ofgem to limit the scope of energy companies to charge unjustified prices; notes that the poorest and most vulnerable groups continue to pay higher prices for electricity and gas, particularly those with prepayment meters where charges amount to an average differential of £118 compared to customers paying by direct debit, and that a significant percentage of some groups at risk of fuel poverty use prepayment meters, including 22% of households with an income of less than £10,000; calls for tighter regulatory laws in the future, including windfall taxes or fines as a tool of regulation for utility companies that fail to comply, and believes that Ofgem could go further by insisting that energy companies absorb the comparatively small operational costs for prepayment meters and standard credit payment methods in order to achieve a more level and fairer system of pricing. Supported by: Mike Pringle*, Brian Adam*, Bill Kidd*, Jamie Hepburn*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Alasdair Allan*, Angela Constance*, Kenneth Gibson*, Aileen Campbell*, Christina McKelvie*
