*S2M-4164.1 Christine Grahame: Strategy for an Ageing Population—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4164) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "and welcomes" to end and insert "notes, however, the injustice of charging for food preparation under the free personal care legislation, ageism, fuel poverty and associated excess winter deaths, the punitive council tax and the discredited basic state pension, all of which deprive our elderly population of independence, security and choice, and recognises that until Scotland has power over tax and benefits many of Scotland’s pensioners will continue to live in poverty."
