 *S2M-1206.1# Chris Ballance: Harestanes Wind Farm Planning Application-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1206) in the name of Dr Elaine Murray, leave out from "with concern" to end and insert, "Scottish Power's application to erect 94 turbines each 411 feet high, in the Forest of Ae in Dumfries and Galloway, notes that Scottish Power's ballot of local people attending the exhibitions on the proposal showed twice as many people in support as against the project, which will bring an index-linked £250,000 to the region in community support; further notes that the generation capacity of the wind farm is equivalent to that of Chapelcross nuclear power station, and believes that a public inquiry may be advisable for a development of this size."
