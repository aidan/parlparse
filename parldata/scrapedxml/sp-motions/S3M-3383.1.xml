*S3M-3383.1 Derek Brownlee: Borrowing Powers for the Scottish Parliament—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3383) in the name of Tavish Scott, leave out from "would enhance" to end and insert "could enhance the autonomy and accountability of the Scottish Parliament and improve the Scottish Government’s ability to respond to changing economic circumstances; notes that borrowing powers could allow the Scottish Government to phase the funding of major capital projects such as the Forth Replacement Crossing sensibly and efficiently and therefore welcomes the Scottish Government’s commitment to give permission for civil servants to engage fully with the Commission on Scottish Devolution on the issue of borrowing powers for the Scottish Parliament; also notes the consideration by the commission of other financial and non-financial powers that might be made available to the Scottish Government, and calls on the Scottish Government to confirm that it will permit civil servants to engage with the commission on all such matters."
