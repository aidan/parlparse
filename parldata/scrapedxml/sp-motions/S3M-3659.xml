*S3M-3659 Anne McLaughlin: EAL Provision in Glasgow Schools—That the Parliament recognises the importance of English as an Additional Language (EAL) support in schools up and down the country; notes that in Glasgow alone there are 86 languages spoken by pupils in the city’s schools; believes that the needs of new migrant children must be fully met but not at the cost of providing much-needed support to Scots-born bilingual children; recognises that European funding streams exist to give EAL support to migrant European children, and urges local authorities to explore this avenue if they have not already done so. Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Bob Doris*, Alasdair Allan*, Sandra White*, Bill Kidd*, Christopher Harvie*
