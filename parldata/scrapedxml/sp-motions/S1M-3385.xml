*S1M-3385 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Arnold Kemp—That the Parliament pays tribute to the magnificent service rendered to Scotland by Arnold Kemp, former editor of The Herald newspaper and latterly former news editor of The Observer; recognises him as a great and heroic editor, in both Scottish and European terms, who campaigned steadfastly for Scottish devolution and humanitarian causes and who, like his late father Robert Kemp, was an influence for enduring good, delivering his outstanding intellectual gifts with the sparkle of grace, style, kindness and humour, and extends its deep sympathy to Mr Kemp's family and partner on his untimely loss to them and to Scotland.
