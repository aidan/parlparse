*S3M-531 Kenneth Gibson: Save the Sumatran Rainforest—That the Parliament acknowledges and supports the campaign by the RSPB and Burung Indonesia, part of the BirdLife International partnership, to restore an area of Sumatra’s lowland rainforest, the Harapan (hope) Rainforest; recognises that Sumatra has lost 97% of its rainforest, 16 million hectares, in under a century to unsustainable, often illegal, development, particularly logging activity; is aware that some of Earth’s most critically endangered species live in the Sumatran rainforest, a fragile habitat vulnerable to the devastating impact of deforestation, including 600 species of bird, the world’s largest flower, Rafflesia arnoldii, the Asian elephant, Malaysian tapir and the Sumatran tiger, where numbers are now reduced in the wild to fewer than 300; believes that restoration of the Harapan Rainforest would ensure the survival of a rich and diverse wildlife habitat vital to the prosperity of its indigenous people, and acknowledges that this ambitious project will help the development of scientific research and provide sustainable employment in wildlife monitoring, replanting, managing and eco-tourism.
