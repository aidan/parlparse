 *S3M-5121 Liam McArthur: Dan Buglass—That the Parliament notes with great regret the death of Dan Buglass, who, for over three decades, has been a leading Scottish agricultural journalist serving, with distinction, both the print and broadcast sections of the media; recognises the vital role played by agricultural journalists, not only in serving the needs of farmers and others in the industry, but also in educating and informing the general public and so helping to build bridges of understanding between Scotland’s largely urban population and one of its most important industries, a role in which Dan Buglass excelled; believes that Scotland’s agricultural world will be a duller place without his presence at shows and other trade events, and offers its condolences to his family on their loss. Supported by: Jamie McGrigor*, Elaine Murray*, Mike Pringle*, David Whitton*, Des McNulty*, Jim Hume*, Bill Kidd*, Nanette Milne*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Alex Johnstone*, Margaret Mitchell*, Sarah Boyack*, John Lamont*, Bob Doris*, Aileen Campbell*, David McLetchie*
