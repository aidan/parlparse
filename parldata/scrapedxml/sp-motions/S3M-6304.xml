*S3M-6304 Jackie Baillie: Youth Services Funding for West Dunbartonshire—That the Parliament expresses concern over the lack of youth projects and services available in the West Dunbartonshire area and understands that the Community Planning Partnership Executive Group supported a Youth Review that suggested a "reduction in funding for most youth projects and services"; acknowledges that West Dunbartonshire has some 16,781 young people aged between 12 and 25 who, as a result, could have reduced opportunities for personal and social development outwith mainstream education; is further concerned at the lack of volunteering opportunities that this has caused, and calls on West Dunbartonshire Community Planning Partnership to secure adequate future funding for youth services in the area.
