*S1M-3863# Irene Oldfather: Dispersal of Civil Service Jobs-That the Parliament welcomes the progress made to date on the dispersal of civil service jobs throughout Scotland; believes that an assessment should be made of the benefits that dispersal has brought to the respective local economies; notes the pending dissolution of the Parliament and seeks early expedition of the timetable for dispersal to ensure further progress; acknowledges that the selection criteria for such dispersals take account of cost, operational effectiveness, social, economic and environmental considerations and the position of staff; but nonetheless considers that priority should be given in future dispersals to areas such as Ayrshire, where there are above average levels of unemployment, to ensure that all of Scotland's communities share in the economic and social benefits of the policy of relocation.
