*S2M-2212# Colin Fox: Indefinite Imprisonment Without Trial at Belmarsh Prisonâ€”That the Parliament regrets the resignation of Ian Macdonald QC and the possible resignation of five other lawyers acting on behalf of detainees held indefinitely without trial at Belmarsh prison in London; notes that people have been held there for two years already with still no prospect of a fair trial; further believes that powers invested in government under the Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001 destroy that fundamental right at the heart of our legal system, the right to a fair trial by jury; believes that the indefinite detention of suspects at Belmarsh, ruled unlawful by the Law Lords in December 2004, sullies our international reputation and puts us on par with the odious legal position at the US military base at Guantanamo Bay on Cuba, and agrees with Mr Macdonald that "such a law is an odious blot on the legal landscape".
