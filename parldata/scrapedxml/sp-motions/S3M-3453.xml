*S3M-3453 Aileen Campbell: Families Outside’s Support to Children of Prisoners—That the Parliament commends the work of Families Outside to support and provide information for the estimated 16,500 children in Scotland who are affected by a parent’s imprisonment; recognises the devastating effect that a parent’s imprisonment can have on children and the need to ensure adequate support and information is provided, and welcomes the publication of Families Outside’s booklets, Honest? Emma’s story and What’s the story? Jenny’s Journey, which are tailored to specific age groups in a way that gives children a greater understanding of what is happening when a family member is sent to prison.
