*S3M-7308 Christina McKelvie: The Return of The Street—That the Parliament notes that Regen:fx Youth Trust in Hamilton’s immersive drama project, The Street, is scheduled to return for a month-long run from 15 November 2010; understands that The Street combines hard-hitting theatre performance with youth work and education to explore topics including vandalism, bullying and intimidation, substance abuse, sexual health, knife crime, personal safety and domestic violence; further notes that the project not only works with targeted groups of young people who have been identified as being at particular risk of becoming involved in crime but also that the drama is performed by young people who have themselves previously participated in the project; believes that this model of peer-to-peer discussion, backed up by strong professional support, which challenges harmful behaviour by young people, highlighting the consequences of their actions and encourages them to question their life choices, is an effective way of communicating with at-risk young people; further believes that this model has the potential to reduce offending by young people in communities across Scotland, and commends the work of Hamilton’s Regen:fx Youth Trust and all those involved in this innovative project.
