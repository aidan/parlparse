*S1M-4057.3 Tommy Sheridan: The Scottish Economy-As an amendment to motion (S1M-4057) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from "endorses" to end and insert "condemns the failure of the Scottish Executive's policy on the economy which has led to the erosion of Scottish industry and the proliferation of a low wage, poverty-ridden society and believes that only a radically different economic policy can change this situation, including (a) a Â£7.32 per hour minimum wage in the public sector, (b) creating 24,000 jobs by legislating for a 35-hour maximum working week in the Scottish public sector, (c) funding the training of 5,000 new apprenticeships in construction-related trades as part of a general strategy to build public sector homes, schools, community facilities and hospitals, (d) refusing contracts to any company that is anti-trade union, (e) taking over without compensation the assets, including factories, offices and equipment, of multinational companies that pull out of Scotland in search of cheap labour elsewhere and imposing heavy financial penalties on those companies, (f) supporting trade unionists forced to take strike action in defence of their living standards and working conditions, (g) ensuring that all public sector trainees are paid trade union-negotiated rates of pay, (h) regenerating local economies by returning the uniform business rate to the control of local authorities, (i) investigating a more progressive form of local business taxation to transfer the burden of business rates away from small businesses and new businesses on to bigger and more profitable businesses and (j) setting up a skills diversification programme involving the Scottish Trade Union Congress, in preparation for the future decommissioning of Scotland's nuclear power plants and nuclear weapons bases."
