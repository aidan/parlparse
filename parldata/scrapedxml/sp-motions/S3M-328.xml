*S3M-328 Irene Oldfather: RIP Cigarettes—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the European Commission to bring forward proposals to ban traditional cigarettes by 2009-10, forcing smokers to buy fire safe or reduced ignition potential (RIP) cigarettes that require constant drags to keep them alight; acknowledges that RIP cigarettes stop burning within two minutes of being put down therefore reducing the number of fires started by smouldering cigarette butts; is aware that cigarettes or other tobacco products sparked 30 of the 76 fatal house fires in Scotland in 2004; notes that 2,000 people across Europe are killed and a further 7,300 injured in house fires caused by cigarettes every year, and supports the European Commission’s proposals that will save lives.
