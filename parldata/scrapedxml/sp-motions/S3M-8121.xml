*S3M-8121 Alasdair Allan: 100 Years of the Harris Tweed Orb—That the Parliament notes that on Saturday 12 March 2011 a fashion show will take place in the An Lanntair Arts Centre in Stornoway that will showcase works by some of the UK’s leading designers to mark the 100th anniversary of the famous Harris Tweed Orb; recognises that, for a century now, this mark, which by law has to be stamped on every piece of genuine Harris Tweed, has symbolised the quality of what it considers this extraordinary fabric, which is produced and prepared entirely in the Outer Hebrides; is encouraged to note that both operational tweed mills in the islands are finding successful new markets and that Harris Tweed Textiles, based in Carloway, Isle of Lewis, has recently marked the quadrupling of its production in the last year; believes that Harris Tweed is a unique part of the heritage of the Western Isles and that it has an outstanding role to play in promoting the islands around the world, and looks forward to many more successful years in the future for Harris Tweed.
