 * S2M-2903 Dr Jean Turner: TB Testing in Scotland—That the Parliament notes with great concern that NFU Scotland is disappointed with the DEFRA working group recommendations on tackling the threat of bovine tuberculosis by only testing cattle over 15 months of age from high risk areas in England and Wales; urges the Scottish Executive to legislate to introduce pre- and post-movement testing of all cattle coming into Scotland from all high risk areas, irrespective of age, thus preventing a loophole in the legislation, and recognises the need to protect and strengthen the health of Scotland’s cattle and wildlife populations, as well as protecting low risk areas throughout the United Kingdom from losing their low risk status. Supported by: Shiona Baird*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*
