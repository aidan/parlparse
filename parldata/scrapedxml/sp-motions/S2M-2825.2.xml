 * S2M-2825.2 Mark Ballard: Voluntary Sector and the Social Economy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2825) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end “recognises the breadth of the social economy in Scotland; further recognises the distinctive contribution that co-operatives and social enterprises make to the social economy; recommends the development of a differentiated strategy to meet the specific needs of the social enterprise sector of the social economy, and further recommends that such a strategy be developed in partnership with social enterprises and their networks beyond the voluntary sector, be aligned with the development of the Co-operative Development Agency and be aligned with the Department of Trade and Industry’s strategy to support social enterprise across the rest of the United Kingdom.”
