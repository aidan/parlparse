 *S2M-4801 Murdo Fraser: HBOS’s Commitment to Scotland—That the Parliament congratulates Halifax Bank of Scotland (HBOS) for pledging to install 50 new fee-free ATMs in deprived areas across Scotland, which will provide thousands of people in Scotland with free access to their money; believes that the pledge demonstrates HBOS’s corporate social responsibility to the Scottish people; notes that HBOS provides more than half of all social banking accounts in the United Kingdom and works continuously to reduce the number of "unbanked" people in Scotland, underlining its commitment to the financial inclusion of all Scots; congratulates the bank on its contribution to the Scottish economy, and calls on the Scottish Executive to continue to work closely with HBOS and all of Scotland’s banks to increase financial inclusion in Scotland.
