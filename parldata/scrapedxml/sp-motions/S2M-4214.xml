 *S2M-4214 Donald Gorrie: Caledonia Youth—That the Parliament notes with regret that decisions by NHS Greater Glasgow and NHS Tayside have resulted in the closure of Caledonia Youth clinics and sexual health education and advice services, first in Glasgow and now in Dundee; further notes that these services have been widely praised, including by HM Inspectorate of Education, as providing much-needed individual support to young people facing unplanned pregnancy, relationship problems and issues of sexuality and low self-esteem and proving successful in reducing such problems among Caledonia Youth’s clients, and urges the Scottish Executive and the Parliament to show that they take seriously the Executive’s national sexual health strategy, Respect and Responsibility, by ensuring that Caledonia Youth is sustained financially and allowed to contribute towards the national policy.
