*S3M-3103 Dave Thompson: Keep Trade Local this Christmas—That the Parliament congratulates the Federation of Small Businesses in Scotland on its Keep Trade Local – Sustaining Scottish Communities campaign; recognises the contribution of small independent businesses not simply to the local economy but also to the wider community, and encourages MSPs to back their local traders in the current economic difficulties and source their Christmas dinners from small, independent businesses in their constituencies.
