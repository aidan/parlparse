*S2M-3945 Alex Fergusson: Scottish Meat and Sainsbury’s—That the Parliament notes the 30% rise in red meat sales at Sainsbury’s since November 2005, including a 55% rise in the sale of Scotch beef, following a change in policy to promote Scottish beef, lamb and pork more actively; further notes that the consumer is prepared to spend more on high-quality Scottish produce when it is correctly presented and robust information on the origin of the product is available, and believes that Sainsbury’s has introduced a model of retailing Scottish meat which should be followed by all other retailers.
