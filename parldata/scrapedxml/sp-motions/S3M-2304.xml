*S3M-2304 Christine Grahame: Pringle of Scotland No Moreâ€”That the Parliament notes with regret the recent decision by Pringle of Scotland to end production of its manufacturing operations in Hawick, bringing to an end almost 200 years of production in Scotland; notes further that Pringle relies heavily on the "Scottish brand" to market its products and considers that it should desist from using the Lion Rampant emblem and any reference to Scotland in its marketing which, in the circumstances, is entirely misleading, and further urges the Scottish Government to explore all legal avenues to prevent the use of these Scottish references should the company fail to do so voluntarily.
