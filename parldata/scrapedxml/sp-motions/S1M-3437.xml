*S1M-3437# Mr Brian Monteith: Celebration of 400th Anniversary of Union of the Crownsâ€”That the Parliament recognises that the 400th anniversary of the Union of the Crowns will occur in 2003, an event in which the King of Scotland, James VI, acceded to the English throne and became the monarch of Britain; notes that this ultimately led to the Union of the Parliaments in 1707 and over 250 years of peace between the ancient nations of Britain and brought increased prosperity and widened opportunities for Scots in the United Kingdom and abroad, and considers that the Scottish Executive and other public bodies should bring forward a programme of events to mark this important date in Scottish and English history.Supported by: John Scott*, Murdo Fraser*
