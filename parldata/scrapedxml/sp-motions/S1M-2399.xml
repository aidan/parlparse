*S1M-2399# Fergus Ewing: Proposed New Testing System of Scallops-That the Parliament views with extreme concern the proposal from the European Commission (EC) of a new level for testing toxin amounts in scallops of 4.6 micrograms per gram of flesh; notes that the existing level of 20 micrograms has been employed for the last three years and that no single case of amnesic shellfish poisoning has been detected over that period; believes that this new lower limit has not been proposed on the basis of any verifiable scientific data; considers that the Food Standards Agency Scotland (FSA) should report to the Parliament, setting out its views on these new proposals; further believes that if this new level proposed by the EC is implemented it will threaten the livelihood of many fishermen whilst not providing any demonstrable benefit for the purpose of the protection of public health; expresses further concern at the unnecessary complexity of the testing system proposed by the EU Amnesic Shellfish Poisoning Working Group, and finally believes that the consultation by the FSA on whether scallop products should carry a health warning may needlessly put off consumers from eating shellfish and has no function given the record of no single case of poisoning from scallops in the last three years.
