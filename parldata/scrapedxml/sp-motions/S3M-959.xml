*S3M-959 Robert Brown: Prisoners with Learning Difficulties and Learning Disabilities—That the Parliament welcomes the report, No One Knows, produced by the Prison Reform Trust, based on interviews with prison staff in Scotland regarding the identification and support of prisoners with learning difficulties; notes the suggestion that up to 2,250 prisoners out of approximately 7,000 are likely to have a technical learning disability or require some additional support with learning; notes further that all public services, including criminal justice organisations, have a duty under the Disability Discrimination Act 1995 to eliminate discrimination and promote opportunity for disabled people, including those with learning difficulties; is concerned that few systematic procedures appear to be in place in prisons to identify prisoners with learning difficulties or disabilities and that information about this does not accompany most prisoners when they enter prison; is aware that short-term prison sentences militate against effective working with such prisoners; calls on the Scottish Executive to act on the recommendations of the report, and believes that there would be considerable value in a review of the care and treatment of prisoners with learning difficulties and disabilities by HM Inspectorate of Prisons and by the Scottish Commissioner for Equality and Human Rights, as recommended in the report.
