*S2M-4604 Tommy Sheridan: Election of Cuba to UN Human Rights Council—That the Parliament welcomes the recently established UN Human Rights Council and the election of Cuba from among United Nations members to sit on the council; recognises that Cuba’s election to this human rights body is a ringing endorsement of Cuba’s unparalleled record in providing overseas aid and human resources in the fields of health and education to poor and needy nations across the world and its delivery of free health, education and housing to all its citizens, and further notes that the United States of America failed to stand for election to the new human rights body to save the USA from embarrassment in the event of failing to be elected.
