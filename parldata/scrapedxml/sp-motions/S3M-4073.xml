 *S3M-4073 Jackie Baillie: From the Vaults, Whisky and the Scots—That the Parliament congratulates the National Archives of Scotland, the Scotch Whisky Association, John Dewar and Sons Ltd and Diageo plc on bringing together a landmark exhibition, taking place in May and June 2009, that tells the story of Scotch Whisky from its creation, over 500 years ago, through archive treasures held in the vaults of both the National Archives of Scotland and other private industry collections; notes that this includes the famous 515-year-old Exchequer Roll, considered to be the founding document of the industry; further notes that this exhibition gives the public a chance to learn how, over the last five centuries, whisky has become inextricably linked to Scotland’s culture, history and economy, and encourages people from across Scotland to attend the free exhibition at the National Archives of Scotland, West Register House, Charlotte Square, Edinburgh.
