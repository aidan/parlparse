*S3M-5300 Christopher Harvie: New President of the Council of the European Union—That the Parliament congratulates Herman Van Rompuy, Prime Minister of Belgium, on having been selected as the first permanent President of the Council of the European Union; believes that his was the correct appointment; notes his personal interest in the writings of Scottish novelist and politician John Buchan, and expresses the hope that the European Union will become more effective, less bureaucratic and closer to the European people and that Scotland will, in due course, take its place among the other European nations as an independent member state.
