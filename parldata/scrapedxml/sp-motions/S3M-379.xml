*S3M-379 Jackie Baillie: Gender Agenda Campaign—That the Parliament congratulates the Equal Opportunities Commission in Scotland for launching its Gender Agenda campaign; recognises that, while our lives have transformed significantly over the last 30 years and the roles of men and women continue to change, there are still persistent barriers to equality in workplaces and services, illustrated by the power gap which will take almost 200 years to close, the part-time pay gap which will take 30 years to close and the full-time pay gap which will take 20 years; further notes that women working part-time earn 34% less per hour than men working full-time and full-time female employees earn 14% less per hour than men; regrets that the rape conviction rate is currently at an all time low of 3.9% and believes that action must be taken to change this; supports the priority areas of action set out in Gender Agenda, including closing the income gap between men and women, giving better support to families, modernising public services so they meet men’s and women’s needs, providing equal access to justice and safety and sharing power, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take action to support the Gender Agenda campaign.
