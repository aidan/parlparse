*S3M-3579 Bob Doris: Cities and the Town Centre Regeneration Fund—That the Parliament notes the importance of vibrant town centres up and down Scotland in increasing sustainable economic growth; recognises the importance of town centres for local residents and in attracting others to spend their money in the local community; welcomes the Scottish Government’s £60 million Town Centre Regeneration Fund, which will provide a much needed boost to town centres that are feeling the ill effects of the current economic downturn; notes that many city-based town centres suffer from the draw of a large city centre and from out-of-town shopping centres, often leaving the most socially excluded residents in the area using a poor range of facilities; welcomes the Minister for Housing and Communities’ agreement to explore the prospect of city areas being able to apply for money from this fund, and believes that locations in Glasgow such as Springburn Shopping Centre and Victoria Road are just some examples of areas that could benefit.
