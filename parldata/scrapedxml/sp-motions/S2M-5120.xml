*S2M-5120 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Saving Live Music on Radio 3—That the Parliament deplores the proposal to end the broadcasting of live concerts on Radio 3 outside the Prom season; believes that live concerts are an essential part of the BBC’s musical remit; is concerned that ending the broadcasting of live music will reduce the choice of classical music available to listeners and could reduce the number of such concerts, especially in Scotland; believes that it might also reduce the BBC’s commissioning of new music and jeopardise the future of its orchestras and singers; reminds the BBC that its broadcasting policy should not be the plaything of particular controllers; insists that its management undertakes a proper consultation with its listeners and the classical music community before any final decisions are taken, and calls on the BBC’s governors to take this final opportunity before they are abolished to make a stand against yet another example of the dumbing down of the BBC’s cultural programming.
