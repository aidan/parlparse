 *S2M-3719 Carolyn Leckie: UNISON Supports More Powers for the Parliament—That the Parliament notes Devolution - The Next Stage, published by UNISON’s Scottish Committee; welcomes its support for more powers for the Parliament in areas such as equal opportunities, energy, council tax benefit, firearms, drugs, immigration and broadcasting, believing that such powers would be used more progressively by the Scottish Parliament than Westminster; congratulates UNISON on its open-minded and flexible approach to more powers for the people of Scotland and their Parliament; agrees with the statement that devolution is a "process not an event"; further believes that this process will not stop at devolution and that independence for Scotland is inevitable, and looks forward to that day when the people of Scotland flex their right to self-determination and assume all the powers currently vested in Westminster and the Crown for themselves.
