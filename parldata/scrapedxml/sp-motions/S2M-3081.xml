*S2M-3081 Jim Mather: Co-operation Between the Faroe Islands and Scotland—That the Parliament, in recognition of the historic and geographical links between the Scottish island communities of the Western Isles, Shetland and Orkney and the Faroe Islands, a self-governing territory within the state of Denmark, welcomes the transfer of the competency of broad control over foreign policy for the islands from Denmark to the Faroese parliament, the Løgtingið, in addition to its already extensive powers, including the power of negotiation of international agreements and treaties to suit the islands’ unique needs, and congratulates the Faroe Islands, Orkney, Shetland and the Western Isles on the signing of a joint statement on co-operation between the islands on 1 June 2005 to address areas of mutual interest including fisheries, aquaculture, oil, transport, infrastructure, renewable energy, broadcasting and culture.
