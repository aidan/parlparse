 *S3M-1403 Joe FitzPatrick: Ofgem Investigates Energy Companies’ Profits—That the Parliament welcomes the move by the electricity and gas market regulator, Ofgem, to investigate the profits of energy companies; is concerned by reports of anti-competitive practices in the gas and electricity markets; notes that, at a time when energy companies are posting record profits, customers in Scotland are facing increases to their bills; recognises that for every 5% increase in fuel prices an extra 30,000 Scottish households will end up in fuel poverty, and looks forward to the outcome of Ofgem’s investigation.
