 *S3M-4319 Stewart Maxwell: RIP Cigarettes Cut Fire Deathsâ€”That the Parliament acknowledges that 48.1% of fire deaths in Strathclyde and 44.8% of fire deaths across Scotland in 2007-08 were attributable to smoking materials; recognises the impact of legislation introduced in 2005 in Vermont, United States of America, that introduced reduced ignition propensity (RIP) cigarettes, also called fire-safe cigarettes, that resulted in no deaths being attributed to cigarettes in 2007 and 2008, and therefore believes that Scotland should be the first country in Europe to introduce this life-saving technology to its cigarettes.
