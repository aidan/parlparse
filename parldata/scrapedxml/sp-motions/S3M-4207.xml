 *S3M-4207 Anne McLaughlin: Congratulating Mr Ali Ahmed Aslam—That the Parliament congratulates Mr Ali Ahmed Aslam for winning the prestigious Irn-Bru Scottish Curry Awards 2009 Lifetime Achievement Award; believes that it is a fitting tribute to the man who is one of the original curry kings of Glasgow and is famed for introducing us to some of Scotland’s favourite dishes; recognises that Mr Aslam’s contribution to Glasgow’s culinary scene goes back to 1959 with the opening of the Green Gates Restaurant and continues with the popular Shish Mahal restaurant in Glasgow’s West End; believes that through his business and his philanthropic nature Mr Aslam is a fantastic role model for budding entrepreneurs from all communities, and wishes him continued success in the future.
