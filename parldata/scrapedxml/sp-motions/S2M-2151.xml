*S2M-2151 Shona Robison: Time to Care Report and Campaign—That the Parliament supports Breast Cancer Care and the Royal College of Nursing’s Time to Care report and campaign to improve access to breast care nurses for people affected by breast cancer; agrees that the use of breast care nurses represents best practice in cancer care and provides an invaluable service; is concerned at the report’s findings that there is a growing shortage of breast care nurses in the United Kingdom; is further concerned that increasing demands on time and the growth in the number of breast cancer patients are making it progressively more difficult for breast care nurses to give patients the information and support that they need, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review urgently the current number of breast care nurses and establish a recruitment and retention strategy to ensure that there are sufficient breast care nurses for the future.
