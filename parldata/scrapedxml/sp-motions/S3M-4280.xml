*S3M-4280# Trish Godman: Job Losses, Profits and Subsidies at Hewlett-Packard, Erskine—That the Parliament deplores and deeply regrets the short-sighted decision of the management of Hewlett-Packard to dismiss 843 employees at their Erskine site in order to outsource their jobs to plants in the Czech Republic; is well aware of the company’s profits of £5.2 billion in 2008 and of the substantial public funds given to the company based on assurances offered by company representatives in the past; views with scepticism the claim made by management that the remaining jobs at the Renfrewshire plant are comparatively safe; believes that the interests of shareholders will always swamp the needs and expectations of loyal and hard-working employees, and hopes that the dreadful consequences of this decision can be avoided.
