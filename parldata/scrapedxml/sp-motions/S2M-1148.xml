*S2M-1148 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Fire-Safe Cigarettes-That the Parliament congratulates the Canadian Parliament on its recent Bill requiring all cigarettes sold in Canada to be self-extinguishing; recognises that lit cigarettes are the leading cause of fire fatalities within Scotland, and now looks forward to the Scottish Parliament bringing forward similar legislation introducing fire-safe cigarettes and helping to decrease the large number of avoidable deaths within Scotland from the aftermath of lit cigarettes.
