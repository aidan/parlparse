 *S2M-5538 John Swinburne: Maintenance Contracts for Senior Citizens’ Central Heating Systems—That the Parliament expresses concern that maintenance contracts for central heating systems installed under the Scottish Executive’s excellent central heating programme currently cost pensioner households in excess of £200 per annum; recognises that, while this provides peace of mind that their central heating systems are being maintained, it cancels out the benefit of their £200 winter heating allowance, and considers that a 50% reduction in the cost of these maintainance contracts would be of great benefit to hard-pressed senior citizens.
