*S3M-5883 Alasdair Allan: Harris Tweed Weavers Training—That the Parliament welcomes the training course for twelve new Harris Tweed weavers, due to start in Stornoway later this month and funded by the European Social Fund, Skills Development Scotland, Highlands and Islands Enterprise and Comhairle nan Eilean Siar; notes that this course has been developed by Cardonald College in Glasgow, which has recruited two weavers to deliver the training from a specifically set up Stornoway training centre, and that, for the first time, formal training will be available to encourage new weavers into the industry, and considers that, with a strong order book predicted for 2010, new weavers are crucial in an industry that is dependant on a small number of highly skilled, self-employed home weavers to maintain the weaving way of life in the Western Isles.
