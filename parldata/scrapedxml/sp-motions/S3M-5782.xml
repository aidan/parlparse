 * S3M-5782 Jamie Hepburn: UK Financial Investments Ltd—That the Parliament notes with concern the announcement by UK Financial Investments Limited (UKFI) that it does not expect to be able to sell the shares that it holds in The Royal Bank of Scotland Group Plc, Lloyds Banking Group and Northern Rock Plc until 2015; notes that these shares were bought using public funds from the UK Government as part of the Government’s effort to prevent these banks from collapsing; further notes that, with the UK Government as a major shareholder in these institutions, taxpayers’ money is being used to finance investments in a range of companies and businesses including Kraft Foods Inc (which has purchased Cadburys Ltd), Rangers Football Club, the Porterbrook Leasing Company Ltd, which owns rolling stock used on Scotland’s railways, a range of PFI consortia financing projects across Scotland and the preferred bidder for private ownership of the UK Search and Rescue helicopter operations, and believes that the UK Government should ensure that UKFI’s strategy for handling its share ownership does not seek simply to maximise the return to the Government from the eventual sale of these shares, but uses the opportunity to look at the structure of financial investments in public services and key industries as a whole and seeks to ensure maximum value for money and prevent excessive profits being made by private companies using public funds.
