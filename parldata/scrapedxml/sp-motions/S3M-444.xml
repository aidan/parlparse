*S3M-444 Robert Brown: Lack of Local Consultation on Botanic Gardens Lease—That the Parliament strongly regrets the decision by Labour councillors on Glasgow City Council’s Land Services Scrutiny Committee to reject the call by Liberal Democrat, SNP and Green opposition councillors for meaningful consultation with the local community over the lease of a site in Glasgow’s historic Botanic Gardens for a café and nightclub complex; notes the strong objection from the local community to the scale, type and detail of the proposed development which would have a serious and adverse impact on the quality of life of local people; notes the lack of safeguards around the disposal by lease or sale of property held by local authorities on behalf of the public, and calls on Scottish ministers to initiate reform of the law on common good and a more accountable framework to govern the disposal of land by public authorities.
