 *S3M-2968 Keith Brown: Peru Today, Scotland Tomorrow?—That the Parliament notes the decision of FIFA, the international football governing body, to suspend the Peruvian national football association as of 25 November 2008, removing its right to participate in international tournaments; notes with alarm that this was triggered by excessive political intervention by the Peruvian Government, including pressure to elect a national association president of the government’s choice; believes that there are disturbing parallels between this intervention and the pressure being exerted by the UK Government on the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish associations to accept a combined Great Britain Olympic football team, and calls on the UK Government to abandon this stance and allow all football associations on these islands to act without politically-motivated coercion. Supported by: Alasdair Allan*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Bashir Ahmad*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Jamie Hepburn*, Brian Adam*, Stuart McMillan*
