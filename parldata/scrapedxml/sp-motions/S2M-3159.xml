*S2M-3159 Mike Pringle: Gilmerton Field Archery Club—That the Parliament congratulates the members of Gilmerton Field Archery Club of South Edinburgh on their magnificent performance at the European Field Archery Championship in Estonia where they won seven gold medals, three silver and one bronze and set two European records; recognises that their participation in major events such as this is dependent on the club’s own fundraising; supports their attempts to find sponsorship for defence of their titles in Finland next year and to compete in the World Field Archery Championship in Australia, and wishes them well at the Scottish Field Archery Championship in Innerleithen later this month where archers from throughout Scotland will compete.
