 *S2M-3951# Mr Bruce McFee: Student Loan Debt Interest—That the Parliament believes that interest on student loan debt should be frozen in cases where the person is temporarily unable to take up employment due to an illness or medical condition; notes that at present no such mechanism exists; recognises that this adversely affects the lives of students and graduates in the west of Scotland and Scotland as a whole; stresses that, while those who are unable to work due to illness or through conditions such as Asperger’s Syndrome may wish to take up employment and repay their loan at a later stage, increasing the burden of debt through interest only serves to increase anxiety; recognises and appreciates the support for this motion from The Scottish Society for Autism; believes that the current position is unjust and causes increased stress for vulnerable people in society; and considers that the Scottish Executive should take decisive action to change the current student loan regulations.
