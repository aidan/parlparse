 *S1M-787# Ms Margo MacDonald: Standard Life Mutuality—That the Parliament expresses its support for Standard Life, the largest Mutual Insurance Company in Europe and one of the most important financial institutions in Scotland; notes that mutuality allows Standard Life to focus its interests solely on the long term financial security of its members, and further expresses its dismay that this mutuality and success could be threatened by the actions of a few individuals or "carpet-baggers" seeking short-term, individual gain.
