*S3M-5518 Mike Rumbles: Threat to Aberdeen Plastic Surgery and Burns Unit—That the Parliament notes with concern the plans of NHS Grampian to downgrade and downsize the Aberdeen Plastic Surgery and Burns Unit, the unit that looked after many of the survivors of the Piper Alpha disaster; further notes that the plans are proceeding in the face of grave reservations from the unit’s consultants; recognises the important work carried out by the unit, which undertakes complex reconstruction of cancer cases, trauma cases and burns as well as work in areas such as hand surgery, breast reconstruction and head and neck surgery; believes that the unit, which serves the needs of over half a million people from the Northern Isles to Aberdeen, cannot continue to offer the full range of services if its beds are reduced by 40% as currently planned; considers that the contraction of the plastic surgery provision in Aberdeen, while it is expanded in the central belt, would lead to unacceptable inequalities of service levels across Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Government and NHS Grampian to work constructively with the consultants and staff in the unit to revise the plans to allow the unit to maintain and build on the work that it currently carries out.
