 * S2M-2887 Alex Neil:Arrest of Paul Foreman in Sudan—That the Parliament condemns the actions of the Sudanese authorities for arresting Paul Foreman of Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) for publishing what they claim is a “false” report that identifies over 500 incidences of rape in the Darfur region in a four-and-a-half-month period; calls on the international community to do all it can to bring pressure to bear on the government of Sudan and press for a rescinding of all charges laid against Paul Foreman; congratulates MSF for the work it has done to highlight the appalling abuse of women that is ongoing in Darfur which the United Nations has also identified as happening on a regular basis, and utterly condemns those involved in these crimes against humanity.
