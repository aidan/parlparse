*S3M-4016 Patrick Harvie: Sustrans School Travel Survey—That the Parliament welcomes the launch by Sustrans of the results of the first ever Scottish national survey into school travel; welcomes the fact that more children now travel to school by active travel methods such as walking, cycling and scooter than those who travel by car, bus or taxi; further welcomes the fact that the number of children cycling and walking to school has been found to be higher than previously expected; recognises the importance of active travel to school in combating traffic congestion, air pollution and childhood obesity; congratulates Sustrans on the success of its Tackling the School Run programme of projects with 103 schools across Scotland, which has doubled on average the use of cycling and walking routes around project schools, enabled 135,690 more cycling and walking trips to school and has ensured that 30,929 young Scots now have access to safer walking and cycling routes to school, and calls on the Scottish Government to commit additional resources to support and promote active and sustainable travel to school for those many young people who do not yet have access to safe routes.
