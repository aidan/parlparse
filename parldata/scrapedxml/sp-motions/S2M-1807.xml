 *S2M-1807# Marilyn Livingstone: National Construction Week, 6 to 13 October 2004—That the Parliament supports National Construction Week from 6 to 13 October 2004 and recognises the many economic advantages for Scotland that an expanding construction industry will bring, notably in employment preservation and creation, training, skills and provision of the built environment; acknowledges the continuing work of the Cross Party Group on Construction which considers and debates all appropriate issues concerning the structure and operation of the construction industry in Scotland as they may affect all relevant stakeholders; supports the industry’s schemes to register construction firms through the Construction Licensing Executive and workers through approved registration schemes, thereby protecting the public by eradicating rogue traders, enhancing the industry’s image and improving the skills base and health and safety practices, and acknowledges that the Scottish Executive, local authorities and other government bodies can assist by supporting registration schemes by insisting that all public works contractors are committed to them, supporting the education and training infrastructure so that it meets Scotland’s construction requirements, acting as an enlightened client by ensuring, where possible, that there are advance programmes of work on which the industry can plan its skills requirements and provide its workforce with security of employment and ensuring that public works contracts are fair, open, effective and straightforward to administer and deliver.
