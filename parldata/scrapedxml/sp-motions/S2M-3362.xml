*S2M-3362 Robin Harper: NICE Report on Drug Treatments for Children—That the Parliament congratulates the British Psychological Society’s (BPS) Faculty for Children and Young People on its successful conference on child psychology held in Edinburgh on 15 and 16 September 2005; notes, in relation to this conference, the conclusions of the National Institute for Clinical Excellence (NICE) report published on 28 September 2005 in relation to the provision of drug treatments to young children suffering from depression, conclusions that clearly recommend maximising of the benefits of using the skills of clinical psychologists before using drugs, however safe and effective these treatments may be, and calls on the Scottish Executive to make the necessary resources available to the NHS in order to implement such a change in health policy, in the interests of the mental health of all young people, and to take note of other conclusions from the September BPS conference, especially in relation to early recognition of, and pre-emptive treatments for, children who are likely to develop mental health problems, ensuring that the principles outlined in the National Framework for Children and Young People’s Mental Health, due to be launched in October, are consistent with this and that efforts to improve and expand the workforce so as to deliver appropriate psychological interventions early on in the problem cycle are resourced adequately.
