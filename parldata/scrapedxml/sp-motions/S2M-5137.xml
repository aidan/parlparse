*S2M-5137 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Support and Protection for Victims of Sex Crimesâ€”That the Parliament recognises the trauma caused to victims of sex abuse; recognises that counselling can help with this trauma and should be provided free to all victims of sex abuse and their families; calls for a dedicated counselling service for victims of sex abuse and their families to be established across the country; recognises that the process of giving evidence in sex abuse trials can add to the stress of victims and their families, and calls on the legal system to recognise this and to do all it can to reduce stress, including the provision of separate waiting areas for victims and families, and accused sex offenders and proper support services to victims and their families including full explanation of the court procedures and notification of court decisions.
