*S3M-5187 Sarah Boyack: City of Edinburgh Council Care Package Tendering Process—That the Parliament notes the City of Edinburgh Council’s decision to change the care packages of 800 vulnerable people across the city; expresses its concerns at reports that some of the successful bidders for the provision of care packages lack the specialist skills and experience of their predecessors; further expresses concern at the council’s decision to suspend until March 2010 direct payments to individuals who wish to arrange their own care despite issuing letters to those in receipt of care informing them that staff would be on hand to deal with increased applications before the contract changes took effect; further expresses concern at proposals in the council’s report into the tendering process that recommend that direct payments be cut by 20%, a move that impacts on all service users and limits choice, particularly for those who require a substantial amount of support; recognises that the relationship between a carer and cared-for individual is built on trust that is gained over time and that a change in care provider can cause significant disruption and anxiety, and urges the council to fully consider the implications of the report at its meeting on 19 November 2009.
