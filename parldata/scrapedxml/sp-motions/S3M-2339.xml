 *S3M-2339 Helen Eadie: Salmond’s Government Has No Compassion for Disabled People—That the Parliament deplores that in the 21st century the clock is being turned back so that disabled people are apparently the least cared about by this SNP government; further deplores that all those disabled people in Scotland who now for the first time, under a Nationalist government, will face assessments of income in order to determine which scale of fees will apply for essential services that, under the previous Labour-led Scottish Executive, were provided free of charge and without any age discrimination; recognises that the age discrimination against disabled people must be investigated as a matter of urgency, and hopes that all those disabled people in the Fife region and, in particular, the towns of Lochgelly and Dalgety Bay, will act as champions supported by their local elected representatives and pursue this very important issue with every relevant agency conceivable until this disgraceful policy is reversed.
