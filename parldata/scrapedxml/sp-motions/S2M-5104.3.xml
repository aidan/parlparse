*S2M-5104.3 Tommy Sheridan: Housing Stock Transferâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-5104) in the name of Colin Fox, insert at end "further believes that building new good-quality and affordable homes to rent without ending the damaging right-to-buy policy will not produce a sustainable supply of houses to rent in the future, and therefore believes that right-to-buy discounts should be replaced immediately with right-to-rent discounts at the same rate to reward long-term tenants and encourage demand in the rented sector, that houses under local authority control and management represent real social and community ownership and democratic control and that all tenants misled into supporting stock transfer in Glasgow and the Western Isles should be offered the opportunity of returning to council control via democratic ballot."
