*S3M-7449 Marilyn Livingstone: Investment in Social Housingâ€”That the Parliament considers that continuing to invest in social housing is important and that significant economic and social benefits arise from housing investment and activity; commends the Fife Housing Association Alliance (FHAA) for delivering, in partnership with Fife Council, 1,300 new homes over the last five years; considers that the FHAA has created an appropriate partnership framework and structures that guarantee the delivery of quality affordable housing in Fife; notes with concern the representations made by the FHAA that, without continuing support from the Scottish Government, its success and ability to continue to deliver affordable social housing will be jeopardised; advocates that housing policy and funding allocations should primarily be driven by the needs of lower-income households that cannot afford the costs of housing without financial assistance, and believes that a properly funded housing policy based on such principles delivers good quality housing, thereby improving health, educational chances, employment opportunities and general wellbeing.
