*S1M-2324 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Clarkston Disaster, October 1971-That the Parliament notes the 30th anniversary of the Clarkston Disaster in October, 1971, one of the most shocking moments in modern Scottish history when a normal day of shopping at a local centre exploded into one of the worst gas disasters ever suffered; pays tribute to the families of those who died for the long years in which they have endured the loss of wives, mothers and fathers; remembers the many injured, some of whom are afflicted to this day by the severe injuries which they received; further notes that the indelible memories of those who were present that day included witnessing the courage and compassion of police, fire and ambulance services and also the loving care of the people of Clarkston and the WRVS for the wounded, and regrets that no proper memorial exists for the dead of the Clarkston disaster and questions why not.
