*S3M-3988 Jim Hume: A New Vision for the Devil’s Beef Tub—That the Parliament commends the Borders Forest Trust’s plans to purchase the iconic landscape feature, the Devil’s Beef Tub, and the surrounding land at Corehead in the spectacular Southern upland hills near Moffat; notes that once the land is purchased the trust plans to manage the area ecologically, integrating the restoration of natural habitats with traditional low intensity farming and local community-based food production; recognises that the project will see significant increases in biodiversity and the return of many native species to the hills and valleys of Corehead; congratulates the trust on raising £462,000 in private and charitable donations, and wishes the trust well in raising a further £238,000 to complete this special purchase.
