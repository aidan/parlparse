 *S3M-1949 Ken Macintosh: Walk to School Week—That the Parliament applauds pupils and parents in East Renfrewshire and across Scotland in supporting Walk to School Week from 19 to 23 May 2008; congratulates the walk to school campaign in this its 13th year but notes that over 50% of children still don’t walk to school regularly; notes that cars consume most fuel and pollute more at the start of their journeys and that therefore walking for short journeys will reduce the amount of CO2 emissions by a disproportionate amount; further notes that nearly 30% of children aged two to 15 are classed as overweight or obese, and commends the efforts that have been made by schools and local authorities across the UK in not only supporting the walk to school campaign but in working to establish safe routes to school for all pupils all year round.
