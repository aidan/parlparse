*S3M-5003 Mary Scanlon: Forres in Bloom Wins Entente Florale Europe Gold Awardâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Forres in Bloom on being awarded a prestigious gold award by the Entente Florale Europe competition judges; notes that this is an invitation only competition and that Forres was the only Scottish representative; further notes that the town was invited to compete in the European event after consecutive wins in the Scotland in Bloom and Britain in Bloom contests; recognises that the judges were particularly impressed by the woodland, well-maintained open spaces for informal activity and high-quality seasonal planting schemes, providing wonderful colour throughout the year along with a high level of community involvement, and praises the work of the Forres in Bloom committee and all the many volunteers who work tirelessly throughout the year and whose efforts have been recognised by this award, one of only six gold medals awarded across Europe for the whole of the competition, in which 24 countries took part.
