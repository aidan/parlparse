*S3M-4346 Ian McKee: European Parliament Elections in Scotland—That the Parliament congratulates Scotland’s elected Members of the European Parliament who will serve a term of five years representing Scotland in Europe; considers that, while in parts of the United Kingdom the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) and the British National Party (BNP) won numerous seats, in Scotland they completely failed to make ground with their campaigns, widely considered to be eurosceptic and racist, and were humiliated by coming in the bottom end of the list, with UKIP’s share of the vote falling since the 2004 European elections; considers that this poll demonstrates a clear diversity of political attitude and culture, and believes that Scotland, unlike other parts of the UK, remains predominantly a pro-European nation that rejects extremist views and agendas and recognises the importance of EU membership.
