 *S2M-3163 Pauline McNeill: Glasgow’s Bid for Commonwealth Games—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Executive’s decision to back Glasgow’s bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games; notes the research into the feasibility of the bid which suggests there are significant regeneration opportunities for Glasgow, including 1,000 jobs, 4% growth in tourism and the development of new and upgraded sports facilities; further notes that the 6,000 athletes who compete would be housed in 1,500 residential units which would be used for social rented and private housing after the games; believes that a successful bid will also bring social change across the city and opportunities to promote sporting excellence across Glasgow, particularly to our young people to engage them in sports and activities they might otherwise never enjoy; further believes that it will also help us tackle ill-health across the city by encouraging everyone to participate in regular exercise and take other healthy lifestyle actions, and considers that a successful bid will also bring benefit to the wider Scottish economy, Scottish sport and the population of Scotland.
