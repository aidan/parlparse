 *S2M-3593 Shiona Baird: Safe Haven for Trafficked Women in Glasgow—That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow City Council on its establishment of a 30-day "safe haven" for women trafficked into the sex trade so that they can receive medical assistance, legal guidance and counselling; notes that the Home Office has dispensed with its usual immigration rules in this instance so that trafficked foreign women will be afforded assistance and support to escape from the sex trade rather than face instant deportation; commends this initiative for reflecting a core tenet of a recent Council of Europe Directive on the trafficking of human beings, despite it not being Home Office policy, and urges the Scottish Executive to put pressure on the UK Government to adopt this humanitarian directive and expedite the removal of all legal obstacles to the establishment of safe havens for trafficked women in Scotland. Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Tommy Sheridan*, Fiona Hyslop*, Ms Sandra White*, Eleanor Scott*, Robin Harper*, Chris Ballance*
