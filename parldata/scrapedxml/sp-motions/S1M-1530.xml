*S1M-1530 Tommy Sheridan: Rankin Maternity Unit, Inverclyde Royal Hospital—That the Parliament notes with great regret the possible closure of the Rankin Maternity Unit at Inverclyde Royal Hospital and notes that, as Inverclyde already has one of the worst health records in Britain, any closure can only exacerbate this situation; further notes that in particular the loss of specialised local knowledge which staff have built up over many years would be a devastating blow to the community, while the long and expensive journeys for women and families to the proposed unit in Paisley would put unbearable strain on them at an already stressful time, with potential consequences for their unborn children; further regards it as inconceivable that an area the size of Inverclyde would be left without any maternity service, and therefore fully supports the campaign to Save the Rankin in Inverclyde with the aim of keeping vital services and jobs in the community and supporting staff who provide the high standard of health provision to users of the Rankin Maternity Unit.
