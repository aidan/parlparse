*S3M-7074 Johann Lamont: Pope Benedict XVI - Glasgow and Scotland Shine—That the Parliament acknowledges the significance of the visit of Pope Benedict XVI for members of the Roman Catholic Church, for people of all faiths and for Scotland; celebrates the enthusiasm and warmth of the welcome that Pope Benedict received; recognises the hard work of the Roman Catholic Church, local parishioners and the many volunteers who helped make the visit such a success, and, in particular, considers that Glasgow City Council was hugely effective in its organisation on the day, for which it congratulates it, and ensured that the ability of Glasgow to host such important occasions with efficiency, attention to detail and confidence was further reinforced and that the beauty and hospitality of Glasgow, that "dear green place", were given global attention and admiration.
