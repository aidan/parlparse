 *S3M-3958.1 James Kelly: Scottish Government and STUC—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3958) in the name of Linda Fabiani, leave out from "the support" to end and insert "that the Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) has been calling on the Scottish Government to establish a Scottish Investment Bank for some time; considers that the Scottish Government’s proposed Scottish Investment Bank comprises the rebranding of three existing funds that will continue to operate in their own right; urges the Scottish Government to explain how the proposed bank will raise funds and create jobs, and welcomes the STUC’s enthusiastic welcome of the substantial measures in the UK Budget aimed at rebalancing the UK taxation framework and the assistance aimed at boosting growth in offshore wind farms and carbon capture and storage."
