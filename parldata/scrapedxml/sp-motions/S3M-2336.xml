*S3M-2336 George Foulkes: 400th Stonewall Diversity Championâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the British Army on becoming the 400th Stonewall Diversity Champion, demonstrating its commitment to supporting all of its current and future employees; notes that this a remarkable achievement in light of the fact that less than 10 years ago lesbian and gay people were banned from the army; believes that the road to equality is a long one but recognises the substantial achievements of the Labour government in ensuring that equality and diversity are valued and protected at all levels of our society, and supports the UK Equality Bill which aims to make it easier for people to access their rights and be afforded the dignity and respect that they rightfully deserve.
