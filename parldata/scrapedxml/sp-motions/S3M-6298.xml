*S3M-6298 Marilyn Livingstone: Changes to the Provision and Delivery of Care for Children with Cystic Fibrosis in Scotland—That the Parliament notes with concern the closure of Ward 6B of Yorkhill Hospital, Glasgow, which accommodated young people with cystic fibrosis; acknowledges that the nursing staff of the ward have been dispersed across other wards in the hospital, which will result in patients with cystic fibrosis being admitted to alternative accommodation and possibly being nursed by staff with little or no knowledge of cystic fibrosis; understands that it is vital for those providing care for people with cystic fibrosis to have an in-depth understanding of the condition and to comprehend the importance of segregation of this group of patients and the necessary steps to take to avoid cross-infection; is further concerned at changes to the role of cystic fibrosis specialist nurses who are reportedly being directed to spend 20% of their time undertaking ward duties in Yorkhill Hospital and the Royal Hospital for Sick Children in Edinburgh; considers that, as a result of this directive, the ability of specialist nurses to provide a comprehensive package of care will be compromised and that the current situation falls below the UK and European standards of care for those with cystic fibrosis.
