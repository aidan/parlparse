*S2M-5779.4 Patrick Harvie: Scotland in the United Kingdomâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-5779) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "the United Kingdom" to end and insert "all political parties receive electoral support from people with a range of views on the constitution; considers therefore that the constitutional future of Scotland is a matter best decided by the people of Scotland through a referendum; believes that, regardless of the constitutional future chosen by the people of Scotland, there is a strong case for devolving power from government to local communities throughout Scotland, and considers that government in Scotland, whether under the current devolved arrangements or in an independent future, can do far more to empower communities than has been done to date."
