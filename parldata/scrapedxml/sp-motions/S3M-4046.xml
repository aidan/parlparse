*S3M-4046 Aileen Campbell: Withdrawal of UK Troops from Iraq—That the Parliament welcomes the withdrawal of UK troops from Iraq on 30 April 2009, six years after the start of the UK and US invasion of the country in 2003; recognises the bravery of members of the armed forces who served and gave their lives in Iraq; notes that no weapons of mass destruction have ever been found since the invasion; regrets the massive loss of life among both military personnel and civilians in the country; reiterates its call for an immediate public inquiry into the UK Government’s decision to take military action in Iraq in 2003; believes that hostile military action of this nature, in the face of massive international opposition, should never again be perpetrated, and calls on all levels of government in the United Kingdom and across the world to continue to work for peace and stability in Iraq and across the Middle East.
