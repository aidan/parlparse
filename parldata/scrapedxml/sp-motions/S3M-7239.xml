*S3M-7239 Christine Grahame: Fireworks and Furry Fings—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals campaign to change the law on the use of fireworks; notes that the law currently allows people to use fireworks on any day of the week between the hours of 7 am and 11 pm with no regard to the impact on domestic and wild animals; believes that the use of fireworks should be restricted to festivals and special events such as 5 November, New Year’s Eve, Chinese New Year and the Hindu festival of Diwali; considers that this proposed change would ensure that pet owners could plan to keep pets indoors, and hopes that the general public will ensure that fireworks are used carefully and responsibly, recognising the obvious dangers they can pose to both people and animals.
