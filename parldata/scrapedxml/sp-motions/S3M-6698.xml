*S3M-6698 Hugh Henry: BT Rewards—That the Parliament is concerned that BT is demonstrating insensitivity to staff and customers in the rewards given to senior staff and directors; regrets the 79% increase in reward to the chief executive officer with a £850,000 per annum salary and an annual bonus of £1,206,000; believes that there is no justification for the amounts paid to board members, including Sir Michael Rake, £670,000, Hanif Lalani, £1,166,000, and Patricia Hewitt, £128,000, and further believes that the UK Government should investigate ways of restricting such corporate excesses.
