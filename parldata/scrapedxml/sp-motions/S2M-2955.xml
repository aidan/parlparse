 * S2M-2955 Mrs Nanette Milne: Men’s Health Week, 13 to 19 June 2005—That the Parliament welcomes Men’s Health Week which runs from 13 to 19 June 2005; notes that the campaign is being run by the Men’s Health Forum which aims to make men more aware of possible symptoms and encourages them to seek advice from a doctor as soon as possible, and further notes that the 2005 campaign aims to increase men’s awareness of weight issues and obesity which, it is estimated, will affect over 75% of the male UK population by 2010.
