*S2M-2736 Cathy Jamieson: Supporting Safer, Stronger Communities: Reform of Scotland’s Criminal Justice Services—That the Parliament believes that building safer, stronger communities is vital for Scotland’s well-being and future success; supports the reform package set out in the Criminal Justice Plan to promote the swifter delivery of sentences that are effective in reducing reoffending and supporting rehabilitation; recognises that violence, particularly knife crime, damages the daily life of already disadvantaged communities, and believes that co-ordinated action to tackle violence and knife crime must be stepped up in communities across Scotland.
