 *S3M-1873 Jamie Hepburn: Annual World Elder Abuse Awareness Day—That the Parliament notes the third Annual World Elder Abuse Awareness Day (WEAAD), taking place on 15 June 2008, as a way to give abuse and neglect of older adults a global relevance that will sustain and move prevention efforts forward throughout the whole year; notes with concern estimates by Action on Elder Abuse that at least 500,000 older people in the United Kingdom and at least 20,000 in Ireland suffer such abuse; believes that persistent campaigning by older people’s groups has helped to raise awareness and to begin to tackle this issue, and calls on people across Scotland to support Elder Abuse Awareness Day and all efforts to end abuse of older people.
