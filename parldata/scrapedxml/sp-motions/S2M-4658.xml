 *S2M-4658 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Green Coal—That the Parliament recognises the role that green coal can play as part of a mixed energy policy which excludes nuclear power; notes that blending biomass with coal gives an immediate reduction of 20% in carbon emissions; acknowledges that this would contribute to a reduction in Scotland’s carbon emissions and would go part of the way to allowing Scotland to meet its Kyoto Protocol commitments, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should immediately promote a policy within the coal industry of blending biomass with coal as part of a longer-term green coal policy in the south of Scotland.
