*S2M-5245 Frances Curran: Rendition Flights Inquiry—That the Parliament notes that the preliminary report of Claudio Fava, Rapporteur to the European Parliament’s temporary committee investigating CIA activity in Europe, has found that EU member states, including the United Kingdom, have failed to fully co-operate with his investigation, failed to carry out independent investigations of their own and failed to hold their own security services to account for their role in facilitating renditions; agrees with Amnesty International’s conclusion that the report is a damning indictment of the UK’s complicity in CIA renditions, and calls on the Scottish Executive to stop ignoring the issue and to set in train a full, independent investigation into all aspects of rendition involving Scottish airports.
