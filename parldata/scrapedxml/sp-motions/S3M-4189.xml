*S3M-4189 Ian McKee: Migration and Scotland—That the Parliament acknowledges the Equality and Human Rights Commission conference that took place in Edinburgh on 13 May 2009, which highlighted the importance of migration to Scotland and called for potential consideration and research into adapting immigration control to a Scottish context; notes that Scotland’s long-term GDP growth performance is closely affected by population trends and that, in comparison to the rest of the United Kingdom, Scotland has seen a population decline between 1995 and 2001, with considerably fewer people aged 14 and under and an increased number over the age of 65; further notes that the UK as a whole does not suffer from a population shortfall and benefits from a considerably larger migrant population; observes that the UK Minister of State for Borders and Immigration announced that Labour will not allow the UK’s population to rise above 70 million; believes that both the UK Government and the Conservative party immigration policies are in stark contrast with Scotland’s economic and demographic needs and that these policies could damage Scotland’s long-term economy, and considers that devolving certain aspects of immigration control to the Scottish Parliament would address the distinct immigration needs of Scotland in order to achieve a long-term economically viable and sustainable country.
