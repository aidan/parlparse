 *S1M-1179 Christine Grahame: Barlinnie and Overcrowding—That the Parliament notes the evidence of Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Prisons for Scotland to the Justice and Home Affairs Committee on 11 September 2000 in speaking to his Annual Report, further notes his concerns regarding Barlinnie Prison, namely the highest level of overcrowding in Scotland (currently 17.5%), the conditions for prisoners on remand, the further 12 month postponement of the end of "slopping out", and the failure to reopen "B" Hall, itself half the size of some prisons in Scotland; acknowledges his view that "For reasons of safety and decency there must be change. The problems at Barlinnie have gone on for long enough", and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive as a matter of urgency to respond to his concerns.
