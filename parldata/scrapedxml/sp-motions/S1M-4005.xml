*S1M-4005 Michael Russell: William Symington and the Charlotte Dundas—That the Parliament recognises that 28 March 2003 marks the bicentenary of the birth of steam transport; further recognises that this is the anniversary of an event that took place in Scotland; notes that, on 28 March 1803, the voyage of William Symington’s steam tug Charlotte Dundas, towing the sloops Active and Euphemia on the Forth and Clyde Canal from Castlecary to Port Dundas in Glasgow, was an event of immense significance for the world; is aware that the anniversary of the birth of steam transport in the United States of America, which took place more than four years later, is already being prepared for and will be celebrated in major style; considers that the completion of the three-quarters model of the Charlotte Dundas, parts of which are in Falkirk museum, would be a useful and positive start to commemorating both William Symington and the bicentenary, greatly complement the modern engineering achievement that is the Millennium Wheel at Falkirk and enhance and promote Scotland as a place of engineering excellence and the cradle of the industrial revolution, and, therefore, given the Scottish Executive's support for publicly commemorating other historic anniversaries, calls on the First Minister to respond speedily and positively to the letter on this matter that was sent to him by, amongst others, Professor Christopher Smout, Professor Tom Devine, Professor W Hamish Fraser, Professor Ted Cowan, Professor Christopher Harvie, Professor Anthony Slaven, Professor Roland Paxton, Lord Morgan of Aberdyfi, John R Hume (former Inspector of Monuments, Scottish Heritage), William S Harvey (engineer and biographer of William Symington), Guthrie Hutton (historian of Scotland’s millennium canals), George Rosie (historian and novelist), Michael S Moss (archivist, University of Glasgow), Richard Finlay (senior lecturer in Scottish history, Strathclyde University), Dugald MacMillan (former Principal, Glasgow School of Art), Fiona Watson (senior lecturer in history, University of Stirling) and Campbell Christie (former General Secretary, Scottish Trades Union Congress).
