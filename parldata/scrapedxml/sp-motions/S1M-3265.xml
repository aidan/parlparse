 *S1M-3265# Robin Harper: World Summit on Sustainable Development—That the Parliament recognises the importance to global social and environmental justice of the World Summit on Sustainable Development, Rio +10, in Johannesburg in August 2002; welcomes the First Minister’s decision to attend the summit; notes the publication by Scotland’s leading environmental organisations, Friends of the Earth, the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, the Scottish Wildlife Trust and WWF, of the Must Try Harder report card on Scotland’s progress toward sustainability, and considers that the Scottish Executive should consider adopting the report’s urgent 10 point action plan to demonstrate Scotland’s commitment to achieving sustainability.
