S1M-1468# Mr Kenneth Gibson: Raw Deal for Glasgow—That the Parliament notes the decision of the Minister for Finance and Local Government to present Glasgow with a percentage increase in Aggregate External Finance for 2001-02 to 2003-04 which is substantially below the Scottish average; is aware that Glasgow in financial year 2003-2004 will receive £72 per capita less in real terms than in 1996-97; notes that council tax in Glasgow has risen by 36% since 1996-97, compared to the Scottish average of 25.1% over that period, taking it from the third highest to the highest in Scotland and that, according to the City Council itself, council tax will have to rise by twice the rate of inflation to prevent service cuts in 2001-02, placing an unfair burden on Glasgow’s already hard-pressed council tax payers; is aware that Glasgow has already had to implement service cuts of £242.7 million from 1996-97 to 2000-2001 and shed 2327 full-time equivalent posts, net, from December 1996 to September 1999; appreciates that Glasgow has, in common with other councils, had to fund new burdens, such as self-financing pay awards and new statutory responsibilities such as those imposed by the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 in recent years; accepts that Glasgow has more than half of Scotland’s areas of deprivation with only 12% of its population and that it requires resourcing that reflects this; agrees with Glasgow City Council’s leader that the Scottish Executive is "walking away from its own social inclusion agenda" in relation to its 2001-02 to 2003-04 local government settlement for Glasgow and urges the Scottish Executive to act immediately to ensure that Glasgow City Council’s 2001-02 to 2003-04 local government funding settlement is increased to a level commensurate with Glasgow’s economic and social needs.
