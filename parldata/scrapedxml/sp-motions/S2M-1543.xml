*S2M-1543 John Swinburne: Access by Senior Citizens to Physical Activity-That the Parliament is concerned at the current disparity in access to swimming facilities for senior citizens across Scotland; believes that any barriers to positive physical activity for older people are unacceptable, particularly financial barriers which result in the exclusion of groups such as senior citizens who are on low or fixed incomes; agrees that all local authorities should provide free access to activities like swimming, in light of the Scottish Executive's strategy of improving the public health of Scotland through diet and physical activity; congratulates South Lanarkshire Council on offering free swimming to all senior citizens residing in the local authority area, and therefore calls on the Executive to ensure that all local authorities positively promote physical activity amongst older people by also offering free swimming.
