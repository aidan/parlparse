 *S2M-1990 Irene Oldfather: Framework Convention on Tobacco Control—That the Parliament notes that the UK Government is a signatory and strong supporter of the World Health Organisation’s Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC); welcomes the fact that France, Hungary, Malta and Slovenia have now ratified the treaty; regrets that other EU Member States have not yet formally endorsed the principles of the FCTC; urges the Scottish Executive to do all that it can in discussion with Her Majesty’s Government to encourage formal ratification which would act as a catalyst to other member states; notes that the FCTC calls on its signatories to eliminate the illicit trade in tobacco products, end tobacco advertising and ban tobacco sales to and by minors; further notes that the principles of the FCTC are endorsed by the Executive’s policy as set out in the Tobacco Action Plan, and recognises that the global application of the FCTC will result in reducing the number of people who die as a result of smoking-related illnesses each year.
