*S2M-1896# Ms Sandra White: Proposals to Deregulate Gambling—That the Parliament notes with concern the recent publication of the Gambling Bill by Her Majesty’s Government; notes that the deregulation of gambling proposed in this Bill will lead to more casinos being built and that it is highly likely that more problem gambling will result; further notes with concern the dismissal of the legitimate concerns of those opposed to the proposals by Tessa Jowell, the Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport, as being "a whiff of snobbery", and believes that such comments are unworthy of a government minister and should be retracted.
