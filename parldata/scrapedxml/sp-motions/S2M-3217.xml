*S2M-3217 Mark Ballard: Folding Bicyclesâ€”That the Parliament notes that folding bicycles are a useful part of an integrated, sustainable transport system; further notes that such folding bicycles reduce to the size of a medium suitcase; additionally notes that, while other objects of similar size are allowed onto buses, travellers with folding bicycles are frequently refused access to buses with their bicycles, and calls on bus companies to revise any such policy that operates to the detriment of integrated sustainable transport.
