*S2M-1943.3 Shiona Baird: Domestic Abuse Services—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1943) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "recognises" to end and insert "notes with concern that, despite Scottish Executive initiatives, domestic abuse continues to be widespread; recognises the recent public opinion poll from Amnesty International showing the level of complacency in society about domestic abuse; believes that tackling domestic abuse will require concerted effort by the Executive including a continued focus on public education and awareness-raising, in particular focusing on education and involving non-perpetrating men, along with extending support for those experiencing domestic abuse; welcomes the Executive’s recent announcement of £6 million funding for children and young people experiencing domestic abuse but calls on the Executive to detail as soon as possible how this funding will be allocated; notes with concern that there is no national funding strategy for domestic abuse services, that funding for Women’s Aid groups throughout Scotland is often on a yearly basis and that the quality of service varies widely according to local authority area and calls on the Executive to put in place a national funding strategy, and recognises that, to tackle domestic abuse effectively, Executive policy-making needs to take into account the interlinkages between all types of gender-based violence and continue to broaden its focus to encompass to all forms of violence against women including those in vulnerable minorities."
