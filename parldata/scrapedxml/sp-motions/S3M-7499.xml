*S3M-7499 Maureen Watt: People’s Postcode Lottery Welcomes the Woodland Trust Scotland as New Charity Partner—That the Parliament welcomes the recent announcement that the Woodland Trust Scotland has been named the People’s Postcode Lottery’s new charity partner; considers that the Woodland Trust Scotland can now count itself among a distinguished repertoire of charity partners that are supported by the lottery in Scotland, including CHILDREN 1ST, Missing People in Scotland, Maggie’s Cancer Caring Centres, WWF Scotland, the Scottish Wildlife Trust and the People’s Postcode Trust; considers that the unrestricted nature of the People’s Postcode Lottery funding means that the charity partners, such as the Woodland Trust Scotland, can target support where they feel that it is needed the most; understands that this commitment of support from the lottery and its players will be a huge boost to the Woodland Trust Scotland in helping to create new native woodland and maintaining the 80 woods, covering an area of 8,500 hectares of Scottish countryside, under its purview, and fully supports this partnership and continued investment in good causes by the People’s Postcode Lottery across Scotland.
