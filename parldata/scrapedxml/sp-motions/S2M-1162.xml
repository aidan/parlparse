*S2M-1162 Robin Harper: Sustainable Development Commission Report-That the Parliament welcomes the report by the UK Sustainable Development Commission, Shows Progress - But Must Try Harder; agrees with the commission's criticism of government's fundamental belief that economic growth should be the driving force behind all policy decisions; agrees that far more effort needs to be made to differentiate between sustainable growth that generates wealth and social benefits without damaging the environment and unsustainable growth that damages people's real quality of life; notes that, of the twenty specific challenges for government laid down by the Commission, more than half fall within the power of the Scottish Executive; notes that challenge 9 of the report calls specifically on devolved administrations to "turn the initial strategies for sustainability that they have formulated into central and effective drivers for change over the next five years", and calls on the Executive to take up that challenge and for the Sub-Committee on a Sustainable Scotland to publish a response that addresses the other challenges that fall within its powers.
