*S2M-4560 Christine Grahame: Buried News—That the Parliament notes, and expresses its disgust at, the announcement by the Minister for Health and Community Care of the closure of the Coldstream and Jedburgh cottage hospitals at exactly the same time that the Parliament was debating the Waverley Railway (Scotland) Bill; recognises that this was a shabby and relatively successful ploy to bury this bad news for eastern Borderers; recognises that this decision ignores the communities’ wishes, as expressed in meetings, including with the Minister, marches and petitions, and also ignores the thrust of the Kerr report on keeping such services local and comes and at a time when services for elderly people in the Borders are overstretched, and therefore calls for the coalition government to respect those communities and reverse the decision. Supported by: Jim Mather*, Brian Adam*, Mr Bruce McFee*, Mr Stewart Maxwell*
