*S1M-3553 Tommy Sheridan: Education Standards in Cuba-That the Parliament notes the comments of a Wiltshire County Council spokeswoman in relation to primary school education in Cuba when she said "Cuba has a 97% literacy rate which is better than ours in many areas of the country"; further notes the result of research by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office which found Cuba to be a "beacon of education best practice", and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to arrange a fact-finding visit similar to that currently under way by 10 teachers from across Wiltshire County Council, paid for by the British Council Teachers' International Professional Development Programme, to exchange ideas and learn from the positive education experience promoted in Cuba.
