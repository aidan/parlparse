 *S3M-1463 Liam McArthur: Orkney Postwoman’s Bravery Award—That the Parliament congratulates life-saving Orkney postwoman, Caroline Delday, for winning the Scottish section of Royal Mail’s 2008 1st Class People Awards for her bravery; believes that the award is well deserved recognition for her actions when, after spotting smoke from a house, she shouted to wake up the elderly householder and then entered the burning house to help him escape; notes that she will now travel to London for the UK finals of the prestigious awards, which aim to celebrate postmen and women who are unsung heroes in their communities, and wishes her every success in the finals.
