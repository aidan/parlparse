*S2M-2435 Robin Harper: Kyoto Climate Change Protocol Into Force—That the Parliament welcomes the entry into force of the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on 16 February 2005; recognises that this is an important step towards reducing the global pollution that causes climate change; condemns the US Government for its refusal to sign up to the Kyoto Protocol; requests that the First Minister does all in his power at the G8 summit in Scotland this year to challenge the United States’ refusal to act on climate change, including raising the matter with the Prime Minister; notes, however, that Scotland lags behind the rest of the United Kingdom in reducing carbon dioxide emissions and believes that the Scottish Executive must take urgent steps towards ensuring that these emissions are reduced, particularly ahead of the G8 summit, and supports the Scottish Environment LINK’s "Everyone" campaign to reduce emissions causing climate change.
