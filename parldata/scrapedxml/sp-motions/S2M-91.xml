 *S2M-91 Mike Pringle: Electoral Registration and Victims of Domestic Abuse—That the Parliament recognises that victims of domestic abuse can become vulnerable to further abuse and intimidation through publication of their names and addresses on the publicly available electoral register; notes the House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee’s Fourth Report 1997-98, Electoral Law and Administration, which recognised the calls for a means of registering without having to reveal information that could make the elector vulnerable, and calls on the Electoral Commission and the UK Parliament to give consideration to developing a system to allow anonymous electoral registration in exceptional circumstances, while providing safeguards against electoral fraud, as part of the general review of electoral registration.
