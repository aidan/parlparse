 *S3M-4257 Kenneth Gibson: A Citizen’s Right to Privacy—That the Parliament condemns the reported £1 billion allotted to the Government Communications Headquarters (GCHQ) for developing its monitoring technology, while disapproving of the estimated £2 billion cost of the UK Government’s plan to maintain a vast network of corporate databases containing the public’s communications data; remembers the UK Government’s poor track record for safeguarding sensitive information and recognises that the who, when and where of communication is highly intrusive and personally sensitive; questions this use of resources at a time when the Scottish Government is being asked to make cuts in vital public services, and hopes that UK ministers will appreciate a citizen’s rights to privacy, freedom and trust, which, seemingly, as experienced so often under Labour, have been disregarded. Supported by: Alasdair Allan*, Rob Gibson*, Bill Kidd*, Michael Matheson*
