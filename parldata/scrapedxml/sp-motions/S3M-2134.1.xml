*S3M-2134.1 Sarah Boyack: Unacceptable Levels of Poverty in Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2134) in the name of Jamie Hepburn, leave out from "the Office" to end and insert "and encouragement the findings of the National Statistics publication Scottish Households Below Average Income 2006-07 which shows a marked decline since 1999-2000 in the number of households in both absolute and relative poverty, including a 28% decrease in relative child poverty and a 61% decrease in absolute child poverty meaning that the previous administration’s target to halve absolute child poverty by 2010 has been met significantly ahead of schedule; believes that, while government at all levels should continue to strive to eliminate poverty completely, this progress would not have been possible without many of the initiatives by the previous administration and the UK Government, including the Sure Start programme, record increases in child benefit, the winter fuel allowance, the working families tax credit and the national minimum wage, the latter of which was finally passed in the House of Commons without the support of a single SNP MP, and is concerned that the SNP government’s budget, passed with the Conservatives in this session of the Parliament, and its single outcome agreements with local authorities are precipitating cuts to a range of local services including homecare services for the elderly, school classes and school meals provision as well as a host of voluntary organisations providing services for some of Scotland’s most vulnerable citizens, that this threatens to undo much of the progress on poverty which the report outlines and that this seriously undermines the SNP’s case to be trusted with more powers."
