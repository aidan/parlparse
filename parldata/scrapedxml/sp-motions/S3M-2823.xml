*S3M-2823 Karen Whitefield: World Diabetes Day 2008—That the Parliament welcomes the United Nation’s declaration of November 14 as World Diabetes Day; further welcomes the arrival in the Scottish Parliament of Diabetes UK Scotland’s exhibition, which aims to raise awareness of the impact that the condition has on children and young adolescents in Scotland; recognises that Scotland has one of the highest rates in the world for Type 1 diabetes and that more than 90% of young people with diabetes in Scotland are at risk of serious health complications because they lack the information and support to manage their condition properly; congratulates Diabetes UK Scotland on the publication of the Making Connections toolkit, which aims to give young people an improved transition from paediatric to adult services in hospitals and gives them advice on living with diabetes as young adults, and calls on the Scottish Government to support fully children and young people with diabetes.
