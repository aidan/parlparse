*S1M-2261 Robin Harper: Shellfish Farming—That the Parliament recognises the vital role which shellfish farming plays in Scotland’s rural economy and the valuable contribution its exports make; is concerned that the lack of insurance cover for closure due to biotoxin events seriously undermines investor confidence, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to work with the shellfish industry in order to produce such an insurance scheme or other suitable support.
