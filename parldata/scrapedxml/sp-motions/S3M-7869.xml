 *S3M-7869 Cathy Peattie: The Helix Project—That the Parliament welcomes the commencement of work on the Helix project on 2 February 2011 on a 300-hectare site between Falkirk and Grangemouth; notes that the area will be transformed into a park featuring an enclosed lagoon and outdoor events space, pathways, cycle networks and a range of community facilities, with a new canal link connecting Grangemouth and the Firth of Forth to Scotland’s extensive canal network, the centrepiece of which will be the Kelpies lock, featuring two 30-metre high sculptures in the shape of horses’ heads, and believes that the Helix will provide a much-needed recreational facility for local people and further boost the tourist potential of the area.
