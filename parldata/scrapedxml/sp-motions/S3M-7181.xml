 *S3M-7181 Kenneth Gibson: Heritage Lottery Fund—That the Parliament notes with concern the reported proposal to merge the Heritage Lottery Fund with English Heritage; considers that such a merger would result in grant applicants from Scotland having to contact the English body; believes that, as an England-only advisory body, English Heritage has a very different remit from the Heritage Lottery Fund, which is a UK-wide lottery distributor that does not give grants to private owners; welcomes what it considers the vital funding that the Heritage Lottery Fund provides for a wide range of projects and institutions throughout Scotland; considers that, with every grant that the Heritage Lottery Fund gives, numerous jobs and training placements are created and other people are provided with the opportunity to learn about heritage and develop a wide range of skills and knowledge; believes that failure to consult heritage bodies and communities throughout the UK represents exactly the sort of public and local disenfranchisement that the UK coalition government supposedly wanted to overturn, and is apprehensive about the implications that such a merger could have, with thousands of jobs and millions of pounds-worth of essential funding potentially lost. Supported by: Gil Paterson*, Aileen Campbell*, Joe FitzPatrick*
