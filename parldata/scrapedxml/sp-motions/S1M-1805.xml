*S1M-1805 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Investigation of Handling of Foot-and-Mouth Disease Crisis by MAFF—That the Parliament demands to know the precise date when the Ministry for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (MAFF) was informed of the first cases of foot-and-mouth disease in the recent outbreak, the time and day MAFF then passed this knowledge to the Scottish Executive and precisely when MAFF informed the European Commission or other member states of its knowledge of the foot-and-mouth outbreak; wishes all actions by MAFF over this epidemic to be revealed immediately and later subjected to an inquiry; bears in mind the past history of MAFF regarding BSE, when it delayed informing farmers of the exact contents of animal feed on grounds of so-called "commercial confidentiality", and regarding genetically modified (GM) crops, when it delayed informing Scottish ministers that an accidental GM planting had taken place in Scotland in spring 2000 and that an accidental GM harvest had been gathered and had entered the human and animal food chain in 1999, and notes that these cases of shocking delay were condemned outspokenly by Ministers and all parties in the Scottish Parliament.
