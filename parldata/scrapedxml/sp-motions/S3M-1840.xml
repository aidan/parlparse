*S3M-1840 Sarah Boyack: Vulnerable Paying the Price of SNP Populism—That the Parliament notes with both concern and regret the cuts in frontline services across Scotland, including nurseries, crèches, services for the housebound and infirm and funding for voluntary sector organisations, including those caring for some of Scotland’s most vulnerable citizens, arising from the Scottish Government’s budget passed with Conservative support in Holyrood and its subsequent concordat with local government, including a freeze in Council Tax; notes the Evening News’ comment of 29 April 2008 that "since then the chickens have come home to roost and despite predictable crowing in council chambers the length and breadth of the country that frontline services would be protected from the cuts, predictably this has not proved possible for most administrations"; further notes that such predictions by opposition MSPs were dismissed at the time by SNP ministers as "scaremongering", but believes that the reality on the ground, particularly in areas such as Edinburgh, Aberdeen and East Lothian, has vindicated those who warned of the consequences; is aware that these cuts are being imposed despite the SNP government enjoying a funding settlement twice that available to Donald Dewar as First Minister, and regrets that local authorities which freeze their Council Tax without sufficient funding in place are passing on cuts in services to Scotland’s youngest, oldest, poorest and disabled who are paying the price of the SNP’s populism.
