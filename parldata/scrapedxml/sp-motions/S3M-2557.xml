 *S3M-2557 Bill Kidd: The Late Dr Alan F Phillips—That the Parliament notes with sadness the passing away of Dr Alan F Phillips, who dedicated much of his life work to the elimination of nuclear weapons as a result of his involvement in the early development of radar during World War Two, leading to him becoming a leader in the field of radiation therapy and clinical radiotherapy, which in turn allowed him to gain an intimate understanding of the secrets of the atom that imbued him with a unique moral imperative to work for nuclear weapons elimination, and hopes that his passion and dedication to nuclear disarmament will serve as a shining example to all those seeking the same. Supported by: Alasdair Allan*, Brian Adam*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Aileen Campbell*, Kenneth Gibson*, Sandra White*
