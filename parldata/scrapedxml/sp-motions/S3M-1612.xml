*S3M-1612 Roseanna Cunningham: Scottish Campaign for Cardiac Rehabilitation—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the Scottish Campaign for Cardiac Rehabilitation, led by British Heart Foundation Scotland and Chest, Heart and Stroke Scotland; supports the campaign’s aim for all patients to have access to a high-quality cardiac rehabilitation programme; notes that cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to reduce the chances of dying of heart disease by up to a third and is very cost effective in comparison to other treatments; is aware that, although cardiac rehabilitation is provided for up to 60% of people who have had heart attacks or heart bypass operations, access is still limited amongst many groups, including women and people in deprived or remote and rural communities; is concerned that for certain other heart conditions, such as chronic angina and heart failure, the level of provision of cardiac rehabilitation for patients is very low; believes that, with at least 190,000 people in Scotland already living with significant heart disease, a robust and well-resourced national approach to cardiac rehabilitation is essential to allow our health service to cope with increasing numbers of people living with heart conditions in the future, and urges the Scottish Government and NHSScotland to ensure that the campaign’s policy calls are implemented in full.
