 * S3M-6198 Rob Gibson: Encouraging Biofoam, Bioplastic and Biowaste Innovations—That the Parliament notes the cross-party seminar held in the Parliament on 13 April 2010 that highlighted the welcome innovations of Synbra Group, the leading producer and converter of expanded polystyrene used in a broad range of its BioFoam sustainable insulation systems for roof, wall and floor projects as well as its industrial products and solutions for electronics, fish, meat and produce packaging in addition to seed trays for horticulture and Biostyr for water filtration systems, among many other end products; further welcomes its collaborations with Purac, a leading player in natural food preservation and green chemicals; welcomes the companies’ partnership to produce polylactic acid used to make bioplastics that are produced from renewable resources such as sugar, are close to carbon neutral over their entire lifespan with current technology and which are expected to become carbon negative based on third and fourth generation technology by 2015; welcomes regulations in several EU countries that exclude recycling fees for bioplastics, and, finally, calls for the speedy development of a European biowaste framework.
