*S2M-4605&lt;&gt; Tommy Sheridan: Return of Bus Services in Scotland to the Public Sector—That the Parliament notes the increasing fiasco surrounding the provision of bus services in Glasgow and across Scotland; demands that those companies threatening to withdraw important services in Glasgow face financial penalties and political condemnation; believes that bus services in Glasgow and throughout Scotland, except for the Lothians, will continue to decline while those services are provided on the basis of private companies seeking maximum profit instead of public providers delivering maximum quality and accessible services, and accordingly believes that the Scottish Executive should move quickly to introduce a Bill to return bus services to the public sector so that services can improve and public subsidies are used properly to enhance bus provision instead of disappearing into private bus companies’ bank accounts.
