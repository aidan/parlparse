*S3M-4445 Bill Wilson: Ezra Nawi and Israel’s Continued Violation of Human Rights—That the Parliament applauds the actions of Jewish Israeli Ezra Nawi in raising awareness, by persistent non-violent action, of his country’s continued de facto ethnic cleansing through the destruction of Palestinian homes in the occupied West Bank; deplores the continued violation of the human rights of Palestinians by Israeli settlers and the Israeli Defence Force (IDF), which it considers to be in breach of both Israeli and international law; notes reports that the chief of the investigations in the Hebron Israeli Police has admitted that Ezra Nawi’s actions are "exposing the dirt laying under the rug"; agrees with Ezra Nawi’s remarks, on the destruction of a Palestinian home by the IDF, that "the only thing that will be left here is hatred", and calls on Israel not to jail or harass him, but to take its moral lead from his courageous and principled stand. Supported by: Robin Harper*, Elaine Smith*, Sandra White*
