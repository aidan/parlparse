*S3M-1786 Margo MacDonald: Human Rights and the Olympic Games—That the Parliament sends its best wishes to all athletes attending the forthcoming Olympic Games in Beijing; remembers the words of the then Deputy Mayor of Beijing, Liu Jingmin, in 2001 that "By applying for the Olympics, we want to promote not just the city’s development but the development of society, including democracy and human rights"; expresses grave concerns that, in the years since, the recognition of the human rights of Chinese citizens does not appear to have notably progressed towards the standard defined by the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights and, while accepting that the Games should go ahead, calls on all those who are able to remind the Chinese Government of its previously stated commitments on improving human rights.
