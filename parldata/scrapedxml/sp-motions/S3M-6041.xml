*S3M-6041 Hugh Henry: Congratulations to CWU and Royal Mail—That the Parliament congratulates the Communications Workers Union (CWU) and the Royal Mail on reaching an agreement that it considers can provide stability to Royal Mail and fairness to its employees; hopes that CWU members vote to endorse the deal, which it believes can, alongside the development of a Post Bank, ensure the future of the Post Office; recognises that the issue of the Royal Mail pension fund deficit is still to be resolved, and believes that this should be done without the need to sell off any part of the Royal Mail to the private sector.
