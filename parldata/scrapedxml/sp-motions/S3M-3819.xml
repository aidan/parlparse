*S3M-3819 Stuart McMillan: Boundary Proposals—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed boundary change that would relocate the Princes Gate development in Bishopbriggs from the local authority area of East Dunbartonshire to the city of Glasgow; understands that residents were not aware of any such proposal when purchasing their homes; recognises the anxiety and anger of some residents who specifically chose to purchase homes in Bishopbriggs and for whom the proposal would mean the severing of community links, jeopardising their access to amenities and potentially considerable financial loss; notes also that the proposal would see the loss of a much-needed affordable housing site from East Dunbartonshire to the city of Glasgow; wishes the residents every success in working with East Dunbartonshire Council to resist the proposal, and calls on the Local Government Boundary Commission for Scotland to reconsider and to acknowledge the right of local residents to stay within the area and to maintain their community links.
