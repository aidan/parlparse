*S3M-2799 Bill Kidd: Welcome New Rights for Disabled and Elderly People—That the Parliament welcomes the introduction of Regulation (EC) No 1107/2006, which came into force throughout Europe in the summer of 2008 and is designed specifically to give disabled and elderly people access to air transport comparable to that enjoyed by all other passengers flying to or from, or passing in transit through, airports in the European Union, with no discrimination and at no additional cost; believes that, as a result, no traveller with reduced mobility should experience any form of discrimination, and urges anyone who does to inform the national enforcement body, which in Scotland is the Equality and Human Rights Commission.
