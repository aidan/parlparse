*S1M-678 Dr Elaine Murray: Bus Drivers' Strike—That the Parliament notes with concern the escalation of industrial action by employees of Stagecoach in the South West of Scotland; notes the disruption to public and school transport caused in such areas such as Dumfries and Galloway; notes that this dispute was caused by the company’s withdrawal of their latest pay offer without allowing trade union representatives to ballot their members, and requests that the management of Stagecoach immediately resume negotiations with trade union representatives with the aim of resolving this dispute.
