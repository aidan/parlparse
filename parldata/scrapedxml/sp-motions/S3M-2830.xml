 *S3M-2830 John Scott: Impact of BBC Local News Proposals on Local Newspapers—That the Parliament is concerned about proposals by the BBC to spend £68 million of licence payers’ money on incorporating extra local news coverage into its website; believes that this will simply duplicate news already provided by local newspapers and other local news media; considers that the proposal will stifle competition and damage the commercial viability of local newspapers, and calls on the BBC Trust to abandon these proposals.
