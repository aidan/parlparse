*S3M-1848.1 Jamie McGrigor: Meeting Scotland’s Housing Needs—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1848) in the name of Johann Lamont, insert at end "regrets the failure of the Scottish Government to actively promote housing stock transfer by local authorities to community-based housing associations, with the approval of tenants, and urges the Scottish Government to co-operate with HM Treasury and councils to achieve the substantial debt write-offs of over £2 billion which are available and thereby facilitate new investment in social housing."
