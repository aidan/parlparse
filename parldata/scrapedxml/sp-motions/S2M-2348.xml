*S2M-2348 Robin Harper: ‘Second Term, One Year On’ Report on Scottish Executive Environmental Policy—That the Parliament welcomes the independent report, Second Term, One Year On, produced by Citigate Public Affairs for Scottish Environment LINK which states that the gap between rhetoric and reality remains wide in many areas of the Scottish Executive’s approach to sustainable development and the environment; notes that, while some progress has been made in the fields of nature conservation and strategic environmental assessment and that Common Agricultural Policy reforms have produced some steps in the right direction, much remains to be done in key areas such as waste and recycling, energy and climate change, transport, air and in freshwater and marine environments, and calls on the Executive to adopt strategies such as ecological footprinting to complement strategic environmental assessment and develop an economic policy set that does not rely on growth above all else as a measure of success.
