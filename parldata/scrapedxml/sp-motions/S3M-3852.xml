 *S3M-3852 Jamie Hepburn: House of Commons Business and Enterprise Committee Report on Part-privatisation of the Royal Mail—That the Parliament notes the report of the House of Commons Business and Enterprise Committee that concludes that the UK Government has not properly made the case for its planned part-privatisation of the Royal Mail and that "it is entirely unacceptable for Parliament to be asked to approve such fundamental changes to Royal Mail Group when there is no indication of how much money Royal Mail Group needs for investment while the Government appears to have no business plan and has not indicated the use to which any private sector capital would be put"; believes this to be convincing evidence, if more were needed, that the UK Government’s plans in this area are simply wrong, and calls on the UK Government immediately to halt its plans for the part-privatisation of the Royal Mail. Supported by: Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Bill Wilson*, Brian Adam*, Stuart McMillan*, Kenneth Gibson*, Bob Doris*, Bill Kidd*
