 *S3M-1500 Rhoda Grant: Congratulations to Moray Council on Addiction and Children 1st—That the Parliament congratulates Moray Council on Addiction and Children 1st who have been awarded almost £800,000 from the Big Lottery Fund to develop a counselling service for those affected by substance misuse and a project to support youngsters leaving care; notes that this investment means that Moray has become one of the most successful local authorities in Scotland in accessing the Big Lottery Fund which is a testament to the quality of projects in the area; further notes that with the £384,693 award, Moray Council on Addiction is expected to be able to reach 500 local young people who are affected either directly or by another’s substance misuse and, in addition, that the £401,412 awarded to Children 1st will help make a real difference to some of the most vulnerable young people in Moray, helping them to make the often difficult transition into adulthood, and wishes both organisations every success for the future. Supported by: Peter Peacock*, David Stewart*
