*S3M-28 Jim Hume: Local Food—That the Parliament recognises the benefit to our health, the environment and Scotland’s farmers, fishermen and rural areas of choosing more local, fresh, seasonal produce; believes that by specifying requirements for freshness, delivery frequency, specific varieties and production standards the public sector can take a lead in the promotion of local food; notes the success of the East Ayrshire school meals pilot in showing how procurement rules can promote locally grown food and support Scotland’s local suppliers, and calls on the Scottish Executive to roll out the school meals pilot across Scotland and take action across the public sector to encourage the procurement of more locally grown produce.
