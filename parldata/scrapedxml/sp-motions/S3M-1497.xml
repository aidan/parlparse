 *S3M-1497 John Wilson: National Minimum Wage—That the Parliament expresses its disappointment at the announcement by the Prime Minister on 5 March 2008 regarding the decision to increase the National Minimum Wage (NMW) by only 21p per hour from October 2008; considers that the decision is even more disappointing given the recent reports which have highlighted the failure of the NMW to address the issue of in-work poverty, and calls on the Prime Minister and the UK Government to increase the NMW to £6.00 an hour from October 2008 in order to alleviate the effects of those working on poverty wages.
