*S2M-3975&lt;&gt; Ms Rosemary Byrne: Class Sizes—That the Parliament agrees that class sizes in Scottish schools should be set at a national maximum level of 20 for non-practical classes and 15 or less for practical classes; condemns the Scottish Executive for failing to reach targets for maximum classes in S1 and S2 mathematics and English classes; believes that the Executive should provide a strategy, including a timescale, to implement those commitments already made for S1 and S2 mathematics and English and the early stages of primary school and produce a longer-term strategy to reduce all class sizes to 20 for non-practical subjects in state schools, and considers that such a strategy should include teacher recruitment and retention in addition to a survey of school capacity to ensure equality of access to education for all children, especially those in deprived areas such as parts of Ayrshire.
