 *S1M-1781# Elaine Smith: Mental Health and Young People—That the Parliament welcomes the £8.6 million allocated from the Mental Health and Well Being Development Fund since its inception in September 1997, in particular the £2 million funding for the nine new mental health projects throughout Scotland announced by the Deputy Minister for Health and Community Care on 20 March 2001; notes the publication by the National Schizophrenia Fellowship of the report Tomorrow’s Minds, which shows that the majority of teenagers and young adults believe that they would face discrimination if they developed a mental health problem, and, in the light of this report, believes that the Scottish Executive should give consideration to running an education campaign, aimed at young people, to combat negative attitudes towards mental illness.
