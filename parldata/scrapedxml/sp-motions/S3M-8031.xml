 *S3M-8031 Liam McArthur: Ness of Brodgar Excavationsâ€”That the Parliament notes that ongoing excavations on the Ness of Brodgar, on the Orkney mainland, have won the Research Project of the Year award at the 2011 Current Archaeology Awards; further notes that the excavations, which are uncovering a large Neolithic complex on the Brodgar peninsula lying on the low ridge between the Stones of Stenness and the Ring of Brodgar, were runner-up in the Andante Travel Archaeology Awards 2008 and were listed by the American Institute of Archaeology as one of the great discoveries of 2009; believes that the complex uncovered by the excavations is further evidence of the rich archaeology of Orkney, both in the Heart of Neolithic Orkney World Heritage Site and across the islands, and congratulates Nick Card of the Orkney Research Centre for Archaeology, the director of the excavations, and his team on their award.
