*S2M-4864.3 Euan Robson: Trident—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4864) in the name of Roseanna Cunningham, leave out from "believes" to end and insert "wishes to see the worldwide elimination of nuclear weapons; notes the UK Government’s commitment, made in June 2005, to reach a decision on the replacement of the Trident system by the end of the current Westminster Parliament; further notes that the Secretary of State for Defence stated in June 2005 that "no decision on any replacement for Trident has been taken, either in principle or otherwise"; calls on the UK Government to ensure that there is a full public debate on the issue; further calls on the UK Government to press for a new round of multilateral arms reduction talks, and believes that the United Kingdom’s current minimum nuclear deterrent should be retained for the foreseeable future until sufficient progress has been made towards the global elimination of nuclear weapons."
