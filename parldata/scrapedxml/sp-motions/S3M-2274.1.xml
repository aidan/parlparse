 *S3M-2274.1 Iain Smith: International Pressure on Zimbabwe—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2274) in the name of Aileen Campbell, insert at end "considers that the First Minister’s letter to Robert Mugabe asking for support for Scotland to be given observer status at the United Nations was deeply inappropriate; further considers that, as the whole world is moving to cast out President Mugabe, this ill-advised correspondence with the despotic and vilified regime in Zimbabwe is indicative of the First Minister’s preference for global grandstanding rather than fixing the SNP’s broken manifesto promises, and calls for the First Minister to apologise to the people of Scotland."
