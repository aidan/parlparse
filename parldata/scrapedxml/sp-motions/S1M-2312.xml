 *S1M-2312 Irene McGugan: Scots Language Educational Materials-That the Parliament welcomes the grant of £150,000 awarded to the Itchy Coo Project from the Scottish Arts Council's National Lottery Children and Young People Scheme which will transform the image and status of the Scots language by providing resources for use throughout the education system from nursery to advanced higher level; notes that over the two years of the project, beginning in January 2002, Itchy Coo will produce sixteen Scots texts and other resources, including original works, both creative and non-fiction titles, as well as new and innovative versions of Scots literary texts aimed at specific age groups; approves of the participation of children in the way the books are developed and the inclusion of ideas for children to write or perform creatively; further notes that there will be an interactive web-site that will solicit and showcase children's own language creations, that the project also includes a programme of in-service training for teachers and school visits from Itchy Coo authors and editors and that the partnership will work to advance teachers' and young people's knowledge of the language and to develop their confidence in their usage of Scots; is especially pleased to note that the project will have a strong social inclusion element and take account of the needs of children and young people with disabilities and special needs; acknowledges that this will enable thousands of young Scots to articulate and appreciate their own language and culture in ways that have seldom been available to them before; therefore regrets that, in contrast, the Scottish Executive has confirmed in recent responses that it has set no targets for and has not formulated a policy on the numbers of Scots speakers, and deplores the fact that it does not consider any action is necessary to comply with the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages in respect of the Scots language.
