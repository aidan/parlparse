*S2M-5299 Ms Sandra White: Academic Freedom Must be Safeguarded—That the Parliament is concerned that there has been an erosion of faith that the Scottish Executive will report accurately the findings of commissioned research, such as the recent report on youth crime whose authors have since faced disciplinary action which they claim was instigated following pressure from the Executive after they wrote an article for a criminal studies journal highlighting findings including, among others, concerns that the youth courts are in breach of human rights legislation, which were omitted from the final report; further notes with increasing concern the comments made by Mr Walters, the report’s co-author, who told Holyrood magazine that the Executive had created an environment where "universities are terrified about losing contracts and academics are looking over their shoulders, being careful not to say anything critical of the Executive" adding that "one of the hallmarks of a democratic society is the free and open flow of information and a state that prevents, disrupts or misrepresents that flow is acting in a way that is, I would argue, corrupt"; resolutely condemns the manipulation of independent research in order to claim political success, and believes that the Executive should initiate an internal investigation to get to the bottom of this matter.
