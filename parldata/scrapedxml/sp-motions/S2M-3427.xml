*S2M-3427 Ms Sandra White: Comments by the Immigration Minister—That the Parliament notes the comments made by Tony McNulty MP, Minister of State for Immigration and Citizenship, on 16 October 2005 that "We are not knocking down doors at four in the morning… Most of the removals occur at about half five, half six or seven in the morning…in no sense at all can what the dedicated public servants of the immigration service do in very difficult circumstances like removal be described as inhuman or terrorising children"; notes that Kathleen Marshall, Scotland’s Commissioner for Children and Young People, has already condemned the practice of dawn raids; further notes that Jack McConnell MSP, the First Minister, has already acknowledged the existence of so-called "dawn raids" and has condemned the practice, and considers Mr McNulty’s comments to show little understanding of the reality of the situation for families, such as the recently deported Vucaj family.
