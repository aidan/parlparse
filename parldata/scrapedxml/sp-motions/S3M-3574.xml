*S3M-3574 Sandra White: Lloyds Banking Group Blocks Aid to Gaza—That the Parliament condemns Lloyds Banking Group for its refusal to clear donations made to Interpal, a non-political and non-profit-making British charity that works with international funding partners and partners on the ground to provide relief and development aid to Palestinians in need; notes that allegations of links with terrorist organisations made by the BBC’s Panorama programme and the Israeli Government have been rejected by the Charity Commission’s investigation; believes that this further calls into question the impartiality of the BBC and its reasoning behind its refusal to air the Gaza Crisis appeal despite overwhelming public support for this appeal to be aired, and calls on Lloyds Banking Group to reverse its decision, explain under what advice it took such a decision and for the BBC to conduct an inquiry into how its flagship public affairs programme was hijacked in this way.
