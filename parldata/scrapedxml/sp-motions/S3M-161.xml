 *S3M-161 Nanette Milne: What’s On Your Plate? Campaign—That the Parliament welcomes NFU Scotland’s What’s On Your Plate? campaign which aims to highlight all the positive things delivered by Scottish farming and farmers and to persuade people to support Scottish farming by buying local food and drink; notes that the campaign asks consumers to read labels carefully and look out for Scottish produce when they are shopping; supports the call for all Scotland’s schools to organise farm visits and backs the use of a seasonal chart to target Scottish foods when they are in season, and encourages all MSPs to visit the campaign website www.whatsonyourplate.co.uk to sign the pledge of support for Scottish food and farming.
