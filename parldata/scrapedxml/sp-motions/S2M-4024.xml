*S2M-4024 Malcolm Chisholm: Regeneration in Scotland - People and Place—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Scottish Executive’s statement "People and Place: Regeneration Policy in Scotland"; notes the current support for the regeneration of communities across Scotland; supports the commitment from the Executive and its agencies to work with local authorities and other partners to ensure that communities benefit from economic activity and to attract further investment from the private sector, and welcomes the Executive’s determination to tackle those land, property and other issues that can act as a barrier to regeneration and to create successful, mixed and vibrant communities.
