*S2M-5534 Iain Smith: Congratulations to Howe of Fife Under-18s—That the Parliament congratulates Howe of Fife under-18s on winning the Scottish Rugby Union Youth League Cup, beating Musselburgh 27-14 at Murrayfield; notes that, taken together with the Royal Navy Scottish Schools Sevens in September and the success of Bell Baxter High School in the Scottish Schools Cup, this squad of players has achieved a triple crown in Scottish under-18s rugby; recognises the tremendous achievement of the players, and believes that the contribution to under-18s rugby of the coaching staff of Garry Horne and John Lathangie deserves recognition at the highest level.
