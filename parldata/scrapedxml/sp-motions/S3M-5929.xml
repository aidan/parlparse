*S3M-5929 Kenny MacAskill: Serious and Organised Crime—That the Parliament recognises that serious organised crime can have a devastating impact on communities and businesses in Scotland; further recognises that tackling this menace should be a key priority for a Safer and Stronger Scotland; supports the role of the Serious Organised Crime Taskforce in spearheading Scotland’s commitment to address this type of crime; supports Scottish law enforcement in implementing the taskforce’s serious organised crime strategy, Letting our Communities Flourish, and supports the view that serious organised crime cannot be seen to pay.
