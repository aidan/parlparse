 * S2M-2377 Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Reduce the Risk of Cancer—That the Parliament congratulates Cancer Research UK on the launch of its five-year Reduce the Risk campaign to raise awareness of the avoidable risks of cancer and the importance of early detection; recognises that one in three of us will be diagnosed with cancer at some time in our lives but that half of all cancers could be prevented by changes to lifestyle; expresses concern that, of those questioned by the charity in Scotland, 70% did not know that a diet low in fruit and vegetables could increase the chances of getting the disease, only 37% mentioned drinking less alcohol as a way of reducing risk, but almost one-third believed that living near power lines was linked to cancer despite there being no strong evidence to support this, and looks to the Scottish Executive, in the light of these findings, to make cancer prevention a priority in health improvement plans and to continue to support Cancer Research UK’s public communication campaign.
