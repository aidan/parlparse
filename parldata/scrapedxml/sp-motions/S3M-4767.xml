 *S3M-4767 Rob Gibson: Power of Scotland Renewed—That the Parliament notes the publication by Friends of the Earth Scotland, the World Development Movement, WWF Scotland and RSPB Scotland of a new report, The Power of Scotland Renewed; welcomes its findings that by 2030 renewable energy could meet between 60% and 143% of Scotland’s projected annual electricity demand, even when avoiding sensitive wildlife and landscape sites; believes that this demonstrates that centralised power plants can be rapidly replaced by more decentralised forms of generation; further believes that this vindicates the view that a new generation of nuclear power in Scotland is not needed, and calls for priority to be given to energy conservation and renewables and the supporting framework required to decarbonise electricity generation. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
