*S1M-3011 Mr Adam Ingram: Schizophrenia-That the Parliament notes the report by the Clinical Standards Board for Scotland (CSBS) on schizophrenia which shows that there is a postcode lottery in the provision of mental health services; further notes the comments made by Lord Patel, chairman of the CSBS at the launch of the report on schizophrenia that "Mental health has become a bit of a Cinderella", and calls on the Scottish Executive to set up a mental health task force to ensure that mental health is regarded as a national clinical priority by health boards in the same way as it is regarded as one of only three national clinical priorities by the Executive.
