*S2M-115# Dr Jean Turner: National Beds Inquiry—That the Parliament notes that the number of NHS beds has been reduced by over 5,000 since the mid-1990s and that this policy continues today as shown in the Greater Glasgow NHS Board area where the number of acute beds may be reduced by 11% from 2001 to 2005 despite the number of acute admissions increasing; is concerned at the result of this reduction which will mean that patients will have to wait on trolleys until a bed becomes available, sometimes for up to eight hours or longer; believes that this delay exposes patients, who may be lying in a public place on uncomfortable and inappropriate mattresses, to an increased risk of infection with people passing through and also imposes unnecessary additional demands on nursing staff who have to provide food and water to these patients as well as provide treatment to them, such as frequent turning to prevent pressure points and venous stasis, a pre-cursor to deep venous thrombosis, as a result of the patient being kept in a restricted position for long periods; believes that, rather than increasing the number of hospital trolleys for patients to lie on in busy corridors, the number of acute hospital beds must be increased urgently in order to offer a safe and comfortable bed in the appropriate ward with the appropriate nursing and medical care that each patient requires which would also free up accident and emergency departments to carry on with the treatment of other patients; further believes that beds are important in maintaining effective medical and surgical provision for day or short-stay patients, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should institute a national beds inquiry to establish how many beds within each speciality are available, and are required, so that emergency admissions are afforded the proper level of care and elective work can be accommodated within the bed capacity in order to allow waiting times and lists to be reduced.
