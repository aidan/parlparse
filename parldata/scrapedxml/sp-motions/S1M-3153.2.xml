*S1M-3153.2 Ross Finnie: GM Field Trials-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3153) in the name of Fiona McLeod, leave out from second "that" to end and insert "therefore recognises the fact that the development of GM crops in Scotland has proceeded on a precautionary basis requiring, firstly, that releases of GM material are only authorised if an objective scientific test demonstrates that such a release will cause no harm to human health or the environment and, secondly, that a step by step approach is taken involving laboratory testing, plot trials and the current field scale trials with no decision on commercialisation to be taken before a full evaluation of the field scale trials has been completed."
