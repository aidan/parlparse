*S3M-5666 Hugh Henry: The Future of Royal Mail—That the Parliament believes that the public service ethos of Royal Mail and its staff should be reflected in the new leadership of Royal Mail; further notes that the Hooper review on the future of Royal Mail agreed that the pension fund deficit had to be addressed if the company was to have a future; further understands that the deficit can be addressed under existing legislation; welcomes the recognition by Lord Mandelson that the UK Government has a moral obligation to fund the deficit, and believes that this should be resolved as a matter of urgency.
