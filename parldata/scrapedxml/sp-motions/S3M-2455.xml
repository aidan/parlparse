*S3M-2455 Patrick Harvie: Report on Data Handling Review—That the Parliament recalls that, in the context of high-profile government data losses, motion S3M-1017 was agreed on 13 December 2007 calling on the Scottish Government "to ensure that all data protection procedures comply with the principles of data protection"; welcomes the Data Handling in Government review report, published on June 25 2008, as a first step in fulfilling the terms of that motion and addressing concerns about government use of citizens’ data; considers, however that individuals’ right to privacy, and the control of data through the principle of consent, has not been fully explored in the report; recalls that motion S3M-1017 further calls on the Scottish Government "to review plans for Scottish Citizens Accounts on the basis of these principles"; notes that this has not been addressed at all in the report, and calls on the Scottish Government to bring forward a ministerial statement to give details of the intended next steps and to allow Parliament to raise questions on the content of the report.
