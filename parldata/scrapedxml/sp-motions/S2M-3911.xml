*S2M-3911 Ms Sandra White: Women Still Under-Represented—That the Parliament condemns unreservedly the situation demonstrated by the figures contained in Who Runs Scotland 2006, produced by the Equal Opportunities Commission Scotland; notes that, amidst a welter of damning statistics, women make up only 22% of Scottish councillors, 10% of senior police officers and 18% of secondary school head teachers; suggests that 30 years after the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 came into force the pace of change remains painfully slow, and calls on all bodies, both public and private, to dismantle proactively age-old barriers and move forward to a situation where this valuable national resource is utilised to the full.
