*S3M-1743 Robert Brown: Withdrawal of Modern Apprenticeship Funding—That the Parliament condemns the decision by the Scottish Government to withdraw Modern Apprenticeship funding for those over 20 years of age in all sectors other than construction, engineering and the automotive sector; believes that there is a continuing need to support and develop high-quality training through modern apprenticeships in other sectors; is particularly concerned at the withdrawal of funding in the important financial services sector; considers that this once again demonstrates the inadequacy of the Scottish Government’s skills strategy; calls on the Scottish Government to reconsider this decision which will create a north-south divide, and is concerned that Scotland will be left at a disadvantage as against the rest of the United Kingdom in this sphere.
