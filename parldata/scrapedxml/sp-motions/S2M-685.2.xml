*S2M-685.2 Nicola Sturgeon: Modernising Access to Legal Advice, Information and Representation-As an amendment to motion (S2M-685) in the name of Cathy Jamieson, insert at end ", but expresses concern that the reality for far too many people in need of legal advice, information and representation still falls far short of this standard, that availability of high quality legal advice and representation for people who cannot afford to pay for it is less accessible now than previously, and that access to advice and assistance from non-legally qualified providers, which in many circumstances is more appropriate than access to a solicitor, remains needlessly fragmented and geographically inconsistent due to a failure to build on best practice where it exists."
