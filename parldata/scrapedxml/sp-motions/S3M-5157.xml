*S3M-5157 Marilyn Livingstone: Safe Drive Stay Alive—That the Parliament commends the Fife Community Safety Partnership and its commitment to reducing casualties on Fife roads through its educational Safe Drive Stay Alive initiative; recognises that the campaign delivers a theatre-style performance that focuses on the emotional impact that a road traffic collision has on emergency service personnel, accident victims and their families; welcomes the fact that, in an attempt to reach young people before they begin to drive, the initiative is aimed at all fifth year pupils and those likely to leave after fourth year; notes that last year over 5,000 young people saw the road show, and wishes the initiative every success as it is replicated around Scotland to educate young people.
