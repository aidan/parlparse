*S3M-6002 Stuart McMillan: Backtrack by Prime Minister on Defence Spending—That the Parliament welcomes the backtrack by the Prime Minister, and former Chancellor of the Exchequer, who is to correct his evidence to the Iraq Inquiry after admitting that defence spending had not risen in real terms every year under the Labour government; notes the comments of former heads of the armed forces, such as Lord Guthrie, former Chief of Defence Staff, who said that the Ministry of Defence had "received the bare minimum from the chancellor, who wanted to give the military as little as he could get away with"; considers that this is further compounded by a £4.3 billion underspend in Scotland between 2002 and 2007, and further considers this to be another example of the current UK Government failing to deliver on its promises and not treating military personnel with the respect that they deserve and potentially putting them in unnecessary danger.
