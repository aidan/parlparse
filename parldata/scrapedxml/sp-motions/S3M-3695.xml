*S3M-3695 Des McNulty: Cycling and Walking to Work—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Scottish Environmental Attitudes and Behaviours Survey 2008; notes that, of the 3,000 people questioned, 44% of working respondents with a car drive a mile or less to work; expresses concern at the findings that environmental considerations are not a significant factor in the decision on whether to leave the car at home or not, and recognises that road transport is the largest single source of CO2 after power generation and that if climate change targets are to be met then increased investment in infrastructure projects that would facilitate active travel and the promotion of cycling and walking are needed in order to change opinions, travel habits and to help people make more sustainable transport choices.
