*S1M-3796 Pauline McNeill: Glasgow Twinning with Havana—That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow on becoming the first UK city to twin with Cuba; notes that the twinning of Glasgow and the Cuban capital of Havana will enhance cultural, educational and business links between the two cities that are historically linked by their respective roles in the sugar and tobacco trades; applauds the efforts of Havana Mayor, Hector Perez, and Glasgow Lord Provost, Alex Mosson, in bringing the twinning to fruition; further notes the crippling difficulties that Cubans continue to face as a result of 40 years of US imposed economic sanctions against their country, and urges other cities to join Glasgow in promoting friendship and exchange with the people of Cuba.
