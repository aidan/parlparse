 *S2M-694.1 Tavish Scott: European Parliament Seat Numbers-As an amendment to motion (S2M-694) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from "supports" to end and insert "welcomes the accession of the 10 new member states of the European Union on 1 May 2004; notes that the elections to the European Parliament are a reserved matter; recognises that all 15 existing member states have agreed to reduce their quota of MEPs to enable the new member states to be represented on an equitable basis; notes the consequent reduction of United Kingdom seats in the European Parliament from 87 to 78, and considers that this is appropriate given the enlargement of the European Union."
