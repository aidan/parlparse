*S2M-487# Roseanna Cunningham: Renewable Energy and Wind Farm Guidance-That the Parliament recognises the need for the development of renewable sources of energy; welcomes the work being done to ensure that Scotland becomes a market leader for wave, tidal and offshore wind energy generation and hydrogen fuel cells; recognises that wind farms, as the only currently commercially viable new renewable technology, have an important contribution to make to the mix of Scotland's energy generation; notes, however, that the absence of clear, concise and coherent guidelines for the approval of wind farm sites is causing anxiety in many Scottish communities and uncertainty for developers; is concerned that, without such guidelines, public support for renewable energy is in danger of being undermined, and believes that the Scottish Executive must urgently publish guidance on the criteria being applied to wind farm developments, take positive steps to promote and assist community-led renewable energy projects including wind farm developments, engage with the Ministry of Defence regarding its objections to wind farm developments on or near Ministry of Defence property, and encourage developers to recognise their responsibilities to local communities so that the common good of such communities can benefit from developments on their door step. Supported by: Richard Lochhead*, Bruce Crawford*
