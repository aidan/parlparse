*S3M-7060 Kenneth Gibson: World Parkinson’s Congress—That the Parliament welcomes the accomplishment of the World Parkinson’s Congress 2010 in bringing together what is considered one of the largest and most diverse groups of people with Parkinson’s disease, caregivers, scientists and other health professionals, official and non-governmental organisations ever convened to discuss and investigate Parkinson’s disease and the issues related to living with Parkinson’s disease; considers that Parkinson’s disease is one of the most debilitating, socially disruptive and costly neurodegenerative conditions in the world today and that people who live with it face serious challenges with movement and other functions that worsen as the condition progresses; believes that the scientific advances achieved to date and the further advances that will be made possible by increased investments in neuroscience over the next several years will provide the basis both for significant improvement in the management of Parkinson’s and ultimately the prospect of a cure, and further believes that this will only happen through the allocation of significant research funding from government among others.
