*S2M-1187# Rob Gibson: Promoting Timber Buildings-That the Parliament congratulates the Caithness area of Highland Council for promoting the successful seminar "Tomorrow's Houses Today" that explored the possibilities for creating energy-efficient, eco-friendly housing using local materials; notes the participants' conclusions that local timber should be a key component in construction as it offers Scotland the use of a plentiful, renewable resource; further notes the opportunities to create new house styles fit for localised climatic and landscape characteristics, and considers that the Scottish Executive should quickly respond by reforming planning laws and building regulations to encourage diverse architectural expression through the medium of timber construction for affordable and sustainable homes and public buildings.
