*S2M-3795.3 Mr David Davidson: Local Government Finance—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3795) in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from “, and recognises” to end and insert “as many in Scotland are suffering as a result of the 55% rise in council tax since the Labour/Liberal Democrat coalition came to power; believes that a proposed new system of local income tax would be over-complicated, expensive to collect, would remove accountability and transparency from local government and adversely penalise young working households, and notes that the real problem in Scotland is the high level of council taxes charged, not the tax itself.”
