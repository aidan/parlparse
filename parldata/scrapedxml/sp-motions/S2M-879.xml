*S2M-879 Alex Fergusson: Hydro Aluminium Extrusionâ€”That the Parliament notes with regret the decision by Hydro Aluminium Extrusion Ltd (HAE) of Sanquhar to close in July 2004 with the loss of 76 jobs if no alternative can be identified; further notes the vital importance of medium-sized companies such as HAE to the local economies of areas such as Upper Nithsdale and the devastating effect which the loss of 76 jobs will have on the community, given the poor transport and IT links which exist in that part of the Dumfries and Galloway region, and calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward specific proposals for improving the A76 in order to increase the competitiveness and sustainability of those companies which depend on that route.
