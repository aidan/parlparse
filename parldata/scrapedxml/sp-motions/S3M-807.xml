*S3M-807 Hugh Henry: Skills Strategy—That the Parliament notes that the skills strategy brought forward by the Scottish Executive was overwhelmingly rejected by the Parliament; notes that in reply to question S3W-5589 Cabinet Secretary, Fiona Hyslop, said "The Scottish Government does not intend to revise its skills strategy"; regrets that the clearly stated view of the Parliament is being ignored; recognises that there is no parliamentary support for the present strategy, and calls for the Cabinet Secretary to bring to the Parliament a revised strategy or, failing this, to report urgently to the Parliament on why the views of the Parliament are being ignored. Supported by: Michael McMahon*, Marilyn Livingstone*
