*S2M-4991 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Female Education—That the Parliament notes that women in sub-Saharan Africa are more than 1.5 times as likely as men to contract HIV and that millions of women in Africa have difficulty understanding practical health information; further notes that more than 10,000 girls per day will get married before they turn 15 and that 60% of the 110 million children out of school are girls; notes that one in three women and girls in the developing world live on less than $2 per day; recognises that educated girls and women are less vulnerable to HIV infection, human trafficking and other forms of exploitation and are more likely to marry later, raise fewer children who are in turn more likely to go to school, and make important contributions to family income; further recognises the role that girls’ and women’s education plays in reducing risk of infection and exploitation, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that female education is raised at the highest levels of talks with leaders in sub-Saharan countries.
