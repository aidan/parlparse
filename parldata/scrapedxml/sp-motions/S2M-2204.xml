*S2M-2204 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Ritalin Concern—That the Parliament is deeply concerned at the 10-fold increase in Ritalin prescribing found by NHS Quality Improvement Scotland; notes that 13% of all prescriptions for 6 to 14-year-olds in Fife were for Ritalin; does not believe that attention deficit hyperactivity disorder occurs at these levels amongst children, and calls for an urgent review to be conducted into why Ritalin prescribing has been adopted as a blanket response to adults’ difficulties with children’s behaviour and into the long-term effects on mental health of medically-induced drug dependency in young children. Supported by: Frances Curran*, Roseanna Cunningham*
