*S3M-2939 Bill Butler: Scottish Water Dispute—That the Parliament expresses its concern that Scottish Water has breached six years of constructive partnership with staff by imposing a 15-month pay rise of 3%, which equates to an annual offer of 2.4%, far short of the current rate of inflation, and as a result of this imposition staff have voted in favour of industrial action; notes that, by stark contrast, the remuneration of Scottish Water’s executive directors has risen from an average of £108,000 in 2002-03 to £172,000 in 2007-08; commends the hard work and commitment of Scottish Water staff and the world-class public service that they provide and fully understands that their decision to strike has not been taken lightly; recognises that Scottish Water is publicly owned and accountable to Scottish ministers who are also responsible for setting the pay remit and approving any pay deal, and believes that the Scottish Government should engage directly and as quickly as possible with both trade unions and Scottish Water to resolve this dispute and ensure that public servants are awarded a fair and negotiated pay settlement.
