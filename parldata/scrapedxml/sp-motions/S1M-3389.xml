*S1M-3389# Richard Lochhead: HM Chief Inspector of Prison Report on HM Prison Aberdeen—That the Parliament notes the decision by HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, Clive Fairweather, to publish an unprecedented and highly critical intermediate report on HM Prison Aberdeen that highlights serious staffing difficulties, violence and the lack of any meaningful regime; further notes that the report describes the prison's needs assessment, sentence management and pre-release arrangements as inadequate; condemns the Scottish Prison Service management for allowing such a situation to develop; expresses extreme concern that the report states that no drugs strategy is in place at the prison despite the huge drug problem in the north-east of Scotland and the fact that Aberdeen has some of the highest crime rates in Scotland all of which are drug- related, and considers that both the Scottish Executive and one of the Justice Committees should investigate conditions at Craiginches and the prison's role in reducing re-offending.
