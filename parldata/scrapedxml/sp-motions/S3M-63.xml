*S3M-63# Bill Butler: Implementation of the Glasgow Crossrail Scheme—That the Parliament recognises the national and local economic and transport benefits of the proposed Glasgow Crossrail scheme; accepts the added value that the proposed crossrail scheme would bring not only to Glasgow but to Scotland’s rail transport infrastructure; acknowledges that the establishment of the scheme would bridge the missing link in Scotland’s rail network; realises that the scheme would further strengthen Glasgow’s bid to host the 2014 Commonwealth Games, and believes that the compelling economic and transport case for Glasgow Crossrail is such that the Scottish Executive should commit to the implementation of the project at the earliest opportunity.
