 *S3M-4328 Stuart McMillan: Veterans Win the Right to Compensation—That the Parliament welcomes the news that veterans of atomic testing, who took part in the British Government nuclear deterrent tests in the 1950s, have won the right at the High Court to seek compensation from the Ministry of Defence; notes that around 1,000 servicemen claim that they were used as guinea pigs by the government to study the effects of radiation during tests in the Pacific Ocean; further notes that the veterans and their families have suffered from serious ill health including cancer, bone degeneration and blood disorders, and acknowledges that veterans such as Ken McGinley from Johnstone, Renfrewshire, have campaigned for decades to receive recognition and compensation and that the recent High Court ruling will finally allow them to receive justice. Supported by: Alasdair Allan*, Kenneth Gibson*, Joe FitzPatrick*
