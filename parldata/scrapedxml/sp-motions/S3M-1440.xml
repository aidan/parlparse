*S3M-1440 George Foulkes: The Whole of the UK Should Celebrate the Bravery of Scots—That the Parliament recognises that the George Medal and George Cross were both introduced in 1940 by King George VI to recognise the bravery of civilians during the Second World War; also acknowledges that the George Medal carries the head of King George IV on one side and the name of the awardee on the other; urges SNP MSPs to acknowledge that there are three medals for civilian bravery and gallantry and encourages these MSPs to note the difference between them; believes that attempts by nationalist MSPs to introduce a St Andrew’s Medal are an insult to a whole generation of Scots who fought and died to protect the United Kingdom; believes that the sole intention of Christine Grahame’s motion, S3M-1420, is to peddle narrow nationalism; remembers that one of the most recent medals for gallantry awarded to a Scot was to John Smeaton, and believes the whole of the United Kingdom is grateful to him for the unflinching bravery and selflessness that he demonstrated during the attacks on Glasgow Airport.
