*S2M-678# John Swinburne: Winter Fuel Deaths-That the Parliament notes with extreme concern recent figures that show there were 2,510 deaths from cold-related illnesses during the winter of 2002-03, the majority of these being elderly people, which is an increase of nearly 700 from the previous year; condemns such statistics as reprehensible in Scotland in the 21st century and, while welcoming the Scottish Executive's central heating and warm homes programmes, recognises that the delivery of these programmes must be radically improved to reach all senior citizens in need as soon as possible, and considers that the Scottish Executive should use its powers fully to tackle fuel poverty by looking at new initiatives that would release additional financial resources to the elderly for household essentials like heating.
