*S2M-3878 Mr Brian Monteith: Save the UK Theme and Keep the British in BBC—That the Parliament notes that in 1973 the BBC began to mark the handover from the World Service to Radio 4 at 5.30 am with a fantasia of British folk tunes called UK Theme which combines Early One Morning, Londonderry Air, Annie Laurie, What Shall We Do With the Drunken Sailor?, Greensleeves, Men of Harlech, Scotland the Brave, Trumpet Voluntary and Rule Britannia; notes that it was composed by Fritz Spiegl, an Austrian refugee, who, escaping Nazi oppression, arrived in Britain in 1939 aged 15 and, although unable to speak English or play a musical instrument, went on to become a successful musician and composer; further notes that BBC Radio 4 controller, Mark Damazer, has decided that from April the tune should be dropped in favour of an additional "pacy" news bulletin before the full news programme that commences at 6.00 am; regrets this decision and considers it to be a further step by the BBC to remove visual and aural icons of Britain from the British Broadcasting Corporation; supports the retention of the UK Theme as marking the beginning of Radio 4 broadcasts, and believes that the BBC should reverse the decision and remember that it is a British institution funded by British licence payers.
