*S2M-541.2 Chris Ballance: Scotland's Transport-As an amendment to motion (S2M-541) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from "recognises" to end and insert "notes with concern the Scottish Executive's proposals for improving transport in Scotland, as set out in A Partnership for a Better Scotland, in particular its failure to give sufficient support for healthy transport initiatives such as walking and cycling; further notes that the finance put aside so far overwhelmingly relates to encouraging road and air transport, the most polluting forms of transport, and, while welcoming any extension of concessionary fares, regrets the failure to promote an effective public transport system in Scotland."
