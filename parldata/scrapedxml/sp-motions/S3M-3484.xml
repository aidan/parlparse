*S3M-3484 Ian McKee: Pan-European Rare Disease Day, 28 February 2009—That the Parliament acknowledges the second pan-European Rare Disease Day on 28 February 2009, which successfully highlights rare diseases and the challenges faced by patients, carers, healthcare professionals and policy makers working to ensure that the highest quality of services and available treatments are accessible to often isolated and vulnerable people; notes that there are over 6,000 rare conditions identified, potentially affecting around 300,000 people in Scotland; further notes that 75% of those with a rare condition are children and that 30% die before the age of five; welcomes the key research on rare diseases being undertaken at world-leading Scottish bioscience centres; further welcomes the newly established campaign, Rare Disease UK, and urges the UK Government to move forward with the European Commission’s Communication to create a national plan for rare diseases.
