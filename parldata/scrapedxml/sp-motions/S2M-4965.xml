*S2M-4965 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Help for Farepak Customers—That the Parliament notes with grave concern that Farepak, the Christmas hamper firm, has ceased trading, with no warning to customers and that Farepak states that customers may receive some money back, but not all; further notes that many of Farepak’s customers are on low incomes and have been making regular payments to the company throughout 2006, up to and including September 2006, and that the closure leaves many of them in financial difficulties, and calls on the Scottish Executive to undertake a full inquiry into the situation and to urge Farepak’s liquidators, as a priority, to repay all customers in full. Supported by: Richard Lochhead*, Tommy Sheridan*, Campbell Martin*, Colin Fox*
