*S3M-7735 Patrick Harvie: Protecting Public Services—That the Parliament calls on ministers to open discussions in good faith with their UK counterparts regarding the prompt re-establishment of the democratically endorsed Scottish variable rate of income tax; believes that the UK Government’s cuts agenda is ideologically driven, economically illiterate and will have a disproportionate impact on poorer people both in Scotland and in the rest of the UK; rejects the Scottish Government’s decision simply to hand on these cuts to Scottish public services, with housing, energy efficiency and public transport particularly at threat; believes that the terms of the proposed council tax freeze reduce local authorities’ ability to make their own democratic decisions and look at alternatives to cutting vital local services, and urges the Scottish Government to revise the draft budget to reduce these cuts by incorporating progressive ways to raise revenue at a local level within the existing powers of the Scottish Parliament to ensure that wealthier people pay more and poorer people pay less, including options such as land value tax, a hotel bed tax and reducing exemptions to the uniform business rate.
