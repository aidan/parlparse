 *S2M-30.1 Christine Grahame: Broomhill Day Centre, Penicuik—As an amendment to motion (S2M-30) in the name of Jeremy Purvis, leave out from "and calls" to end and insert "further notes that Midlothian Council only awards annual funding when, for the purposes of forward planning, it is essential that funding is secured on a triennial basis; is aware that the funding comes from the council, the NHS and from grant-making bodies including the Community Fund and the Lloyds TSB Foundation; is concerned that the Lloyds TSB Foundation funding expires in September 2003, thereby reducing financial support by £40,000 and that, if this is not replaced, then the service provided at the centre may have to be reduced from provision for 94 frail elderly people to 40 and staffing cuts will be made; believes that it is essential that day centres such as Broomhill are 100% funded by a partnership of the local authorities and NHS boards which is where Broomhill receives 100% of its referrals from, and further believes that, without these changes, Broomhill, an award-winning centre, cannot continue to deliver its invaluable services to frail and elderly people in Penicuik."
