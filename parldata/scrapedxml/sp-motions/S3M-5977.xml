 S3M-5977 Rob Gibson: Recognising the Benefit of Social Enterprises—That the Parliament notes the recent Ipsos MORI poll that detailed that public awareness of social enterprises in Scotland had risen by 11% in just six months and now shows that 65% of Scots surveyed knew about social enterprises, up from 54% when the same question was polled in August 2009; recognises the role that the Scottish Social Enterprise Coalition has played in promoting the positive impact and crucial role that social enterprise businesses can play in their local areas, and congratulates it on its achievements in advocating the benefit of the social enterprise model. Supported by: Jamie Hepburn, Mr Frank McAveety, Michael Matheson*
