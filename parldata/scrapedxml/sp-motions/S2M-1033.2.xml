*S2M-1033.2 Roseanna Cunningham: The Historic Environment, A Valuable Resource for Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1033) in the name of Mr Frank McAveety, insert at end "; regrets that, notwithstanding the work done by individuals and organisations, there remain serious concerns about (a) a lack of both resources and information and (b) the failure to sufficiently protect, conserve, interpret and promote Scotland’s historic environment and endorses the call for a review of the historic environment backed up by a regular audit to measure progress."
