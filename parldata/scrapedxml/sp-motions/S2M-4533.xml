*S2M-4533# Cathie Craigie: Assurances Regarding Glasgow to Edinburgh High Speed Rail Link—That the Parliament notes recent press reports regarding various options for a high-speed Glasgow to Edinburgh rail link; believes that the services between Croy and other stations along the main Glasgow to Edinburgh line provide a vital service, particularly for people living in the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth area, and help to boost the local economy; further believes that any consideration of proposals for a Glasgow to Edinburgh bullet train or high-speed link should look very carefully at the needs of people living across the whole of the central belt, and considers that assurances should be given that service levels through Croy station will not face cuts because of any future changes to the rail connection between Glasgow and Edinburgh.
