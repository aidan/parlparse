*S3M-6211 Marilyn Livingstone: The Scottish Human Rights Commission Report on Historic Abuse in Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the Scottish Human Rights Commission report, A human rights framework for the design and implementation of the proposed "Acknowledgement and Accountability Forum" and other remedies for historic child abuse in Scotland; is encouraged by the announcement that a pilot forum will operate in Spring 2010 that will listen to and validate survivors’ experiences, create a historical record, signpost to services available and test out a confidential committee model, and notes that the commission believes that the pilot forum can play a valuable role in evaluating the steps required to secure effective access to justice, effective remedies and reparation for survivors of historic child abuse and that it has potential for identifying law, policy and practice changes at all relevant levels that would contribute to mitigating the risk of repetition of abuse.
