*S1M-2391 Tommy Sheridan: Recent Alleged Comments by Sheriff Ronald Smith on Peace Protestorsâ€”That the Parliament condemns the alleged comments of Sheriff Ronald Smith at Dumbarton Sheriff Court referring to peace protestors as parasites, causing untold damage to fences, disrupting the Faslane base and wasting public money which could be spent elsewhere, believes that such comments are unacceptable from a practising Sheriff and expose political bias, ignorance and intolerance of legitimate peaceful protest, and further believes that such comments would render a Sheriff unfit to sit in judgement impartially in any case involving peace protestors, if at all.
