 *S3M-4632.1 Maureen Watt: Olympic-sized Swimming Pool for Aberdeenâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-4632) in the name of Nicol Stephen, leave out from "full" to end and insert "50 metre swimming pool in Aberdeen with part funding from the Scottish Government; recognises that at no stage did Aberdeen City Council or sportscotland recommend that the pool be 10 lanes; notes that the previous administration failed to deliver on this much-needed facility during its time in office, and commends the Scottish Government for delivering on another of its promises for people in Aberdeen."
