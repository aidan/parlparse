 *S3M-8057 Sandra White: World Book Day, 3 March 2011—That the Parliament welcomes World Book Day, designated by UNESCO as a worldwide celebration of books and reading and the biggest annual celebration of books and reading in the United Kingdom and Ireland; notes that it is marked in over 100 countries around the globe; commends the aims of this day, which include encouraging children to explore the pleasures of books, and believes the joy of reading to be invaluable in helping children understand the world around them while stimulating imagination and creativity; congratulates all those schools and organisations holding events to mark the day, such as Garnetbank Primary School in Glasgow, which is organising a readathon, and encourages everyone to make the time to lose themselves in a book for a wee while on the day.
