 *S3M-2787.1 George Foulkes: The Costs of Child Poverty in the UK—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2787) in the name of Bill Wilson, leave out from "commends" to end and insert "considers that the SNP government has decided to reward those who are better-off by offering them tax cuts and penalise the less well-off by cutting local services that many children, disabled and older people depend on; believes that a lack of government funding to local authorities is responsible for cuts to nursery places and a reduction in hours, school kitchen closures, reduced support for one-parent families and funding cuts to respite care services for disabled people as well as cuts to Sure Start funding for vulnerable children and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to use the budget process as an opportunity to revise its settlement with local government; notes, in addition, that the SNP government has delivered a schools settlement described as awful by EIS General Secretary Ronnie Smith, and further believes that these cuts have plunged more people into poverty rather than lifted them out, highlighting a stark contradiction to its claim to redistribute wealth." Supported by: David Stewart*, Jackie Baillie*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Dr Richard Simpson*, Hugh Henry*, David Whitton*, Sarah Boyack* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
