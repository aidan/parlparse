 *S3M-6899 Willie Coffey: Pink Ribbon Ball Helps Tackle Breast Cancer—That the Parliament recognises the efforts of the organisers of the annual Pink Ribbon Ball, held in the Gailes Lodge, Irvine, on raising the fantastic sum of £14,000 for Crosshouse Hospital’s breast cancer team; acknowledges the significant donation of £3,500 from the Santander Banking Group and the donation of a very special star prize by the jewellers, Laings of Glasgow; further acknowledges that the success of the ball, now in its eighth year, is all down to former patient Eileen Symington from Troon, who initiated and ran the event before handing over for this year’s event to Heather Smith, Helen Lawton and Karen Russell, and applauds the efforts of these and many other volunteers who make such tremendous contributions to tackling breast cancer, which affects 800 Scots women a year, and helped deliver a 30% drop in deaths from breast cancer between 1987 and 2006.
