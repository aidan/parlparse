 *S2M-1618.1 Mr Keith Raffan: Shameless Behaviour of Liberal Democrats on Perth and Kinross Council—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1618) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from "unilaterally" to end and insert "form a new partnership administration with the SNP is in the best interests of all the people of Perth and Kinross; notes that, at the local elections in 2003, the Scottish Liberal Democrats and the SNP together won nearly 60% of the vote, and believes that the new partnership will bring badly-needed stability and focus to the work of the council, especially as the Scottish Liberal Democrat and SNP councillors share the common aim of investing in, and so improving, public services, unlike the Conservative councillors, who are only interesting in toeing Michael Howard’s line by imposing highly damaging cuts in services which would hit hard at young and old alike."
