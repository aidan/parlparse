*S3M-1036 Jamie Stone: Support for Scottish Pig Industry—That the Parliament recognises the importance of the Scottish pig industry; notes the impact of the August and September 2007 outbreaks of foot-and-mouth disease on the industry, leading to a backlog of pigs on farms due to the movement restrictions, an export ban and increased imports; further notes the additional burden of increased costs to the industry associated with pre-movement veterinary inspections, haulage costs resulting from a ban on multiple pick-ups and feed costs due to the retention of stock, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to investigate urgently putting together a support package to help to alleviate the detrimental financial effect of the foot-and-mouth outbreak.
