*S2M-5162 Carolyn Leckie: Resist the NHS Profiteers—That the Parliament expresses profound concern about the decision by NHS Lanarkshire to put out to tender the provision of primary medical care at Harthill health centre; recognises that it is Scottish Executive policy and legislation that has facilitated this situation; believes that the experience of England’s primary care services at the hands of predatory companies like US multinational United Health should have acted as a brake on any such developments in Scotland; condemns NHS Lanarkshire for choosing to go out to tender rather than seeking to provide the services in the normal way; believes that other primary medical services will be put at risk by this development, which signifies a further escalation of privatisation of the NHS, and calls on NHS Lanarkshire to recall the tendering process and for the Executive to change policy direction and ensure that no further primary medical services are put out to tender. Supported by: Frances Curran*, Rosie Kane*, Dr Jean Turner*, Tommy Sheridan*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*
