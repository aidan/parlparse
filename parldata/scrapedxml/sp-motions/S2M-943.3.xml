*S2M-943.3 Robin Harper: A Better Deal for Young People-As an amendment to motion (S2M-943) in the name of Peter Peacock, insert at end "but regrets the Executive's decision to withdraw funding from the Airborne Initiative; commends the staff for the excellent work that they have put in over the last 10 years; recognises that the initiative's strategy, in terms of what was possible, has been a huge success in that at least half of the participants completed the last course, and believes that the Executive should consider whether it has any other scheme that is likely to be anywhere near as effective in helping serious and persistent offenders back into society and out of prison on a permanent basis."
