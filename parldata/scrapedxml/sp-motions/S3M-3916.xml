*S3M-3916 Robert Brown: School Closures by Glasgow City Council’s Labour Administration—That the Parliament is appalled at the decision of Glasgow City Council’s Labour administration to recommend the closure of 20 primary and nursery schools across the city and to disregard the views of local communities, particularly in Wyndford and Cadder, which continue to campaign so persuasively against the closures; notes the apparent abandonment by the council of the commitment in its single outcome agreement to provide parents and carers with access to high quality education and childcare within "buggy pushing distance" of their homes; recognises the need to reduce under-occupancy in city schools but considers that this should have been done on a basis that builds on local communities and retains a community school comprising both non-denominational and denominational traditions, and urges all councillors to support this approach at the council meeting on 23 April 2009. Supported by: Ross Finnie*, Robin Harper*, Bill Kidd*
