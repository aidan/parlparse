*S1M-1426 Mr Andrew Welsh: Arbroath Football Club-That the Parliament notes the recent confusion over reports that Arbroath Football Club's world record feat of a 36-0 victory had been surpassed; welcomes the fact that the Red Lichties' 115-year-old record remains intact; further notes that John Petrie scored 13 goals in that game, a feat which also remains an individual record for the number of goals scored by a single player in one match; recognises the great achievement of these two records, and hopes that the chants of "36-0, 36-0" will live on at Gayfield for many years to come. Supported by: Richard Lochhead*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*
