*S3M-5820 Marlyn Glen: Specialist Police Units Tackling Complex Offences such as E-crime and Murderâ€”That the Parliament applauds the call by Tayside Police Chief Constable, Justine Curran, to extend co-operative working between forces to deal with complex offences such as e-crime and murder and issues such as human trafficking for the sex trade; notes that Tayside Police and two other forces already work together on firearms, and believes that shared units to deal with these complex crimes would help deal with more cases and build specialist expertise in our police forces.
