*S3M-5343 John Farquhar Munro: Landowners Forcing Unreasonable Rent Demands on Tenant Farmers—That the Parliament is concerned that the high cost of the legal process that has to be followed to challenge large rent increases imposed by landowners and land agents is forcing agricultural tenants to accept intolerable rent increases that they can ill afford and calls on the Scottish Government to investigate changing the law to provide an affordable and practical system that allows rent disputes to be handled without excessive legal costs.
