*S2M-1326.3 Carolyn Leckie: Health Issues-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1326) in the name of David McLetchie, leave out from ", despite a" to end and insert "Scotland's health and quality of health services are not improving in relation to the wealth available in the fourth biggest economy in the world; further notes that the NHS has insufficient core capacity and insufficient core staffing of establishments that have increased agency, overtime and locum costs; is concerned that NHS boards have substantial deficits and plan unacceptable reductions in service provision and jobs; believes that resources that should be directly spent on patient care are diverted to ever-increasing profits for private consortia, private health providers of all kinds and pharmaceutical companies; notes that the Scottish Executive and NHS boards have repeatedly failed to strategically plan effectively; believes that all forms of privatisation in the NHS such as PFI/PPP and contracting from private providers should be stopped; further believes that the pharmaceutical companies should be brought into public ownership or, in the meantime, at the very least, the Executive should urgently introduce a drug-pricing regime that will control and deflate drug company profits, and believes that capacity and staffing establishments need to be systematically enlarged."
