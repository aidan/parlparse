*S3M-6562 Robert Brown: Eye Health Week—That the Parliament welcomes National Eye Health Week running from 14 to 20 June 2010; notes the importance of ensuring a high level of awareness of eye health; believes that the early detection of conditions that could contribute to sight loss and impairment is essential not only for the wellbeing of the individual but because such intervention could reduce future costs to the public purse, in particular to the health and social care budgets; recognises that Scotland has exemplary eye health services that have been made possible through leading innovations such as free eye tests, and congratulates all those involved in the eye care sector for the professional and dedicated work they carry out.
