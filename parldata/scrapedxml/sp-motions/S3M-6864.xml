 *S3M-6864 Stuart McMillan: Kirkintilloch Canal Festival 2010—That the Parliament welcomes the Kirkintilloch Canal Festival, which takes place on Sunday 29 August 2010; notes that the canal festival is a free-entry event showcasing a mix of local musical talent, circus acts with exciting fire shows and dance, food stalls, exhibitions and market stalls for all to enjoy; further notes that, at 35-miles long, the canal passes through East Dunbartonshire from east to west, providing a route for sea-going vessels; acknowledges that Kirkintilloch is known as the canal capital of Scotland as it’s the only town along the Forth and Clyde Canal corridor to have the canal passing through its town centre; wishes the festival every success for 2010, and hopes that it will continue to go from strength to strength.
