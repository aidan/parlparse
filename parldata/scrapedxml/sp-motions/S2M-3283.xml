*S2M-3283 Mr Jamie McGrigor: Christine’s Wide Ball—That the Parliament notes the comments of Christine Grahame MSP that cricket is a sport of "only marginal interest in Scotland"; believes that her comments ignore the facts that cricket is celebrating the 220th anniversary of the first-recorded match in Scotland in 1785, that there are an estimated 12,000 active cricketers of all ages in Scotland, that a sell-out crowd of 4,500 paid to see Scotland play Australia earlier this summer and that it is estimated that three times that number could have packed the Grange in Edinburgh had there been capacity for them and that the BBC considered interest in the match to be sufficient to show the game live, that eight of the 20 players from the smaller countries which qualified for the ICC World Cup invited to a pre-World Cup training camp are Scottish and three are Scots-born Asians, and celebrates Scottish cricket’s proud record in helping people from across the world integrate into their local communities in Scotland.
