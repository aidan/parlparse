 *S3M-7593.1 Patrick Harvie: Forth Crossing Billâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-7593) in the name of John Swinney, insert at end " but, in so doing, considers that, in light of the current economic and environmental circumstances, the Scottish Government should not sign any further contracts relating to the works set out in the Forth Crossing Bill until a re-inspection of the cables of the existing Forth Road Bridge and an evaluation of the current dehumidification works have been conducted and until a further assessment has been made thereafter, if necessary, of the most cost-effective way for the existing road bridge to be repaired".
