*S3M-7457 Kenneth Gibson: Tax Avoidance—That the Parliament is appalled by what it considers to be the UK Government’s casual attitude towards tax avoidance by some of Britain’s richest companies; believes that the acceptance of such behaviour renders the Prime Minister’s claim that we’re all in this together in terms of the recession, redundant; agrees that closing obvious tax loopholes and ensuring that the correct amount of taxation is paid by companies would be a more effective way of reducing the budget deficit than by simply slashing public spending; finds incredible reports that HM Revenue and Customs allowed Vodafone to forgo £4.8 billion of tax; is aware that, days after this case was settled, Chancellor George Osborne travelled to India to promote Vodafone; is shocked by suggestions that UK companies annually avoid at least £12 billion in tax, and believes that HM Treasury should act with urgency to close such loopholes. Supported by: Robin Harper*, Bill Kidd*, Christina McKelvie*, Aileen Campbell*
