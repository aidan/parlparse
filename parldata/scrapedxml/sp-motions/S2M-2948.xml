 * S2M-2948 Rosie Kane: Nitrogen Dioxide Levels in Glasgow—That the Parliament condemns the Scottish Executive’s failure to produce an air safety plan for Glasgow in respect of nitrogen dioxide levels, as requested by the European Commission; further condemns the Executive’s lack of willingness to address this issue despite the grave health risks associated with nitrogen dioxide levels, especially to those with asthma and other respiratory conditions; calls on both the Executive and Glasgow City Council to publish what plans they do have on this issue, and further calls on the Executive and Glasgow City Council to undertake a city-wide clean up of the air as a matter of urgency.
