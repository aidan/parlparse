*S3M-581 Margaret Mitchell: Police Cameras—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Strathclyde Police to equip officers with digital cameras for a six month trial in Hamilton, Rutherglen and Cambuslang; believes that the initiative could help reduce crime and antisocial behaviour in the areas covered by the scheme; notes calls from East Kilbride and District Crime Prevention Panel for a similar scheme in East Kilbride, and therefore calls on Strathclyde Police to consider extending the scheme throughout South Lanarkshire should the pilot prove to be successful.
