*S2M-5185 Mrs Nanette Milne: Parkinson’s Disease—That the Parliament supports the launch of the Parkinson’s Disease Society’s "Get it on time" campaign to raise awareness of the importance of ensuring that people with Parkinson’s in hospitals and care homes get their medication on time, every time; recognises that, when patients do not get their medication on time, every time, their Parkinson’s symptoms become uncontrolled and they can become very ill; notes that there is currently no known cure for Parkinson’s; supports the efforts of all those engaged in research into all aspects of Parkinson’s disease at centres across the United Kingdom, and congratulates the society for investing more than £30 million in research since it was founded in 1969.
