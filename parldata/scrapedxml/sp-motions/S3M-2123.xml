*S3M-2123 Helen Eadie: Here’s to More Cracks in the Glass Ceiling—That the Parliament congratulates Norma Graham, who is the first woman ever to be appointed to the position of a Chief Constable in Scotland; notes that Mrs Graham, who secured the appointment as Chief Constable of Fife on merit, joined the police service in 1981, serving in Lothian and Borders Police; further notes that her early career featured a number of uniform and CID roles in Edinburgh and the Lothians, including Head of the Drug Squad and Head of Policy and that on promotion to Superintendent, Mrs Graham became Deputy Divisional Commander in the north of the city and later moved to HM Inspectorate of Constabulary as Chief Superintendent, becoming Lead Staff Officer responsible for the inspection of all Scottish forces; notes that on return to Lothian and Borders Police she was appointed Head of Crime Management; further notes that Mrs Graham was appointed Assistant Chief Constable of Central Scotland Police in 2002, where she was responsible for operations until she came to Fife in 2005, taking up the post of Deputy Chief Constable until May 2008 when Mrs Graham was appointed to her current role in Fife Constabulary as Acting Chief Constable, and congratulates at the same time Chief Superintendent Valerie McHoull, who last month became the first female president of a leading police representative body, the Association of Scottish Police Superintendents.
