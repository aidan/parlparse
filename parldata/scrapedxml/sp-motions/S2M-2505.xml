 *S2M-2505 Christine Grahame: ISEA’s Success—That the Parliament is reminded of the valuable work of Independent Special Education Advice Scotland (ISEA) which, because of the failure of the Scottish Executive over the years to respond with funding for this most effective charity, led to a forced closure of its operations in March 2004 with over 1,200 clients on its books; notes that it has now reopened having secured £90,000 from Comic Relief to fund a parliamentary liaison officer and a further £124,000, both over three years, from the Big Lottery Fund for advocacy services, specifically for the new tribunal procedure under the Additional Support for Learning (Scotland) Act 2004; is concerned that an application for funding from the Executive of £65,000 over three years for an ethnic minority worker has this week been rejected, and calls on the Executive to revisit this decision soon. Supported by: Stewart Stevenson*, Mr Bruce McFee*, Fiona Hyslop*, Shiona Baird*
