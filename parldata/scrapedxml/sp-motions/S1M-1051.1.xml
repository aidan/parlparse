*S1M-1051.1 Alex Johnstone: Forward Strategy for Agriculture—As an amendment to motion (S1M-1051) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "the steps" to end and insert "steps being taken to secure a sustainable future for the agricultural industry as part of the social, economic and environmental fabric of rural Scotland; recognises agriculture as the main economic driver in rural Scotland; deplores the lack of urgency being shown by the Scottish Executive in addressing the short-term problems of Scotland’s farmers, and calls for a speedy conclusion to the series of consultations on an agricultural strategy so that action can be initiated to protect the future of the farming industry."
