*S3M-4384 Jackie Baillie: Friends of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs, Visitor Payback Scheme—That the Parliament welcomes the Visitor Payback Scheme being piloted by the Friends of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs; notes that the scheme has the potential to raise significant funds for conservation and enhancement projects in the Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park; understands that the scheme works closely with local businesses and visitors, giving them the opportunity to donate money to projects for the national park; believes that the scheme will demonstrate commitment to sustainability and will enrich the unique diverse natural and cultural heritage of the national park area; further notes that this is the first Visitor Payback Scheme of such a scale in Scotland; thanks Argyll and the Islands LEADER programme, Scottish Enterprise, Loch Lomond and The Trossachs National Park, Scottish Natural Heritage and West Dunbartonshire Council for funding the project, and wishes Friends of Loch Lomond and The Trossachs every success with this venture.
