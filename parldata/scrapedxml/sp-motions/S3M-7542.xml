*S3M-7542♦ Alex Johnstone: Bell Rock Lighthouse—That the Parliament notes that 2011 marks the bicentenary of the Bell Rock Lighthouse situated off the coast of Arbroath, which is widely considered to be one of the seven wonders of the industrial world; welcomes what it considers the substantial investment made in the refurbishment of the Signal Tower museum in Arbroath, which will now focus on the history of this world-famous lighthouse, and wishes the community-led year-long celebration of the bicentenary, called the Year of the Light, every success in promoting Arbroath and its maritime history.
