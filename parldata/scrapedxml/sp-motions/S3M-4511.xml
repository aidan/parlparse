*S3M-4511 Mary Mulligan: West Lothian Council Rent Increases—That the Parliament condemns the decision of SNP-led West Lothian Council to increase rents for new-build council houses in West Lothian by 10%, which is on top of an existing 20% increase over four years in council rents imposed by the SNP-led council in 2007; considers that this decision will create an unfair two-tier rent structure for council housing in West Lothian and means that a tenant renting a three bedroom house in one street will pay £51.35 per week whereas a tenant renting a similar sized new-build property in the next will pay £74.80, a difference of £23.45 each week; further considers this reprehensible decision to be grossly unfair; recognises that it will put hard-pressed families under greater economic pressure, and welcomes the statement from West Lothian Council Labour group opposing this disgraceful rent hike.
