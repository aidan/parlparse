 *S2M-3922.1 Mr David Davidson: Local Government Finance (Scotland) Order 2006—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3922) in the name of Mr Tom McCabe, insert at end "but, in so doing, considers that there is a lack of democratic accountability at the local government level due to the high level of ring-fencing attached to the Scottish Executive’s revenue support grant, and further considers that only when councils are freer to set their own spending priorities will local needs be better met."
