*S2M-5289 Trish Godman: Congratulations to Inverclyde Council Tenants on Voting for a Housing Stock Transfer—That the Parliament congratulates Inverclyde Council tenants for voting overwhelmingly for the transfer of the ownership of their houses from Inverclyde Council to the housing association, River Clyde Homes; believes that this shows both good sense and trust in those who advocated such a radical change; welcomes River Clyde Homes’ commitment to install 3,500 new kitchens and 2,600 new bathrooms and to construct 1,000 new houses; recognises that tenants, by way of democratically-elected tenant representatives, will play a direct, central and effective managerial role in the management of this housing association, thereby guaranteeing that the association becomes a genuine, community-based housing association, based on participation and equality, and calls on the Scottish Executive and River Clyde Homes to guarantee such an outcome that is entirely satisfactory to the tenants’ interests and needs and is based on the principles of tenant participation. Supported by: Mr Duncan McNeil*
