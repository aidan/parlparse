*S2M-3902# Mr Duncan McNeil: Greenock Telegraph Brighter Smiles Campaign—That the Parliament acknowledges the importance of ensuring that children get into the habit of regular visits to the dentist at as early an age as possible; expresses concern that some 5,300 children and young people in Inverclyde are not registered with a dentist; notes that this amounts to approximately one-third of the children in the area; further notes that research by Greenock’s Phoenix Community Health Project found that parents were unsure about where, when and with whom to register a child, and therefore congratulates the Greenock Telegraph for running a very successful, high-profile campaign to get local children signed up with a dentist and on the road to better oral health throughout their lives.
