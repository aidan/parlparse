*S1M-1890.1 Roseanna Cunningham: Crimeâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-1890) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "asserts that since 1997 the UK Government and the Scottish Executive have failed the Scottish criminal justice system and the Scottish people in (a) presiding over an increase in both the levels of crime and the fear of crime, (b) providing insufficient numbers of police officers at the front line, (c) failing to alleviate the serious public concern over the levels of youth offending and (d) overseeing a collapse in morale in the Scottish prison system and calls upon the Scottish Executive to bring forward a coherent programme which will both tackle the major problems currently being experienced across the Scottish criminal justice system and deliver a safer Scotland for everyone."
