 * S2M-2859 Carolyn Leckie:Congratulations to BBC Staff—That the Parliament acknowledges the effectiveness of the 24-hour stoppage of BBC staff, organised by the NUJ, BECTU and Amicus, and congratulates them on their display of solidarity; regrets that such action was necessary; believes that the unions’ demands of no compulsory redundancies, a 90-day moratorium on the proposals for BBC cuts, no sell-off of BBC Broadcast and BBC Resources, or at least protection of terms and conditions and pensions assured, are reasonable, and considers that the BBC should move from its position of consulting only on an immovable set of proposals and agree to participate in meaningful negotiations which might avoid the need for further strikes. Supported by: Frances Curran*, Brian Adam*, Campbell Martin*, Colin Fox*, Robert Brown*, Ms Sandra White* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
