*S3M-3407 Robin Harper: Supporting Scotland’s Future, Research from Scotland’s Colleges—That the Parliament notes the recent research report produced by Scotland’s Colleges, Supporting Scotland’s Future, available at http://www.ascol.org.uk/docs/research_report_web.pdf; further notes Scotland’s Colleges’ proposal in the Scottish Government’s review of student support to move all of Scotland’s HNC and HND students from loans funded through the Students Awards Agency for Scotland to means-tested bursaries funded in the same way as other college bursaries in order to create a simplified system where students studying higher education courses in colleges receive the support that they need to complete their courses without being obstructed by the burden of debt, which, according to research, college students find to be the biggest barrier to accessing higher education, and calls on the Scottish Government to pay close consideration to the research by Scotland’s Colleges and its proposals with a view to supporting students in colleges to be able to access higher education without the burden of huge student debt.
