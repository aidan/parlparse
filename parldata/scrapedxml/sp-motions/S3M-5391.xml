 *S3M-5391 John Park: Scotland’s Role in National Research into Asbestos-related Diseases—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the National Centre for Asbestos-Related Diseases (NCARD): A Strategy Document on 30 November 2009 by the NCARD Development Group; considers that this important document is significant for the future of research into asbestos-related illnesses and the treatment of such conditions; believes that Scottish involvement in the development of asbestos research in the United Kingdom would be beneficial; notes with deep concern that, according to the Health and Safety Executive, exposure to asbestos is the biggest single cause of work-related deaths and that the number of people dying of an asbestos-related disease is rising and is yet to peak; further notes that NHS Fife has reported that 239 people from Fife have been diagnosed with asbestos-related illnesses in the last five years; is reminded that asbestos-related disease is by no means a problem of the past; recognises the important work of support organisations across Scotland, and sends a message to victims and their families in Scotland that MSPs will continue to work to improve awareness, research and treatment of asbestos-related diseases.
