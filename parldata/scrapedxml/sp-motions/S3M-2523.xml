 *S3M-2523 Bill Wilson: Get Fair - A Citizen’s Wage and the ALBA Model for a Fairer Society—That the Parliament agrees with more than 50 organisations represented by the Get Fair anti-poverty umbrella body that Britain has become an unacceptably divided society; notes, as an example of the divide, that men living in Scotland’s most deprived areas, such as parts of Clydeside, have a life expectancy 10.7 years shorter than that of men in the least deprived areas; further notes that Get Fair contends that three-quarters of the UK population agree that the gap between the rich and the poor has grown too large; believes that such facts and opinions reflect the failure of the economic policies of successive governments of the United Kingdom, the fifth richest country in the word, and calls on the present UK Government urgently to examine alternatives to the failed neoliberal economic model, including the implementation of a citizen’s wage and the co-operative economic strategies piloted by the ALBA countries of Latin America and the Caribbean.
