*S2M-572 Donald Gorrie: Scottish Football Writers' Association-That the Parliament deeply regrets the decision of the Scottish Football Writers' Association to exclude women from membership of the association; further regrets their decision to exclude women as guests at their annual dinner, and calls on all football clubs and players in Scotland to put pressure on the association until it recognises that there is no place for gender discrimination in a 21st century Scotland.
