*S2M-437# Mr Brian Monteith: Rising Crime in Forth Valley—That the Parliament notes that the number of recorded crimes and offences in Forth Valley increased again in 2002-03, despite the local constabulary’s enviable record of detecting and clearing up crime; recognises that a secure society can only be built on a foundation of public order and that this requires public policy to focus on cutting crime, reducing the risk of re-offending and keeping young people off the conveyor belt to crime, and believes that the Scottish Executive should begin by supporting the local police force with additional resources for a more visible presence on the streets, ensuring honesty in sentencing of convicted criminals by removing automatic remission and providing more flexible funding arrangements to local authorities when asking them to tackle the problems of crime and anti-social behaviour.
