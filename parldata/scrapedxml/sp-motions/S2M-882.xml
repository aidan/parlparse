*S2M-882 Tricia Marwick: Scottish Affairs Select Committee - Election of MSPs-That the Parliament notes the report by the Scottish Affairs Select Committee published on 3 February 2004; further notes the motion that the Parliament passed on 27 March 2002 on the size of the Scottish Parliament; believes that any modification to the number of the Parliament's elected representatives and the system by which they are elected should be a matter for the Parliament, and considers that, until such time as this Parliament has sovereignty for all matters related to its operation, the House of Commons should not amend the Scotland Act 1998 unless such changes have the consent of the Parliament.
