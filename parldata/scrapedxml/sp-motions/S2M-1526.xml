*S2M-1526 Mr Brian Monteith: Closure of Holy Trinity Episcopal Primary School-That the Parliament regrets the Scottish Executive's failure to reverse the decision by Stirling Council's ruling Labour administration to close Holy Trinity Episcopal Primary School in the top of the town area of the city; regrets the failure of Stirling Council to raise the prospect of closure until immediately after the local authority elections; believes the decision is against the interests of education in Stirling and detrimental to the teaching of children in the city; further believes that the Executive and the local authority have consistently failed to listen to the wishes of parents, the local community and those involved in the school; believes that an adequate case for the closure of the school has failed to be made by either Stirling Council or the Executive, and further believes that the Executive should have used its powers over the closure of denominational schools to ensure that the local authority kept the school open.
