*S2M-3592 Mike Pringle: Every Penny Counts for Mature Students—That the Parliament supports the Edinburgh University Students’ Association’s “Every Penny Counts” campaign; supports its call that tertiary education should be truly accessible to all students irrespective of age; notes that every penny does count when dealing with student debt and is disappointed that Lothian Buses discriminates against full-time students over the age of 25 by refusing to issue them with student ridacards, and calls on Lothian Buses to reverse this decision.
