*S3M-667 Richard Lochhead: Agriculture—That the Parliament notes with concern the impact on our livestock industry, particularly the sheep sector, of the recent outbreaks of foot and mouth disease in England; calls on the UK Government to recognise its financial and moral responsibility to reimburse Scotland’s farmers; acknowledges the work being done in Scotland to support the sustainability of the Scottish livestock industry and the viability of rural communities; welcomes the review, to be led by Professor Jim Scudamore and commissioned by the Scottish Government, into Scotland’s response to the outbreaks, and recognises the need to reduce the risk of future outbreaks and minimise the impact of future disruption.
