*S2M-1673# Jeremy Purvis: Dying with Dignity—That the Parliament acknowledges the commencement of the select committee of the House of Lords’ consideration of physician-assisted dying and euthanasia; further acknowledges the publication of an NOP opinion poll that showed that 82% of respondents in Scotland favour a change in the law to permit people with an incurable terminal illness close to death to seek help to die with dignity; is concerned that 39% of respondents in Scotland said that they would break the law if a loved one who became terminally ill and was suffering unbearably asked them to help them die; recognises the huge benefit to society and individuals of professionals, volunteers and carers working in palliative care and the hospice movement who work tirelessly with compassion and commitment but recognises that there are some people who will not be helped and that they will seek the right to die with dignity, and calls for a wide debate on end of life issues and consideration of a change in the law.
