 * S2M-2849 Mr Jamie Stone: Changes to BBC Weather Forecastâ€”That the Parliament notes the changes the BBC has made to weather forecast bulletins; further notes that these changes distort Scotland, Northern Ireland and the north of England on the map, reducing the information available to many viewers, especially across the north of Scotland, with the Northern Isles barely visible at all; recognises that many people depend on reliable weather forecasting to make their living as fishermen, farmers or crofters or to pursue outdoor leisure activities, and therefore calls on the BBC to revise the maps to provide an adequate weather forecast service for the whole of the United Kingdom.
