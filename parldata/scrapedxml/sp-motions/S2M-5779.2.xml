*S2M-5779.2 Alasdair Morgan: Scotland in the United Kingdomâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-5779) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "United Kingdom" to end and insert "current constitutional arrangements do not offer the right solutions to the challenges facing Scotland, that the natural state of independence, enjoyed by our most successful neighbours, offers the best opportunities for Scotland and that the people of Scotland should have an opportunity in a referendum within the next four years to make their own decision on whether or not Scotland should be independent."
