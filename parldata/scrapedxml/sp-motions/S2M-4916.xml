*S2M-4916 Murray Tosh: Welfare of Animals During Transport—That the Parliament notes EU Regulation 1/2005 on the welfare of animals during transport and the conclusion of the Scottish Executive’s consultation on the detailed regulations to be introduced in Scotland, beginning in January 2007; welcomes the Executive’s recognition of the potential costs for rural businesses of over £42 million and of the need to strike the balance correctly between animal welfare benefits and the cost of compliance, and calls on the Executive to introduce regulations which streamline procedures and minimise costs relating to obtaining authorisations and certificates of competence, to provide derogations for journeys under 12 hours within the United Kingdom, to protect the UK industry from ventilation and temperature requirements which are not appropriate in the UK’s climate and to apply requirements for shallower loading ramps only to new vehicles.
