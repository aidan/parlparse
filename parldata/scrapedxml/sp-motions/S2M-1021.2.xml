*S2M-1021.2 Mrs Mary Mulligan: Winter Cold-Related Deaths—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1021) in the name of John Swinburne, leave out from "with extreme concern" to end and insert "the recent figures on winter cold-related deaths; recognises the decrease by half in the number of fuel-poor households in Scotland; welcomes the Scottish Executive’s extension of the central heating programme to upgrade or replace partial or inefficient central heating systems for the over-80s in the private sector, and reaffirms the commitment to eradicate fuel poverty as far as reasonably practicable by 2016 thereby combating the threat of winter cold-related deaths." Supported by: Ms Margaret Curran*
