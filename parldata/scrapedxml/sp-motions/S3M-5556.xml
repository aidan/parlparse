 *S3M-5556 Willie Coffey: Guide Dogs’ Talking Buses Campaign—That the Parliament acknowledges the role of accessible local bus services in the mobility of disabled people; recognises that the lack of audiovisual information systems on buses makes those services difficult to use for many people, and supports the Talking Buses campaign, led by the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association and supported by many other organisations concerned with the needs of disabled people, which calls on the UK Government to amend the Public Service Vehicle Accessibility Regulations 2000 to require audible and visual information systems on all new buses to provide information on the current stop, next stop and final destination.
