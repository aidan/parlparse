*S2M-5166 Tommy Sheridan: Oppose Politically Driven Public Service Cuts—That the Parliament notes the report from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC) into the effect of the £375 million cost-cutting exercise by the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) which has decimated the service to the public so much that the PAC Chairman, Edward Leigh MP, described the service as “unresponsive, overcomplicated and unreliable” and that the “people left hanging on the phone would have met with derisive laughter the claim by the DWP that it was modernising the delivery of welfare benefits”; also notes that a total of 21 million calls to the DWP helplines went unanswered, representing almost half, 44%, of all calls to Jobcentre Plus, the Pension Service and the Disability and Carers Service (DCS) and that the worst problems were experienced by callers to DCS helplines, with inquiries about Disability Living Allowance and Attendance Allowance getting through to a member of staff in only 21% of cases; condemns the New Labour government for implementing such politically motivated and damaging cuts in essential services for the most vulnerable citizens, and supports the campaign of the Public and Commercial Services (PCS) union and other welfare and pensioners’ groups to reverse these cuts.
