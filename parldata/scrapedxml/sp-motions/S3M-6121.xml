*S3M-6121 Aileen Campbell: Demos Calls for Votes at 16—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of two new documents by the think tank, Demos, An Anatomy of Youth and The New Frontier, which call for greater democratic empowerment of young people in the United Kingdom, including the extension of the franchise to 16 and 17-year-olds, and examine the range of challenges facing younger generations; notes that the SNP in government has already extended the vote to 16 and 17-year-olds in the pilot elections to NHS boards and has proposed allowing this age group to vote in any referendum on Scotland’s constitutional future, and calls on political parties and government at all levels to find ways to ensure that young people are fully engaged with democratic life in Scotland. Supported by: Bob Doris*, Bill Kidd*, Sandra White*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Stuart McMillan*
