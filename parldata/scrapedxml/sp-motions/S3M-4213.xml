*S3M-4213 Liam McArthur: Countryside Ranger Service—That the Parliament recognises the important contribution that countryside rangers make to public life in Scotland; acknowledges, in particular, their role in supporting and extending public access to our green spaces as well as facilitating a better understanding and appreciation of Scotland’s rich natural heritage; believes that the countryside ranger service can play an important part in helping to deliver a wide range of broader education and health benefits, and calls on government at national and local level to support the service and ensure that it remains able to perform these valuable and wide-ranging functions.
