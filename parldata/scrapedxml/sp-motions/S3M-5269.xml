*S3M-5269 Bill Kidd: Arrival of HMS Astute (S119) at HMNB Clyde—That the Parliament notes with concern the arrival of the first of the newly deployed Astute-class nuclear-powered fleet submarines, HMS Astute (S119), at HM Naval Base (HMNB) Clyde on Friday 20 November 2009; understands that the submarine, the first of a possible seven, is to begin sea trials next year, approximately three years behind schedule at an approximate overspend of £1 billion; believes this to be a gross waste of taxpayers’ money, especially considering that UK Government debt currently stands at an astronomical 59.2% of GDP, and, in view of a reported number of nuclear safety breaches at HMNB Clyde under what would appear to be the worryingly negligent supervision of the Ministry of Defence, expresses concern at the presence of yet another nuclear-powered and nuclear-weapons-capable fleet of submarines in Scotland’s waters.
