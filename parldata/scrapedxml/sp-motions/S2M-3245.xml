*S2M-3245# Mrs Nanette Milne: Communication Impairment—That the Parliament notes that there are an estimated 250,000 people in Scotland who have communication impairment; recognises that communication impairment can affect every waking moment of a person’s life and that those affected by communication impairment, by definition, are not easily able to speak up about their needs, and believes that the Scottish Executive should take immediate steps to support quality social action research in order to develop a comprehensive and coherent framework for action on communication impairment in Scotland.
