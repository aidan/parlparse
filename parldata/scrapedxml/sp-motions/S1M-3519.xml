*S1M-3519 Fergus Ewing: Dentistry—That the Parliament notes that children’s registration with an NHS dental practice expires after a period of 15 months; believes that a child should be registered with a dentist until adulthood, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to amend the current rules governing registration of children with NHS dentists so that registration does not lapse in this way.
