 *S3M-3569 Jack McConnell: One World Action’s More Women More Power Campaign—That the Parliament notes that 8 March 2009 is International Women’s Day; is proud, but not complacent, that women represent a third of all members of the Scottish Parliament; is determined that recent progress in Scotland will not mean that the issue of women’s political representation falls off the agenda; considers that this issue is a matter of justice and democracy and is essential to tackling poverty and inequality; encourages MSPs to support One World Action’s More Women More Power campaign for greater political representation globally and in the United Kingdom, and calls for urgent action to implement Article 7 of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women on ending discrimination in political and public life.
