*S3M-3596 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Leith Docks to Retain Nameâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the decision by Forth Ports to drop its plans to rebrand part of the waterfront development at Leith Docks as Edinburgh Harbour; recognises the historical significance of the Port of Leith and the strong and distinct identity of the area, and welcomes the decision of Forth Ports to listen to the opinion of the thousands of Leith residents who ran a successful campaign against the name change.
