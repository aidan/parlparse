 *S3M-414♦ David Stewart: UN International Day for the Eradication of Poverty—That the Parliament supports the UN International Day for Eradication of Poverty on 17 October; notes that promises made in 1970 to devote 0.7% of gross national income to overseas development aid have not been met by the international community; notes that every G8 country except the United Kingdom is off target to meet commitments made at the Gleneagles Summit in 2005 and that the UN Millennium Development Goals are unlikely to be met by 2015; believes that more international action is needed to deliver more and better aid, trade justice, full debt relief and gender equality and to tackle climate change; further notes that millions of people around the world are still united in the fight against global poverty and inequality, and considers that solidarity should be shown through support for participation in the Global Call to Action Against Poverty’s world record attempt on 17 October 2007 for the largest number of people ready to stand up and speak out against poverty and inequality. Supported by: Peter Peacock*, Rhoda Grant*
