*S2M-1484# Carolyn Leckie: Closure and Rationalisation of Maternity Services-That the Parliament expresses its grave concern at the sustained attacks on maternity services; believes that rationalisation of maternity services with consultations held in isolation and without reference to cross-boundary and pan-Scotland impact continue unabated; notes that claimed benefits of centralisation in relation to morbidity and mortality are unproven; is concerned that the risks associated with reduced access to consultant-led services have not been assessed and no time has been allowed to assess the impact of previous closures before further closures are embarked upon; reiterates concern that there are no minimum standards for staffing establishments of midwives across the service and that models for calculating staff numbers and ratios are outdated and outmoded; notes that expectations of staff by the public and demands of government have increased dramatically over the years which has created more work for all staff providing maternity services despite a declining birth rate, and considers that the Scottish Executive should implement a moratorium on maternity closures and conduct a full, systemic analysis of the provision of maternity services across Scotland that involves the public and all trade union and professional organisations with the aim of establishing agreed minimum staffing establishments in a safe, co-ordinated service that meets the needs of all women and families across the whole of Scotland, maintains the expertise and excellence already established in the provision of these services and finds ways to deliver the right service for properly assessed need that has the confidence of communities, whatever measures are necessary to achieve these objectives.
