*S2M-4358 Euan Robson: International Nurses’ Day 2006: Safe Staffing Saves Lives—That the Parliament notes that 12 May 2006 is International Nurses’ Day; further notes that the International Council of Nurses (ICN), which represents national nurses’ associations from 128 countries, has chosen the theme of safe staffing levels for this year’s activities; supports the ICN’s Safe Staffing Saves Lives campaign in highlighting the fact that appropriate levels of registered nursing staff lead to better patient outcomes, improvements in the patient experience and better patient safety, and believes that this complements the work of RCN Scotland and others in the nursing profession on the need for appropriate nurse staffing levels in hospitals and communities across Scotland.
