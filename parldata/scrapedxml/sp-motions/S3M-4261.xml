*S3M-4261 Trish Godman: Credit Unions Versus Loan Sharks—That the Parliament is aware of the infamous activity of loan sharks in today’s difficult economic circumstances; deplores their squalid and parasitical focusing on those without work and other citizens on low incomes; believes that measures must be taken to defeat these parasites; is convinced that an expanding credit-union movement, with the appropriate local and national support, is the most effective antidote to this obnoxious practice, especially in communities characterised by deprivation and disadvantage; praises the fine work performed in such areas by members of the credit-union movement, and calls on all of those organisations and agencies that have the wherewithal to support constructively our credit unions.
