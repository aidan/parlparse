*S2M-970# Richard Baker: Association of University Teachers' Industrial Dispute and Strike Action-That the Parliament supports the campaign by the Association of University Teachers (AUT) for better pay for academic and related staff; notes that the AUT is currently taking strike action, supported by NUS Scotland, and boycotting assessment activity from 1 March 2004 onwards; further notes that since 1980 academic salaries have increased by an average of only 20% compared with a rise in average earnings of 60% and of graduate earnings by still more; believes that fair pay in universities and colleges is essential for recruitment of well-motivated academic staff on whom we rely to create a highly skilled economy in Scotland, and believes that the Scottish Executive should act on the recommendations in the Enterprise and Culture Committee's Scottish Solutions Inquiry to ensure that investment in higher education in the future will enable staff to be better paid and address problems of recruitment and retention of academic staff.
