*S2M-3115 Donald Gorrie: Funding of Scottish Civic Forum—That the Parliament is concerned that neither the Scottish Executive nor the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body is prepared to provide funding to help keep the Scottish Civic Forum going; is conscious that the forum was a major plank in the Consultative Steering Group’s proposals for the new parliamentary arrangements in Scotland; recognises that the Scottish Civic Forum has done some good work and has also been the target of some criticism; believes that the forum or some similar body outwith the Parliament and the Executive should be an essential part of a vigorous Scottish democracy, and urges the Executive and the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body to meet the forum, MSPs and other interested parties to discuss how best to provide this democratic structure.
