*S3M-5419# David Whitton: Scotland’s Investment Management Industry—That the Parliament recognises the heritage, international standing and continuing success of Scotland’s investment management industry; is concerned by the serious risk that the industry’s capacity to serve its customers by providing a choice of investment opportunities to meet their needs will be impaired by the proposed Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive, currently before the European Parliament and the Council of Ministers, and hopes that the directive will be amended so that it is proportionate, practicable and sufficiently flexible and can support the continued provision by companies in Scotland, and in particular areas such as Strathkelvin and Bearsden, of a range of investment vehicles, including investment trusts.
