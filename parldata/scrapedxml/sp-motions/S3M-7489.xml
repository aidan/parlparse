 *S3M-7489♦ Rhona Brankin: Lothian Homeopathy Clinic—That the Parliament views with concern the proposal made by NHS Lothian to withdraw funding from the Lothian Homeopathy Clinic based at the Dalkeith Medical Centre; considers that many patients from Lothian and the Borders have benefited from the services provided there and would welcome a continuation of the service in order that patients in the east of Scotland are not required to travel to Glasgow for homeopathic treatment on the NHS.
