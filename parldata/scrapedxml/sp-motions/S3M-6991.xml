*S3M-6991♦ Ted Brocklebank: Congratulations to BBC Alba—That the Parliament congratulates the BBC Alba partnership on two years of what it considers to be its groundbreaking achievements in Gaelic broadcasting, including securing exclusive coverage of Scottish football, rugby and national cultural events; believes that BBC Alba has established itself as a cornerstone of public service broadcasting and an important source of commissioning revenue for the independent production sector, and would welcome steps for the widening of the distribution of BBC Alba by licensing its transmission on Freeview, the popular digital television platform, so as to allow full access to it for viewers throughout Scotland.
