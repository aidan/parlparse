*S3M-2285 Kenneth Gibson: Labour’s U-turn—That the Parliament notes the U-turn of Glasgow City Council’s Labour Executive which has now reversed an earlier decision and decided to maintain all free bus services for children who live between two and three miles from their school; understands that this climbdown was brought about by pressure from SNP councillors in Glasgow, school staff and affected parents and children, and believes that this demonstrates that the only way to protect frontline services at local level in Glasgow and ensure that resources remain within the Education budget is for the SNP opposition to keep the complacent Labour Executive under scrutiny and hold it to account.
