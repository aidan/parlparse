*S2M-25 Tommy Sheridan: Income Inequality Under New Labour—That the Parliament notes the latest statistics from the Office for National Statistics that reveal that income under the New Labour governments is worse than under Margaret Thatcher’s governments from 1979 to 1990; further notes that inequality has grown sharply under New Labour as a direct result of its unwillingness to tax appropriately Britain’s growing band of millionaires and high earners; is aware that the latest figures show that inequality under New Labour is, on average, one sixth higher than the equivalent average under the 11-year government of Margaret Thatcher and 10 per cent higher than under the Conservatives’ 18-year rule as a whole, and calls on Her Majesty’s Government to introduce immediately a wealth redistribution package involving higher taxes for the wealthy and millionaires, combined with a living minimum wage, significantly improved benefits and a basic state pension of £150 a week without means testing.
