 *S2M-5178 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Congratulations on the Organising for Fighting Unions Conference—That the Parliament congratulates the trade union movement on its recent Organising for Fighting Unions conference; notes that this was the biggest unofficial gathering of rank and file union activists for over 20 years; notes that for more than a generation workers have faced an onslaught on their jobs, wages, conditions and trade union rights as privatisation and deregulation have been implemented by both Conservative and New Labour governments; recognises that the early 21st century has seen a rebirth of radicalism on a global scale; agrees that now is the time for trade unionists to rebuild their organisations and recommit themselves to defend working peoples’ livelihoods and rights; notes that the Workers Charter includes the right to a job that pays a living wage and gives workers the right to time with their families and communities, the automatic right to union recognition and full employment rights from the first day of work, the right to equal pay and conditions for women and ethnic minority, young, migrant and casual workers, the right to a living minimum wage, the right to free public healthcare, welfare and education and to a liveable pension, the right to decent public housing or to private housing without crippling rents or mortgages, the right to public control of all vital public services and utilities, the right of workers to protect their own health and safety and their environment from corporate greed, the right of workers to express their personal identity free from discrimination, the right of workers to strike in defence of their interests and to campaign for the repeal of the Tory anti-union laws, including support for the defiance of those laws, the right to be able to take secondary, solidarity strike action without the threat of legal action, the right to organise for the transfer of wealth and power from the haves to the have-nots, partly through severe taxation of multinational corporations or their dismantling, and the right to unite with workers worldwide against corporate globalisation and war, and calls on the Scottish Executive to recognise and support this initiative and to ensure that it puts pressure on the UK Government to fully implement the charter.
