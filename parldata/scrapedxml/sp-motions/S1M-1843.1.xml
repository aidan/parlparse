 *S1M-1843.1 Mr Keith Harding: Scottish Local Authorities (Tendering) Billâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-1843) in the name of Angus MacKay, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "does not agree to the general principles of the Scottish Local Authorities (Tendering) Bill because it believes that the Executive should give priority to the drafting of a Bill on Best Value so that it can be placed before the Parliament before the end of this year, and therefore calls upon the Executive to make an early announcement of its proposals, together with a timetable, for the publication of a draft bill to introduce a statutory framework for Best Value."
