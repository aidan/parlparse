 * S2M-2908 Shiona Baird: Forward Not Back for the Cromarty Firth—That the Parliament totally rejects any proposal by Able UK to transfer toxic American “ghost ships” from Hartlepool to the Nigg fabrication yard on the Cromarty Firth; believes that such a move would be a retrograde step for the local area and would seriously harm the prospects of building a sustainable local economy; considers that the Highland economy would be much better served by the development of a strong and vibrant Scottish marine renewables industry creating sustainable jobs and opportunities, and welcomes and supports the bid submitted by the Cromarty Firth Port Authority for the Nigg Bay site to be developed as a multi-user facility for the production of components for the renewables industry.
