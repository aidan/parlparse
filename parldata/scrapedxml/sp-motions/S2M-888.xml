*S2M-888 Colin Fox: City of Edinburgh Council Social Work Crisis-That the Parliament believes that the City of Edinburgh Council's Social Work Department needs assistance if it is to attract staff to fill its 32% vacancy rate in social work posts and pursue a concerted recruitment campaign; further believes that the council needs to offer a greatly improved pay and conditions package and regrading commitment to prevent staff leaving the profession, and believes that the proposed reorganisation of the department would lower morale further.
