*S2M-226# Mr Duncan McNeil: Maternity Services in Argyll and Clyde NHS Board Area-That the Parliament notes with dismay the decision of the NHS Argyll and Clyde Maternity Services Steering Group to recommend that all in-patient consultant-led maternity services in the Argyll and Clyde NHS Board area be centralised at the Royal Alexandria Hospital, Paisley; further notes that this decision will force over 200,000 women over a 2,880 square mile area to travel to a single hospital for in-patient consultant-led services; expresses concern that this decision could concentrate maternity services for up to quarter of the Scottish female population in two hospitals that are seven miles apart; is disappointed that the consultation process, despite representations, was substantially curtailed; looks forward to legislative changes that would prevent situations such as this recurring, and urges NHS boards, when considering restructuring service delivery, to have regard not only to the clinicians whom they employ but also to the communities that they serve and stop the march towards the centralisation of NHS services.
