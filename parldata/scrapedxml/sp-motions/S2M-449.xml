 *S2M-449 Tommy Sheridan: Support for Liberal Democrats' Comments on Council Taxâ€”That the Parliament notes the comments of Edward Davey, Liberal Democrat local government spokesman, who stated on 29 September 2003, "John Prescott has demonstrated that once again this government is not listening to the people hit hardest by their policies. John Prescott had the opportunity to announce an end to the hated council tax, which hits the poorest hardest, especially vulnerable pensioners. Instead he has ducked the real issue and sought to shift the blame. The structure of council tax is patently unfair. The only way to deal with it is to scrap it, not cap it"; further notes the comments of Liberal Democrat Councillor Chris Clarke, Leader of Somerset County Council and Deputy Chairman of the Local Government Association, who stated on 29 September 2003, "The government must accept the fact that the council tax is unfair. The people with the lowest incomes pay more than those with the highest"; believes these comments to be an accurate description of the unfair council tax, and further believes that it should be replaced with a tax based on personal income at the earliest possible opportunity.
