 *S3M-6907♦ Murdo Fraser: Andrew Moray—That the Parliament recognises the importance of Andrew Moray in Scottish history and shaping Scotland’s destiny; acknowledges that Andrew Moray was an exceptional leader of the Scottish armies during the Scottish Wars of Independence, who led the rising in northern Scotland against the rule of King Edward I and co-commanded the Scottish armies with William Wallace to victory at the Battle of Stirling Bridge in 1297; welcomes the efforts of the Andrew de Moray Project to promote the feats of the Scottish patriot; understands that the Royal Commission of the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Scotland has no records of any statues or monuments attributed to Andrew Moray and believes that his role in Scotland’s history should be properly marked with a monument, and considers that a monument on par with the finest in Scotland should be designed and erected to commemorate one of Scotland’s most important historical heroes and that there should be a national debate about the type of monument and its location, meaning Scots in mid Scotland and Fife and beyond can take part as well as raise awareness of Andrew Moray’s role in the nation’s history.
