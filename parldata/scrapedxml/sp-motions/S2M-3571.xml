*S2M-3571 Michael Matheson: Support for Museum of Photography—That the Parliament expresses its support for the proposal by the Scottish National Photographic Centre (SNPC) to establish, within the old Royal High School on Calton Hill in Edinburgh, the Hill Adamson Museum of Photography, which will celebrate the unique and profound contribution of Scotland to the art of photography, a contribution which continues to the present day; welcomes the collaboration between the SNPC and the National Galleries of Scotland, which has resulted in an agreement to house the internationally important Scottish National Photography Collection in the care of the SNPC; congratulates the City of Edinburgh Council for its strong endorsement of the plan and Sony UK for its considerable commercial sponsorship of the SNPC to date, and expresses the hope that the outcome of present discussions between the Scottish Executive and the SNPC with regard to a positive contribution by the Executive to these plans will come to fruition at an early date, particularly as without such support the SNPC’s present application to the Heritage Lottery Fund, due to be decided in early December, will be put at risk.Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Fiona Hyslop*, Christine Grahame*
