*S2M-1397 Rosie Kane: Gulf War Syndrome-That the Parliament expresses its deep concern for Mr Alexander Izett, 34, a Scottish veteran of the first Gulf War, who has been on hunger strike since 1 May 2004 to demand an independent public inquiry into the causes and medical treatment of Gulf War Syndrome; notes that, in preparation for deployment, he received nine vaccinations in 24 hours, and that since 1993 he has suffered ill-health, including autoimmune osteoporosis which a 2003 court ruling found was caused by this "concoction of drugs"; further notes that many other veterans have suffered similar ill-health and even death, and calls on Her Majesty's Government to set up an independent public inquiry into all aspects of Gulf War Syndrome.
