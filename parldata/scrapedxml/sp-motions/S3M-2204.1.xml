 *S3M-2204.1 Bill Aitken: Youth Justice—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2204) in the name of Fergus Ewing, after "around" insert "notes with concern the failure of the previous administration to reduce persistent young offending by 10% and recognises the increasing drain on time and resources that offence referrals are having on the Scottish Children’s Reporter Administration (SCRA); recommends that an increase in disposals available to SCRA, such as an extension of drug treatment and testing orders, would enable it to intervene more effectively; recognises that the sending of 14 and 15-year-old persistent young offenders to youth courts would allow children’s panels to concentrate more on referrals for non-offence grounds."
