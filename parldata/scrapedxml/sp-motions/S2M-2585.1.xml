 *S2M-2585.1 John Swinburne: Housing—As an amendment to motion (S2M-2585) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end ", while also acknowledging the need to set aside and develop areas for housing for elderly people which will enable them to live independently in their own homes but have additional care services delivered there as required, and therefore recommends that the Scottish Executive should consider the principles of the forthcoming UK Government’s Green Paper on a New Vision for Adult Social Care to provide sheltered or extra care housing for elderly people who would otherwise have to sell their homes to fund residential care and to encourage the public and private sectors to develop a programme of housing which will meet the social needs of all groups within our communities."
