* S3M-5777 Trish Godman: The Restoration of the Comet in Port Glasgow—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of Inverclyde Council, supported by Inverclyde Community Development Trust and Ferguson Shipbuilders, to renovate the Comet, a replica of the first commercially successful steamship in Europe, at the Newark Shipyard in Port Glasgow; notes that the work will be undertaken by nine people engaged on a training project; further notes that they will carry out this project on the site where Henry Bell and his workforce built the original Comet in 1812, and believes that when the renovated replica is returned to its well-known site in Port Glasgow it will be of considerable interest during the Tall Ships event in 2011 and Inverclyde’s bicentennial celebrations the following year.
