*S2M-5779.1 Colin Fox: Scotland in the United Kingdom—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5779) in the name of Ms Margaret Curran, leave out from "is a mutually beneficial relationship" to end and insert "thwarts Scotland’s economic, social, cultural and political development; believes that Scotland would be better off if it were independent from the UK; believes that an independent Scotland would remove Trident nuclear weapons from the Clyde, scrap the hated council tax and prescription charges and redistribute the great wealth of Scotland to address widening inequalities and would never have agreed to send Scottish soldiers to fight a war in Iraq that is considered by many to be illegal; believes that Scots have the same democratic rights to self-determination as the people of any other country, and looks forward to a Scotland that is independent, socially just and internationalist in its outlook."
