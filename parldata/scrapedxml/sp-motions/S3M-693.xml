*S3M-693 Karen Whitefield: Government Rejection of New Station for Plains—That the Parliament condemns the decision of transport minister, Stewart Stevenson MSP, not to fulfil the commitment of the previous administration to enable the construction of a new train station at Plains, as part of the Airdrie to Bathgate rail link; notes that, during the previous session, the proposals received the backing of the Local Government and Transport Committee and the endorsement of the Scottish Executive; recognises that there is overwhelming support from the people of Plains for a new station to be built and that a direct link into the Airdrie-Bathgate line would make a real difference to local people, allowing them access to educational, employment, recreational and cultural opportunities that are presently out of reach, and believes that the will of the Parliament should prevail and that this decision not to proceed should be reconsidered as a matter of urgency. Supported by: Elaine Smith*, Cathy Peattie*, Mary Mulligan*, Bill Butler*, Cathie Craigie*, Patricia Ferguson*, Hugh Henry*, Des McNulty*, Elaine Murray*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Ken Macintosh*, Jackie Baillie*, Andy Kerr*
