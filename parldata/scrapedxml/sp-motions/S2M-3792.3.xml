*S2M-3792.3 Mr Mark Ruskell: Sustainable Development Strategy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3792) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end “and moreover makes it clear that leadership and consistent action from the top of government is of critical importance to enable lasting change; considers the progress so far by the Executive since 1999 to be richer in rhetoric than reality but, nevertheless, a full 13 years since the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, welcomes this first step towards a meaningful strategy; considers that sustainable development should be the top priority of government, and recognises the critical role of this Parliament and its structures in engaging fully with the strategy and holding the Executive to account on its delivery.” Supported by: Mark Ballard*
