*S3M-867 Michael Matheson: The HELIX Project—That the Parliament congratulates Falkirk Council, its partners and the "My Future’s In Falkirk" initiative on their recently successful bid for a £25 million grant for the HELIX project from the Big Lottery Fund to transform an industrial landscape between Falkirk and Grangemouth into an inspirational green space; notes that this is the first of such awards to be granted to Scotland through this programme, although hopefully not the last; further notes that the HELIX project will see over 750,000 trees planted, create five biodiversity parks, lay 34 kilometres of paths and cycle tracks, create a 1.85 kilometre canal link connecting Grangemouth on the River Forth into Scotland’s canal network and see two 30m "Kelpie" horse heads, based on Scottish mythology, that will function as a boat lift at the canal entrance, and considers that this project will transform the site and improve the area for residents and visitors alike, as well as fulfilling a "My Future’s In Falkirk" economic initiative by further putting Falkirk on the map for visitors and locals alike.
