*S2M-1243 Tommy Sheridan: Directors' Salaries and an Equitable Wage Differential-That the Parliament notes that the pay rises for Britain's 35 best-paid directors averaged 25.9% while average earnings for the economy as a whole increased by only 3.4%; notes that these directors are all paid more than £500,000 a year, with 27 of them paid over £1 million, and believes that these obscene salaries do not represent a fair reward structure within the workplace and that a maximum wage with an initial 1:10 differential between minimum and maximum earnings should be introduced urgently to close the growing and obscene wage gap within Scottish and British workplaces.
