 *S1M-3262 Stewart Stevenson: Trade Unionsâ€”That the Parliament rejects the insulting description of trade unions as "other restrictive practices that exist in our economy" by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on the BBC Radio 4 Today programme on 26 June 2002; believes that this reactionary and right-wing attitude to the trade union movement is more akin to that of Victorian mill owners than 21st century government, and celebrates the contribution of trade unions to society as a vital element in protecting and promoting the interests of working men and women.
