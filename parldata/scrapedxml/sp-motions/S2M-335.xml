 *S2M-335# Stewart Stevenson: Local Sourcing by Public Bodies-That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should take steps to ensure that public bodies such as the NHS, the Scottish Prison Service, local authorities and educational establishments source their foodstuffs as far as possible from local sources and suppliers; further considers that the Executive should put in place a programme to offer assistance to public bodies in achieving this aim, and believes that in so doing benefit will accrue to Scotland's farmers, growers, food processors and producers, and also to the Scottish economy. Supported by: Alasdair Morgan*, Alex Neil*, Christine Grahame*, Brian Adam*, Fergus Ewing*, Michael Matheson*, Mr Stewart Maxwell*, Mr Rob Gibson*, Eleanor Scott*, Mr Bruce McFee*, Mr Keith Raffan*
