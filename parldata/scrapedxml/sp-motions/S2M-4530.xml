*S2M-4530# Margaret Smith: Royal Victoria Hospital Site—That the Parliament welcomes NHS Lothian’s decision to relocate the majority of its geriatric in-patient beds to the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh, as part of its Improving Care: Investing in Change programme, where modern facilities are better placed to provide quality care for older people; seeks the best possible provision of care for the elderly services in Lothian; acknowledges the current range of measures being put in place to ease parking and congestion problems for visitors and residents in the vicinity of the Western General; believes that the current site of the Royal Victoria Hospital remains ideally located for the provision of a range of care for the elderly services, including adapted housing, clinics, a care home and day-hospital facilities for the benefit of older people in north-west Edinburgh, and believes that NHS Lothian should consult fully and effectively with Edinburgh residents and key local groups such as Queensferry Churches Care in the Community Project, Pilton Elderly Project and the Almond Mains Initiative to determine their priorities and the perceived needs of older people in the capital and how the Royal Victoria site might be used to meet these needs.
