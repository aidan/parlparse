 *S1M-3001 Fiona Hyslop: Middle East-That the Parliament condemns all acts of violence in the Middle East, whether they be acts of state violence from Israel or terrorist attacks from Palestine factions; calls for the immediate cessation of all acts of violence; supports the codification of the Saudi initiative as a UN Security Council resolution that would involve Israeli troops withdrawing to pre-1967 boundaries, acceptance of the legitimacy of the Israeli state by the Arab world and the establishment of a viable, self-governing Palestine state; recognises that the UK should freeze all military exports to Israel until it agrees to abide by UN Security Council resolutions; calls for wider economic sanctions to be imposed by the US and EU, preferably under the terms of a UN resolution, and further recognises that the Prime Minister should resolve his contradictory stance by accepting that a new UN Security Council resolution is necessary before embarking on any military action in Iraq. Supported by: Christine Grahame*, Richard Lochhead*, Michael Matheson*, Michael Russell*
