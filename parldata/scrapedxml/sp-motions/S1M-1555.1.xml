 *S1M-1555.1 Tricia Marwick: Convenership of Committeesâ€”As an amendment to motion (S1M-1555) in the name of Mr Tom McCabe, leave out from "the Convener" to end and insert "the founding principles of the Parliament as established by the Consultative Steering Group must not be undermined; that those principles have as their bedrock the fair representation of the parties in the Parliament, on parliamentary committees and in the role of Convener and Deputy Convener of those committees; and therefore instructs the Parliamentary Bureau to bring forward a proposal to allocate the Convenership and Deputy Convenership of the Justice 2 Committee according to the system that has been successfully applied since the establishment of the Parliament and which has to date commanded all party support."
