*S2M-5303.2 Richard Lochhead: Fisheries—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5303) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end "calls for a deal that provides Scotland’s fishing communities with a sustainable share of fishing opportunities and adequate time at sea to allow the industry’s quota to be caught and demands that any deal to the contrary is rejected; notes with regret that the failed Common Fisheries Policy continues to deliver remote, inflexible and draconian fisheries management that results in ongoing instability and uncertainty for our catching and fish processing sectors, and believes that, since over two-thirds of UK fish landings are in Scotland, Scotland’s fisheries minister should be designated as the official lead minister for the United Kingdom in EU negotiations."
