*S3M-637 Michael Matheson: Closure of Falkirk Tourist Office—That the Parliament notes the decision of VisitScotland and Falkirk Council to close the tourist office in the centre of the town and move it to the Falkirk Wheel; believes that this decision is wrong as visitors to Falkirk will now have to travel several miles in order to access the local tourist office; recognises that tourist numbers to the Falkirk area have grown significantly over the last few years, and believes that the existing tourist information centre should be retained with an additional information centre at the Falkirk Wheel.
