*S3M-1352# Murdo Fraser: New Energy Strategy for Scotland—That the Parliament believes that it is time for a new approach to national energy strategy giving due regard to Scotland’s landscape; notes that a new renewable energy policy should incorporate criteria which define the type of landscape within which modern wind turbines can be accommodated and new guidelines setting out where it is appropriate and not appropriate to site a wind farm; understands that such guidelines are needed to end the numerous and speculative applications being submitted and threatening scenic areas and local economies in mid-Scotland and Fife and throughout Scotland; believes that large-scale wind farm projects which face local opposition should not be approved until a new energy strategy is put in place; further understands that Scotland’s landscape is a resource of outstanding value to outdoor recreation, tourism and the wider economy, and welcomes the John Muir Trust, the Association for the Protection of Rural Scotland, the Scottish Wild Land Group, the Mountaineering Council of Scotland and the Ramblers’ Association Scotland calling for a new energy strategy.
