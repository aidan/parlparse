*S2M-3636 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Reporting Knife-Related Injuriesâ€”That the Parliament acknowledges the cross-party consensus to reduce knife crime in Scotland; recognises that knife crime remains a persistent problem in Scotland and that, according to a study by Glasgow Royal Infirmary, only 53% of knife-related assaults are ever reported to the police; agrees that it is vital that hospitals notify the police when they have knowledge of a knife-related injury, thus giving police the opportunity to investigate every knife crime that is actually committed in Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to require NHS boards to implement a system whereby all knife-related injuries are reported to the police.
