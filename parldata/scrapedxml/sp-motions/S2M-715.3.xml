*S2M-715.3 Robin Harper: Fisheries 2004-As an amendment to motion (S2M-715) in the name of Ross Finnie, insert at end "; believes that effort controls need to include limits to the total fishing capacity of the fleet, the establishment of regeneration areas, tighter controls over industrial fisheries and the widespread adoption of independent observers at sea and in ports as part of a European Union-wide recovery plan, and further believes that annual bartering is a fundamentally inappropriate approach to the sustainable management of fisheries and that multi-annual management planning is essential."
