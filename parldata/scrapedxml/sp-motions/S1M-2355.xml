*S1M-2355 Tommy Sheridan: Medical Secretaries—That the Parliament notes the all-out indefinite strike action of the 300 medical secretaries in North Glasgow; supports the campaign of these low paid women workers to receive improved pay and appropriate grading commensurate with their skills and value to the NHS, and calls on North Glasgow NHS Trust to stop ignoring the medical secretaries’ legitimate claims and start meaningful negotiation designed to meet their reasonable aspirations.
