 *S3M-1553 Karen Whitefield: Future Funding of Scottish Ballet—That the Parliament expresses great concern about the City of Edinburgh Council’s proposed £40,000 cut in revenue funding for Scottish Ballet; notes that Scottish Ballet has consistently presented world-class performance and education programmes in Edinburgh (including the Edinburgh International Festival) delivering 16 performances to 20,000 people during the past year alone, as well as a wide range of educational activities, amounting to 28 events benefiting 1,555 people; believes that the funding reductions will have serious implications for the level of activity that Scottish Ballet can provide in Edinburgh and are likely to have a significant impact on the city’s venues, such as the Edinburgh Festival Theatre, and on vital events in the city’s calendar, including the Edinburgh International Festival, and calls on the City of Edinburgh Council to reconsider this damaging proposal and to consult Scottish Ballet before future funding decisions are made.
