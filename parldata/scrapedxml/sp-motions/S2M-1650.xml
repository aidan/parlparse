*S2M-1650# Linda Fabiani: National Police Memorial—That the Parliament welcomes the unveiling on 7 September 2004 of a national memorial, sited at the Scottish Police College at Tulliallan, to all Scottish police officers who have lost their lives in the line of duty; recognises that giving one’s life in the line of duty is a sacrifice which very few people in our society ever have to face, but one that is faced by our police officers on a daily basis, and acknowledges that sacrifice and recognises the loss suffered by the families of police officers.
