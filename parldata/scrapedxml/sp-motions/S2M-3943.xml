 *S2M-3943 Carolyn Leckie: Catering Equality—That the Parliament believes that the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body’s (SPCB) current policy towards catering in the Parliament is elitist and exclusive; further believes that congestion in the canteen could be minimised if the first-floor restaurant was opened up; considers that the disproportionate subsidy of the currently named Members’ Restaurant for MSPs on already comfortable salaries, who can also claim expenses for meals when staying overnight, should cease; considers that access to the restaurant should be open at all times to everyone, and believes that the SPCB should consider also opening it to the public so that its capacity can be fully utilised.
