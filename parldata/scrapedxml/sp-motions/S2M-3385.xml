*S2M-3385 John Farquhar Munro: Condemnation of the Crown Estate Commission at Annat Bayâ€”That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Crown Estate Commission (CEC) to allow consent for a new salmon farm in Annat Bay, near Ullapool, overturning the democratic decision taken by the Highland Council after extensive consultation with the local community; believes that the interim guidance that the Scottish Executive has introduced gives carte blanche to the CEC to continue to ignore the views of the local community and the management of the local environment in order to maximise its revenue; notes that it is nearly three years since the Parliament voted for planning controls for marine fish farms to be transferred to local authorities; regrets the lack of urgency by the Executive in bringing into force the relevant section in the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003, and calls on it to end the interim measures as soon as possible and ensure that any decisions taken under interim arrangements can be reviewed by the democratically elected local authorities.
