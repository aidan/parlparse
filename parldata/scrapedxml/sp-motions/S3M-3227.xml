 *S3M-3227 Alison McInnes: Reverse Vending Recycling Project—That the Parliament congratulates Stagecoach Bluebird and Aberdeenshire Council for the roll out of Scotland’s first reverse vending recycling project; notes that, as well as providing an easy recycling point, the scheme actively encourages recycling by giving green points for each item deposited in the machine; welcomes that these green points can then be used to claim eco vouchers, giving recyclers money off their bus travel, and therefore hopes that more transport companies and local authorities will follow this example and commit to encouraging recycling while promoting the use of public transport. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
