 *S2M-2784# Carolyn Leckie: Stop Violence Against Women—That the Parliament is concerned about the recent violent deaths of women in the context of very low conviction rates for violence against women, in particular sexual violence, and extends its concern and condolences to all the friends and families of these young women so brutally taken from the world; regrets that there remain too many outstanding, unsolved cases of murder of women; believes that reporting of these crimes stigmatises the female victims by headlines such as "prostitute murdered", and further believes that all of these women are first and foremost women, daughters, mothers, sisters, partners and friends and that the focus of blame should rest on the perpetrators not the victims and that much more effort needs to be made to identify the perpetrators of these crimes and end the unacceptable level of gender-based violence in society. Supported by: Frances Curran*, Campbell Martin*, Rosie Kane*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Christine Grahame*
