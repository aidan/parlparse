*S3M-3359 Jackie Baillie: Sustaining Emergency Services at the Vale of Leven Hospital—That the Parliament notes the development of the GP-led model of emergency care at the Vale of Leven Hospital; commends local GPs for their efforts in trying to retain as many services as possible locally; further notes, however, that more people will have to travel to Paisley for services including coronary care and treatment for strokes, gastrointestinal bleeds and epileptic seizures; acknowledges that for the model to work effectively and be sustainable in the long term it requires the active support of consultant physicians from the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley; understands that concerns have been expressed by all of these physicians in their response to the publication of Vision for the Vale of Leven Hospital to the extent that they do not support the model and believe that "the vision is flawed", "it provides a two tier service for patients" and they "would not wish any of their relatives cared for under these circumstances"; consequently believes that even if NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde managed to convince these consultant physicians to support the GP-led emergency service at the Vale of Leven Hospital that, given their underlying attitude, there are very serious questions about its sustainability, and therefore calls on NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to consider retaining anaesthetics at the Vale of Leven Hospital and, failing that, to deliver a north of the river solution using the Golden Jubilee Hospital together with the Vale of Leven Hospital to provide services for an enhanced catchment area.
