*S2M-1997# Dr Elaine Murray: Recognition of the Achievements of James Clerk Maxwell—That the Parliament notes the 125th anniversary of the death of James Clerk Maxwell, one of Scotland’s greatest scientists, whose work paved the way for television and radio; considers that the Scottish Executive should give consideration to commemorating the work of this outstanding physicist, and believes that Maxwell’s achievements should be promoted in Scotland’s schools to encourage more pupils to study science at school and in further and higher education.
