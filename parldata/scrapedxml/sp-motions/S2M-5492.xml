 *S2M-5492# Mr Jamie McGrigor: Rum’s Red Deer—That the Parliament notes that the red deer is an iconic part of the image of Scotland; further notes that, because of its isolation, the red deer herd on Rum has arguably the purest bloodline in the country and has been the subject of scientific research, and considers that Scottish Natural Heritage’s plans to cull Rum’s red deer solely to protect the trees that it has decided to plant on the island without any protective fencing is to be condemned.
