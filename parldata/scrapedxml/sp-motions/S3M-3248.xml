*S3M-3248 Bob Doris: Welcoming The New Possilpark Health Centre—That the Parliament welcomes the £82 million announced by the Scottish Government for community health facilities; notes that £21.5 million of this will be spent in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area; congratulates all those involved in all successful bids, including the bid to secure £9 million of funding towards rebuilding Possilpark Health Centre, which will now be located on a purpose-built campus beside a range of other community services; also notes that this will enhance the working environment for staff and the facilities and services available to patients; believes that this can drive much-needed local regeneration within the area; welcomes the partnership working of a number of agencies to secure this funding, and pays particular tribute to Dr Mandeville, a GP at Keppochill Practice within the current Possilpark Health Centre, who has dedicated much of his career to helping the local community and campaigning for a new purpose-built health centre in Possilpark.
