*S2M-611 Tommy Sheridan: Threat to Teachers' Pensions-That the Parliament notes Her Majesty's Government's Green Paper Simplicity, Security and Choice: Working and Saving for Retirement on teachers' pensions; is opposed to the proposals which would raise the minimum age for taking an occupational pension from 60 to 65 and will have hugely detrimental effects on the future well-being of teachers and their profession; fears that such plans, if implemented, will deter young people from entering the profession with its highly stressful working environment and will force many long-serving teachers to work for five further years beyond their expected retirement date, only serving to disillusion and dishearten them, given that half the secondary teaching workforce is within 12 years of retirement; believes that these proposals will make it extremely difficult to recruit new teachers, and therefore supports the Secondary School Teachers' Association's campaign to have the proposals overturned.
