 *S3M-2858 Patricia Ferguson: People’s Postcode Lottery—That the Parliament congratulates the People’s Postcode Lottery in raising over £1 million for charities in Scotland in its first year in existence; welcomes the fact that funding is unrestricted so that its charity partners, Scottish Wildlife Trust, Children 1st and Maggie’s Cancer Care Centres, can spend the money with complete independence; notes that the money raised so far equates to funding a Maggie’s Centre for one year, supporting the Children 1st Parent Line service for 12 months and maintaining the Scottish Wildlife Trust’s network of over 120 reserves across Scotland; further welcomes the fact that all funds raised in Scotland stay in Scotland, and supports the future growth of the lottery so that other charities can benefit from this invaluable source of funding.
