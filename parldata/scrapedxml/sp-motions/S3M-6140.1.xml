 *S3M-6140.1 John Swinney: Supporting Business—As an amendment to motion (S3M-6140) in the name of Jeremy Purvis, leave out from "crippling" to end and insert "measuresthat the Scottish Government has put in place to support Scottish businesses as part of its economic recovery plan, including setting the lowest business rate poundage ever, saving businesses well over £200 million in 2010-11 alone,and putting in place a package of relief measures worth around an additional £2.4 billion over the nextfive years, including a new renewable relief scheme and extending the small business bonus scheme, which means that half of all businesses will receive a discounted bill this year and well over a quarter of businesses properties will pay no rates at all; recognises that the merits of a transitional relief scheme are outweighed by the disadvantages, and recognises that the measures that have been put in place, taken together, represent the most generous package of business rates support available in the United Kingdom."
