*S3M-5244 Karen Whitefield: Big Lottery Boost for Newmains—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement that Newmains in North Lanarkshire has been selected as one of five areas to benefit from a share of £9 million pounds of Big Lottery funding; notes that the new multi-million funding programme, Our Place, is aimed at regenerating five communities in Scotland that have not seen the expected level of lottery grants over the last three years; welcomes the emphasis in the Our Place programme of ensuring that the needs and aspirations of local people are reflected in the lottery funding that they receive, and believes that this announcement is excellent news for the people of Newmains and that it will make a real and significant difference to the local community.
