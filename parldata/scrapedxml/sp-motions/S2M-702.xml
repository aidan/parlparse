*S2M-702# Mr Brian Monteith: Closure of Holy Trinity Episcopal Primary School-That the Parliament regrets the decision of Stirling Council's ruling Labour administration to close Holy Trinity Episcopal Primary School in the top of the town area of the city; notes that the council has failed to listen to the wishes of parents, the local community and those involved in the school as recorded in its report on its own consultation exercise; believes that Stirling Council has therefore failed to make an adequate case for the closure of the school, and further believes that the Scottish Executive should use its powers over the closure of denominational schools to ask the council to find a way to keep the school open. Supported by: Murdo Fraser*, Mr Ted Brocklebank*
