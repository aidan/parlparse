*S1M-868.2 Mary Scanlon: Community Care—As an amendment to motion (S1M-868) in the name of Iain Gray, leave out from "commends" to end and insert "notes that the Scottish Executive’s approach to community care has resulted in a 40% increase in blocked beds in acute hospitals since 1997, to a total of 2,400 in the latest delayed discharge census, and that this costs the NHS in Scotland up to £96 million per year compared with the cost of nursing home places; further notes that many local authorities across Scotland have been forced to reduce services and increase costs for community care clients as a direct result of the Executive’s latest local government financial settlement; further notes that many nursing and residential homes are facing severe financial pressure, due to decisions by councils to freeze fees for social work funded places despite cost increases; calls upon the Scottish Executive to unify health and social work budgets within Community Health Trusts involving NHS community services, social work services, the voluntary sector and the private sector, and believes that NHS resources wasted on blocked beds should be transferred to Health Trusts in order to provide more community care places and to deliver seamless and more effective community care services for clients."
