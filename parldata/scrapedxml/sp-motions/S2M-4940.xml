 *S2M-4940 Rob Gibson: Congratulations to Eejits—That the Parliament congratulates Itchy Coo publications on the success of its book, Eejits, a best selling Scots translation of Roald Dahl’s children’s classic, The Twits, and on the work of its development officer, Matthew Fitt, who translated Eejits, who made over 500 school visits in the last four years to encourage pupils to recognise how much Scots language they know and use; deplores the status of the Scots tongue whereby few pupils when asked can name their own language as Scots, Doric or Lallans and not slang, and encourages the Scottish Arts Council and its successor body to continue the important funding of Itchy Coo and its work to promote Scots and, additionally, to encourage the recognition and use of Scots in public as well as private life by official bodies so that they prepare voluntarily Scots language development plans alongside the Gaelic language plans they have to prepare under the Gaelic Language (Scotland) Act 2005.
