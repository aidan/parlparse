 *S3M-3160 Sandra White: Action Needed to Secure Ceasefire—That the Parliament calls on the international community to act with the utmost urgency in efforts to secure a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas before the current humanitarian crisis in Gaza leads to the death of thousands of innocent civilians; believes that the disproportionate nature of the Israeli offensive and its collective punishment of the civilian population via the blockade are illegal under international law, warranting investigation by the International Court of Justice, and notes that, despite Israel’s attempts to justify these acts, a growing number of people are highly critical of the Israeli actions and supportive of the Palestinian situation, as evidenced by the current demonstrations and supportive events throughout the world, such as the recent fundraising dinner held by Islamic Relief Scotland, which raised £160,000 for the people of Gaza to buy medical equipment, including incubators and medical kits.
