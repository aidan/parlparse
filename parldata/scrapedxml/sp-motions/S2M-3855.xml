*S2M-3855 Frances Curran: Leven Cottage Care Homeâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the two residents from the Leven Cottage care home in the Vale of Leven who have refused to leave their home in the face of a West Dunbartonshire Council decision to close the 11-bed care home; sends its support to local people who have spent the last 55 days in permanent occupation of the home to prevent closure, and believes that, with an increasing elderly population, we need to expand care home provision rather than continue to cut beds and close homes.
