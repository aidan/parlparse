 *S3M-5815 Marlyn Glen: Fair Care for Parkinson’s—That the Parliament endorses the Parkinson’s Disease Society’s Fair Care for Parkinson’s campaign, which aims to ensure that everyone affected by Parkinson’s receives the information, care and support that they need; recognises that there are about 10,000 people with Parkinson’s in Scotland; welcomes the publication of NHS Quality Improvement Scotland’s (NHS QIS) Clinical Standards - Neurological Health Services, which outlines the support that all NHS boards should provide for people with Parkinson’s and their carers, including diagnosis and review from a doctor specialising in Parkinson’s, ongoing access to a multidisciplinary team, including a Parkinson’s specialist nurse, and measures to make sure that people get their Parkinson’s medication on time every time; further welcomes the publication of Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) Guideline no. 113, Diagnosis and pharmacological management of Parkinson’s disease, and, in particular, its recommendation that everyone with suspected Parkinson’s should be referred untreated to a doctor specialising in Parkinson’s to reduce high rates of misdiagnosis, and believes that full implementation of the NHS QIS clinical standards and SIGN guideline is essential to improve NHS care for people with Parkinson’s wherever they live in Scotland. Supported by: Rhona Brankin*, Hugh Henry*, Jackie Baillie*, Elaine Smith*, George Foulkes*, Cathy Jamieson*, Trish Godman*, Mike Pringle*, Cathie Craigie*, Karen Whitefield*, Kenneth Gibson*, Richard Baker*, James Kelly*, Mr Frank McAveety*
