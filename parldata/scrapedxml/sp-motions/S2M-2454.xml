*S2M-2454 Irene Oldfather: Stress Down Friday, 4 March 2005—That the Parliament recognises that 16% of workers now work more than 60 hours per week; is aware that 23% of men over 40 have visited their doctor because of work-related stress; agrees that employers should be aware of this and take steps to reduce stress in the workplace; welcomes Capability Scotland’s initiative, Stress Down Friday, due to take place on 4 March 2005 whereby, for a small donation, participants receive a pack full of ideas on how to de-stress at work, such as taking a proper lunch break and cutting down on caffeine, and encourages as many employers as possible to participate in the event.
