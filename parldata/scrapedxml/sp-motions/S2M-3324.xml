*S2M-3324 Jackie Baillie: Report of the Working Group on Debt Relief—That the Parliament welcomes the report of the Working Group on Debt Relief, established by the Scottish Executive; commends those involved, representing both creditor and debtor interests, for arriving at a series of positive recommendations to address the debt problems experienced by people with no income and no assets; notes the recommendation to provide a single gateway procedure for those without access to other forms of debt relief; considers that this will ensure that no person without income or assets will fall through the net, and therefore encourages the Executive to include the proposal in the forthcoming legislation to reform bankruptcy and diligence.
