*S2M-4341 Carolyn Leckie: Cuts to Compensation for Mesothelioma Sufferers—That the Parliament expresses concern that sufferers of mesothelioma and their families face massive cuts in their compensation following a ruling by the House of Lords which, at the same time as depriving vulnerable and low income families of much needed monies, will reward insurance companies with billions of pounds; believes that this decision means that workers injured by their employers will continue to be denied justice, and further believes that, if the law has been applied accurately, then the law is inadequate and that legislation should be urgently introduced to ensure full settlement for sufferers and families and that natural justice prevails.
