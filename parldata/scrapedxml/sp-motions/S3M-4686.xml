S3M-4686 Margaret Mitchell: The Well Foundationâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the establishment of the Hamilton-based charity, the Well Foundation, in January 2009; notes that the foundation aims to raise funds to provide wells and hand pumps for communities lacking safe drinking water; further notes that 1.1 billion people worldwide presently lack access to safe drinking water and that almost two million children die annually due to a lack of clean water and inadequate sanitation, and thus wishes the Well Foundation every success in its efforts over the years ahead.
