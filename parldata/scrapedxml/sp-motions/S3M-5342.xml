*S3M-5342 John Farquhar Munro: Landowners Preventing Tenant Farmers’ Right to Buy:—That the Parliament notes with concern reports that landowners and land agents are using protracted and expensive legal devices to make it very difficult for agricultural tenants to exercise their right to buy their farms; believes that in doing so landowners and land agents are subverting the will of the Parliament as expressed in the Agricultural Holdings (Scotland) Act 2003, and calls on the Scottish Government to investigate the possibility of introducing measures to stop the use of protracted devices by landowners and land agents to hamper tenants’ rights to buy their farms.
