 *S3M-3230 Jamie Hepburn: War of Terror is Mistaken and Misleading—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of an article in The Guardian on 15 January 2009 by the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, David Miliband MP, in which he argues that the notion of a war on terror is mistaken and misleading; believes, however, that the millions of people across the world who marched against the invasion of Iraq in March 2003 could have told Mr Miliband this at the time; agrees that the use of rhetoric about a war on terror has in fact helped to fuel the extremism and terrorism that it was supposed to combat, and calls on Mr Miliband to take steps to introduce the ethical foreign policy first promised by his New Labour predecessor, Robin Cook, in 1997. Supported by: Bashir Ahmad*, Mike Pringle*, Ian McKee*, Aileen Campbell*, Alasdair Allan*, Sandra White*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Stuart McMillan*, Christine Grahame*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*
