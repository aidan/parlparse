 *S3M-1794 Patrick Harvie: UN Convention on the Rights of the Child Should Protect All Children—That the Parliament welcomes the UK Government’s review of its general reservation to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC); recognises that the reservation prevents children seeking asylum and trafficked children in Scotland from realising their rights as children; acknowledges the support that members across the Parliament have given to ensuring that asylum-seeking children are treated with dignity and respect as children; notes that the United Kingdom will be assessed on its implementation of the UNCRC later this year, and calls on the Scottish Government to support the removal of the reservation.
