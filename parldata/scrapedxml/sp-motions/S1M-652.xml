*S1M-652# Mrs Margaret Smith: Firework Sales—That the Parliament believes that, given the level of injuries and distress to people and animals and the public nuisance caused by the sale of fireworks to the public, pressure should be applied to the UK government to limit such sales, that local authorities should be encouraged to control availability of fireworks through the use of local by-laws, and that it should be made an offence to pass fireworks on to a minor.
