*S2M-5386.4 Robert Brown: Education with specific reference to Skills Academies—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5386) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from "believes" to end and insert "welcomes the priority given to improving education standards by the Scottish Executive, local authorities, schools and other partners; recognises that the Executive’s investment in new and refurbished schools, increased teacher numbers, reducing class sizes, strong parental involvement and stable industrial relations is providing the right environment for real and lasting change for Scotland’s children; welcomes the new opportunities that are being developed through A Curriculum for Excellence and Determined to Succeed, including enabling young people across Scotland aged 14 to 16 to undertake vocational learning in further education colleges as part of the school-based curriculum; believes that a strong and relevant education system is fundamental to securing a smart, successful Scotland in which all our 16 to 19 year-olds are in education, employment or training, and calls for steadily improving opportunities for young people to achieve success in education including, particularly, opportunities to study a wider range of vocational options."
