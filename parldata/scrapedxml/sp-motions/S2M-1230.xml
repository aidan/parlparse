 *S2M-1230 Frances Curran: Latin American Plantation Bananas-That the Parliament notes with concern that use of pesticides, including paraquat, on plantation bananas in Latin America is more than 20 times greater than average pesticide use on crops in industrialised countries with corresponding levels of worker exposure to pesticides and illnesses; further notes the lack of compliance with international labour standards, including the right to unionise and the right to safety protection for workers, in these Latin American countries, and calls on Her Majesty's Government to put pressure on the World Trade Organisation to force countries growing plantation bananas to reduce pesticides usage and improve workers' rights as a matter of urgency.
