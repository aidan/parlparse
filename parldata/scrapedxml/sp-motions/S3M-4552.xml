 S3M-4552 Sandra White: Israel Detains UK Citizens—That the Parliament condemns in the strongest possible terms the illegal boarding and detention of the passengers of the Spirit of Humanity, including, among others, UK citizens, former US Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney and Mairead Maguire, Irish Nobel Peace Laureate, in international waters on route to Gaza; believes that Israel’s continuing flagrant breach of international law and existing UN resolutions must be addressed in order to demonstrate that no one is above the law, and calls on Prime Minister Gordon Brown to condemn the illegal detention of UK citizens, be it by Iran or Israel, and for the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama, to redouble his efforts to secure meaningful change to Israel’s current position.
