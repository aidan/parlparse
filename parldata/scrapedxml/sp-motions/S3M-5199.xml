*S3M-5199 Sarah Boyack: Launch of a New Alcohol Charter in Edinburghâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the volunteers and staff at Voice of Carers Across Lothian (VOCAL) and the Edinburgh Alcohol and Drug Partnership on the launch of the new alcohol charter in Edinburgh, which outlines the services that carers should expect when supporting someone with an alcohol addiction; notes that the alcohol charter recognises that carers looking after those with an alcohol dependency have a right to expect their views to be valued, to receive appropriate support, to inform practitioners of the ongoing situation and to inform the development of policy and services, and pays tribute to the important work carried out by carers supporting family members and friends with an alcohol dependency.
