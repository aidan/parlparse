 *S2M-4328 Carolyn Leckie: Solidarity with PCS Department of Work and Pensions Strikers—That the Parliament expresses its support for members of the PCS who are taking strike action over two days to prevent compulsory redundancies, end attacks on workers’ rights and defend public services by getting the staffing levels that match public needs; regrets that senior management refused to make any reasonable or meaningful offer on jobs, services and rights but instead want to forge ahead with the wholesale destruction of jobs, with 15,000 jobs already gone and another 15,000 to go by 2008, and then another 5% cut to the Department of Work and Pensions’ budget in 2008-9, as announced by Gordon Brown; expresses alarm that cuts have already led to vulnerable people not getting access to the benefits they need, with one million calls unanswered last year and claimants experiencing two-month delays in obtaining benefits which they so desperately need, and believes that the employers and the UK Government should immediately come to the negotiating table prepared to put the needs of people first and prepared to reach an agreement acceptable to PCS members.
