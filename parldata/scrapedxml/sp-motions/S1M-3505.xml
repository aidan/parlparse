*S1M-3505 Richard Lochhead: UNISON Campaign on Needlestick Injuries-That the Parliament warmly endorses the aims of the UNISON campaign to reduce needlestick injuries in hospitals which, at their worst, can transmit fatal viruses including Hepatitis B and C which result in liver diseases as well as HIV, and calls on the Scottish Executive to introduce "safer needles" throughout the NHS in Scotland in order to protect NHS staff from unnecessary risk.
