*S2M-4012 Frances Curran: Care Home Residents Evicted—That the Parliament condemns the actions of West Dunbartonshire Council who intend to close Leven Cottage elderly care home with two remaining residents still inside; notes that the residents have been informed by the council’s Social Work Department that from Monday 27 February 2006 the building will be closed, care staff will be withdrawn and replaced with a 24-hour security guard, the top floor will be boarded up, all kitchen appliances, with the exception of a kettle and microwave, will be disconnected and there will be no heating when the current oil supply runs out; is appalled that a local authority could behave in such a way and defends the right of Robert and Annie to remain in Leven Cottage which has been their home for decades, and further believes that the council is completely reneging on its duty of care to Annie and Robert by attempting to bully them into leaving their home.
