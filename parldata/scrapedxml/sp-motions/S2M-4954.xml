*S2M-4954 Colin Fox: Upgrading Edinburgh Sports Pavilions—That the Parliament welcomes the campaigning initiative of Hutchison Vale FC young footballers for increased funding for Edinburgh sports pavilions; notes that the City of Edinburgh Council has earmarked £4 million to replace three crumbling pavilions; recognises that more major investment is required to ensure that this is no longer seen as a "Cinderella service", and believes that, at a time when it is vitally important that young people are encouraged to take up competitive sport, it is unacceptable that changing facilities are squalid and not fit for purpose.
