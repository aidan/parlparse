*S2M-5548 Margaret Mitchell: Cork It—That the Parliament congratulates the Falkirk Herald on the launch of Cork It!, a campaign aimed at addressing the problems caused by underage drinking; acknowledges that the issues surrounding underage drinking are diverse and pervasive; recognises the misery that underage drinking can inflict on communities; welcomes the support of Central Scotland Police and NHS Forth Valley for this campaign; considers that everyone has a role to play in discouraging the binge-drinking culture that resulted in the death of Neil Forrester, aged 15 from Larbert, who was killed by a hit-and-run driver when he staggered into the middle of the road after consuming alcohol purchased for him by a 22-year-old adult, and encourages communities both in central Scotland and throughout Scotland to actively support similar campaigns seeking to tackle and eliminate underage drinking.
