 S2M-2688 Cathy Peattie: Equalities Review—That the Parliament welcomes the Department of Trade and Industry and Cabinet Office’s decision to set up an equalities review to examine the long-term and underlying causes of inequality that need to be addressed by public policy; expresses disappointment that there is no Scottish representative on the review team, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take measures to ensure that the work of the review and the recommendations it makes fully encompass Scotland.
