 *S3M-4371 Malcolm Chisholm: Cuts at Telford Collegeâ€”That the Parliament is deeply concerned by the plans of the management of Telford College to axe 64 posts at a time when there are increased applications for places; is astonished that the majority of the teaching posts targeted are in business, IT and tourism, which are so central to the Edinburgh economy and provide local training for local jobs; supports a thorough review of the management arrangements at the college, including the massive pay increase recently awarded to senior managers, and calls upon the management and board of Telford College to look urgently at other options for savings that rule out any threat of compulsory redundancies.
