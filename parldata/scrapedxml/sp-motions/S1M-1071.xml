*S1M-1071 Mr Keith Harding: Holding Local Authority Elections in 2002—That the Parliament calls upon the Scottish Executive to ensure that the next local authority elections proceed as planned in 2002, separate from the Scottish Parliament elections in 2003 and in line with the recommendations of the McIntosh Commission and the Kerley Committee; believes that this would help to ensure that local issues are properly aired and debated and would clarify the alternatives open to electors for a level of government that is responsible for a wide range of services and for spending hundreds of millions of pounds of public money, and further believes that such debate would be almost impossible to achieve if a combined Holyrood and council poll was held.
