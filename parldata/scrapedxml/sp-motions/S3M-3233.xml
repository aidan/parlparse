 *S3M-3233 Hugh Henry: University of the West of Scotland Nursery Provision—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by the University of the West of Scotland (UWS) to close its on-site nursery at Paisley; notes that out of 10 other Scottish universities surveyed only two do not currently provide on-site nursery places; regrets that up to 30 jobs are threatened across the Paisley and Hamilton campuses; notes that student parents fear being unable to complete their courses; calls on UWS to appreciate that substitute financial assistance may not necessarily be an answer, given that many external nurseries have constraints that do not align with the university’s course timetables, and, in consequence, urges the UWS to review the closure proposal, re-examine the existing costs and fee structure and explore other means of generating income before any decision is taken.
