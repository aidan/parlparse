 *S3M-1665 Robin Harper: Congratulations to Chris Hoy, the Real McHoy!—That the Parliament congratulates Chris Hoy on his truly inspirational World Championship performance and notes that his two gold medals for individual sprint and keirin events, added to silver in the team sprint event, take his tally of Olympic and World Championship medals to an incredible total of  20, not including his notable collection of World Cup and Commonwealth Games successes; acknowledges the diverse range of his prodigious talent; recognises the valuable role of his inspirational career in encouraging active and sporting lifestyles; acknowledges the important role that the velodrome at Meadowbank Stadium played in his development as a track cyclist; notes that without the provision of a track cycling facility in the city many would lose the opportunity of involvement in one of Scotland’s most successful sports, and agrees that Scotland and Edinburgh, his native city, should  honour his achievements by providing and enhancing track cycling facilities in the capital.
