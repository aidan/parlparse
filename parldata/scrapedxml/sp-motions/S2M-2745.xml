 * S2M-2745 Margaret Jamieson:Careers Scotland Disputeâ€”That the Parliament condemns Scottish Enterprise for its attitude to resolving the dispute with employees in Careers Scotland by insisting that mediation be provided by the private sector rather than by the public service, ACAS, therefore incurring additional costs which could be better used to deliver core services, and calls on the Scottish Executive to intervene immediately for the benefit of the people of Scotland.
