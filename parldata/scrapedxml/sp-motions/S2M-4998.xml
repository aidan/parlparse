*S2M-4998 Brian Adam: Donation Box for the Homeless Initiative in Aberdeen—That the Parliament commends the initiative in Aberdeen to install donation boxes for the homeless in the city centre and, in particular, commends the work of Aberdeen Cyrenians in the city; encourages citizens to favour this form of donation above giving money directly to homeless people, and regrets that Aberdeen City Council has yet to submit evidence to the Scottish Executive in support of a bye-law prohibiting street-begging.
