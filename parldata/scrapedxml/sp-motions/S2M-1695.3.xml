*S2M-1695.3 Shiona Baird: Growing Scotland’s Economy - Building on Progress—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1695) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, leave out from first "welcomes" to end and insert "acknowledges that Scotland’s economy, society and environment are interlinked and cannot be treated in isolation; notes that prioritising economic growth, above all else, contradicts the Scottish Executive’s stated commitment to human and environmental welfare, and that GDP growth alone is not a measure of improvement in people’s quality of life and environmental sustainability; notes the revelation in the recent report to the Environment and Rural Development Committee by CAG Consultants, Is The Scottish Executive Structured and Positioned to Deliver Sustainable Development? that the most significant weakness emerged in relation to the perceived need for economic growth and the failure to acknowledge the negative environmental impacts of growth policies, and calls on the Executive to place quality of life as its number one priority, supported by the development of a sustainable economy that does not undermine social and environmental justice."
