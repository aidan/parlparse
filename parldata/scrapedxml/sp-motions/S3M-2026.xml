*S3M-2026 Robert Brown: World No Tobacco Day 2008â€”That the Parliament welcomes the tobacco-free youth theme of World No Tobacco Day 2008 on Saturday 31 May; notes that smoking is the highest in Scotland in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area; congratulates South West Glasgow Community Health and Care Partnership for organising a nursery-based event for parents in Govan and a school-based event for parents in Pollok to raise awareness of the smoking-related health risks and the support services available in the area; notes that six months ago the legal age for buying cigarettes was raised to 18 but that most young people who smoke start before the age of 18, and calls on the Scottish Government to take action to raise awareness among teenagers and young adults of the dangers of smoking.
