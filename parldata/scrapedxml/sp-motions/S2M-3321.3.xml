*S2M-3321.3 Tommy Sheridan: Economic Policy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3321) in the name of Mark Ballard, leave out from “if Scotland is to enjoy” to end and insert “the key aims of Executive policy should be to increase social justice via the redistribution of wealth created through economic growth and to ensure that growth does not compromise future environmental sustainability, and urges the Executive to replace GDP with an economic measuring tool for growth that includes targets for increased social justice and environmental sustainability.”
