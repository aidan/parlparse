 *S1M-2606.1 David Mundell: Scotland's Railways-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2606) in the name of Mr Kenny MacAskill, leave out from "that the Executive's" to end and insert "with regret the acquiescence of the Scottish Executive in Her Majesty's Government's woeful handling of our railways which has led to the uncertainty and chaos that now exists throughout the UK rail industry and, in particular, the undermining of the confidence that is needed to secure the necessary private investment in our railways in order to meet the needs of the travelling public and business users, and calls upon the Executive to set out its strategic objectives for the rail network and services in Scotland, how and when these are to be achieved and how they will be funded."
