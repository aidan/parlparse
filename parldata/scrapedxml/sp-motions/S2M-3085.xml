 * S2M-3085 Mark Ballard: Protests, Policing and Public Safety—That the Parliament notes the eyewitness reports of the protest in Edinburgh on 4 July 2005; is concerned that groups of local youths drinking alcohol were allowed to walk into the areas where there were disturbances and that innocent bystanders were also able to wander unknowingly into the protests and were then contained by police officers and not allowed to move away from the unrest; is further concerned that there was a lack of clear communication by the police, resulting in confusion and panic among protesters and the public; recognises the difficult situation faced by police officers on the ground; questions, however, the Justice Minister’s description of police tactics as prioritising the maintenance of public safety and public order, and appeals for calm from both police and protesters ahead of the organised peaceful march planned near Gleneagles Hotel on 6 July.
