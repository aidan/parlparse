*S2M-1898.2 Bill Aitken: Improving the Quality and Availability of Scotland’s Housing—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1898) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, leave out from "endorses" to end and insert "recognises that housing stock transfer to community-based housing associations, a policy introduced by the Conservatives, gives tenants greater rights, responsibilities and input into the way their housing is run; believes that, to improve the standard of public housing for everyone, it is necessary to step up the process of devolving control of housing from local authorities to local community groups; further believes that, to improve the standard and supply of private housing for rent or purchase, a review and modernisation of the Scottish planning system is required to simplify and speed up the development process, and notes with concern the restraint on new housing construction currently imposed in Scotland by the inadequacies of Scottish Water’s sewerage network."
