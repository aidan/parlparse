*S3M-3965 Robin Harper: Re-establishment of Access to Play in Planning Policies—That the Parliament congratulates the Alliance for Childhood on the occasion of its first conference held at the Scottish Parliament on 23 April 2009; notes the terms of Article 31 of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child; expresses its concern that, although Scottish Planning Policy 11 established the principle that access to play should be embedded in planning policies, this principle has been extracted from the new planning policy document, and calls on the Scottish Government to re-establish this principle and reaffirm its commitment to incorporating the terms of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child in full in all appropriate public policy areas.
