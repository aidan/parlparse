*S2M-2724 Christine Grahame: The Cost of Doing Nothing—That the Parliament notes the answer to question S2W-15285 by Andy Kerr on 13 April 2005 that information on the cost of obesity to the NHS "is not held centrally"; refers the Minister to the excellent study by Dr Andrew Walker of June 2003, The Cost of Doing Nothing - the economics of obesity in Scotland; notes that, at the time of this report, the cost to the NHS of obesity and its consequences was estimated at the time by Dr Walker to be some £171 million; further notes that obesity is implicated as a predisposing factor in at least 13 diseases, including various cancers, stroke and type 2 diabetes and that 98% of that £171 million is consumed by obesity comorbidities, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to include action on diabetes in its public health strategies and to ensure that obesity is one of the new priorities for the Scottish Diabetes Framework. Supported by: Mr Bruce McFee*, Rob Gibson*
