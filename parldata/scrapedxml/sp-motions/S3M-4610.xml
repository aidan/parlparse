 *S3M-4610 Rhoda Grant: Hand Hygiene Complianceâ€”That the Parliament notes the second bi-monthly Health Protection Scotland Compliance with Hand Hygiene - Audit Report; recognises the 93% compliance rate across the NHS in Scotland; congratulates NHS staff for their consistently high performance in this area; however notes with concern the performance of doctors who, at 86% compliance, are significantly below other staff groups, and believes that the Scottish Government should consider further targeted measures to ensure that medics improve their performance in this area.
