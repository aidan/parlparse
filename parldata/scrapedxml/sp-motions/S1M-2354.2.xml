 *S1M-2354.2 Mr Brian Monteith: National Cultural Strategy - One Year On-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2354) in the name of Allan Wilson, leave out from "notes" to end and insert "but regrets that the Strategy has failed to evoke any substantial response from the people of Scotland who are the ultimate and only source of Scottish culture; notes that the most recent achievements of Scottish culture such as the dramas "Gagarin Way" and "Wiping My Mother's Arse" owed nothing whatsoever to the Cultural Strategy, and expresses confidence that Scots culture will continue to flourish without the intervention of the state as it has since 1707."
