*S3M-3828 Michael McMahon: 10th Anniversary of Alex Salmond’s Unpardonable Folly—That the Parliament notes that 29 March 2009 marks the 10th anniversary of the election broadcast in which Alex Salmond condemned NATO’s air strikes against Yugoslavia as an unpardonable folly; considers that Alex Salmond’s remarks followed a decade of wars provoked by Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic; recognises that NATO, in its first military action since being created in 1949, was attempting to compel Slobodan Milosevic to end his oppression of the Kosovar Albanians and to agree to a solution that would restore their autonomy and work towards full independence; also notes that Alex Salmond compared the NATO raids on Yugoslav military targets with those of the Luftwaffe’s wartime London blitz and the bombings of Clydebank; believes that Slobodan Milosevic was relying on voices like Alex Salmond’s to undermine international political unity opposed to the genocide in Kosovo, and further considers that the SNP continues to ignore Kosovo when it is looking for independence movements to compare itself to and that this shows that the SNP is never genuinely interested in the rights and wrongs of a foreign conflict but in its own narrow nationalist electoral agenda.
