*S2M-1626# Brian Adam: Proposed National Front March in Aberdeen—That the Parliament expresses great sympathy for the councillors in Aberdeen who have to determine the application for a National Front march in Aberdeen; notes the advice given by the council’s legal department that councillors voting for a ban on the march may expose themselves to disqualification of up to five years, a draconian punishment; further notes the considerable potential for public disorder as evidenced by similar events elsewhere, and believes that the Scottish Executive should take all steps, including legislation, to ensure that local councillors representing local opinion can make decisions on local issues without fear of oppressive punishment.
