*S1M-383 Susan Deacon: Health—That the Parliament is wholeheartedly committed to the NHS in Scotland and applauds the contribution and commitment of NHS staff across Scotland; welcomes the abolition of the internal market; recognises the record levels of investment in the NHS enabling the biggest ever hospital building programme; believes that the development of a modern NHS depends on a sustained programme of service redesign, greater public accountability and involvement and true partnership working across the NHS in Scotland, and pledges to work with the Executive, NHS and the Scottish people to address constructively and imaginatively the challenges of building a 21st century NHS.
