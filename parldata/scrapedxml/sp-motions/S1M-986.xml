*S1M-986# Tommy Sheridan: Coffee Shops-That the Parliament supports the Westminster motion sponsored by Paul Flynn MP that cannabis coffee shops should be set up along the Dutch model; recognises that doing so would help break the connection between cannabis use and more dangerous and addictive drugs like heroin; further notes that such a measure would effectively take the cannabis market out of housing estates and residential areas and into licensed premises which could be properly regulated; further recognises that such a move would greatly reduce the overall harm caused by the illegal market in cannabis, and believes that the Scottish Executive should put Scotland at the forefront of such an experiment.
