*S3M-5249 Bob Doris: Be a Hero and Help our Heroes, Shoebox Appeal—That the Parliament applauds Glasgow-based High Access Rescue Team ahead of the launch of its Shoebox Appeal in association with the charity Help for Heroes, which will collect boxes filled with much-needed practical items to send to the troops serving in Afghanistan over the Christmas period, and calls on MSPs and all who work in the Scottish Parliament to lead the appeal with enthusiasm and to send an early Christmas message from Holyrood to the men and women who so bravely serve in the forces overseas that they are foremost in the nation’s minds and are not forgotten over the festive period.
