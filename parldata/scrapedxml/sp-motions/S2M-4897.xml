*S2M-4897 Tommy Sheridan: Scots Denied Breast Cancer Test—That the Parliament notes with great concern that a life-saving breast-screening programme which costs just £20 per patient is being denied to patients in Scotland; notes that, despite being given approval by the Breast and Cervical Screening National Advisory Group who say that the extra test is "cost-effective and clinically effective", NHS Scotland has refused to provide the test; also notes that the test, which is a mammogram taken from two angles instead of one, is available to women in England and Wales, and considers that the Scottish Executive should take immediate steps to introduce this test, which would be especially welcome as October is National Breast Cancer Awareness month, thereby ensuring that all patients are screened to ensure that any abnormality of the breast has a better chance of being detected.
