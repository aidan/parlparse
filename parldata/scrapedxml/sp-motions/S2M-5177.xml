*S2M-5177 Dr Elaine Murray: Loss of 120 Jobs at Young’s Seafood, Annan—That the Parliament expresses grave concern over the loss of 120 jobs at Young’s Seafood in Annan, caused by the company’s decision to cease machine peeling of langoustines at its Annan plant; recognises that this will be a grave blow to the individuals concerned, their families and the local economy; urges the Scottish Executive and Scottish Enterprise to commit to offering whatever assistance they can to support the workers concerned; expresses profound concern that food processing companies such as Young’s Seafood are shipping Scottish caught nephrops 12,000 miles for six weeks there and back to take advantage of low wages in the Far East, and considers that government should do all it can to encourage companies to take social and environmental considerations into account as well as commercial pressures.
