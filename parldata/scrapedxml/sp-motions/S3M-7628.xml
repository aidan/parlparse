*S3M-7628 Cathy Peattie: Snow Party—That the Parliament applauds the residents of Canal Walk, Brightons, Falkirk who, following heavy snow, organised a "snow party", which was attended by 30 people armed with spades, shovels and home baking who spent an hour clearing the street of snow; believes that this and similar instances of locally organised action to keep streets and pavements clear of snow and ice are great examples of Scotland’s communities at their best, organising themselves to tackle adversity for the benefit of the community as a whole, and believes that such initiatives should be supported and encouraged by local authorities and the Scottish Government.
