 *S2M-2820 Mark Ballard: Inveresk Laboratories—That the Parliament notes the report by Animal Defenders International condemning animal suffering at Inveresk laboratories; believes that no experimental procedure should be used that causes animals unnecessary suffering; further believes that no animal should ever choke to death on paint, as is alleged to have happened at Inveresk; urges all organisations involved in animal testing to make stringent efforts to use existing alternative non-animal techniques; calls for increased commitment and funding for the development of new alternatives to the use of animals in testing and research; calls for an inquiry by the Home Office Inspectorate of Her Majesty’s Government to ascertain whether the suffering at Inveresk was sanctioned by the Home Office and whether there was any breach of the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and for the findings to be made public, and, in light of the Home Office failure to prevent suffering, further calls for independent checks on laboratories in Scotland.
