*S1M-1771.2 Fergus Ewing: Rural Scotland—As an amendment to motion (S1M-1771) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "the Scottish Executive’s" to end and insert "welcomes the united approach taken by the Executive and opposition parties in recognising the need to eradicate the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease; believes that the rural economy is facing unprecedented difficulties; urges the Executive to launch a public information campaign in relation to the disease with clearer and more precise guidelines governing access to the countryside, and believes that the extent of the financial difficulties now being suffered is so grave that a comprehensive package of measures must be introduced to assist all aspects of economic life in our rural communities."
