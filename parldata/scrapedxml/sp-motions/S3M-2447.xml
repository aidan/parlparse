*S3M-2447 Bill Wilson: Breaking Israel’s Blockade of Gaza—That the Parliament, further to motion S3M-2411 in the name of Bashir Ahmad, congratulates the passengers and crew of SS Free Gaza and SS Liberty on breaking the Israeli blockade of Gaza; notes that their effort has had the immediate benefit of enabling Palestinian fishermen to enter fishing waters barred to them by Israel and therefore to land the best catch that they have had in four years; urges Israel to lift its blockade of Gaza entirely and immediately, and believes that such a step, as well as alleviating the terrible suffering of the inhabitants of Gaza, would be in the long-term best interests of both Israelis and Palestinians. Supported by: Elaine Smith*, Bill Kidd*, Rob Gibson*, Bashir Ahmad*
