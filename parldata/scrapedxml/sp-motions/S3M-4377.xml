*S3M-4377 Pauline McNeill: MOBO’s Boost for Glasgow—That the Parliament welcomes the projection that the prestigious Music of Black Origin (MOBO) urban music awards ceremony will deliver a boost of around £3.6 million to the Glasgow economy; notes that this figure takes into account the success of the MTV Europe Music Awards in Edinburgh in 2003; further notes that this is the first time that this major awards ceremony, which will be held at the SECC on 30 September 2009, has been staged outside London in its 13-year history, and recognises Glasgow’s renowned status as a UNESCO City of Music.
