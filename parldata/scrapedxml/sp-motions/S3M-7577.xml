*S3M-7577♦ Elaine Murray: Theatre Royal Dumfries—That the Parliament regrets the decision by the Corporate Policy Committee of Dumfries and Galloway Council not to award £315,000 of the £455,000 that it has allocated for theatre provision to the Theatre Royal in Dumfries; considers that this would have safeguarded the property for the next 10 years; notes that the Theatre Royal is Scotland’s oldest working theatre, originally built in 1792, and that Robert Burns attended the theatre when living in Dumfries and Galloway, and believes that this decision is to the detriment of cultural provision in the town.
