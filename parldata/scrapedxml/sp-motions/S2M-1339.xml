 *S2M-1339 Colin Fox: Firefighters' Dispute-That the Parliament regrets the breakdown of the national June 2003 agreement reached by fire service employers and the Fire Brigades Union, which brought the 2002-03 national dispute to an end; hopes that both parties remain within the parameters of the June 2003 agreement in order for the agreement to be progressed and completed; hopes that the fire service employers recognise the efforts of firefighters and emergency fire control operators in the modernisation process and consequently pay firefighters and emergency fire control operators their promised pay increases, and hopes that, by the Fire Brigades Union's reconvened annual conference in Southport in June, agreement can be reached between the fire service employers and the Fire Brigades Union that allows this long-running dispute to be drawn to a satisfactory conclusion, sees the process of true improvements in the fire service continuing and ensures that firefighters and emergency fire control operators are rewarded to a level that fully recognises the many skills they have acquired.
