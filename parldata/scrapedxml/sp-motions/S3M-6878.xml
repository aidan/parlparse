*S3M-6878 Sandra White: International Day of the Disappeared—That the Parliament notes the International Day of the Disappeared on Monday 30 August 2010, which is a United Nations-recognised annual commemoration day for individuals who have gone missing during armed conflicts or other situations of violence and whose fate is unresolved; recognises that hundreds of thousands of families across the world are still unaware of the fate of their loved ones who are missing; supports the work of the Red Cross in putting missing people back in touch with loved ones and commends the work of the Red Cross International Tracing and Message Service based at the organisation’s Refugee Unit in Glasgow, and further notes that over the past year this service has seen over 500 people, worked on 120 new tracing cases and has had 30 successful cases, which led to the reconnection of over 80 people and the exchange of 90 Red Cross messages between separated families.
