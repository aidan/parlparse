 *S3M-7549 Liam McArthur: Highlands and Islands Success in SURF Awards—That the Parliament notes that three of the four winners chosen by the Scottish Urban Regeneration forum (SURF), Scotland’s independent regeneration network, for its 2010 awards come from the Highlands and Islands as does one of the four highly commended entries; congratulates Orkney’s Eday Partnership, which has developed services and infrastructure on its island, for winning the Partnership category; further congratulates Rag Tag n’ Textile, the Balmacara based project that supports people with mental health issues by producing what it considers to be high-quality products, for winning the People category; also congratulates Uig community shop from Lewis, which it considers provides vital services and a community focus, for winning the Place award and the Northmavine Community Development Company from Shetland, which saved the Hillswick shop from closure and was highly commended in the People category, and believes that this Highlands and Islands success in the face of what it understands to have been keen competition from 85 entries shows the strength of the community spirit that can be found across the Highlands and Islands, sustaining communities which would otherwise struggle to survive.
