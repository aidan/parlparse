*S1M-3494# Rhoda Grant: Alain Baxter-That the Parliament deplores the failure of the Court of Arbitration for Sport to award Alain Baxter the bronze medal which he won during the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City; notes that the court described Alain Baxter, in its verdict, as "a sincere and honest man" and that he did not intend to gain a competitive advantage, and considers that the bronze medal should be returned to Mr Baxter immediately and that the British Olympic Association should withdraw its ban on him from competing in the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.
