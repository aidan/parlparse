*S3M-1226 Aileen Campbell: Chair of Scottish Youth Parliament on Big Brother TV Show—That the Parliament notes with interest the appearance of John Loughton, Chair of the Scottish Youth Parliament and co-vice convener of the Cross Party Group for Children and Young People, in the Big Brother reality television show; notes the opportunity that such ventures provide to engage with large numbers of those who traditionally do not participate in established political structures; believes that such new methods of engagement are useful for evolving parliamentary democracy and ensuring that it remains relevant to the people, and further believes that Scotland’s Youth Parliament provides excellent role models for today’s young Scots and that John deserves the support of all Big Brother viewers in Scotland.
