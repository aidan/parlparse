*S3M-4109♦ Willie Coffey: Scotch Whisky Exports Exceed £3 Billion—That the Parliament welcomes the news that in 2008 Scotch whisky exports exceeded £3 billion for the first time, an increase of 8% from 2007; recognises the significant export performance of Kilmarnock-based Johnnie Walker, the world’s leading Scotch whisky, with production of over 145 million litres in 2008; highlights the importance of Scotch whisky in the life of Kilmarnock and Scotland, including as an important employer, a major source of exports and a significant source of government revenues; recognises the significant steps that have been taken to improve the industry’s carbon footprint through heat-recovery systems, reducing the amount of energy used per litre and investing in lightweight glass technology; acknowledges the need for an effective regulatory and fiscal regime for all alcohol products to tackle excess consumption; welcomes wide-ranging contributions to this debate, including those from the Scotch Whisky Association, trade unions and advisory agencies, and considers that the removal of incentives for marketing strong beers and ciders and fortified wines would be beneficial and expresses strong support for ending the unfair treatment of Scotch whisky.
