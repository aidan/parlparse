*S2M-1855# John Scott: Implications for Scotland of Pensions Commission Reportâ€”That the Parliament notes the report Pensions: Challenges and Choices which has been published by the Pensions Commission on the subject of the pension funding shortfall; expresses concern that the effect of this underfunding will be more severely felt in Scotland; regrets the implications for the health and quality of life of pensioners and the additional costs likely to be incurred by the health service and local authorities in Scotland, and considers that the UK Parliament should take note of these concerns.
