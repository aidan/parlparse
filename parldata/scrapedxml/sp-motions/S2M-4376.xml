*S2M-4376 Pauline McNeill: The Coach House Trust—That the Parliament notes the achievement of the 25% recycling target for Scotland and believes that the achievement of this target and the ambition of reaching 30% by 2008 can be achieved only through the empowerment and co-operation of commercial, public, and voluntary organisations; applauds the efforts of the Coach House Trust, which operates a vital scheme in the west end of Glasgow, particularly given the poor overall roll-out of recycling in Glasgow; expresses concern about recent changes in the funding arrangements managed by INCREASE which have resulted in a reduction of the grant available to the Coach House Trust recycling project, thereby threatening the continued viability of the project; regrets that the provision of specialist assistance for smaller, non-commercial schemes through the Community Recycling Network Scotland and the Strategic Waste Fund has become increasingly difficult to access and unreliable for match-funders, and calls on the Scottish Executive to do more to assist the smaller providers directly and so better contribute to a genuine community response to the recycling targets. Supported by: Tommy Sheridan*, Robin Harper*, Mr Charlie Gordon*, Sarah Boyack*, Jackie Baillie*, Mr Jamie Stone*, Frances Curran*
