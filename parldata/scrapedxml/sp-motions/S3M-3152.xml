 *S3M-3152 Liam McArthur: Public Analyst Laboratories—That the Parliament notes the importance of public analysts in the wider framework of food quality checks; recognises the crucial role played by public analysts in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland in enforcing the recall of all Irish-produced pork products after they identified that animal feed contaminated with harmful toxins had infected pig products; notes with concern that 11 public analyst laboratories across the United Kingdom have closed in the last 13 years; is alarmed that there are currently only 24 public analyst laboratories left, of which four are in Scotland; is further concerned that the fate of Aberdeen city’s Public Analyst Laboratory hangs in the balance, with the distinct possibility that it will be closed and the services contracted out to Tayside Scientific Services in Dundee; is deeply concerned that the wider public health role of public analysts is in danger despite the increasing demand by consumers for better quality food, and calls on the Scottish Government to conduct a review of arrangements for the funding of public analysts to ensure that food quality and safety are not compromised by the pressure on local government budgets.
