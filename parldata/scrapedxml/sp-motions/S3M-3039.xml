*S3M-3039 Willie Coffey: Call for Review of UK Employment Law—That the Parliament notes with concern recent actions by Euro Car Parts, which sacked over 600 staff just a week after acquiring long-established firm LSUK Ltd, better known as Lucas, including its depots at Kilmarnock, Edinburgh and elsewhere in Scotland, by the posting of notices on depot doors; expresses its sympathies for the workers and their families, and calls on the UK Government to undertake an urgent examination of UK employment law, with a view to bringing forward to the UK Parliament any changes necessary to create an employment framework fit for the 21st century, to prevent Scottish workers facing such Dickensian employment practices and to reinforce the responsibility of company directors to ensure proper consultation with and treatment of a company’s workforce.
