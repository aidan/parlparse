 *S2M-60# Shiona Baird: Future of the Scottish Agricultural College—That the Parliament questions the decision of the Scottish Agricultural College to consolidate its main education and research facilities at King’s Buildings and the Bush Estate and notes that the decision is based on an appraisal carried out by Deloitte and Touche, which failed to appreciate the organic research facility available at Craibstone, including the knowledge gained over the last decade by the establishment of a working organic farm and which failed to recognise the vital strategic importance of this facility in addressing the needs of the future of organic farming in Scotland. Supported by: Mr Mark Ruskell*, Patrick Harvie*, Mark Ballard*
