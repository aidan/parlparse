*S3M-3749 Brian Adam: Scrap the 2p per Litre Fuel Tax Rise—That the Parliament notes the Chancellor of the Exchequer’s planned rise in fuel duty of 2p from 1 April 2009; further notes the comments of the Automobile Association president, Edmund King, that drivers face the threat of severe financial hardship from the credit crunch; believes that any rise in fuel duty during this economic recession will have an adverse effect on Scottish businesses, the road haulage industry and hard-pressed families; finds it perverse that billions have been spent by the UK Exchequer bailing out other businesses while it intends to increase business costs with a rise in fuel duty, and calls on the UK Government to scrap the rise in fuel duty.
