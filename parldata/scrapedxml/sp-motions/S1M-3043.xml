*S1M-3043 Fiona Hyslop: European Parliamentary Report on Multi-Annual Guidance Programme for Fishing Fleets-That the Parliament congratulates the SNP members of the European Parliament and their European Free Alliance Colleagues on their successful amendment in the European Parliament on 25 April 2002 to the parliamentary report on multi-annual guidance programme for fishing fleets which instructs the President of the European Parliament "to forward its resolution to the governments and parliaments in the Member States", ensuring that the Scottish Parliament will be informed directly of this report; notes that this sets a precedent for this Parliament to be informed of further important deliberations in the European Parliament as of right; further notes that the proposal was opposed by the Scottish Labour MEP Catherine Stihler at the fisheries committee meeting in March 2002, and welcomes the volte-face of Scottish Labour MEPs in the plenary session.
