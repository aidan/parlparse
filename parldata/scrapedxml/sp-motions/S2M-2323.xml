 * S2M-2323 Mike Rumbles:JDWetherspoon Pubs to be Smoke-Free—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by JD Wetherspoon to ban smoking in all of its pubs; notes the comments of Chairman, Tim Martin, firstly that a “significant number of people are staying away from pubs and restaurants because they are too smoky” and secondly that the UK Government’s approach does not make sense since pubs can get around it by giving up food sales; welcomes the fact that smoking will be banned in its Aberdeen and Glasgow pubs from May 2005; commends this decision taken on straightforward business grounds, and welcomes the intention of the Scottish Executive to introduce a ban on smoking in enclosed public places from March 2006.
