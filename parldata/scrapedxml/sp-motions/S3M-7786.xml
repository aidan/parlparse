*S3M-7786 Robin Harper: Unemployment Services in Edinburgh—That the Parliament notes with concern the news that the Scottish Government is planning to cut almost half of its budget for employment programmes in Edinburgh; notes that this would be in addition to the cuts already experienced by the City of Edinburgh Council; recognises that this funding, which historically has come to the Edinburgh Partnership, is used to support the Joined Up For Jobs strategy and to fund specialist programmes designed to fit the needs of local communities and priority groups; believes that the removal of these local services would impact greatly on those living in the most disadvantaged areas of the city and severely reduce the opportunities for unemployed young people and those who have experience of homelessness or addictions; recognises that, on 20 January 2011, members debated the need to provide opportunities for young people through establishing a microcredit scheme, and considers that such a scheme would greatly complement the retention of Edinburgh’s existing unemployment services.
