 *S2M-524 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Continuation of Grant for Headway Scotland-That the Parliament appreciates the valuable work done by Headway Scotland in the field of support for both brain injury victims and their families and carers; recognises the importance of the continuation of the existing grant under section 10 of the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968 to Headway Scotland in allowing them to continue and improve the crucial role already being filled by them, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to give assurances that these services are allowed to continue, unhindered by fears over the ceasing of existing funding, by guaranteeing the continuation of this community care grant.
