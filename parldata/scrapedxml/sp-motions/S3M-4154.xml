*S3M-4154 Anne McLaughlin: Driving Down Crime in the South Side of Glasgow—That the Parliament welcomes the recent recorded decline in crime in the south side of Glasgow; applauds Strathclyde Police for its good work, which has resulted in crimes of violence being at a five-year low; notes that crimes of violence are down 15% in Govan and Craigton, 24% in Greater Pollok and 24% in Pollokshields compared with the five-year average; further notes that housebreaking in Pollokshields is down 52%; applauds the Scottish Government and the Cabinet Secretary for Justice for their commitment to tackling violent crime and gang culture; recognises the role of the increase in police numbers in allowing the local community policing teams to get up to full strength, and wishes Strathclyde Police’s Glasgow South and East Renfrewshire Division continued success in working towards a safer Scotland.
