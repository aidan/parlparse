*S3M-5574 Bill Wilson: Renfrewshire’s Budget Priorities—That the Parliament congratulates SNP-led Renfrewshire Council in being the first local authority in Scotland to set its budget this year, with the emphasis on helping young and older people in Renfrewshire; recognises the £2.5 million additional funding for foster care, as well as the extra £312,000 being targeted towards older people to enable them to move out of hospital; notes the £250,000,000 investment programme in community, education and leisure facilities, and commends Renfrewshire Council in freezing council tax for a third successive year, all set against a backdrop of Labour cuts from Westminster.
