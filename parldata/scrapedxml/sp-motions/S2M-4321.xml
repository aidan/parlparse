*S2M-4321 Shona Robison: World Asthma Day—That the Parliament recognises that 2 May 2006 is World Asthma Day; understands that there are 390,000 sufferers of this illness in Scotland; recognises that these sufferers are not automatically entitled to free prescriptions despite having a chronic illness; calls on the Scottish Executive to immediately abolish prescription charges for those with chronic health conditions and cancer and thereafter to phase out charges for everyone else in Scotland, and notes that this charging goes against the founding principles of the NHS and is ultimately a tax on ill-health.
