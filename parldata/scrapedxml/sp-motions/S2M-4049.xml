*S2M-4049 Jackie Baillie: Removal of Tolls from the Erskine Bridge—That the Parliament welcomes the historic announcement by the Minister for Transport and Telecommunications that tolls will be removed from the Erskine Bridge as of 31 March 2006; congratulates all those involved in the campaign to scrap the tolls, in particular local councils, chambers of commerce and local people; considers that this decision is right for the environment, easing congestion on the Kingston Bridge and the Clyde Tunnel, and right for the local economy, with communities on both sides of the Clyde benefiting from this action, and encourages the Scottish Executive to lock in the environmental gains and consider how to maximise the economic impact of the removal of tolls as a first step in regenerating the entirety of the Clyde corridor, including Dumbarton and the Vale of Leven.
