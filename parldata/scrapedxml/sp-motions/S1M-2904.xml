*S1M-2904# Tommy Sheridan: Improving Glasgow's Council Homes Without a Penny of Borrowing Required-That the Parliament notes the comments of the Minister for Social Justice in relation to the wholesale stock transfer ballot in Glasgow reported in the Evening Times on 13 March 2002; notes specifically his statement that "Glasgow's tenants must not miss this historic opportunity to vote for warm, dry houses, rejuvenated neighbourhoods and a real say in how their homes should be managed and improved. It would take close to twenty years to match the level of improvements that the GHA plans to undertake in ten years"; further notes that, in a letter of 12 March 2002, the Director of Housing Services at Glasgow City Council stated that, if the housing debt burden were removed from the council, it could invest £129.2 million per year in modernising and improving Glasgow's council homes without a penny of borrowing required; believes that it is a duty of Ministers to present available information in a fair and honest fashion; accepts that, if Glasgow City Council were relieved of its £900 million capital debt burden, it would be able to invest £129.2 million per annum, i.e. £1.3 billion over ten years without any new borrowing or additional grant aid from the Scottish Executive, and considers that the Parliamentary Bureau should timetable a debate on the Glasgow stock transfer issue in order to allow all the information available to be discussed openly and frankly.
