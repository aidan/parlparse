*S2M-5591 Trish Godman: Scottish NHS Treatment and Care of Former Servicemen and Women—That the Parliament is of the view that the very best NHS treatment must be given to the young Scottish men and women who have been discharged from the British armed services as a result of the physical and mental wounds that they have suffered in Iraq, Afghanistan and elsewhere; notes that the absence of military hospitals anywhere in the United Kingdom places additional burdens on these courageous young ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen and also those involved in their treatment, care and rehabilitation; is confident that the NHS personnel are more than equal to this challenge; wishes to remind the nation that our servicemen and servicewomen are rightly acknowledged as among the finest of the United Nations’ peacekeepers, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive, working in tandem with the Ministry of Defence, to ensure that sufficient means are given to those concerned with the NHS treatment and care of these young military veterans so that they can return to their communities as soon as possible and in the knowledge that the NHS has shown to them the compassionate care they so eminently deserve.
