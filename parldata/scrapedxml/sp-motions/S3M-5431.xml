*S3M-5431 Irene Oldfather: The 2010 European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusionâ€”That the Parliament notes that the European Union has declared that 2010 is the European Year for Combating Poverty and Social Exclusion; recognises that almost 80 million European citizens live at risk of poverty; welcomes a commitment by the European Union to raise public awareness about these issues and to renew the political commitment of member states to combat poverty and social exclusion, and therefore encourages the Scottish Government to work alongside the UK Government to make 2010 a year when stereotypes and collective perceptions of poverty are challenged and ensure that everyone can play a full and active role in society.
