*S2M-4083 Tommy Sheridan: Support Aberdeen Strikers—That the Parliament expresses solidarity with those school cleaning and catering workers employed by Aberdeen City Council who are compelled to strike for two days in pursuit of equal and fair pay; believes that the Scottish Executive must accept the responsibility to ensure that equal pay is implemented across Scotland, particularly in the public sector, and considers that the thousands of low-paid women workers who have been underpaid over the last seven years deserve full compensation for their loss of earnings.
