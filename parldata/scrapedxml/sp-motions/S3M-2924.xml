 *S3M-2924 Liam McArthur: Froglife—That the Parliament congratulates the Froglife charity on its Scottish launch, which took place at Edinburgh Zoo on Friday 14 November 2008; recognises the importance of the charity’s achievements in England, where it has a strong record of conserving habitats for amphibians, reptiles and a wide range of other species; further congratulates the charity on its excellent record of achieving its conservation aims through a process of engaging and working with a diverse section of the population, including harder-to-reach groups such as young offenders and people with learning difficulties; wishes the charity every success in its continued work, and looks forward to seeing the benefits that this work can bring to Scotland.
