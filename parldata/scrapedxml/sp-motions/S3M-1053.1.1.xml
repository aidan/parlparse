*S3M-1053.1.1 Patrick Harvie: EU Reform Treaty—As an amendment to amendment (S3M-1053.1) in the name of Malcolm Chisholm, insert at end "notes the Labour Party’s manifesto commitment to hold a referendum on the proposed constitutional treaty; further notes written comments made by German Chancellor, Angela Merkel, to her fellow EU heads of government that the new EU Reform Treaty is effectively using "different terminology without changing the legal substance" of the European constitution, and therefore considers that the strong similarities between the two treaties require that the commitment to a referendum should be fulfilled."
