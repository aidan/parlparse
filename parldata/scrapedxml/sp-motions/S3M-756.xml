 *S3M-756 Sandra White: Saudi Arabian Visit—That the Parliament expresses its regret over the UK Government’s feting of King Abdullah and the Saudi Arabian regime which discriminates against women, allegedly tortures prisoners, conducts public executions, amputates limbs as a punishment and bans freedom of expression, assembly and religion; believes that putting business issues above human rights, in light of the UK Government’s halting of the Serious Fraud Office’s inquiry into the Al Yamamah arms deal with BAE Systems and last month’s agreement to sell the regime 72 Eurofighter Typhoon fighter planes from the United Kingdom at a cost of £4.43 billion, sends out the dangerous message to the world that the UK Government will support and legitimise vicious dictatorships and blatantly disregard human rights violations if the money is right; notes that, in the time that King Abdullah has been red carpeted here in Britain, five public beheadings have taken place in Saudi Arabia, bringing the total for the first six months of this year to over 100 executions, and takes this opportunity to state that the values embodied by the UK Government’s decision to overlook human rights violations in order to promote business in no way represent the views of the Scottish Parliament or the will of the people of Scotland. Supported by: Michael Matheson*, Mike Pringle*, Bill Kidd*, Bashir Ahmad*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Kenneth Gibson*, Dave Thompson*, Hugh O’Donnell*
