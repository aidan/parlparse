 *S3M-3481 Patricia Ferguson: Save the Chinese Healthy Living Centre—That the Parliament notes the important work done by healthy living centres throughout Scotland and, in particular, the work of Glasgow’s Chinese Healthy Living Centre, which for five years has provided a valuable service to the Chinese community in Glasgow; acknowledges that the project has raised awareness of health issues within the community and has raised the confidence of the community through its work; considers that the project has provided a very valuable service to the Chinese community and to wider society in the city; regrets that the management board has had to announce the closure of the project with effect from 1 April 2009, and urges the Scottish Government to provide the resources to enable the project to continue its invaluable work across Glasgow.
