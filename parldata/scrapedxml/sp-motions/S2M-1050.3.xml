 *S2M-1050.3 Mr Brian Monteith: Abolition of Council Tax-As an amendment to motion (S2M-1050) in the name of Fergus Ewing, leave out from "the council tax" to end and insert "local taxation cannot be viewed in isolation and must be seen as part of the overall taxation system, particularly as locally variable taxes only raise 18% of council revenues with the rest coming from charges, business rates and central government grants and further believes that the independent review of local government finance must take account of what range of responsibilities is best administered locally and ensure a broadly-based system of national and local taxation with a combination of income, consumption, capital and property taxes as the best way of delivering a fair and balanced system."
