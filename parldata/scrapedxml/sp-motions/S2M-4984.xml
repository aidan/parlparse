*S2M-4984 Frances Curran: Giveme5—That the Parliament supports the "giveme5" campaign, launched by The Richmond Fellowship and FOCUS to increase the permitted earnings disregard for people on means-tested benefits; notes that the permitted earnings disregard has not been increased for five years and supports the call for the Westminster Government to increase it by £5 per week to £25, and further notes that the permitted earnings disregard enables people to increase their skills and confidence in the knowledge that their benefits will not be affected and can be a stepping stone to future employment.
