*S2M-4398 Dr Elaine Murray: Congratulations to Tennent’s Scottish Cup Finalists—That the Parliament congratulates Heart of Midlothian FC on winning the Tennent’s Scottish Cup Final 2006; also congratulates Gretna FC on being magnificent runners-up and believes that the Scottish Second Division Champion’s performance in the cup final will give added credibility to its work in the community, promoting sport and encouraging young people to be physically active and to resist drugs, and further congratulates both teams and their supporters on a marvellous day for Scottish football.
