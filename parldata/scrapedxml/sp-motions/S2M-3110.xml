 *S2M-3110 Robin Harper: North American Indians, Klamath River and ScottishPowerâ€”That the Parliament welcomes to Scotland a delegation of representatives from North American Indian tribal nations and US fishing and environmental organisations; recognises their quest to obtain justice from the Scottish-based multinational, ScottishPower; backs their campaign to oblige ScottishPower to establish the highest environmental standards in its operation in North America; regards the historic damage to the environment of the Klamath River caused by previous owners of the dams as having had an unacceptable and serious impact on the social, cultural and economic situation of the native peoples; notes the "personal commitment to find the right solution" from ScottishPower Chief Executive, Ian Russell, last year, and urges ScottishPower to do what it can to back that commitment ahead of the anticipated sale of its US subsidiary PacifiCorp and to secure a commitment from the buyer that any and all improvement commenced will be completed.
