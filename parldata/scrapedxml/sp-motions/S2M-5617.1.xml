 *S2M-5617.1 Bill Aitken: Affordable Housing—As an amendment to motion (S2M-5617) in the name of Rhona Brankin, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "recognises that the private and public rental and purchase sectors are under considerable pressure and are not able to keep up with the high demand for affordable housing, especially in rural areas; is alarmed that last year first-time buyer activity reached its lowest level in 25 years; regrets that the Lib-Lab pact has failed to enable Scottish tenants to take advantage of housing stock transfer and, over the last year, has overseen four "no" votes in Edinburgh, Stirling, Renfrewshire and the Highlands and welcomes the Scottish Conservatives’ support for housing stock transfer and the continuation of tenants’ right to buy their local authority homes; is opposed to the proposal for the single seller survey as it "will cause difficulties for disadvantaged buyers and sellers, who may be on low incomes and/or be buying or selling low-value properties in areas of low demand", as highlighted by the Scottish Consumer Council, and considers that the single seller survey is based on an inadequate pilot and is an unnecessary and costly intervention in a sensitive market."
