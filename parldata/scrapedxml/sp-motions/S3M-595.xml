 *S3M-595 Jack McConnell: Motherwell Train Station—That the Parliament recognises Motherwell train station as an important transport interchange for residents in Motherwell and Wishaw and in other communities in central Scotland; welcomes the initiative by Strathclyde Partnership for Transport (SPT) and North Lanarkshire Council to improve the station and nearby road system; recognises the unique position that Motherwell holds on the Scottish rail network as the only access point in the central belt to First Scotrail and east and west coast mainline services outside Glasgow and Edinburgh city centres; further notes the close proximity of Motherwell to three of Scotland’s main motorways, the M8, the M74 and the M73; welcomes the support of private stakeholders keen to see Motherwell station’s further development as a hub, and urges the Scottish Executive to work constructively with North Lanarkshire Council and SPT to bring these proposals to fruition.
