 *S2M-560.2 Ross Finnie: Future of Scottish Agriculture-As an amendment to motion (S2M-560) in the name of Mr Mark Ruskell, leave out from "calls" to end and insert "notes that in accordance with A Partnership for a Better Scotland the Scottish Executive will apply the precautionary principle in relation to the planting of GM crops; notes that no decision has been taken on the possible commercialisation of GM crops; recognises that it would be premature to do so before the results of the farm scale trials and the GM dialogue have been fully evaluated, and notes the Executive's continuing commitment to protecting human health, animal health and the environment."
