*S3M-5812 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Congratulations to Edinburgh Central Mosque—That the Parliament welcomes the shortlisting of the Edinburgh Central Mosque’s kitchen in the 2010 Scottish Restaurant Awards Best Indian Restaurant category; considers that, while ultimately missing out on the award, this shortlisting represents a marvellous achievement for a charitable venture selling high quality cuisine for £4 per plate; recalls that the kitchen was launched to make the mosque more accessible and to counter negative feelings towards the Muslim community after the 9/11 attacks; congratulates the 50 volunteers who run the kitchen on this tremendous success and wishes them well for the future, and also congratulates the staff of Mother India’s Café, Edinburgh, for winning the Best Indian Restaurant award.
