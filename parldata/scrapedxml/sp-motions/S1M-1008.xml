*S1M-1008 Phil Gallie: Crime and Punishment—That the Parliament notes that public confidence in the criminal justice system is at an all time low due to the Scottish Executive’s failure to take effective steps to curb rising crime; recognises the frustration and anxiety felt by the victims of crime and the wider Scottish public arising from early prisoner release and asks the Scottish Executive to restore honesty in sentencing by ending automatic remission; further notes with concern the proposals to raise the age of criminal responsibility from 8 to 12 and to bring 16 and 17 year old offenders within the Children’s Hearings System; calls upon the Executive to reject the proposals, and demands that the Executive brings forward its proposals to strengthen the law in relation to the seizure and confiscation of assets suspected of being derived from drug dealing.
