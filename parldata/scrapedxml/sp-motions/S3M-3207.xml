*S3M-3207 Jamie Hepburn: US President-elect’s Pledge to Close Guantánamo Bay—That the Parliament welcomes reports that US President-elect Barack Obama intends to issue an order for the closure of the detention centre at Guantánamo Bay during his first week in office; notes that closure of the centre was a key promise in Mr Obama’s election platform and is widely supported by governments, human rights organisations and members of the public around the world; looks forward to the day when the centre is finally closed, and believes that this will be a sign of a new era in the United States of America’s international relations and an important step towards the re-establishment of respect for fundamental human rights around the world. Supported by: Bob Doris*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Alasdair Allan*, Alex Neil*, Sandra White*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Bashir Ahmad*, Mike Pringle*, Christine Grahame*, Bill Kidd*, Trish Godman*, Robert Brown*, Stuart McMillan*
