 S3M-3207 Jamie Hepburn: US President-elect’s Pledge to Close Guantánamo Bay—That the Parliament welcomes reports that US President-elect Barack Obama intends to issue an order for the closure of the detention centre at Guantánamo Bay during his first week in office; notes that closure of the centre was a key promise in Mr Obama’s election platform and is widely supported by governments, human rights organisations and members of the public around the world; looks forward to the day when the centre is finally closed, and believes that this will be a sign of a new era in the United States of America’s international relations and an important step towards the re-establishment of respect for fundamental human rights around the world. Supported by: Bob Doris, Hugh O’Donnell, Alasdair Allan, Alex Neil, Sandra White, Shirley-Anne Somerville, Bashir Ahmad, Mike Pringle, Christine Grahame, Bill Kidd, Trish Godman, Robert Brown, Stuart McMillan, Robin Harper, Patrick Harvie, Joe FitzPatrick, Bill Butler, Brian Adam, Gil Paterson, Hugh Henry, Roseanna Cunningham
