 *S3M-4795 Shirley-Anne Somerville: Scotland’s Commitment to Cut Greenhouse Gas Emissions—That the Parliament welcomes Scotland’s commitment to cut greenhouse gas emissions by at least 42% by 2020 in the Climate Change (Scotland) Act 2009; notes that the most recent scientific evidence shows that this is the minimum needed to prevent dangerous climate change; believes that Scotland has set a world-leading example for other developed countries to subscribe to ahead of the international climate negotiations in Copenhagen later this year; urges the UK Government to push for equally ambitious domestic emissions reduction targets across Europe, while simultaneously committing mitigation and adaptation funds to developing countries to compensate for the developed world’s past emissions, and calls on all MSPs to support the upcoming climate change march, The Wave, in Glasgow on 5 December 2009, organised by Stop Climate Chaos Scotland.
