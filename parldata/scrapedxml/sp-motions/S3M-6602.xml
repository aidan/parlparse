 * S3M-6602 Willie Coffey: Another Hat Trick for Kilmarnock and Loudoun Footballers—That the Parliament congratulates Hurlford Thistle on winning the Lindsay Fencing (Irvine) Ayrshire Amateur Premier League; notes that Hurlford won 15 of its 16 matches, scoring 63 goals and conceding only 15, and further notes that with Galston United finishing as runners-up and Knockentiber in third place, this made it yet another hat trick of team successes for amateur football in Kilmarnock and Loudoun.
