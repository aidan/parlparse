*S3M-4211♦ Bill Kidd: Shine on Scotland—That the Parliament commends Ryan McLaughlin, a 14-year-old young man from Glasgow, on his Shine on Scotland campaign and accompanying e-petition, which seeks to raise public awareness about the benefits of vitamin D in relation to multiple sclerosis (MS), seeks clarification on Scottish Government advice on the recommended daily allowance of vitamin D for children, adults and pregnant women and plans to ensure that these levels are delivered to each of these groups; notes that Ryan developed this campaign after his mother, a former Scottish taekwondo champion, developed MS in her thirties, and welcomes Ryan when he comes to the Parliament, leading 500 children on a march, to lodge his petition on 16 June 2009.
