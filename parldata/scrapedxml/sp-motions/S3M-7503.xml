*S3M-7503 Patrick Harvie: Shawlands Town Centre—That the Parliament notes the longstanding efforts of Shawlands and Strathbungo Community Council as well as residents, businesses and community groups on Glasgow’s south side to push for the improvement of Shawlands town centre; recognises the work of the Shawlands Town Centre Steering Group, which published the results of a consultation exercise in April 2010 and which is working toward an action plan for the area; notes that the priorities identified in the consultation included the regeneration of Shawlands Arcade and better use of public space, including more greenery and facilities for a market; looks forward to the publication of the action plan and a commitment from Glasgow City Council to addressing these and other priorities; values the character of Shawlands and the diversity of local independent businesses, and hopes to see the great potential for improvement turned into a reality.
