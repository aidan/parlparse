*S1M-454 Mr Brian Monteith: Duty on Cigars—That the Parliament notes the threat posed to the future of Scotland’s specialist tobacco retailers by the declining sales of large cigars, which have fallen 64% over the past decade and are still declining; acknowledges that UK duty on cigars is the highest in Europe, and calls upon Her Majesty's Government to give consideration to replacing the present weight related duty on cigars by duty on a specific per unit basis, which would simplify the calculation and collection of tax duty, and could increase revenue overall as a result of the potential reduction in personal imports and illegal trafficking.
