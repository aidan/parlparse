 *S3M-4165 Liam McArthur: Scottish Renewables Festival 2009—That the Parliament looks forward to the Scottish Renewables Festival, which will run on the weekend of 13-14 June 2009 at venues across the whole of Scotland, giving the public a chance to learn more about renewable energy; notes that the festival will allow people to see wind farms, hydropower plants, marine energy demonstrations and biomass heat and power plants, as well as household and community installations of solar panels, wind turbines, heat pumps and wood fuel; believes that, with the continuing harnessing of Scotland’s rich and diverse renewable energy resources being of vital importance to our environment and economy, it is important that people get to see for themselves what renewable energy is all about, and congratulates Scottish Renewables and all other bodies involved in setting up and running this welcome new addition to Scotland’s festivals.
