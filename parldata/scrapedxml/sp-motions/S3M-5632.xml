*S3M-5632 Robert Brown: Save the Children Report Measuring Severe Child Poverty in the UK—That the Parliament welcomes the publication by Save the Children of its report, Measuring Severe Child Poverty in the UK; notes with concern that the report found that 95,000 children across Scotland continue to live in severe poverty, equating to 9% of all Scottish children; considers that progress in eradicating child poverty in Scotland has stalled as the number of children living in severe poverty remained constant at between 8% and 9% from 2004-05 to 2007-08; urges the Scottish Government and the UK Government to deliver more focused action to achieve the overdue eradication of child poverty in Scotland by 2020; agrees that concerted policy action must be undertaken to (a) remove barriers to parental employment, (b) ensure that the poorest do not pay the price for the economic crisis, (c) make the tax and benefit system work for the poorest families, (d) support families to reduce their expenditure and (e) break the link between poverty and educational achievement; recognises the importance of the proposals put forth by the Liberal Democrats to address poverty, notably measures to realign the tax system to ensure fairness to those at the lower end of the income spectrum by setting the annual tax threshold at £10,000, thereby cutting the average tax bill by £700 and taking four million people out of the income tax net altogether, and to introduce a mansion tax on homes valued at over £2 million, and believes that all children are born equal and none should be left behind.
