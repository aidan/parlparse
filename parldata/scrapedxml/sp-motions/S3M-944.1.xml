*S3M-944.1 Tavish Scott: Road Hauliers and a Fuel Price Regulator—As an amendment to motion (S3M-944) in the name of Brian Adam, insert at end "and to ensure that the fuel price regulator mechanism allows for regional variations in tax rates set so that it can be used to remove regional variation in the price paid for fuel at the pumps in order that motorists in the islands and remote rural areas, who need their cars as public transport alternatives are limited, no longer pay around 10 pence per litre more for fuel than motorists in Scotland’s cities, where motorists have many public transport alternatives."
