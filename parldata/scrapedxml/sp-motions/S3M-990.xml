*S3M-990 Irene Oldfather: North Ayrshire Carers Centre—That the Parliament welcomes members of the Three Towns Support Group to the Parliament on 6 December 2007; commends the hard work and dedication of staff at North Ayrshire Carers Centre in Irvine to maintain high standards of support and advice for carers; recognises that 7 December is Carers Rights Day 2007; notes that an estimated one in five people give up employment in order to care; is aware that a proportion of these people may have been able to continue working if given the correct information about what help was in place; welcomes the introduction of national legislation in 2007 that gives carers the right to request flexible working hours from their employers; acknowledges that many people providing care continue to be unaware of the range of support that is available to them, including meals on wheels, telecare and carers’ allowance; congratulates Carers Scotland for its campaign to inform carers about what services are in place through a variety of methods, including CarersLine, the national advice helpline for carers, and however recognises that more needs to be done to ensure that carers are fully aware of their rights and are given the opportunity to continue working if they so wish.
