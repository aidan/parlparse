*S1M-1914 Mr David Davidson: Tourismâ€”That the Parliament notes the failure of the Scottish Executive to complete the restructuring of the Scottish Tourist Board/visitscotland which has undermined efforts to regenerate Scottish tourism following two years of decline; calls upon the Scottish Executive to implement a survival and recovery plan for Scottish businesses affected by the foot-and-mouth disease outbreak which includes a hardship fund to provide interest-free loans to supplement the limited measures announced to date, and further calls upon the Scottish Executive to expedite the opening up of the countryside via the risk assessment procedure.
