*S2M-4225 Mark Ballard: Real Nappy Week Tenth Anniversary 24 to 30 April 2006—That the Parliament welcomes and sends a message of encouragement on its tenth anniversary to Real Nappy Week which runs from 24 to 30 April 2006; notes that three billion nappies per year, or eight million nappies per day, are thrown away in the United Kingdom with 90% ending up in landfill sites; further notes that 90% of local authorities have already signed up to Real Nappy Week and that parents could save £500 on the cost of nappies for one baby if they used washable rather than disposable nappies, and commends the Scottish Waste Awareness Group and the Waste and Resources Action Programme for their work in jointly delivering the Real Nappy Campaign. Supported by: Shiona Baird*, Patrick Harvie*, Mr Mark Ruskell*, Dr Jean Turner*, Eleanor Scott*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*
