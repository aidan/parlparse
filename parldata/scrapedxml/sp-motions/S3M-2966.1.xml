 *S3M-2966.1 John Scott: Sea Fisheries—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2966) in the name of Richard Lochhead, insert at end "; notes with concern the European Commission’s proposals for west coast stocks that, if implemented, could especially damage the viability of the west coast langoustine sector, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to work towards a settlement that successfully balances the need to conserve depleted west coast whitefish stocks with a thriving langoustine fishery."
