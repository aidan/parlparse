*S3M-4929♦ Christine Grahame: Call for UN Public Inquiry into the Conviction of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi—That the Parliament notes and endorses the letter sent by a number of prominent individuals, such as Archbishop Desmond Tutu, Ian Hislop, Professor Robert Black QC and Professor Noam Chomsky, calling on the General Assembly of the United Nations (UN) to establish a full public inquiry, under the provisions of Article 22 of its charter, into the investigation of the destruction of Pan Am flight 103 over Lockerbie on 21 December 1988, the Fatal Accident Inquiry into the event conducted in 1991, the subsequent trial of Abdelbaset Ali Mohmed Al Megrahi and Lamin Khalifa Fhimah at Camp van Zeist, both of Mr Al Megrahi’s appeals and the circumstances surrounding the dropping of his second appeal; notes that the signatories have urged any UN public inquiry to have the powers to call witnesses who have been both directly and indirectly involved to give testimony and account for their actions, decisions and opinions relating to the events that resulted in PA103 being bombed, and would welcome the cooperation of all relevant Scottish agencies and bodies with such an inquiry once it has been established. Supported by: Christopher Harvie*, Bill Wilson*, Patrick Harvie*, Stuart McMillan*, Jamie Hepburn*
