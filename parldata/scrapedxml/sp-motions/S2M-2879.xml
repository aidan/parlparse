 * S2M-2879 Fiona Hyslop:Welsh Decision on Tuition Fees—That the Parliament congratulates Plaid Cymru – the Party of Wales, the Welsh Liberal Democrats and the Welsh Conservatives on seeking to ensure that there will be no top-up fees in Welsh universities; notes that the resolution of the Welsh Assembly, “that the Assembly 1. believes that education is a right and not a privilege and condemns the Labour Government in Westminster for introducing measures which will drastically increase the amount of debt a graduate leaves higher education with; 2. instructs the Welsh Assembly Government not to introduce top-up fees for Welsh domiciled students and to ensure parity of funding with higher education institutions in England ; 3. calls on the Welsh Assembly Government to ensure that higher education institutions are funded to a level equitable to comparable institutions in England, and to bring forward a funding framework for higher education institutions in Wales for the next 10 years by June 2005; 4. condemns the New Labour Government in the National Assembly for failing to instruct Professor Teresa Rees to consider a no-fees solution for Wales; 5. believes that the level of student debt acts as a deterrent to entering higher education for many young people; and 6. calls on the Welsh Assembly Government to present funding options for the National Assembly to consider” sends out a most appropriate message to Welsh students about the value of higher education, and calls on all of Scotland’s politicians to make a similar commitment to the future of higher education here.
