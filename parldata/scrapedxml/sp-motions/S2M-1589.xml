*S2M-1589 Carolyn Leckie: Agenda For Change-That the Parliament believes that Agenda for Change will not address pay inequalities in the NHS and that through it far too many NHS workers will lose out in pay and other terms and conditions; notes that increases for medical staff will be proportionately far greater than any gains by other groups of NHS staff, which perpetuates the historical undervaluation of non-medical NHS staff; is particularly concerned about the implications for ancillary, administration and clerical, speech and language therapy and other staff; believes that unsocial hours will be inadequately rewarded; is further concerned that Agenda for Change does not fulfil either the Scottish Executive's, employers' or trade unions' obligations to ensure equal pay for women; believes that such flaws will lead to increased recruitment and retention problems in the NHS, placing further constraints on NHS capacity and the delivery of care; believes, therefore, that the Executive and employers are obliged to ensure that such a seriously flawed scheme is not implemented in the NHS, and considers that the Executive should withdraw the current proposals and reopen negotiations to achieve fair and equal pay and terms and conditions across the NHS without detriment to anyone.
