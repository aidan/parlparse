*S2M-3826.1 Mr John Swinney: International Strategy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3826) in the name of Mr Tom McCabe, leave out from “acknowledges” to end and insert “but regrets that on major issues of international policy, such as the war in Iraq or CIA rendition flights, the Executive is unable effectively to represent the views of the people of Scotland, and recognises that this will be possible only when Scotland plays a constructive role as an independent member of the international community.”
