*S2M-3870.1 Frances Curran: Future Energy Policyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-3870) in the name of Alex Johnstone, leave out from "electricity" to end and insert "energy for Scotland must include development of all types of renewable energy within a publicly owned, publicly accountable energy company; considers that the energy policy must be based on the needs of Scottish communities and not on the profits of big business, and believes that energy production, distribution and usage must be carried out in a socially, economically and environmentally sustainable manner and that as such, nuclear power must never be considered in any energy policy."
