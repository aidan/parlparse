*S3M-5099# Johann Lamont: Congratulations to the West Highland Free Press—That the Parliament congratulates the West Highland Free Press (WHFP) on becoming Britain’s first employee-owned newspaper; applauds the founders of the WHFP in practising what they preach both in their radical stewardship of the paper for the last 37 years and in their present support for this new form of ownership for the paper; recognises the significance of the WHFP since 1972 in informing and shaping political, cultural, social and community debate on issues close to the hearts of the people of the Highlands and Islands and across Scotland and in sustaining its commitment to its motto, An Tir, An Canan, sna’ Daoine - The Land, The Language, The People; wishes its new owners every success, and trusts that it will serve as an example to other businesses to develop employee ownership initiatives where possible.
