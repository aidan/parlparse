*S2M-1152 Eleanor Scott: Harris Superquarry-That the Parliament welcomes the decision by the multinational company, Lafarge to finally give up plans for a superquarry on Harris in the Western Isles; congratulates local people and the Scottish LINK Quarry Group for defending the local community against the threat to their economy and environment over more than a decade of campaigning, and considers that the current planning review provides a vital opportunity to improve the planning system to ensure that local communities across Scotland are better protected and less vulnerable to the power of multinational companies pursuing unsustainable and environmentally destructive developments.
