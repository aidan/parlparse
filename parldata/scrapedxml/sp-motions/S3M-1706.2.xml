*S3M-1706.2 Jim Mather: Support for the Voluntary Sector—As an amendment to motion (S3M-1706) in the name of Elaine Murray, leave out from first "voluntary" to end and insert "third sector; believes that co-operation between the third sector, local authorities and the Scottish Government is vital in ensuring a strong role for the third sector; recognises that the Scottish Government is funding Project Scotland and has made clear to Project Scotland that further resources may be available for projects it runs in terms of the Scottish Government’s employability agenda, and believes that the exemption from payment of water rates extended by the previous administration to 2010 should be further extended." Supported by: Stewart Maxwell*
