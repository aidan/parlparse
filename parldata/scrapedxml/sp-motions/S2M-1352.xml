 *S2M-1352 Pauline McNeill: Palestine-That the Parliament believes that stability will not be achieved in the Middle East without a just and durable solution to the situation in Israel and Palestine; notes that, despite countless UN resolutions requiring withdrawal, the West Bank and Gaza continue to be illegally occupied by Israel; firmly believes that most Israelis and Palestinians simply want to live in peace and freedom; asserts that it is not acceptable for Ariel Sharon to dictate to the world which parts of Palestine he is prepared to quit and which parts he wants to incorporate into Israel and to build a 30ft wall dividing Palestinian communities from essential services and facilities; condemns President Bush's backing of the Sharon plan to combine annexation of large parts of the West Bank with withdrawal from Gaza; believes that, by backing the Sharon plan, President Bush is endorsing a flagrant flouting of international law by Israel and is dismissing the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their homeland, overriding an explicit decision of the United Nations; condemns the latest illegal attack by the Israeli Defence Force (IDF) on an unarmed peaceful demonstration in Rafah which resulted in the deaths of 10 and wounded 50 people; welcomes the condemnation of this latest atrocity by the UN Security Council and the call from Kofi Annan for an immediate halt to Israeli military operations in Gaza, and further welcomes the denunciation of the IDF action by Peter Hain MP, Leader of the House of Commons.
