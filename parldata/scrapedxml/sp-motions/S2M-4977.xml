*S2M-4977 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Support for the Lindsay Armstrong Support Groupâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the Lindsay Armstrong Support Group on its work; notes that the group offers free and confidential support to victims of rape and sexual assault and their families, regardless of age or gender, including practical and emotional support through the criminal justice process and anonymous 24-hour telephone and web-based support networks; is concerned that this group is currently suffering financial problems, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that adequate funding is made available to allow the group to carry out its much-needed work nationwide. Supported by: Tommy Sheridan*, Campbell Martin*
