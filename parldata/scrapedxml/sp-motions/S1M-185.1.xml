*S1M-185.1 Alasdair Morgan: Scottish Agriculture—As an amendment to motion (S1M-185) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "notes the vital role of agriculture for Scotland’s rural communities; recognises that many of the factors causing the serious crisis in Scottish agriculture are outwith the control of the Scottish Executive, and calls upon the Executive to make representations to Her Majesty’s Government on such matters as interest rates and the level of road fuel duty and to implement the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reforms in a way which best sustains rural communities."
