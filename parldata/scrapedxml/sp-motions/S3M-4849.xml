 *S3M-4849 Jackie Baillie: Imprisonment of Peaceful Protestor Min Ko Naing—That the Parliament notes that Burmese democracy campaigner Min Ko Naing faces up to 20 years in prison for leading a peaceful protest against the policies of that country’s government and has been adopted as a prisoner of conscience by Amnesty International; understands that the rights to freedom of expression and assembly and to take part in the government of one’s country are enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR); believes that the opportunity for citizens to engage with and influence their government provides an important feedback mechanism as well as a necessary check and balance on government action, and expresses its hope that the people of Burma/Myanmar will one day be able to fully enjoy all of their human rights as set out in the UDHR.
