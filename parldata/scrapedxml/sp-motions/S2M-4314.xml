*S2M-4314# Iain Smith: Madras College—That the Parliament notes with concern the report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Education (HMIe) on Madras College, St Andrews; notes with particular concern that HMIe considered that the dispersed accommodation has a negative impact on learning, teaching and the school’s capacity to supervise behaviour and also considered the school accommodation to be unsatisfactory; regrets that, by failing to address the known deficiencies of the multi-site accommodation at Madras College, Fife Council has let down a generation of schoolchildren, and believes that Fife Council should take urgent action to address the unsatisfactory accommodation by constructing a new school to serve the Tay Bridgehead area and a new, or refurbished, Madras College on a single site in St Andrews.
