*S2M-2937# Mark Ballard: Fair Deal for Freelances—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the NUJ’s Fair Deal for Freelances campaign; commends this effort to highlight the importance of the freelance media sector in Scotland; recognises that individual livelihoods can be threatened by all-rights copyright contracts which restrict freelances’ ability to benefit financially from the sale of their work, and welcomes the NUJ’s efforts to tackle such practices by raising awareness of freelance issues, negotiating separate freelance house agreements and defending the rights of individuals against globalised media corporations.
