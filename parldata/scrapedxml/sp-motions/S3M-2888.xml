*S3M-2888 George Foulkes: Livingston’s Touch Bionics Grabbed 14th Place in TIME Magazine’s Top Inventions 2008—That the Parliament congratulates Touch Bionics, based in Livingston, on achieving 14th place out of 50 top inventions this year in TIME Magazine for producing the i-LIMB Hand, the first-to-market prosthetic device with five individually powered digits; appreciates the technology and skill involved in producing an artificial hand with subtle capabilities, such as a credit card grip for grasping narrow objects, that looks just like a real human hand; notes that research on the device began in the United Kingdom’s national health system back in the 1960s; commends all those involved in inventing such a life-changing product, which now benefits more than 400 patients worldwide; welcomes Touch Bionics’ recently announced improvements, such as a lycra lining for easier and more comfortable wear with thicker silicone at the fingertips for greater durability; wishes Touch Bionics well with its agenda to develop technology for providing patients with upper-limb deficiencies with prosthetic fingers, wrists and a full bionic arm, and further congratulates TIME Magazine for giving Touch Bionics and other innovation companies the recognition and inspiration to expand and develop in a global market.
