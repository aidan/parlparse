*S2M-2275.3 Mr Mark Ruskell: Climate Changeâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-2275) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "supports" to end and insert "is gravely concerned about the impacts of climate change on Scotland and the rest of the world and its implications for communities, the economy and the environment; is concerned that Scotland is failing to make an equitable contribution to the UK reduction of global greenhouse gas pollution; urges the Executive to set specific carbon reduction targets for Scotland with the aim of a minimum of 60% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2050, as recommended by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution; calls for a halt to Executive policies and projects that will undermine progress towards achieving this target; further calls on the Executive to set challenging energy efficiency targets in both the domestic and business sectors, recognising the economic opportunities that this affords; believes that there must be an accelerated introduction of all forms of sustainable renewable energy technology, including wave and tidal power, and considers that there is no place for expensive and unsustainable nuclear power in a sustainable Scotland."
