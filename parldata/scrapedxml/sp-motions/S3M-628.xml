*S3M-628 Michael Matheson: End Discrimination by Utilitiesâ€”That the Parliament notes the continuation of the practice by utility companies of surcharging those who do not pay by direct debit; believes that this surcharge is a tax on older people and those with low incomes, and calls on these companies to introduce a system that does not discriminate against those who choose to pay by cash.
