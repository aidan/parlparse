*S3M-7432 Sarah Boyack: Congratulations to Voice of Carers Across Lothian—That the Parliament congratulates Voice of Carers Across Lothian (VOCAL) on its success in becoming the first organisation in Scotland to be awarded Quality Mark Level 2 by the Charities Evaluation Service in July 2010 and the title of Centre of Excellence by the Princess Royal Trust for Carers in November 2010; considers that these awards not only reflect the strong collective commitment to excellence in carer support by VOCAL board members, staff and volunteers but also their strong tradition of partnership work with funders and service partners; believes that VOCAL and other carer organisations play an important role in supporting carers in the Lothians and across Scotland, and wishes them well in the future.
