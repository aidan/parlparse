*S1M-3989 Ms Wendy Alexander: UNESCO World Book Day 6 March 2003—That the Parliament notes that World Book Day events in the United Kingdom and Ireland will take place on Thursday 6 March 2003, a date chosen to fall within school term times; notes that 23 April 2003, the date originally designated by UNESCO in 1995, marks the birth and death of William Shakespeare, the greatest literary talent these islands have ever produced; believes that under the patronage of Baron Renfrew, King James VI and I, Shakespeare wrote some of his finest works including Macbeth, Antony and Cleopatra and The Tempest; considers these works to be among the first cultural masterpieces of the newly united kingdoms, proof of the defining bonds between Scotland and England and central to our place in the world and our sense of ourselves, and further considers that everyone in Scotland should be supported and encouraged to participate in UNESCO’s sixth World Book Day and that encouraging young people particularly to engage with the written word opens immeasurable life-enhancing opportunities and would be the most fitting tribute to the genius of William Shakespeare, the first great Briton.
