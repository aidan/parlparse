 * S2M-2963 Rosie Kane: Keep Coca-Cola out of LIVE 8—That the Parliament would deeply regret any involvement by soft drinks giant, Coca-Cola, in the forthcoming LIVE 8 concerts; is concerned by reports that concert organisers have approached the multi-national company; reminds the organisers that Coca-Cola has refused to take action or show concern for the fact that eight trade unionists were murdered at its bottling plant in Colombia and that towns in India have both lost their water supply and had it polluted due to Coca-Cola’s activities there; notes that the international boycott of Coca-Cola has been in place since 22 July 2003 and congratulates the community-led campaign against Coca-Cola; welcomes Juan Carlos Galvis, trade union leader from SINALTRAINAL, the Colombian Food and Drink Workers Union, who will be addressing G8 Alternatives meetings and will give testimony to the exploitation and dangers in Colombia from Coca-Cola and others, and finally believes that multi-nationals like Coca-Cola are better seated with their feet under the table with G8 leaders who plan to exploit and carve up the planet and should not be allowed to advertise their product on stages or in arenas where good people are protesting against the activities of capitalism. Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Frances Curran*
