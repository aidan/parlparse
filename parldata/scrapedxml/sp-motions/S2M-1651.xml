 *S2M-1651 Rosie Kane: Segregation in the New Parliament—That the Parliament agrees to strive to ensure that it is an inclusive modern democracy; condemns, therefore, the decision to create separate entrances and eating areas in the new building which segregate MSPs from workers; furthermore believes that this is a backward step given that, in the previous parliament building, all workers, including MSPs, entered and dined together, and is concerned that this will serve to create an unhealthy "them and us" division.
