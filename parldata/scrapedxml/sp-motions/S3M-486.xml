 *S3M-486 Liam McArthur: Aberdeen Maternity Hospital Islands Accommodation—That the Parliament notes the importance of Aberdeen Maternity Hospital’s islands accommodation facility, not least in enabling mothers from Orkney and Shetland whose babies require to stay on in hospital to remain close at hand; recognises the need for the accommodation to undergo substantial refurbishment and upgrading; applauds the tremendous efforts and personal drive of Janette Park who has spearheaded a fundraising campaign that has raised over £25,000 in Orkney towards the cost of the refurbishment; welcomes the commitment of NHS Grampian to provide a further £25,000 and NHS Orkney to match the total of £50,000, and looks forward to improvements to this essential facility now being carried out without delay.
