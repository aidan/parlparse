*S1M-2740 Roseanna Cunningham: Review of Older People's Services in Perth and Kinross-That the Parliament notes with concern the recent publication by the Scottish Health Advisory Service (SHAS) of their Review of Older People's Services in Perth and Kinross which found that "there is effectively no planned NHS continuing care for frail older people in Perth and Kinross which is inequitable with the rest of Scotland and should be addressed as a matter of urgency"; further notes the report's recognition of the problems being caused by "bed-blocking" at Perth Royal Infirmary and that a number of the recommendations made following SHAS's last visit in 1998 have not been acted on; expresses the view that the closure of local authority-owned residential homes would exacerbate the problem of care provision and add to the existing anxieties of older people in Perth and Kinross, and calls on the Minister for Health and Community Care, NHS Tayside and Perth and Kinross Council to work together to provide the elderly of Perth and Kinross with the service they deserve. Supported by: Mr John Swinney*
