 *S2M-5698 Trish Godman: Ferguson’s Shipyard in Port Glasgow—That the Parliament gives its support to the management and workforce at this difficult moment in Ferguson’s shipyard’s fortunes; acknowledges that Ferguson’s is not only the one remaining yard on the lower Clyde, but that it is and always has been an integral part of the community of Port Glasgow and that it is an important local employer of skilled men and women, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive and other key decision-makers to exercise all their skills and power to ensure that the yard stays in business, despite temporary difficulties, and in doing so to demonstrate their commitment to the retention of the important, locally based skills of a truly first-class workforce.
