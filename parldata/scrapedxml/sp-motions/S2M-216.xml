 *S2M-216 Margo MacDonald: Use of Cannabis for the Relief of Painâ€”That the Parliament salutes the courage, integrity and tenacity of Biz Ivol in her campaign to change the laws on cannabis in order to enable MS sufferers such as herself to legally use the substance for the relief of pain; regrets that the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service judged her prosecution to be in the public interest when common sense and humanity dictate otherwise, and calls on the Scottish Executive to instigate an immediate public consultation on changing the provisions of the criminal law in Scotland in respect of the use of cannabis for the relief of pain.
