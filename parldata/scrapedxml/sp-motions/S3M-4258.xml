 *S3M-4258 Iain Smith: Keep Largo and Lundin Links in North East Fife—That the Parliament notes that, despite overwhelming opposition, the Boundary Commission for Scotland’s revised recommendations for Scottish Parliament constituencies retains the provisional proposal to move the communities of Lundin Links, Lower Largo and Upper Largo from the North East Fife constituency to the proposed new constituency of Mid Fife and Glenrothes; recognises that residents of Largo and Lundin Links consider that they have strong local ties to the East Neuk and north east Fife and that this was confirmed by Sheriff Principal Mr R A Dunlop QC in his report on the local inquiry into the provisional proposals last September, which stated "in my judgement this inquiry has thrown up as strong an example of such local ties as one is likely to find"; believes that the Boundary Commission for Scotland has failed to give due weight to public opinion and to exercise its discretion, under constituency rule 4, to take account of local ties that may be broken, and urges the commission to reconsider its recommendation for the North East Fife constituency and keep Largo and Lundin Links in North East Fife.
