 *S3M-6765 Helen Eadie: Celebrating Golf in Fife—That the Parliament celebrates the 49 golf courses in Fife, which range from local and very special courses, like those of Ballingry, Lochgelly, Cowdenbeath and Aberdour, to internationally renowned courses, like those at St Andrews; considers the importance of golf for Fife residents not only as a health and leisure benefit but also in terms of building communities; furthermore notes the wider significance of golf in Fife historically, culturally and economically; welcomes competitions such as the Open Championship, which is now in its 150th year, that bring thousands of people to Fife each year, providing business to Fife’s hotels, bed and breakfasts, restaurants, bars and cafés, tourist destinations and shops; congratulates organisations such as Fife Constabulary and Stagecoach on helping to co-ordinate and support these competitions and whose sterling work ensures that they run smoothly and are successful, and wishes the golfing tradition in Fife every success for the future.
