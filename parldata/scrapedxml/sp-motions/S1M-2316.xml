*S1M-2316# Bruce Crawford: Reversal of Her Majesty's Government's Decision on Mixed Oxide Fuel Plant at Sellafield, Cumbria—That the Parliament supports the demand of the Irish Prime Minister, Bertie Ahern, that Her Majesty’s Government abandon its proposals to allow for the operation of a new mixed oxide fuel (MOX) plant at Sellafield in Cumbria; further supports Mr Ahern’s wish to rid the waters surrounding both Ireland and Scotland of nuclear contamination; notes the intention of the Irish Government to fight the decision "on every front" both legally and politically and believes that the Scottish Executive should use every means at its disposal to persuade Her Majesty’s Government to reverse this dangerous and irresponsible decision. Supported by: Fiona McLeod*, Andrew Wilson*, Mr Lloyd Quinan*, Mr Gil Paterson*, Mr Adam Ingram*, Mr Kenneth Gibson*, Robin Harper*, Stewart Stevenson*, Shona Robison*, Colin Campbell*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Fiona Hyslop*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*
