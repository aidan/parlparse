*S3M-3326 Bill Wilson: National Holocaust Memorial Day, 27 January 2009—That the Parliament notes the continued relevance of Holocaust Memorial Day, the international day of remembrance for the victims of the Holocaust and of other genocides; further notes that Renfrewshire Council, chosen to host the Scottish National Holocaust Memorial Day, marked the day with, among other things, a series of events under the positive title, One Great Tapestry; A Celebration of Diversity, at which a major theme was "stand up to hatred"; believes that an appreciation of peoples and cultures the world over should be an integral part of the Scottish identity, as suggested by this title, and expresses the hope that Scotland will continue to welcome those fleeing persecution, stand up to hatred and have the courage to condemn all those who infringe human rights. Supported by: Joe FitzPatrick*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Sandra White*, Bashir Ahmad*, Christopher Harvie*
