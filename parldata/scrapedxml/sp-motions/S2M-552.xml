 *S2M-552# Mark Ballard: Alternatives to New Forth Crossing-That the Parliament believes that the building of a second Forth road bridge would do nothing to solve the problems of increasing traffic congestion in Fife and Lothian and further believes that these problems could be tackled through a range of other measures including rail infrastructure improvements, starting with an upgrade of the inadequate signalling system of the Forth Rail Bridge and, in the longer term, a reopening of the rail line from Dunfermline to Alloa to alleviate freight congestion on the central Scotland rail network.
