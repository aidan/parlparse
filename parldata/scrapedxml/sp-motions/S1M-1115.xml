*S1M-1115# Dorothy-Grace Elder: Protection of Children from Hard-core Pornography-That the Parliament deplores the decision of the Video Appeal Committee (VAC) of the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) to uphold an appeal from the distributors of hardcore pornography to allow distribution of videos with a more explicit content than had previously been acceptable, against the wishes of the BBFC board; notes that the BBFC lost a High Court action this year against the VAC over its decision; is appalled at the High Court ruling in London which brushed aside the possible effects on children once this pornographic material enters homes; deplores the rules since issued by the BBFC which permit even more explicit hardcore pornographic videos to be sold in sex shops in Scotland and the UK; calls upon all local authorities to refuse licences for more sex shops which are now anticipated to open due to the ability to sell even more explicit material; notes that the floodgates could now be open for further hardcore pornography to enter the UK; pledges to do all in its power to resist anything which could harm children through viewing pornography, and supports parents in the UK who are appealing for the Obscene Publications Act 1959 to be amended to include new and tougher regulations.
