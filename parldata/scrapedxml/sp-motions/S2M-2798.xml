 * S2M-2798 Colin Fox:Remembering Those Who Fought and Died in World War II—That the Parliament acknowledges the 60th anniversary of VE Day and pays tribute to those all over the world who fought against the evil of Nazism and fascism in World War II; recognises that, alongside the 57,000 Scots who gave their lives, many millions across the world also died in the conflict; believes that Scotland owes a huge debt to all those who fought on its behalf and that it is right to remember their sacrifice, and further believes that the best tribute that can be made in remembering them at this time is to build a peaceful world, one where the resources of the world are shared out equally between all the peoples of the world.
