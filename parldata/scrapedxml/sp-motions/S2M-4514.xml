 *S2M-4514 Bill Butler: Refugee Week in Scotland—That the Parliament notes that Monday 19 June to Sunday 25 June 2006 is Refugee Week in Scotland; acknowledges the contribution which refugees have made culturally, socially and economically to Scottish society; recognises that during the week over 70 events across Scotland will be held which will continue both to build upon the success of previous years’ Refugee Week campaigns and showcase many of the community-led projects which welcome, and provide assistance to, refugees and asylum seekers in Scotland; commends the work of the Scottish Executive in this area including its innovative One Scotland, Many Cultures campaign, and wishes to pay particular tribute to the staff and volunteers of the Scottish Refugee Council, both for their unstinting efforts on behalf of those who arrive in Scotland seeking sanctuary and in challenging many of the myths which have attached themselves to this issue. Supported by: Trish Godman*, Alex Neil*, Dr Sylvia Jackson*, Mr Kenny MacAskill*, Maureen Macmillan*, Patrick Harvie*, Shiona Baird*
