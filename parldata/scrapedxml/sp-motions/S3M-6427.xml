 *S3M-6427 Patricia Ferguson: People’s Postcode Lottery Raises £1 million Each for Charities in Scotland—That the Parliament congratulates the People’s Postcode Lottery for raising £1 million for four of its charity partners, Maggie’s Cancer Caring Centres, the Scottish Wildlife Trust, CHILDREN 1st and the People’s Postcode Trust; notes that the money raised so far equates to running one Maggie’s Cancer Caring Centre for almost three years, running all of CHILDREN 1st’s projects for 42 days, assists the Scottish Wildlife Trust to run its wildlife centres throughout Scotland for a year and has helped the People’s Postcode Trust to fund over 200 community projects across Scotland; welcomes the fact that all funds raised in Scotland stay in Scotland, and wishes the People’s Postcode Lottery and its charity partners the very best for the future in generating further funding for Scottish charities.
