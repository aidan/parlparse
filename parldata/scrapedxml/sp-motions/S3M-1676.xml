*S3M-1676 Jamie Hepburn: Income Tax Increase for Poorest Taxpayers—That the Parliament notes with concern the abolition of the 10p income tax rate; further notes that this will increase the taxes of some 324,000 low paid Scottish workers; agrees with the assertion of the House of Commons’ Treasury Committee that this raising of the tax level for the poorest taxpayers in society is "unreasonable" to say the least; calls on Her Majesty’s Government to reverse this decision with immediate effect, and believes that the Scottish Parliament should be endowed with full control over taxation matters to put in place a fair and progressive form of income tax that does not penalise our poorest citizens in this manner.
