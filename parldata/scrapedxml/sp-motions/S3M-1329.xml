*S3M-1329 Aileen Campbell: Rights of Children of Prisoners—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Not Seen. Not Heard. Not Guilty: The Rights and Status of the Children of Prisoners in Scotland by the Commissioner for Children and Young People in Scotland; notes that the report finds that an estimated 13,500 children in Scotland are affected at any one time by the imprisonment of a parent and that when sentencing options are being considered the impact on the child is rarely taken into account; believes that the rights of children must be taken into account when sentencing and offender policy is considered, and welcomes the Scottish Government’s moves to reduce the number of custodial sentences for minor offences, especially where mothers with children are concerned.
