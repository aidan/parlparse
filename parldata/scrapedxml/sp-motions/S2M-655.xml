*S2M-655# Pauline McNeill: Drug Assisted Rape-That the Parliament notes with concern the properties of the drugs Rohypnol (roofies) and gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB, Liquid E or Liquid X), commonly known as "date-rape" drugs or "forget pills" as the sedative effects are seven to ten times greater than Valium; further notes the extensive foundation work carried out by Detective Chief Inspector Peter Sturman of the Metropolitan Police Serious Crime Group on the subject; welcomes the banning of GHB in June 2003 because of government concerns over its use in sexual attacks; further welcomes the Scottish Executive's plans to respond to increasing public concern over date-rape drugs and to take the matter seriously by running a major festive season information campaign including leaflets, posters and videos in pubs and clubs and, hopefully, also in universities, colleges and schools; notes that although over 60 drug-related sexual abuse victims in Scotland have, since 1997, contacted The Roofie Foundation which provides assistance and support, fewer than 15% of victims report these crimes and in Scotland only two convictions have ever taken place, and considers that drug-assisted rape should be recognised as a major crime. Supported by: Fiona Hyslop*
