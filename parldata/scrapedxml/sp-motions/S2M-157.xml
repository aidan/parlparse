 *S2M-157 Colin Fox: Biz Ivol—That the Parliament sends its support and solidarity to Orkney woman Biz Ivol, who has highlighted the situation of people with multiple sclerosis (MS) who need to seek medical supplies of cannabis to help alleviate their suffering; is seriously concerned about the health of all MS sufferers when the range of effective medical help that they have at their disposal does not include medical cannabis supplies; calls for greater financial resources to be allocated to help search for treatments that alleviate the symptoms of MS; believes that these treatments include the medical use of cannabis and further calls on Her Majesty’s Government to issue an immediate review of the law regarding the use of cannabis for medical purposes so that MS suffers like Biz Ivol are not treated like criminals.
