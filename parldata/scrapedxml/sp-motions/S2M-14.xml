*S2M-14 Rosie Kane: M74 Northern Extension—That the Parliament expresses its complete opposition to the M74 Northern Extension; recognises that the process by which this proposal has been pursued, the monies already spent and the estimated cost of the project have failed the people of Glasgow; condemns the Scottish Executive's lack of provision of an alternative public transport system for this part of Glasgow and its apparent disregard for local concerns and needs; calls on the Executive to review its transport policy so that it properly reflects the needs and desires of the Scottish people, and, in the case of the M74 extension, calls for an immediate public inquiry including an environmental impact assessment and proper exploration of alternative options.
