 *S3M-5752 Robert Brown: End the Tax on Breathing—That the Parliament welcomes the End the Tax on Breathing campaign initiated by the Pulmonary Hypertension Association UK; supports the campaign’s objective to end the discrimination facing 90,000 people in Scotland and across the United Kingdom who live with conditions such as pulmonary hypertension (PH) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are fit to fly yet require supplemental oxygen when flying around or out of the UK; notes with concern that a recent report by the organisation found that, of the 71 airlines surveyed, (a) less than a quarter supply free supplementary oxygen, (b) a quarter do not supply supplementary oxygen at all, (3) two thirds of the airlines would not allow disabled air travellers with lung conditions to bring their own oxygen for use in-flight and (4) of the airlines that provide supplemental oxygen but charge for it, each levies a different fee ranging from £50 to £500 per trip; finds it disappointing that parliamentary motion S3M-4527, lodged on 25 June 2009, has not been embraced by external stakeholders to the desired degree and that only Thomson Holidays has followed the example of British Airways, Emirates Airlines and Cathay Pacific by dropping charges for in-flight oxygen provision for those who need it, and urges all airlines to take measures to axe supplemental oxygen surcharges and to allow patients, as in the United States of America, to bring their own oxygen supply free of charge.
