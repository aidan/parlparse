*S2M-1579# Bill Butler: Citizens Advice Week-That the Parliament supports Advice Week from 6 to 13 September 2004; commends the vital work that Scotland's 77 citizens advice bureaux do in providing free, impartial and confidential advice to all; recognises that in the last year they handled over 400,000 issues and secured nearly £26m for clients; further recognises that such good quality advice on issues such as benefits, debt, employment, housing and consumer affairs is increasingly necessary in today's society; acknowledges that the use of client evidence means that citizens advice bureaux speak with authority and relevance on changing social issues from both a local and national perspective; congratulates the 2,193 volunteers and 329 paid members of staff who provide this service, and hopes that parliamentarians across the political spectrum can work together to ensure that the service will continue to inform government and meet the needs of local communities across Scotland in the years to come.
