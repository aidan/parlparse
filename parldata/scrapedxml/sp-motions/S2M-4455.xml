*S2M-4455 Pauline McNeill: Ban on Dropping-Off at Glasgow Airportâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the proposals by British Airports Authority (BAA) which include a ban on cars and certain taxis from dropping-off passengers immediately outside the Glasgow Airport terminal; further notes the strong public reaction to this proposal; is concerned that this will impact on ordinary passengers and business interests; believes that this would not show Glasgow city and surrounding areas in a good light if passengers are so inconvenienced compared with other airports on pick-up and departure; is not convinced that this proposal is likely to encourage greater use of public transport; believes that a public authority would be required to at least consult on such radical proposals; further believes that the charges proposed are unreasonable, and calls on BAA to withdraw these proposals and for the Scottish Executive to consider the impact which this will have on the image of Scotland and its tourism, leisure and business interests.
