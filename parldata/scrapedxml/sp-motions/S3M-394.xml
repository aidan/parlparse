*S3M-394 Jackie Baillie: Delta Queen to Abdicate—That the Parliament regrets the decision to retire the Dumbarton-built riverboat, Delta Queen, from service on the Mississippi river where she has plied her trade for more than sixty years; notes her long and distinguished history of service across the United States ever since she was built in 1924; believes that Delta Queen is a fine example of Dumbarton’s proud tradition of shipbuilding, and hopes that this historic vessel will be preserved as an attraction to be enjoyed by visitors across the world for years to come.
