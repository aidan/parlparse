 * S2M-2965 Shiona Baird: Fantastic It’s Not Plastic—That the Parliament congratulates Aberdeenshire Council on its “Fantastic It’s Not Plastic” campaign, which encourages people to carry their shopping in reusable bags as opposed to disposable plastic bags from the supermarket; notes that there are eight billion plastic carrier bags used every year in the United Kingdom, which greatly exacerbate our litter problems, present a particular hazard to animals, birds and marine life and, for the most part, end up in landfill sites where they take up to 100 years to break down; commends the work of Aberdeenshire Council’s Waste Aware Team, whose members are this week piloting the “Fantastic It’s Not Plastic” initiative in Insch, Culter and through Buchan’s Dial-a-Bus community scheme by handing out cotton bags to shoppers in exchange for their disposable plastic bags, and recognises the valuable contribution that such a campaign makes in raising awareness among members of the public and the business community of this important environmental issue and the practical steps individuals can take to help halt the proliferation of plastic bags.
