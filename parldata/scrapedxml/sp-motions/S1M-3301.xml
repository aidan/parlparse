*S1M-3301 Mr Brian Monteith: Scotland's Commonwealth Games Team—That the Parliament extends its warm congratulations to members of Scotland’s Commonwealth Games team for their achievement in getting selected and accomplishing personal bests and winning 30 gold, silver and bronze medals, a total of one fewer than the record attained at the Edinburgh Games in 1986; extends its thanks also to their support network of relatives, friends, coaches, trainers and sports administrators who helped the participants to represent Scotland so well, and calls on the Scottish Executive and sportscotland to use this opportunity to review the success or otherwise of lottery funding for various sports so that any necessary changes can be made for the future.
