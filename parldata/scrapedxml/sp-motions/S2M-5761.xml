*S2M-5761 Margaret Mitchell: Charities and Churches Water Charge Exemption—That the Parliament notes with regret that the consultation paper regarding the proposed charging arrangements for the payment of water charges for non-household premises from 2010 contained no specific reference to relief for churches and charities; further notes that, following the closure of the consultation in January 2007, the Scottish Executive has confirmed that it has no plans to extend the current exemption scheme beyond 2010 or to establish a replacement for the scheme when it expires; considers that this decision is short-sighted and will merely serve to place a significant burden on the majority of charities and church organisations, despite the fact that seeking to maintain the long-term future of these organisations is crucial to ensuring that they continue to play an integral part in the well-being of our communities, and calls on the Executive to reconsider this decision.
