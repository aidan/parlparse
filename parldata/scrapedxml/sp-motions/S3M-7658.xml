*S3M-7658 Murdo Fraser: Submarine Dismantling Project—That the Parliament notes that the Ministry of Defence has named Rosyth Royal Dockyard as one of the two potential sites for the Submarine Dismantling Project, along with Devonport Royal Dockyard; notes that the project has been established to dismantle 27 defueled nuclear submarines after they have left service with the Royal Navy; believes that, should Rosyth be awarded the contract, it would bring a massive economic boost to Rosyth, Fife and Scotland; further believes that Rosyth is home to one of the most highly skilled workforces suited for this type of work and that there is a proud history and connection in Fife to the Royal Navy, and hopes that Rosyth is successful in winning the Submarine Dismantling Project.
