*S3M-2469 Mr Frank McAveety: SNP Councillor Glamorises Guns—That the Parliament expresses deep concern about the growing problem of gun crime in Scotland and condemns the actions of SNP councillor, Jahangir Hanif, in posing with an AK-47 rifle; considers that any action by an elected representative that glamorises gun crime is completely unacceptable and that Councillor Hanif’s action dangerously undermines the credibility of the SNP government on law and order; condemns the SNP’s response as totally inadequate, and notes that the final judgement on both Councillor Hanif and the SNP will rest with the electorate.
