 * S2M-2416 Irene Oldfather:British Heart Foundation - Real Valentine Appeal—That the Parliament recognises that heart disease is the UK’s biggest killer and that, every two minutes, someone in the United Kingdom has a heart attack; acknowledges that a healthy diet and regular exercise is the best way to avoid heart disease; agrees, however, that sufferers of heart disease should have access to the best levels of care possible; appreciates the work of the British Heart Foundation (BHF) for more than 40 years in leading the fight against heart disease by funding research, education and care; supports the charity’s Real Valentine Appeal which aims to raise £1 million to fund 30 new British Heart Foundation nurses who provide specialist care, reassurance and advice to patients, and encourages as many Scottish people as possible to get involved and post a Valentine note, either online on the BHF website or in a BHF shop window, to their loved one for a small donation to the campaign.
