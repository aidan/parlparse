 *S3M-4248 Sandra White: Pathways to Palestine—That the Parliament applauds the students from Glasgow Caledonian University who will set off from George Square in Glasgow on 27 May 2009 on their first leg of an epic journey that will see them cycle through 14 countries and travel over 4,000 miles on route to Gaza to raise funds for Medical Aid for Palestinians, and notes that, as they travel over the foothills of the Alps, the Syrian desert and the lowest point on the planet, the cyclists will be phlogging directly to their website, www.pathwaystopalestine.com, where their progress can be followed and miles can be bought in order to help ensure that Medical Aid for Palestine can provide the necessary life-saving equipment that ordinary citizens of Gaza still desperately need. Supported by: Hugh O’Donnell*, Rob Gibson*, Kenneth Gibson*, Bob Doris*, Bill Kidd*, Michael Matheson*, Jim Tolson*, Pauline McNeill*
