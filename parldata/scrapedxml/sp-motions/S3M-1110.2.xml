*S3M-1110.2 Iain Smith: Gould Reportâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-1110) in the name of Bruce Crawford, insert at end "but believes that changes in the powers of the Parliament should be for a purpose and notes that a single transferable vote (STV) system offers the most effective way of electing parliaments, giving voters more choice than any other system, wasting fewer votes and increasing accountability; further notes the successful use of STV for the local government elections in 2007, and therefore believes that the 2011 Scottish Parliament elections should be conducted using STV."
