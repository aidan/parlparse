*S2M-4524 Frances Curran: Solidarity with Venezuelan Workers—That the Parliament expresses concern over the situation regarding the Venezuelan company, Drogueria Race, which has sacked two workers, Andry Key and Jhonny Coronil, for organising the SUPROFARD trade union; notes that this trade union has been recognised by the Venezuelan Ministry of Labour and that the company must therefore grant recognition to the union in accordance with the constitution of the Venezuelan Bolivarian Republic; is concerned that the management is trying to introduce a company union in order to impede the workers’ rights to organise collectively; further notes that the workers have called for international support and solidarity for their case through the Hands Off Venezuela campaign; calls on the Venezuelan Ministry of Labour to intervene in the case and instruct the company to reinstate the sacked workers and recognise the SUPROFARD trade union with immediate effect, and offers solidarity to the workers in their struggle and to the continuing process of the socialist Bolivarian revolution in Venezuela.
