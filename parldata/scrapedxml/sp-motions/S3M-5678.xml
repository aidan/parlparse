 *S3M-5678 Marlyn Glen: Scotland’s First Dedicated Cancer Research Centre Launched in Dundee—That the Parliament notes that Dundee, City of Discovery, has been chosen as the location for the historic launch of Scotland’s first dedicated cancer research centre; recognises that this centre of excellence is the first of a group of related cancer research centres across the United Kingdom; commends the development as a means for cancer patients across Scotland to benefit from world-class research and medical expertise, which is intended to increase the pace of vital breakthrough discoveries in the treatment of cancer by bringing together researchers and clinicians; applauds the work of Cancer Research UK for offering fresh hope for patients suffering from bowel, breast and skin cancer, including research into malignant melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer, which claimed the lives of more than 170 Scots last year; further notes that £7.5 million will be invested each year by Britain’s main cancer charity and will, for the first time, unite leading biomedical researchers at Dundee University, Cancer Research UK and clinicians at NHS Tayside, and recognises that the launch of the new centre coincides with World Cancer Day 2010.
