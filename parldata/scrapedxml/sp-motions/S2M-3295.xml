 * S2M-3295 Robin Harper:Beachwatch Survey 17 to 18 September 2005—That the Parliament welcomes and supports the Marine Conservation Society’s (MCS) annual “Beachwatch” survey and beach clean-up scheduled for 17 to 18 September 2005; congratulates the MCS on its success in making last year’s event one of the most comprehensive beach surveys ever undertaken; notes that, although last year’s event recorded an 8.5% overall decrease in litter on the United Kingdom’s (UK) beaches, over the previous year this still represents an increase of 82% over the last decade and the highest level of plastic litter since Beachwatch started in 1993; further notes that the UK Government’s Charting Progress report assessing the current state of UK seas acknowledges that Beachwatch, despite being predominantly conducted by voluntary effort, “provides the only long-term dataset” for beach litter in the UK and concludes that “litter on beaches is totally preventable”, and calls on the Scottish Executive to take a firmer lead on protecting Scotland’s coastal and marine environment.
