 *S3M-2353 Dr Richard Simpson: Clostridium Difficileâ€”That the Parliament calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to apologise to the families that have suffered loss in the Clostridium difficile outbreak at the Vale of Leven Hospital and supports their call for a public inquiry; regrets that the Cabinet Secretary has not met the families nor provided them with a preview of the Cairns Smith report prior to full publication; notes with concern the increasing level of Clostridium difficile cases reported in the last two quarters in Scotland, compared to the significant drop in cases in England (32% in the last quarter); regrets that, despite the warnings given by opposition members in the health care associated infection debate on 26 March 2008, it apparently took notification from the Dumbarton and Vale of Leven Reporter prior to its reporting the tragedy of the deaths at Vale of Leven to spur the Cabinet Secretary into action; also calls for upgrading of the mandatory surveillance system to web-based reporting of cases by individual hospital, replacing the current pan-NHS board reporting system whereby the best hospitals can mask the worst, to be introduced as soon as possible on the lines of the English NHS reporting system, which was updated in January 2008; further calls for reporting to be extended to all cases in those over the age of two instead of only over 65, along the lines announced for England; calls for a clear linkage between hospital-acquired cases reported and outcomes to be the subject of mandatory reporting and for this linkage to be published on a monthly basis on the web, and finally calls for all hospitals to have in place clear antibiotic policies supported by pharmacists on the wards.
