 *S3M-6544 Liam McArthur: Scottish Hockey Threat to Island Teams—That the Parliament condemns the proposal to be put to the Scottish Hockey Union AGM scheduled for 12 June 2010 that would impose a rule on all National League matches requiring them to be played on the Scottish mainland unless both teams agree otherwise; believes that such a move would discriminate against island-based teams that already take on and accept the need to travel off their islands for 50% of their games; considers that such a rule would undermine the credibility of the Scottish Hockey Union as a national organisation in receipt of national funding, and urges the Scottish Hockey Union to reject the proposal and commit itself to being a genuine Scottish body, treating all players and teams the same, regardless of where in Scotland they are based. Supported by: Rob Gibson*, Peter Peacock*, Alasdair Allan*, Mike Pringle*, Tavish Scott*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Mr Frank McAveety*, Ross Finnie*
