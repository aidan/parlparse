*S2M-5569 Murray Tosh: Investment in Building Affordable Rented Homes—That the Parliament acknowledges the need for increased investment in building affordable rented homes; further acknowledges that the 2007 Comprehensive Spending Review is the most significant opportunity to secure this funding, which is essential to achieve the Scottish Executive’s target that all unintentionally homeless people will have the right to a home by 2012, and recognises the case for committing the funding for 30,000 affordable homes for rent over the period 2008 to 2011.
