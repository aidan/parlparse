 *S1M-4046 Alex Fergusson: Scottish Agricultural College Restructuring—That the Parliament notes the decision of the board of the Scottish Agricultural College to restructure the colleges at Edinburgh as recommended in the Deloitte &amp; Touche survey; regrets that this decision ignores the social impact of the recommendations on the south west and north east of Scotland and runs contrary to the Scottish Executive’s policy of dispersing agency and department jobs and offices outwith the central belt; considers that the basis for some of the evidence, such as the student survey, is questionable as is the weighting system which was devised by the board itself, and calls for a further study into the potential of the Auchincruive campus as the sole location of the colleges’ educational and advisory services in its future structure.
