*S3M-5408 Rob Gibson: The Network Change Programme in Argyll and Bute: A Case Study—That the Parliament welcomes Consumer Focus Scotland’s research report, The Network Change Programme in Argyll and Bute: A Case Study, which examines the impact of post office closures on consumers in the Argyll and Bute area; believes that this empowering research, which engaged directly with people affected by the closures, highlights important lessons about the weaknesses in the consultation process and the impact that the programme has had on local communities, and further believes that the report’s recommendations should be carefully considered by Post Office Ltd and acted on now in order to address the concerns expressed by consumers and also to inform any future consultations on changes to the post office network in Scotland.
