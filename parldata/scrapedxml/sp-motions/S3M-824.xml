*S3M-824# Bill Butler: Sectarian Stories—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of Sectarian Stories, an educational documentary produced by Nil by Mouth in conjunction with the Gallery of Modern Art’s Blind Faith programme, which will be premiered at the Parliament on 14 November 2007; notes that the documentary features 12 people from across Scotland sharing their personal experiences of sectarianism which reflect the impact that sectarian attitudes, language and behaviour have on individuals and their communities; applauds the courage of the participants for speaking out on the issue; views such first hand experiences as a valuable resource that will support work to challenge sectarianism across primary, secondary and community education programmes, and, while acknowledging the significant strides taken in recent years to challenge and legislate against sectarianism, realises that it still presents Scotland with a series of deep-seated, emotive and complex challenges that are best met by strong and visible leadership from the Scottish Government. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Brian Adam*, Ross Finnie*, Kenneth Gibson*, Elaine Smith*, Stuart McMillan*, Andy Kerr*, Patrick Harvie*
