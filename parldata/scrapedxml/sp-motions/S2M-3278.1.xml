 *S2M-3278.1 Lord James Douglas-Hamilton: Quality Teachers for the 21st Century—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3278) in the name of Peter Peacock, leave out from first "welcomes" to end and insert "while recognising with concern the increasing number of teaching posts vacant for more than three months, welcomes the implementation of radically improved teacher induction arrangements; acknowledges the widening of opportunities and improved quality of Continuing Professional Development for teachers and the development of chartered teacher programmes, but notes the low uptake of these programmes among teachers; recognises the importance of teaching standards in delivering higher educational attainment, and welcomes the Executive’s commitment to secure quality teachers for the 21st century but notes that, with 40% of teachers due to retire within 10 years, the issue of teacher retention must be addressed with some urgency."
