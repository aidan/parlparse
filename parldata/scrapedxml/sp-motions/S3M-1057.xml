 *S3M-1057 Shirley-Anne Somerville: The Samaritansâ€”That the Parliament applauds the work of the Samaritans whose dedicated team of volunteers regularly gives its time to provide 24-hour, non-judgmental, confidential emotional support to people experiencing feelings of distress or despair; notes that the Edinburgh and Lothians Samaritans, which has been active since 1959 and is the second oldest branch in the United Kingdom, now has around 140 volunteers who in 2007 answered 24,000 calls, saw over 200 people at the centre and responded to around 2,500 emails and over 3,000 text messages; recognises that Christmas can be a particularly difficult emotional period for many people, and praises the commitment of the volunteers in providing this important service over this busy time.
