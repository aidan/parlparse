 *S3M-4580# Alasdair Morgan: Whithorn as Cradle of Christianity and Place of Modern Pilgrimage—That the Parliament recognises that Whithorn is the earliest known centre of Christianity in Scotland and that Whithorn has already produced archaeological artefacts of immense historical significance; notes that, while in ancient times Ninian was Scotland’s premier saint and remains commemorated in many sites throughout the nation, the historical significance of Whithorn and Ninian’s story is largely forgotten by a modern generation; recognises that the recognition of Whithorn as Scotland’s cradle of Christianity will bring economic benefit to a depressed area, and supports the efforts of the Whithorn Trust to publicise Whithorn’s unique contribution to Scottish history more widely, not least for the benefit of its present-day inhabitants.
