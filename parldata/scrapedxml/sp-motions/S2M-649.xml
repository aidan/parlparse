*S2M-649# Phil Gallie: Scots Regiments-That the Parliament notes with concern the alleged recommendations in the Ministry of Defence's review of the United Kingdom armed forces and the impact that these will have on Scotland's famous regiments; believes that, in a time of uncertainty due to international turbulence and terrorism and with our forces deployed and over-stretched throughout the world, our regiments, including the Black Watch, the Royal Scots and the King's Own Scottish Borderers, should be strengthened and not cut back or disbanded, and considers that any proposals which undermine or damage this objective are ill-timed, counter-productive and fundamentally contrary to the national interest. Supported by: Lord James Douglas-Hamilton*, Mr Ted Brocklebank*, Margaret Mitchell*, Mr Brian Monteith*, Alex Johnstone*, Alex Fergusson*
