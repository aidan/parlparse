 * S2M-2578 Tommy Sheridan:Bank of Scotland Earnings Survey and Low Pay Across Scotland—That the Parliament notes the Bank of Scotland earnings survey, released on 5 March 2005, which claimed that the lowest weekly earnings in Scotland are in Moray at an average of £390 per week; believes that this survey is wildly optimistic and unrealistic as the Annual Survey of Hours and Earnings, the most reliable earnings survey across the United Kingdom, shows that the lowest average weekly wage in Scotland is just £291 per week in the Borders; further believes that the Bank of Scotland survey disguises massively the extent of low pay across Scotland because the lowest-paid tenth of Scottish workers, according to more reliable surveys, earn less than £109 per week which is more than £280 less than the lowest figure quoted by the Bank of Scotland, and believes that a company with the massive resources of the Bank of Scotland should be able to conduct more reliable surveys instead of presenting a picture of Scotland among workers which is completely unrecognisable and unrelated to reality.
