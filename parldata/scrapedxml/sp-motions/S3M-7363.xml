*S3M-7363 Mary Scanlon: Save RAF Lossiemouth March and Rally—That the Parliament congratulates everyone involved in the march and rally to save RAF Lossiemouth, which saw an estimated 6,000 people join political leaders of the four main parties, local businesses and other members of the community to send what it considers to be the strongest possible message for the retention of RAF Lossiemouth; particularly praises the efforts of Councillor David Stewart and the Save RAF Lossiemouth Action Group, who organised the event in just 15 days; acknowledges the support offered by Grampian Police, particularly the local officers, who it believes found a solution to every potential problem and allowed this huge event to run so smoothly, and trusts that the message from the rally and the thousands of supporters will resound with decision makers.
