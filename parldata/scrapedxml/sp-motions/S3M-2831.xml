 *S3M-2831 Bob Doris: Protecting Worried Homeowners—That the Parliament notes the pressure placed on homeowners and the uncertainty created by the current economic crisis; acknowledges the content of the Office of Fair Trading (OFT) market study report on the UK sale and rent back sector (SRB) where private firms buy and rent back, often at well below market value, the properties of homeowners, often where homeowners are struggling to keep up mortgage payments and facing repossession; condemns the bad practices of some SRB firms, such as giving a verbal commitment on a long-term lease, while in reality committing only to a short-term lease and subsequently charging inflated rental prices to former owners, resulting in their being forced out of their homes; agrees with the OFT report, which recommends regulation by the Financial Services Authority (FSA) as well as ensuring that homeowners considering the SRB option are given independent financial advice and that the UK Government provide greater clarity on the rights of former homeowners in relation to the claiming of housing benefit, and strongly urges Jim Murphy, Secretary of State for Scotland, to join the Scottish Government in pressing the UK Government to act on and implement these recommendations, particularly regulation by the FSA, as quickly as possible.
