*S3M-3855 Bob Doris: Remembering the Real G20—That the Parliament calls on the leaders of the G20 group of countries meeting in London to remember, in their deliberations about the global economy, the people of the G20 postcode area in Glasgow and other ordinary communities hard-hit by the recession in Scotland and around the world; notes that, while the G20 leaders will be staying in plush embassies and hotels, 29% of people in Glasgow’s G20 are classified as income deprived by the Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation, and believes that Glasgow City Council’s plans to close schools in the G20 area and beyond can only further damage such hard-pressed communities.
