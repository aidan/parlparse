 *S3M-534 Bill Wilson: Iraq - Genocide—That the Parliament notes that excess mortality in Iraq subsequent to the 2003 invasion was estimated, as detailed in The Lancet of 21 October 2006, to be of the order of 654,965 deaths (or within the range of 392,979 to 942,636, with a confidence interval of 95%); notes that a survey released earlier this month by British polling organisation, Opinion Research Business, now estimates post-invasion excess mortality at 1,220,580 (within the range of 733,158 to 1,446,063); further notes the half a million estimated excess deaths of children under five alone, between 1991 and 1998, that the executive director of Unicef suggested was attributable in some measure to sanctions; notes that it is possible that Iraq, a nation of some 27 million people, has lost a tenth of its population due to the combined effects of sanctions and the 2003 invasion, and further believes that, had mortality of this scale been attributable to the actions of governments hostile to the United Kingdom and United States of America, the term used to describe it would be genocide.
