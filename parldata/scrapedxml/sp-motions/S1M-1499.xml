 *S1M-1499 Mr Brian Monteith: Snowmen—That the Parliament agrees with Raymond Briggs, author of the book The Snowman, that it is absolute rubbish to suggest that snowmen are racist and sexist; believes that the paper produced by Dr Tricia Cusack claiming that the snow sculptures are phallic symbols which help oppress women and represent greed, nationalism and capitalism is so out of touch with the innocence and joy experienced by children of all ages who build snowmen; further believes that such a publication is not worthy of academic endorsement, and calls upon children throughout Scotland to build as many snowmen as possible as a message of solidarity to Raymond Briggs.
