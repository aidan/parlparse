 *S1M-2502 Fiona McLeod: Munlochy GM Protest Site—That the Parliament congratulates the Ross and Cromarty Planning Committee of Highland Council on its recent decision to grant planning permission for the Munlochy GM protest site; recognises that the deliberate release of genetically modified organisms into the environment threatens Scotland’s reputation as a producer of quality food, and applauds the protesters for their peaceful vigil which has ensured that this issue remains the focus of public attention.
