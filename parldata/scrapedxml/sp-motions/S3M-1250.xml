*S3M-1250 Patrick Harvie: Scotland’s Community Councils—That the Parliament values the excellent work done by Scotland’s community councils in fostering participative democracy by getting communities active and involved in local decision-making and planning; recognises the vital role played by the Association of Scottish Community Councils in the provision of services and resources to Scotland’s 12,500 community councillors; notes with concern that annual funding awards for the association’s crucial work have fallen dramatically over recent years and that, as a result, the organisation now finds it extremely difficult to carry out its core duties, and calls on the Scottish Government to work with local authorities to develop a strategy to support and develop dynamic, responsive and effective work by community councils and the Association of Scottish Community Councils. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, John Lamont*, Rob Gibson*, Jim Hume*, Mike Pringle*
