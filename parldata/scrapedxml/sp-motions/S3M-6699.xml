*S3M-6699 David Stewart: Retain Fort Georgeâ€”That the Parliament recognises the iconic status of Fort George, near Inverness, home to the Garrison of The Black Watch, 3rd Battalion The Royal Regiment of Scotland; believes that, along with Fort George being an iconic tourist attraction, the 430 soldiers stationed there and their families play an important role in the local community; notes that, in the Strategic Defence and Security Review debate in the House of Commons on 21 June 2010, concerns were raised that Fort George would close as an army barracks; believes that any proposal to close Fort George would have severe economic consequences in Inverness and the surrounding areas as a result of the troops and their families spending less in the local economy, and would welcome the preparation of a survival plan to save Fort George, ensuring that it remains both a working army barracks and a premium league tourist destination.
