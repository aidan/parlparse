 *S2M-2754 Rosie Kane: Exclusion of Communities from the Planning Process—That the Parliament rejects any proposal by the Scottish Executive to restrict public input into the planning process; recognises that the planning process requires change but notes that any change should be in the interest of democracy and inclusion; believes that local knowledge is imperative when planning decisions are being made and is concerned that the Executive is reacting negatively and undemocratically to increased interest by communities in its activities and is openly attempting to curb that access, and demands that the First Minister explain to the public whether, and, if so, why, the Executive has decided to preclude citizens from the decision making process.
