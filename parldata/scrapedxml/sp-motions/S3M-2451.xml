 *S3M-2451 Jamie Hepburn: St Enoch’s Clock, Cumbernauld—That the Parliament notes with concern the apparent disregard shown by London and Regional Properties, owners of the Antonine Centre in Cumbernauld, towards the iconic St Enoch’s Clock, which formerly hung in St Enoch’s train station, Glasgow, and was gifted to the New Town of Cumbernauld; believes that the clock is a local symbol deserving of a more prominent location within the shopping mall, and praises the efforts of the Cumbernauld and Kilsyth branch of the Young Scots for Independence in campaigning on this issue.
