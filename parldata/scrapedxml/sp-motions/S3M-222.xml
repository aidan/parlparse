 *S3M-222 Ken Macintosh: Welcome for the Cervical Cancer Vaccine—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation to recommend a new vaccination programme against the human papilloma virus (HPV), which is responsible for around 70% of cases of cervical cancer; further welcomes the Scottish Executive’s proposals to introduce this vaccination for girls aged 12 to 13 by autumn 2008; notes with concern that almost 3,000 women are diagnosed with and 1,000 women die from cervical cancer in the United Kingdom each year; recognises the huge long-term benefits to be had though vaccination not only in reducing deaths but in also reducing the number of colposcopies, reducing the number of abnormal smears and reducing the number of people requiring treatment for genital warts; also recognises however that the vaccine will not prevent all cases of cervical cancer; therefore believes that the cervical cancer screening programme should be continued and that further action should be taken to increase the take-up of screening in more deprived areas, among ethnic minority groups and among women with learning difficulties; further believes that this will improve early detection and allow earlier treatment of this disease, and welcomes the work of charities such as Jo’s Trust, Cancerbackup and Cancer Research UK, among others, in supporting patients with cervical cancer and their families and in counselling the thousands more women who worry about their health following an abnormal smear result.
