*S2M-2217 David Mundell: New Nuclear Power Stations in Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the comments of the Deputy Minister for Enterprise and Lifelong Learning in the Sunday Herald on 26 December 2004 calling for a debate on the future role for nuclear power as an energy source in Scotland; welcomes the earlier comments by the Secretary of State for Scotland stating that new nuclear power stations in Scotland had not been ruled out by Her Majesty’s Government; believes that new nuclear power stations would provide Scotland with a safe and secure energy supply in the future and mitigate the prospect of an energy gap leading to power cuts and blackouts; calls on the Scottish Executive to clarify its policy on future nuclear development in Scotland, and notes the suitability of the Chapelcross site near Annan for the location of a new nuclear power station.
