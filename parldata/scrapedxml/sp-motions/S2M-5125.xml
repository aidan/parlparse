*S2M-5125 Alex Neil: Escalating Costs of the 2012 Olympic Games—That the Parliament notes that the organisers of the 2012 London Olympics are likely to be hit with a VAT bill on top of the cost of preparing for the games, originally estimated at £2.4 billion and recently estimated at closer to £5 billion; notes that this VAT bill, which Tessa Jowell MP has admitted was not factored into the original costs, may be around £250 million alone; believes that Scottish charitable causes and grassroots sport should not be affected by either the increase in cost or the unexpected VAT bill by facing further displacement of lottery monies to contribute to these costs, and calls on the Scottish Executive to intimate this position clearly to both the organisers of the 2012 London Olympics and Her Majesty’s Government.
