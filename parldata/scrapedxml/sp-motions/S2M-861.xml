 *S2M-861# Mark Ballard: Use of Electoral Register in Edinburgh Referendum on Congestion Charging-That the Parliament considers that the full electoral roll should be made available to the City of Edinburgh Council for use exclusively in a referendum on congestion charging, in order to save Edinburgh taxpayers an estimated £100,000 in encouraging residents who have opted out of the published electoral register to participate in the referendum; notes the legal decision of R. (on the application of Robertson) v Wakefield MDC, that the use of electoral rolls for such referenda may be inappropriate under the current legislation, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should consult with the Secretary of State for Scotland and Her Majesty's Government to seek a legislative dispensation to use the full electoral roll for a congestion charging referendum in Edinburgh.
