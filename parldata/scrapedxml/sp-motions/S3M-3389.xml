*S3M-3389 Malcolm Chisholm: North Edinburgh Fuel Poverty Action Group—That the Parliament welcomes the launch of the campaign by North Edinburgh Fuel Poverty Action Group (NEFPAG), supported by North Edinburgh Trust, calling for an end to the unjust practice by energy suppliers of charging customers using prepayment meters (PPM) more for their gas and electricity than customers paying by direct debit or online; notes that in north Edinburgh a PPM user can pay up to £340 more each year than a customer using other payment methods, and calls on all suppliers to take notice of the NEFPAG campaign and reduce the prices paid by PPM customers to those paid by direct debit customers or lower.
