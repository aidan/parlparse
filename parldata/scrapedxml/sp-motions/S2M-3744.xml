*S2M-3744# Christine May: Safer Communities and Neighbourhoods—That the Parliament recognises the many opportunities to improve community safety provided under the Antisocial Behaviour etc. (Scotland) Act 2004 and other initiatives, such as Safer Routes to School; congratulates community safety partnerships, such as that in Fife, for the innovative ways in which they have developed local schemes; notes that initiatives, such as Fife’s Time2Act Safer Neighbourhoods campaign, cover a wide range of community safety matters such as safety of older people, women’s personal safety, reduction in domestic violence, drink driving and drunk pedestrians, safety of children and young people, safer town centres and neighbourhoods and support for victims of crime and anti-social behaviour; acknowledges the work done by public sector staff, uniformed services and many members of local communities to develop and support such schemes; believes that there is further scope for developments in this area, and considers that all concerned should continue to work together to make Scotland’s communities safer.
