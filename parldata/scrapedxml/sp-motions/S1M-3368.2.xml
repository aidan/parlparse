 *S1M-3368.2 Mr John McAllion: Scotland's Links with the United States of America—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3368) in the name of Mr Jim Wallace, insert at end "however, and in view of these strong links with the USA, expresses its deepest possible concern over the increasingly isolationist stance of the USA on international issues concerning the environment, justice, trade and international relations, particularly in relation to Iraq; opposes the planned invasion and aerial bombardment of Iraq in recognition of the fact that, as in Afghanistan, the victims of such action will be thousands of ordinary men, women and children, completely unconnected to the odious regime of Saddam Hussein; states its opposition to waging any further war on Iraq based on current information and believes that the policy of sanctions imposed over the last 11 years has harmed Iraqi children; believes that the current energy deployed aggressively should be re-deployed into genuine diplomacy to seek peaceful solutions to disagreements based on mutual respect; considers that the achievement of a viable Palestinian state would represent the most significant contribution towards peace throughout the Middle East, and finally believes that Scotland’s links with the USA can only remain meaningful and sincere if it has the courage to express such misgivings over US international policy when required."
