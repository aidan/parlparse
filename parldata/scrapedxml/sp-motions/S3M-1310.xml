*S3M-1310# Sandra White: Glasgow Task Force—That the Parliament notes with serious concern the report by the Centre of Social Justice, published on 5 February 2008, showing that Glasgow has 170 teenage gangs, the same as London, with a population one-sixth of the size; acknowledges the Federation of Small Businesses Scotland’s FSB Index of Success 2007 which showed that Glasgow had the poorest rating for education, health, employment and inequality of all the 32 local authority areas in Scotland and the policy recommendations of the report highlighting the need for cross-party support at national and local level in order to take forward crucial policies and address the serious problems facing Glasgow, and hopes that this new report will serve as a catalyst for all parties to support the establishment of a special task force for Glasgow to tackle such inequality.
