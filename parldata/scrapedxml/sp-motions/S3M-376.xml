 *S3M-376# John Lamont: Coldingham Village Hallâ€”That the Parliament congratulates those involved in the redevelopment of Coldingham Village Hall and in its participation in the 2007 Edinburgh Festival Fringe; recognises the value and importance of village halls to rural Scotland; supports the innovative and dynamic ways that village halls use to provide high class public services for their communities; considers that greater support should be provided to village hall facilities in rural Scotland and similar initiatives to that taken up by Coldingham Village Hall encouraged; believes that water rate relief charges should be extended beyond 2010 to prevent discrimination against low users, and wishes Coldingham Village Hall and all other halls in Roxburghshire and Berwickshire the best of success for the future.
