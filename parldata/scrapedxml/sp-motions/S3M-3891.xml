 *S3M-3891 Alex Johnstone: Return of 45 Commando Royal Marinesâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the return of the Arbroath-based 45 Commando Royal Marines from its six-month tour of duty in Afghanistan; commends the professionalism of the marines in the face of extraordinary adversity; believes that the first time they returned from Afghanistan they were met by a Westminster cabinet minister and a rear admiral; expresses its disgust that on their return on 6 April 2009 no such welcome awaited them, that they were forced to disembark at the furthest possible point from the airport terminal, had to unload the cargo from the plane themselves, were left sitting on the grass until transport came to take them to the terminal, were not allowed to use the airport terminal where their families were waiting to welcome them home but were forced to use a back entrance away from other people and that no assistance was provided to help families find their loved ones; condemns the way that these troops were treated, in light of their heroic conduct and losses, and demands that when troops return from combat areas they are met and treated appropriately.
