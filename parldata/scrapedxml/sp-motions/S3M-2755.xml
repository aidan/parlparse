*S3M-2755 Jim Hume: New Lanark World Heritage Site—That the Parliament notes the educational, historical and economic importance of New Lanark World Heritage Site as one of Scotland’s top attraction sites, which receives over 400,000 visitors each year; recognises the excellent work carried out by the New Lanark Trust in achieving world heritage site status in 2001 following the restoration and development of the New Lanark village, building on the principles of philanthropist Robert Owen’s own campaign for a fairer and better society; further recognises the importance of the trust’s work not only in preserving New Lanark as a sustainable community with a resident population, but also in creating new opportunities for employment; deeply regrets the recent lack of grant money available on which the trust has been so reliant in previous years; recognises the potential threat this poses for the future of the trust’s work in the continued development of the site, and calls on the Scottish Government to take the steps necessary to safeguard the future of this educationally, historically and economically vital world heritage site.
