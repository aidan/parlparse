 *S1M-2322 Hugh Henry: Have a Heart Paisley-That the Parliament notes the report by the Coronary Heart Disease/Stroke Task Force, which concluded that the rate of heart disease deaths in Scotland had dropped by 40% in the past 10 years; recognises the work of 'Have a Heart Paisley' which has the aim of reducing heart disease and promoting healthier and longer lives for the residents of Paisley; acknowledges that the project has not only brought the community together but also health professionals and local organisations, working in partnership for a lasting improvement in the health and well being of everyone in Paisley, and believes that the Scottish Executive could learn from 'Have a Heart Paisley' and use the project as a benchmark for other initiatives to help prevent heart disease throughout Scotland.
