 S3M-3573 Hugh Henry: The Post Office, A People’s Bank—That the Parliament notes the confidence that the public has in the Post Office, particularly in this period of financial uncertainty; further notes the value of post offices in communities across Scotland; believes that, in providing a further range of financial services, the Post Office could assist many of those whom the banks do not serve, and further believes that, by becoming a people’s bank, the Post Office could make a significant contribution to social inclusion and financial stability in Scotland.
