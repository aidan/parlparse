*S1M-2716 Richard Lochhead: Scottish Executive Policy on Advertising—That the Parliament notes the current recruitment advertising policy of the Scottish Executive that has seen over £1 million spent in the Scotsman and Herald newspapers from 1998 to 2001 compared to barely £100,000 in the Courier and Press and Journal; is concerned that the dissemination of information on job availability with the Scottish Executive may not reach many able candidates outwith the central belt, particularly since the Press and Journal and Courier readerships are on a par with the Scotsman and Herald; further notes that more has been spent advertising vacancies in London based newspapers than in newspapers in the north east of Scotland and that posts where the specialism exists in this area, such as the Chief Executive of the Fisheries Research Service, have not been advertised in north east newspapers, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review its current policy to ensure that people from across all of Scotland learn about available posts.
