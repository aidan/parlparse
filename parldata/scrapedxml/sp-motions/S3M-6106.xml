 *S3M-6106 Patrick Harvie: Exhibition on Israeli Technology—That the Parliament notes the intended exhibition at Holyrood by the organisation, Scottish Friends of Israel, due to take place in the last week of April 2010, which will aim to promote Israel’s contribution to medicine, science and technology; recognises the deep feelings of anger that exist at the record of the Israeli Government’s treatment of Palestinians over decades and in particular the military action taken in recent years; is concerned that the planned exhibition could give the false impression that the Scottish Parliament as a body condones the record of the Israeli Government or wishes to promote the interests of that government; believes that the prolonged, brutal and unacceptable mistreatment of the Palestinians should be the central issue that the Parliament addresses in any events that relate to the Israel/Palestine situation, and invites those involved in organising the exhibition to reconsider their decision.
