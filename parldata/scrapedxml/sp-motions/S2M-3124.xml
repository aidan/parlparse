 *S2M-3124 Mr Mark Ruskell: GM Superweedsâ€”That the Parliament is shocked, but not surprised, at the news that cross-fertilisation between GM oilseed rape and a distantly related plant, charlock, has resulted in herbicide-resistant superweeds in a field used for GM crop trials; notes that the accidental development of such superweeds was dismissed as impossible by UK Government scientists and the biotechnology industry prior to the trials taking place; acknowledges the many concerns raised, also in advance of the GM crop trials, that such horizontal gene transfer and the resulting emergence of superweeds was inevitable and that conducting these trials in the open would lead to irreversible genetic contamination of the environment, and calls on the Scottish Executive, in light of this evidence, to rule out any future releases of GMOs into the environment.
