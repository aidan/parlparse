*S3M-2664 Des McNulty: A Fare Deal—That the Parliament notes the Fare Deal campaign, which is asking that demand-responsive community transport schemes, such as Dial-a-Bus or Ring ‘n’ Ride, where elderly and disabled people can book a place on a bus that will pick them up and take them to their destination, be included in the national concessionary travel scheme; commends Help the Aged in Scotland, Capability Scotland, Community Transport Association Scotland, Age Concern Scotland, Leonard Cheshire Disability, Guide Dogs, RNID Scotland, Scottish Disability Equality Forum, Glasgow Disability Alliance, Include Scotland, RNIB Scotland and the WRVS for their work in launching the campaign, and urges the Scottish Government to extend the national concessionary travel scheme to include demand-responsive community transport as an effective means of making transport more accessible to disabled people.
