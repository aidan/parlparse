 *S3M-1086 Shirley-Anne Somerville: End Edinburgh’s Housing Debt—That the Parliament recognises the chronic shortage of affordable housing in Edinburgh as illustrated by the recent 1,024 applications to rent a two-bedroom property in Drumbrae; notes that there have been 134,297 homes lost from the social rented sector in Scotland through the right to buy in the last 10 years and welcomes the Scottish Government’s plans to encourage and safeguard new social housing; believes that the £280 million housing debt faced by the City of Edinburgh Council acts as a significant impediment to investment in affordable housing; notes that the UK Government’s offer to write off Edinburgh’s housing debt was withdrawn when tenants voted against stock transfer in 2005; further notes that the £57 billion made available by HM Treasury to Northern Rock could have written off Edinburgh’s housing debt 200 times over, and calls on the Chancellor of the Exchequer finally to end this inequity for Edinburgh, write off the debt, help alleviate the shortage of housing and improve growth in Scotland’s capital.
