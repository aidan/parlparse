S2M-5221 Stewart Stevenson: New Deer Wins Calor Scottish Community of the Year 2006—That the Parliament congratulates community activists in New Deer on their winning the Calor Scottish Community of the Year 2006 award; in particular commends their success in persuading the Royal Bank of Scotland to take over their local bank after the Clydesdale Bank withdrew from the village; notes that, with Whitehill’s previous victory, this is twice in five years that Banff and Buchan communities have won this prestigeous award, and commends communities across Scotland which are taking power into their own hands.
