*S2M-5191# Helen Eadie: BP Fails the People of Scotland—That the Parliament congratulates Fife Constabulary for its test purchasing of alcohol initiative at the BP garage in Dalgety Bay; applauds the efforts of Fife Police in undertaking this work in its efforts to identify retailers who sell to under-age drinkers; recognises the distress of local families who have been seriously affected by the impact of under-age drinkers in the town; further recognises that there is rising public and political alarm at increased alcohol consumption, especially in respect of under-age drinkers, binge drinking and public disorder and violence; notes that alcohol has recently been designated by the World Health Organization as a major global determinant of ill-health, with alcohol-related problems representing about 9% of the disease burden in Europe; further notes that the societal cost of alcohol abuse is colossal, exceeding £20 billion annually in the United Kingdom, to say nothing of the cost of family and social disruption, criminality and ill health; notes with dismay and condemns the actions of BP in failing to train and support its local outlet staff appropriately and further failing to support Fife Constabulary in this groundbreaking initiative, and hopes that all car users in the country will note the actions of BP when deciding which supplier of petrol to use. Supported by: Ms Rosemary Byrne*, Michael McMahon*, Robin Harper*, Phil Gallie*
