 *S1M-3400# Mr John McAllion: Whitfield-That the Parliament congratulates the people of Whitfield in Dundee for their outstanding efforts in regenerating their community over the last few years; notes that Whitfield, like many other parts of Scotland, has its fair share of problems but recognises the great progress made by community-based organisations; however, further notes the Save the Children report, The Well-being of Children in the UK, that highlights the persistence of poverty and other problems in parts of the estate; regrets that the Whitfield Partnership was wound up by the Scotland Office without a proper exit strategy, and believes that the Scottish Executive and Her Majesty's Government should redouble their efforts to eradicate child poverty from Whitfield and every other community in Scotland.
