*S1M-2243# Johann Lamont: Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy-That the Parliament notes the prevalence of the mainly inherited heart disease hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) which affects one in 500 of the population and is the number one cause of sudden death among under 25-year-olds; congratulates the Cardiomyopathy Association on its role in highlighting the condition and acknowledges the work of those involved in the association who have often suffered the loss of a family member because of HCM; further notes the Cardiomyopathy Association's campaign to secure screening by electrocardiogram and echo ultrasound of all first degree relatives of those who die as a result of this condition, and believes that the Scottish Executive, in partnership with the Health and Community Care Committee, the National Health Service and relevant groups working in this field, should consider how best those suffering from this condition might be identified and given access to the appropriate treatment.
