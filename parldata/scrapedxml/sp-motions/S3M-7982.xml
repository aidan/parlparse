*S3M-7982 Bob Doris: Irish Ethnicity and the 2011 Censusâ€”That the Parliament acknowledges that the 2011 census will be the first to allow one to record ethnicity as well as nationality; acknowledges the sizeable Irish community in Scotland and the good work that it considers that it does in many local communities, and encourages all Scots of Irish descent to tick not only the Scottish nationality option proudly but also the Irish ethnicity option and to be proud of what is seen as this multicultural and diverse Scotland in which everybody is proud to live and work.
