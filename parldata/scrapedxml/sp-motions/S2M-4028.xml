*S2M-4028 Colin Fox: Hearts and Hibs Semi-Final Game in Edinburgh—That the Parliament notes that the semi-final draw for the 2006 Scottish Cup sees Hearts playing Hibs in the first all-Edinburgh semi-final for over 100 years; urges the Scottish Football Association (SFA) to stage the match in Edinburgh; believes that Murrayfield Stadium would be an ideal venue for the tie; further believes that fans of both sides would welcome such a decision and that the time and money saved by 60,000 people travelling through to Glasgow would be better spent in making the day a truly remarkable one for fans in the Lothians and east of Scotland, and urges the SFA to take into account the views of the people who matter most, the fans of Hearts and Hibs, and let democracy have its day.
