*S3M-948 Hugh O’Donnell: RSPB Scotland Volunteer and Farmer Alliance—That the Parliament commends the RSPB Scotland Volunteer and Farmer Alliance (V&amp;FA), developed to help reverse the decline of farmland bird populations by working together with volunteers and farmers, which provides farmers with a free survey, undertaken by RSPB volunteers, of the birds breeding on their land; applauds the fact that in Scotland 400 farms and 200 volunteers have participated in surveys since 2002; recognises that, by providing farmers with a free survey of the birds present on their farm and their requirements, the project demonstrates the success of agri-environment schemes and helps to deliver further conservation management successes for farmland birds on the ground, by putting farmers who express an interest in touch with professional advisers who can suggest ways in which to enhance farmland for wild birds, and congratulates all those who have helped set up and maintain the project and those who have participated in it.
