*S3M-1573 Marilyn Livingstone: Opportunities and Success for Young Women in YWCA Scotland—That the Parliament congratulates YWCA Scotland President, Kirsty Kelly, on her election to the YWCA World Board; notes that Kirsty, from Kinghorn in Fife, is still in her early twenties; recognises that this is a huge personal achievement and honour for Kirsty, as well as recognition for the work of YWCA Scotland in developing young women’s leadership; further notes that Kirsty’s election means that a member of YWCA Scotland has held a leadership place at world level for three consecutive terms, as her predecessor, Julie Dickson was from Kirkcaldy and served two terms at this level, and considers it particularly relevant, as we celebrate International Women’s Day, to recognise these young women who have been great ambassadors for Scotland and exemplars of the life changing opportunities available in the YWCA.
