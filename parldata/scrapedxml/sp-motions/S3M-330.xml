*S3M-330 Stefan Tymkewycz: Dr Elsie Inglis (1864-1917) Edinburgh Pioneer of Social and War Medicine—That the Parliament welcomes the opening of the travelling exhibition, Dr Elsie Inglis (1864-1917) Edinburgh Pioneer of Social and War Medicine; recognises the remarkable contribution of Dr Inglis both to the progression of women’s medical care in Edinburgh, where she founded a maternity hospital and midwifery resource centre for the poor, and in relation to her outstanding wartime achievements as founder of the Scottish Women’s Hospitals Service, setting up hospital units staffed by female volunteers tending to frontline soldiers; notes that Serbia has at least 10 monuments commemorating the work of the brave women of the Scottish Women’s Hospital Service; regrets that Dr Elsie Inglis is still relatively unknown in her home city of Edinburgh, and believes that greater recognition and commemoration of her heroic achievements is long overdue.
