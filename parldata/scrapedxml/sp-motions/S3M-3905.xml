 *S3M-3905 Malcolm Chisholm: Citadel Youth Centre and Intergenerational Workâ€”That the Parliament congratulates the Citadel Youth Centre in Leith on winning a substantial award from the Big Lottery Fund to promote intergenerational work; acknowledges the superb work that the centre has been doing with young people for very many years; welcomes this important new initiative, which will bring together younger and older people to reduce intergenerational conflict and promote community cohesion through a skills sharing and hobby programme, and supports the development of other similar programmes across Scotland to the mutual advantage of older and younger people.
