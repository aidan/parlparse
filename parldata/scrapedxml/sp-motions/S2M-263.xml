*S2M-263 Shiona Baird: Support for Fuel Cell Technology-That the Parliament congratulates SiGEN on the success of the BOC Gh2ost in the Shell Eco-Marathon in Alford, Aberdeenshire, travelling for 1,200 miles on one gallon of hydrogen; calls upon the Scottish Executive to provide greater support for all forms of renewable energy research; agrees with David McGrath, the managing director of SiGEN, that oil companies should move towards becoming energy companies, investing a substantial proportion of their profits in renewables, and recognises that Scotland, as a centre of excellence in renewables research with its pool of engineering expertise, will only become a world leader in this field if the Executive plays a full part in financing and integrating efforts in this direction.
