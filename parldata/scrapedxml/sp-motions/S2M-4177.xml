*S2M-4177 Richard Baker: Health and Safety at Workâ€”That the Parliament notes the concerns of Aberdeen City Council that there is a need for greater engagement by the Parliament in issues relating to health and safety in Scotland; notes that, while health and safety legislation and its enforcement are reserved to Westminster, the Scottish Executive has a role in the promotion of health and safety, and urges the Parliament and Executive to explore ways in which a forum can be established for the discussion of ongoing issues relating to health and safety in the workplace.
