*S3M-3350 Jamie Hepburn: 90th Anniversary of George Square’s Bloody Friday—That the Parliament notes that 31 January 2009 is the 90th anniversary of the congregation of tens of thousands of striking workers in George Square, Glasgow, organised by the Scottish Trades Union Congress and the Clyde Workers’ Committee, which led to a confrontation between the workers and the authorities of the time, an event that became known as Bloody Friday; recalls that the then UK Government hugely overreacted to these events by sending troops and tanks from England onto the streets of Glasgow while locking local troops into the Maryhill Barracks for fear that they might side with the striking workers; further notes that this was one of the seminal events of the Red Clydeside movement; salutes the memory of the striking workers, whose actions contributed to the eventual securing of important guarantees of working conditions and practices; believes that the Red Clydeside experience has continued to influence politics in Scotland to the present day, and further believes that a greater awareness of this period of history should be fostered among Scotland’s wider population.
