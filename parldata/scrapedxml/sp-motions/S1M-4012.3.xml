*S1M-4012.3 Tommy Sheridan: The Current International Situation—As an amendment to motion (S1M-4012) in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from second "no" to end and insert "weapons inspectors must be given sufficient time to effect disarmament within Iraq, but as part of a worldwide campaign of disarmament including Israel, Pakistan, India, Great Britain, the United States of America, China, Russia and other states in possession of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction; recognises the increased threat of global dominance imposed by the USA on the basis of economic and military control throughout the globe and regrets the increasingly aggressive statements and actions by the USA in pursuit of its stated desire to build a new American empire in the 21st Century; deplores the fact that 300,000 children a day die from preventable diseases like malaria, tuberculosis and cholera, all products of poverty; further believes therefore that all-out war on poverty and inequality throughout the world should be the United Nations’ priority and that such a war would be the most effective assault on terrorism and the causes of terrorism throughout the Middle East and the world, and further supports those citizens of Scotland committed to engaging in peaceful civil disobedience in opposition to war with Iraq, should Her Majesty’s Government support such an illegal, immoral and unjust action."
