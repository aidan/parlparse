*S3M-3591 Bob Doris: Rebuilding the Botany—That the Parliament notes that, eight years ago, tenants in the Botany area in Maryhill were decanted from their homes with the promise of returning to new-build homes within a few years; recognises the frustration of tenants and the local housing association at the delays in delivering these homes; therefore congratulates in particular Willy Briody and Donna Birrell, of Maryhill Housing Association, and Patricia Wilson, the tenant chair of the Botany tenants’ consultation group, in overcoming the many financial and logistical problems faced in pursuing delivery of these new homes, and also congratulates them on the ground-breaking ceremony, held on 4 March 2009, marking the start of work to deliver 35 new-build homes to tenants.
