*S3M-2840 John Scott: Successor to the Post Office Card Account—That the Parliament notes that no decision has yet been announced by Her Majesty’s Government on which company will operate the replacement for the Post Office card account, known as the POCA2, from 2010; believes that the existing post office network is the most appropriate vehicle for the provision of the POCA2; further believes that retaining the successor to the Post Office card account within the Post Office is vital to the continued viability of Scotland’s post office network, particularly in rural and more remote areas and areas of high social deprivation, and therefore urges Her Majesty’s Government to award the POCA2 to the Post Office.
