 *S3M-4034 Sandra White: Glasgow Community Service Workers—That the Parliament notes with concern the ongoing strike by community service workers in Glasgow, which remains unresolved after almost five months and which has led to Glasgow City Council failing in its statutory duty to implement community service orders; criticises Glasgow City Council for its refusal to seek independent arbitration to end the dispute and for the hardship and anxiety being suffered by the community service workers and their families; believes that Glasgow City Council’s thinly veiled threat to outsource the work will only serve to further inflame the situation, and urges Glasgow City Council to enter into meaningful discussion with the workers through independent arbitration. Supported by: Gil Paterson*, Michael Matheson*, Kenneth Gibson*, Bill Kidd*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Stuart McMillan*
