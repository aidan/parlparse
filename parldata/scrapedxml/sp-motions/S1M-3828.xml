 *S1M-3828 Christine Grahame: Cockenzie House—That the Parliament notes with concern the threatened and imminent closure of Cockenzie House in Cockenzie, a private nursing home currently with 56 residents aged from 50 to 90, due to persistent under-funding by the local authority; further notes that by 31 March 2003 it is probable that those 56 frail people will lose what is now their home and that this is yet another example of the loss of local provision for the frail and elderly, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to take immediate steps nationwide to provide urgent funding in the interests of those who are our most vulnerable citizens.
