*S2M-3355# Maureen Macmillan: Drink Driving in the Highlands—That the Parliament notes with concern the continued high incidence of drink driving offences in the Northern Constabulary area and, in particular, the substantial increase in the statistics for driving while unfit through drink or drugs; notes that in one recent 19-day period there were 19 arrests for drink driving in the Ross, Cromarty and Skye Command area alone; further notes that the profile of drink drivers tends to be middle-aged rather than young, and believes that the Scottish Executive should consider how it can better reinforce the message that drink driving is a criminal offence which can result in severe injury and loss of life. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
