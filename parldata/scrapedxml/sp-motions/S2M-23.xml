*S2M-23 Carolyn Leckie: Nursery Nurses Regrading—That the Parliament supports the nursery nurses in their campaign for the regrading of their annual pay from a current maximum possible annual salary of £13,800 to £17,000 in recognition of the crucial expertise and training required to provide pre-school children with education and social skills; recognises that nursery nurses represent a low-paid female workforce whose skills have been undervalued for far too long, and calls on COSLA to agree to the nursery nurses’ justified regrading claim which UNISON has been pursuing on behalf of nursery nurses for almost two years.
