 *S2M-1536.2# Elaine Smith: Better Access to Small Claims and Summary Cause Procedures—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1536) in the name of Mr John Home Robertson, leave out from first "notes" to end and insert "is concerned that any increase to the threshold for access to small claims and summary cause proceedings would exclude the vast majority of sheriff court litigants from the civil legal aid system to the detriment of the poorest and most vulnerable members of society; believes that the Scottish Consumer Council’s proposal to increase limits to £5,000 and £15,000 for small claims and summary cause respectively is ill-considered, would result in a collapse of "no win no fee" services for low- and modest-income citizens and would deny access to justice for law centre clients with claims of a modest value within the field of housing and social welfare law; further notes that the Scottish Consumer Council as a statutory appointed body representing the interests of all consumers, including small businesses and well-off litigants, cannot represent in any meaningful sense the interests of disadvantaged pursuers and defenders, and considers that the Scottish Executive should initiate a comprehensive public consultation on the effects of proposals to increase jurisdictional limits before taking any further action."
