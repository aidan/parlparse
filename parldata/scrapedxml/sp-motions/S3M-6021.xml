 *S3M-6021 Jim Tolson: Operation Safe Night—That the Parliament congratulates the Dunfermline Business Improvement District company, Dunfermline Delivers, on successfully establishing Scotland’s first ever Operation Safe Night initiative to promote a safe, welcoming and enjoyable atmosphere in Dunfermline’s city centre; considers that there is valuable partnership working between Fife Constabulary, Taxi Marshals, Street Pastors, Neighbourhood Watch, the Fife Alcohol Partnership Project, Pub Watch and St Andrews Ambulance, and believes that the project is now well established, helping to attract visitors from other locations and is an important way to boost Dunfermline’s night time economy.
