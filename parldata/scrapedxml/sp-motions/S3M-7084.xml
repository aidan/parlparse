*S3M-7084 Mr Frank McAveety: Congratulations to St Joan of Arc School—That the Parliament recognises the achievement of St Joan of Arc School in the Tollcross area of Glasgow in being the first secondary school in Glasgow to achieve the permanent Eco-school Award as part of the Green Flag initiative; considers that there has been a tremendous commitment to, and passion for, the project over the past eight years by the school’s staff and students, and is confident that the school will serve as an example for others in the area to follow and that this award demonstrates a commitment to the sustainability of the environment.
