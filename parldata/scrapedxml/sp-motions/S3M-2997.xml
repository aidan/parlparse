*S3M-2997 Alasdair Allan: Iolaire Disaster—That the Parliament notes that 1 January 2009 is the 90th anniversary of the tragic sinking of HMY Iolaire, which sank after hitting the Beasts of Holm rock only a mile away from the safety of Stornoway harbour at 1.55 am on New Year’s Day 1919 and only a few dozen yards from the safety of the shore; notes that the official death toll was 205 of the 284 crew and naval ratings on board who were returning from serving in World War 1; realises that this represented a huge loss of life after the hundreds of islanders who had already been lost in WW1, and recognises that this is one of the most devastating ever losses of life in UK waters in peacetime and that around 40 of the men who survived owed that survival to the courage of John F MacLeod from the Ness area of Lewis who managed to swim ashore carrying a line, which enabled a number of men who might otherwise have perished to drag themselves ashore.
