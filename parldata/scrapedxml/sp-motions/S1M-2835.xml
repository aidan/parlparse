*S1M-2835 Mr Adam Ingram: Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder—That the Parliament notes with concern the rise in the number of children being prescribed methylphenidates, in particular Ritalin, for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; further notes the lack of impartial research into both the use of such drugs in controlling children and the diagnosis and treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and supports the immediate setting up of an independent research project into attention deficit hyperactivity disorder as a diagnosis and the use of methylphenidates in treatment.
