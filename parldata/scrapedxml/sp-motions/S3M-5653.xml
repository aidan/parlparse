*S3M-5653 Bob Doris: Getgo and Wyndford—That the Parliament congratulates Getgo Glasgow and the Wyndford community on their successful bid at the regional finals of the Sustain our Nation competition, including a cash prize of £10,000 for their Green Gorillaz proposal; wishes the project further success at the finals in London on 17 February 2010 and commends the efforts of the postgraduate students at Glasgow School of Art and the Wyndford residents who are giving freely of time and effort to promote the community; applauds the project’s emphasis on community cohesion and intergenerational activities; considers that residents have rallied to fight for the interests of their community as a direct result of the closure of the Wyndford and St Gregory’s primary schools in 2009 against the overwhelming will of the local community, and believes that, following initiatives like Getgo and the recent formation of the Wyndford Community Council, residents in Wyndford will succeed in improving their area and that they are providing a model for grassroots regeneration that could be applied to numerous other communities.
