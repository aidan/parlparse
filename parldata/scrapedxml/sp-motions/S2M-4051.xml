 *S2M-4051 Mr Frank McAveety: Sportscotland—That the Parliament calls on the Scottish Executive to reach a decision regarding the relocation of the headquarters of the national sport agency, sportscotland; believes that the new headquarters should be based in the national sports arena being built in Glasgow; recognises that Glasgow has a well-earned reputation as a city of sport; believes that the relocation would strengthen Scotland’s bid for the 2014 Commonwealth Games; further believes that the new headquarters could potentially be part of a wider regeneration strategy; notes that this relocation would enable sportscotland to maximise its Sport 21 objectives to increase participation and challenge the health statistics of Scotland; further notes that the emphatic report by PMP Consultants, naming Glasgow’s east end as the best place for the new sportscotland headquarters, should be upheld, and finally believes that creating a "hub of sport" with the national arena, the headquarters and many of sports’ governing bodies would be of immense benefit in developing Scotland’s sporting future.
