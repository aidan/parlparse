*S2M-5557 Maureen Macmillan: CAB Blended Learning—That the Parliament congratulates the CAB service on the launch of its innovative Blended Learning Project in the Highlands and Islands; notes that this three-year pilot will use interactive DVDs and e-mentoring to make training more accessible, more flexible and more enjoyable for volunteers, and considers that such projects are vital to ensure that people in rural areas, those with caring responsibilities and those with different patterns of work can still contribute their expertise and enthusiasm to important local voluntary services.
