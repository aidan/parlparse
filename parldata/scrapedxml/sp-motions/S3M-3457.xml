*S3M-3457 Michael Matheson: Falkirk Council’s Unnecessary Cuts on Young and Vulnerable—That the Parliament notes that the Labour/Tory administration of Falkirk Council has set its budget for 2009-10; welcomes its decision to freeze the council tax; is appalled, however, at its cuts that fall on the young and vulnerable, resulting in school meals rising by 25p per pupil per day, the cost of childcare places up by 15p per hour, meals on wheels up 20p per meal, the cost of swimming up and the cost of cremations up by £35, and calls on the Labour/Tory administration to re-evaluate these charges at the earliest opportunity.
