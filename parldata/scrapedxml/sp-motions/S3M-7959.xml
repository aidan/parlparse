 *S3M-7959 Liam McArthur: Northern Constabulary Officers and Staff Reject Single Police Force—That the Parliament considers overwhelming the 86.6% of Northern Constabulary officers and staff who, in responding to an internal survey, voted against the proposal to create a single police force for Scotland; further notes that the chief constable of the Northern Constabulary has made it clear that his professional view is that the retention of the locally accountable police force for the Highlands and Islands is in the best interests of the communities that the force serves, and believes that this clear message of opposition to a single force, coming from those who work on the frontline of policing in the largest geographical force in the United Kingdom, needs to be listened to by those who believe that Scotland’s police are best controlled from a single headquarters in the central belt.
