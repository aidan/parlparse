 *S2M-4237 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Animal Defenders Internationalâ€”That the Parliament commends the work of Animal Defenders International in collecting video evidence of the abnormal behaviour and suffering of animals in travelling circuses; notes that this shows that travelling circuses cannot adequately provide for the basic welfare needs of their animals and as such fail the welfare test of the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Bill; notes that circus animals, whether travelling or not, spend excessive periods of time shut in transporters and are forced to live in temporary facilities lacking appropriate space and environmental enrichment and often in inappropriate groupings of animals; further notes that violence is commonplace and part of the circus culture, that no other working animals spend such a long time, normally at least eight months, in temporary mobile accommodation, thus making animal transport regulations difficult to police and enforce and that the arrangements for circus animals are entirely different from the higher quality accommodation and transport arrangements of animals being transported for racing, horse shows, dog shows and similar events; welcomes the recent announcement made by the Scottish Executive to ban certain species of animals in circuses; considers that the Animal Health and Welfare (Scotland) Bill should ban the use of all animals in circuses, as wild and domestic animals suffer equally, and calls for the end of the use of violence to train animals for the purposes of entertainment.
