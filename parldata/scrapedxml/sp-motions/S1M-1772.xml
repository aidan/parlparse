*S1M-1772 Michael Russell: Scottish Opera—That the Parliament notes the answer to question S1W-14238 which was provided on Friday 16th March, the day that the question was lodged; further notes that the reply to this question as provided to the Education, Culture and Sport Committee by the former Minister for Environment, Sport and Culture indicates that the question was not due for public answer until 30 March, and was not due to be considered by the Minister until 23 March; expresses concern that such a controversial matter as the provision of an extra £1.9 million in grant aid for Scottish Opera in the current financial year which has less than two weeks to run, and an additional £1 million each year for the next three years to the company, has been handled in what appears to be a rushed and irregular manner in the final days of the Minister’s career in government, and calls upon the First Minister to suspend payment of any additional money to Scottish Opera pending an inquiry into the circumstances of the grant and its announcement and, in his new capacity as the Cabinet Minister with responsibility for the arts and culture, to appear before the Education, Culture and Sport committee to answer questions on the decision and on the funding and operation of Scottish Opera which has now received £4 million in emergency aid in less than 16 months and which appears to be in blatant contempt of the key unanimous cross party recommendation of the Education, Culture and Sport committee’s report into the National Companies published in February 2000 which stated "Any solution to Scottish Opera’s financial difficulties must be accompanied by a recognition by the new board that the pursuit of excellence must be balanced against appropriate financial control".
