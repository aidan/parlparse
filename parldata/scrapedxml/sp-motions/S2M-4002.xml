 *S2M-4002 Mr Jamie Stone: Delivery of Central Heating Programme in the North—That the Parliament notes a deteriorating standard of delivery of EAGA’s free central heating programme in the north; is concerned about the increasing time it is taking to install central heating systems and at reports that often EAGA’s contractors fail to turn up at the specified time and date; is further concerned about reports that EAGA’s call centre staff have been rude to some applicants and believes that staff should be more sympathetic towards the needs of elderly people, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that the delivery of the free central heating programme is improved so that elderly and vulnerable people receive the heating system they need.
