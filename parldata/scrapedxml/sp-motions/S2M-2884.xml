 * S2M-2884 Mark Ballard:Cycling in Edinburgh—That the Parliament notes the recent report by Spokes, the Lothian cycle campaign group, showing that Edinburgh is no longer on course to meet its cycle transport targets for 2010; further notes that after 2005 no new major cycle infrastructure projects are planned in Edinburgh and that such schemes often require a two to three-year lead-in; is concerned that Edinburgh’s own transport budget for bicycle projects has fallen; believes that cycling is an important part of any transport strategy because of benefits to health and reductions in CO2 emissions and congestion, and calls on the City of Edinburgh Council to prioritise cycling in its transport portfolio.
