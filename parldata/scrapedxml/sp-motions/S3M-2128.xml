 *S3M-2128 Gil Paterson: Scottish Banknotes—That the Parliament welcomes the decision by HM Treasury to back down over its proposals for Scottish banks to lodge funds with the Bank of England to cover the value of their notes on seven days a week, which threatened the very existence of Scottish banknotes; congratulates HM Treasury for its common-sense, whilst belated, decision; congratulates all those voices in Scotland and further afield for lending support to the campaign for the right of Scots to have Scottish banknotes in their pockets, and calls on HM Treasury to do the right thing by taking the same considered approach and abandoning any plans to issue new coins of the realm with heraldic emblems and paraphernalia which are specific to England and therefore exclude the other nations of the United Kingdom, namely Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.
