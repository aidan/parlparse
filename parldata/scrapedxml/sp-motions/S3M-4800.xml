 *S3M-4800 Sarah Boyack: Meningitis in Babies Awareness Week, 21 to 27 September 2009—That the Parliament welcomes Meningitis Research Foundation’s Meningitis in Babies Awareness Campaign; notes that meningitis and septicaemia are diseases that affect over 97 babies a year in Scotland under the age of 12 months, of whom around one in ten will die and about a quarter are left with life-altering effects that can be as severe as brain damage, deafness, cerebral palsy and multiple amputations; further notes that babies in Scotland under 12 months are 40 times more likely to develop meningitis than children over one and adults and that more young lives can be saved through raising awareness among clinical practitioners and the public of the early warning signs and symptoms, and welcomes a new research project funded by Meningitis Research Foundation to investigate healthcare delivery and look for ways to improve management of meningitis in newborn babies.  Supported by: Nanette Milne*, Stuart McMillan*, Johann Lamont*, Rhona Brankin*, Ross Finnie*, Christina McKelvie*, Mike Pringle*, John Park*, George Foulkes*, Ian McKee*, Kenneth Gibson*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Karen Gillon*, Jackson Carlaw*
