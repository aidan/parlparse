 * S2M-2621 Alex Neil:Waste of Public Money on Olympic Bid—That the Parliament deplores the absurd waste of taxpayers’ and lottery money of up to £60,000 by the Scottish Executive and its agencies, in particular sportscotland, to promote London’s bid for the 2012 Olympics at a time when many small, local sports clubs and other organisations throughout Scotland are struggling to make ends meet, some of whom have been refused financial support by sportscotland and other Executive agencies; notes the campaign being orchestrated by the Mayor of London to persuade the UK Government to significantly reduce the share of spending allocated to Scotland by the Treasury; notes that the contractual opportunities available to Scottish companies would not be materially affected by whether the Olympics are held in London or Paris; recognises that, in any case, nearly all the potential benefits from holding the Olympics in London would accrue to that city and very few, if any, to other parts of the United Kingdom, and calls on the Executive to refuse any further subsidies to the London Olympic bid as Londoners are already sufficiently wealthy to be able to fund their own bid.
