 *S3M-5480 Robin Harper: UN International Year of Biodiversityâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the beginning of the UN International Year of Biodiversity; recognises the good work already done, in hand, or planned by local authorities, especially Glasgow City Council and the City of Edinburgh Council, in preparing and putting into action their biodiversity action plans, by schools engaging in the hugely successful Eco-Schools programme and by colleges and universities that are co-operating in their own biodiversity plans; praises the contributions being made by allotment holders, the Commonwealth Orchard initiative, many farmers, the Soil Association, Plantlife, Buglife, the Bumble Bee Conservation Trust, Scottish Natural Heritage, the RSPB, the Scottish Wildlife Trust, Scottish Environment LINK, the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and countless other environmental organisations as well as the National Trust for Scotland and Historic Scotland; calls on the Scottish Government and the business community to play a full part in supporting a co-ordinated effort to make this UN International Year of Biodiversity a significant advance, and believes that climate change is the biggest present threat to biodiversity and that the two problems can only be addressed together.
