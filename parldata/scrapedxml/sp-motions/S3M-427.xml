*S3M-427♦ Irene Oldfather: World Alzheimer’s Day - 21 September 2007—That the Parliament expresses support for World Alzheimer’s Day on Friday 21 September 2007 as an occasion when Alzheimer Scotland, alongside Alzheimer’s organisations across the globe, concentrates its efforts in raising awareness of dementia; notes that there are an estimated 24 million people around the world who currently have dementia and around 62,000 people living with dementia in Scotland today; acknowledges that it is important to raise awareness of dementia as an illness and campaign to reduce the misunderstandings and stigma that exist about the condition; recognises the importance of advocacy for this vulnerable group; further acknowledges that maintaining current levels of service provision will not be an option due to the projected increase in the number of people with dementia in Scotland, which is expected to rise by 75% in under 25 years to around 108,000 by 2031, and therefore recognises that improvements to services must be made to promote the highest standards of health and community care.
