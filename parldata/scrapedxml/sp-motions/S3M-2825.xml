 *S3M-2825 Willie Coffey: Welcoming the Designation of the Chris Hoy Cycle Way—That the Parliament recognises the tremendous contribution of Chris Hoy, Scotland’s greatest Olympic athlete, to raising the profile of cycling in Scotland; notes that, from about 1869, Thomas McCall, a local joiner and cartwright, operated the world’s first bicycle factory in Kilmarnock, selling machines based on the design of Kirkpatrick MacMillan, inventor of the modern bicycle; further notes that examples of McCall’s products are held in museums in London and Dumfries, and records its support for the decision of East Ayrshire Council to underline Kilmarnock and Loudoun’s continued association with cycling by naming a local cycle route, from Hurlford to Galston, the Chris Hoy Cycle Way.
