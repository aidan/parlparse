*S3M-2495 Jamie McGrigor: Great Britain Football Team—That the Parliament notes the recent discussion over plans for a Great Britain football team; believes that it would be regrettable if Britain did not enter a team in the 2012 Olympics; suggests that such a team could be formed from the winners of a play-off between the under-23 teams from Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales and England, and further notes previous statements from FIFA that it has no problem with a GB football team and that this would not impact on countries keeping their individual teams at FIFA games. Supported by: Elizabeth Smith*, Nanette Milne*, John Lamont*, Bill Aitken*, Murdo Fraser*
