*S3M-5936♦ Alex Johnstone: Offshore Wind Farms and the Fishing Industry—That the Parliament welcomes the construction of offshore wind farms around the Scottish coast, which will increase the use of renewable energy and create related employment; notes with concern, however, ongoing research by the University of Maine, among others, into the effects of offshore wind farms on marine species such as crustaceans suggesting that construction may have a negative impact on crustacean habitats, especially spawning/nursery grounds; notes the concerns of fishermen who catch crustaceans, including those from the north east of Scotland, and who fear that they will be denied access to traditional fishing grounds when the wind farms are built; acknowledges the important contribution that fishermen make to the economy, and would welcome the involvement of fishermen in discussions on wind farms in order to achieve an equitable solution. Supported by: Bill Aitken*, Murdo Fraser*, Nanette Milne*
