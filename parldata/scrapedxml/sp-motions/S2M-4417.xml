*S2M-4417 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Humanitarian Disaster in Africa—That the Parliament notes the urgent appeal by UNICEF in respect of the unfolding humanitarian disaster in the Horn of Africa; recognises that more than 8,780,000 people, including 4,455,000 children, are in urgent need of humanitarian assistance; notes that there has been a failure of crops and loss of livestock which has increased morbidity and mortality, as well as malnutrition, in children; notes that in all five countries in the Horn of Africa UNICEF is providing cluster co-ordination leadership in nutrition and water and sanitation whilst contributing significantly to World Health Organisation-led co-ordination in health and supporting education and child protection; therefore pledges to assist the UNICEF appeal on behalf of the people of Scotland, and calls on the Scottish Executive to contact UNICEF on this matter with a view to providing meaningful assistance to UNICEF in whatever way it can.
