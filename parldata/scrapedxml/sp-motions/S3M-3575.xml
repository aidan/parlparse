*S3M-3575 Ross Finnie: Health Secretary Must Reject Narrow Vision for Vale of Leven—That the Parliament calls on the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing to reject the narrow vision for the future of the Vale of Leven Hospital approved by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde; considers the decision by NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde to restrict the catchment area for the hospital and preclude the involvement of the facilities and personnel of the Golden Jubilee Hospital to be a wasted opportunity, and calls on the cabinet secretary to scrutinise the decision.
