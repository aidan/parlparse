*S2M-4645 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Class Sizes Strategy—That the Parliament agrees that class sizes in Scottish schools should be set at a national maximum level of 20 for non-practical classes and 15 or less for practical classes; condemns the Scottish Executive for failing to reach targets for maximum classes in S1 and S2 mathematics and English classes; regrets that hundreds of newly qualified teachers who have completed their probationary year are without posts as they approach the summer holidays, and believes that the Executive should provide a strategy, including a timescale, to implement those commitments already made for S1 and S2 mathematics and English and the early stages of primary school and produce a longer-term strategy to reduce all class sizes to 20 for non-practical subjects in state schools, such a strategy to include the creation of posts for newly qualified teachers, and in addition undertake a survey of school capacity to ensure equality of access to education for all children, especially those in deprived areas such as parts of Ayrshire.
