*S3M-6177 Rob Gibson: Free up Nigg Yard for Renewables Fabrication—That the Parliament notes the decision by KBR to end its interest in the fabrication yard at Nigg, in Easter Ross; welcomes the fact that the company has finally made a decision on its future involvement on the site but condemns KBR for its years of delays and what many perceive as prevarication and neglect that has lead to a lack of investment in the site, leaving Nigg at a competitive disadvantage; calls on the Highland Council to restart its plans for compulsory purchase of the site immediately so that it can allow new owners to breathe new life into the yard; considers that Nigg has great potential to support the renewables revolution in Scotland; contends that this is by far the best use of the yard, and calls on the Scottish Government to work toward this end.
