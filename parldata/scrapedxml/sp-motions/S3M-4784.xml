*S3M-4784 Robin Harper: Congratulations to Edinburgh’s Climate Challenge Fund Beneficiaries—That the Parliament heartily congratulates all of the Edinburgh projects that recently received an award from the Climate Challenge Fund, Care and Repair Edinburgh Ltd, Drylaw Neighbourhood Centre, Edinburgh University People and Planet Society and the Grange Association and LifeCare; appreciates that they are among a growing number of community projects across Scotland that are proving to be this country’s best source of innovation in tackling climate change; considers that the people behind these projects are true climate pioneers doing work that Scotland can be proud of; acknowledges that, if Scotland is to meet the 42% carbon reduction targets set out by the Parliament last month, it will need to scale up projects like these and learn from their experiences, and calls on the Scottish Government to continue to meet the demand from community groups for this invaluable assistance.
