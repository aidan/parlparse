*S3M-4065.2 Robert Brown: Community Courts—As an amendment to motion (S3M-4065) in the name of Bill Aitken, leave out from "and believes" to "custody" and insert "notes that the independent business plan in March 2009 anticipated numerous benefits from a community court project, including improved community safety, greater offender accountability and reduced rates of reoffending; believes that the cancellation of the community court project also undermines the Scottish Government’s own stated commitment to replace short-term prison sentences with tough and effective community sentences, and calls on the Scottish Government to continue to work with the Community Justice Project Board."
