 *S1M-3880.1 Miss Annabel Goldie: Scottish Economic Growth—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3880) in the name of Andrew Wilson, leave out from "long-term" to end and insert "competitive disadvantage at which Scottish business is being placed as a consequence of an onerous taxation and regulatory regime aggravated by inadequate investment in transport infrastructure and calls on the Scottish Executive to reduce the business rate poundage to the same level that exists in England thereby re-establishing a uniform business rate and to pledge an additional £100 million per annum for investment in our transport infrastructure."
