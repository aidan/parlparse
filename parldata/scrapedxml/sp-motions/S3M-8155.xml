 *S3M-8155 Robin Harper: Scotland: a Safe Place for Child Traffickers?—That the Parliament notes with alarm the conclusions of the report on child trafficking by Scotland’s Commissioner for Children and Young People published on the 14 March 2011, which notes that 83 children may have been trafficked into Scotland in the last year and a half without a single person being convicted of the crimes; considers that there is now an evidence base as a result of this report, and urges the Scottish Government to act as swiftly as possible on the recommendations of the report, especially in light of the evident willingness of the professionals contacted during the research to improve the identification and treatment of children trafficked into and within Scotland and in relation to the traumatic effects of the exploitation that these children experience. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
