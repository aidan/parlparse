*S3M-1032 Alex Johnstone: Wi-Fi on Public Transport—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by National Express that free wi-fi connection will be available to all passengers on the east coast rail passenger service; further welcomes the earlier announcement by Scottish Citylink regarding free wi-fi on its route between Edinburgh and Glasgow; recognises that such initiatives have a vital role to play in enabling flexible working, increased productivity and in reducing traffic congestion by encouraging modal shift, and, in light of these benefits, calls on the Scottish Executive to examine ways of encouraging other transport operators to consider the introduction of wi-fi on their services.
