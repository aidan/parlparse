*S3M-5477 George Foulkes: Inadequate Response to a National Emergencyâ€”That the Parliament notes that Scotland has experienced its longest period of cold weather for decades; congratulates all of the public service workers and volunteers for the work that they have done to help alleviate all kinds of problems; recognises that the Scottish Executive has an important role to co-ordinate and organise the overall response and regrets the delay in getting such effort mobilised over the Christmas period; further believes that the ability of councils to respond fully and effectively has been hampered by the cuts in expenditure imposed by the Scottish Executive through the concordat with local authorities, and believes that the approach of the Scottish Executive, exemplified by the ministerial statement on 7 January 2010 and answers to parliamentary questions, is both arrogant and complacent.
