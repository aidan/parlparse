*S2M-3161 Irene Oldfather: Treatment of Alzheimer’s Disease—That the Parliament notes with regret the decision of the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) to defer its final assessment on the recommendation to not use donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine in the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease; acknowledges the continued uncertainty and concern that this position is causing the families of Alzheimer’s sufferers in Scotland; is aware that there are 62,000 sufferers of Alzheimer’s disease in Scotland and that a significant proportion of these people are currently being prescribed these drugs; accepts that the drugs are widely available in the United States of America and across the rest of Europe to successfully treat Alzheimer’s disease; recognises that devolution offers the opportunity to act differently in Scotland; is aware that the final decision on whether to continue prescribing these drugs in Scotland rests with NHS Quality Improvement Scotland (NHS QIS), and therefore urges NHS QIS to reject the NICE proposals and allow Alzheimer’s sufferers in Scotland to continue to benefit from the positive, proven effects of donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine and memantine on the treatment of their condition.
