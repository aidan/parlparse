*S3M-4103 Robin Harper: Appalling Asset Management in Local Government—That the Parliament notes with extreme concern the contents of the Audit Scotland report, Asset management in local government; recognises the report as a devastating record of poor organisation and lack of coordination; notes that fewer than half of councils have approved corporate asset management strategies, only half have complete property strategies and only half provide regular information to elected members on property performance; further notes, in the context of the Climate Change (Scotland) Bill in particular, that paragraph 21 of Audit Scotland’s associated key message document indicates that "environmental sustainability is not a key factor in building design. Most councils are missing opportunities for incorporating environmentally friendly features into the design of new buildings", and calls on the Scottish Government, as a matter of urgency, to consult with COSLA on the way forward to address these problems through the outcome agreements associated with their concordat.
