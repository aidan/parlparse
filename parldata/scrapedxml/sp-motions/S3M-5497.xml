*S3M-5497 Cathy Jamieson: Thanks to Salt Miners during Big Freeze—That the Parliament recognises the efforts of the salt miners at Cleveland Potash in North Yorkshire, members of Unite the Union, who are battling to get to work in icy conditions above ground while working in Saharan temperatures below ground to produce salt to help keep roads clear during the big freeze; notes that Cleveland Potash is Britain’s biggest mine and the deepest in the western hemisphere, with miners working nine-and-a-half-hour shifts over one mile underground, keeping operations going for 24 hours per day to produce an average of 10,000 tonnes of salt per day; further notes that many of the miners sacrificed much of their Christmas break, when the mine is usually closed, to step up salt supplies, and thanks them for their efforts in working flat out on our behalf.
