*S3M-6550 Trish Godman: Success for Marcus Crawford Guy and the Dance School of Scotland—That the Parliament congratulates Marcus Crawford Guy of Lochwinnoch, Renfrewshire, and the Dance School of Scotland for Marcus’s fantastic achievement in gaining a scholarship to the prestigious Juilliard School of performing arts in New York; notes that Marcus was one of only 18 students to make the final cut out of hundreds of applicants from all over America and the rest of the world; further notes that former pupils of the hugely successful school include Kevin Spacey and Robin Williams; recognises that Marcus is an example of the talent that passes through the Dance School of Scotland, which is a national centre of excellence providing students with specialist teaching to help them realise their ambitions, and wishes Marcus the best of luck as he attempts to raise the £20,000 needed to fund his scholarship and move to New York to attend the Juilliard School.
