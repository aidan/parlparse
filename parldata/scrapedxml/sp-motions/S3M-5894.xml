*S3M-5894 David Whitton: Go Large with McDonald’s and the Scottish FA—That the Parliament congratulates McDonald’s and the Scottish Football Association on announcing a new community partner programme for the next four years; considers that this programme has, over the last eight years, played an intrinsic role in creating even better standards with community football clubs across Scotland; notes that, over the next four years, the programme aims to attract 13,000 new volunteers to club football, deliver 10,000 fully trained new coaches into local clubs, support over 200 community football champions and provide support to 600 clubs and 52,000 players, and hopes that this programme will continue to develop the grassroots game across Scotland. Supported by: Mary Mulligan*, Andy Kerr*, Trish Godman*, Karen Gillon*, Cathie Craigie*
