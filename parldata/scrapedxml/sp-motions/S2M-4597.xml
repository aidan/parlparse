 *S2M-4597 Linda Fabiani: Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia—That the Parliament commiserates with the Catalan people that the original Catalan Parliament proposal, passed by 90% of its members, was diluted by the Spanish Parliament which, amongst other things, resulted in Catalonia not being officially and directly recognised as a nation but nevertheless congratulates Catalans on the recent reform that gives them greater autonomy; recognises that the process was initiated by the political parties in the Catalan Parliament and had the agreement of the people of Catalonia expressed through a referendum; further recognises that the new statute formally establishes that the powers of the Generalitat, the institution in which the self-government of Catalonia is politically organised, rest with the people of Catalonia, that Catalonia will have an improved fiscal system with full powers over Catalan and devolved Spanish taxes and that the Spanish State, when dealing with the EU on issues that are devolved to Catalonia, will from this point on allow the Catalan Government’s position to be determinant, and believes that Scotland should follow Catalonia’s lead by taking control of the devolution process and moving forward to independence.
