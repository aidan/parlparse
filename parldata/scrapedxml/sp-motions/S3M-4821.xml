*S3M-4821 Helen Eadie: Dalgety Bay Friends of Engcongolweni—That the Parliament is delighted to note that Dalgety Bay Friends of Malawi brought 16 Malawians to visit the Parliament on Wednesday 9 September 2009 as they and Scotland celebrate the fact that 150 years ago this month Dr David Livingstone from Blantyre landed at Lake Malawi, ensuring that the futures of both nations would be intertwined in ways that have become inspirational; further expresses its pleasure that the Aberdour and Dalgety Bay Labour Party, Dalgety Bay Church and the General and Municipal Boilermakers Union combined in partnership to raise in excess of £2,000 to support the Dalgety Bay Friends of Malawi as it strives to raise the money to ensure that the project of bringing piped water, building the pre-school nursery and providing for a manse can be completed, and recognises with appreciation and thanks the management at Bowlplex in Dunfermline for the part it played in bringing joy to our Malawi visitors who had never seen or played bowling before.
