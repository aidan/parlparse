*S2M-4793# Helen Eadie: John Thomson—That the Parliament notes that September 2006 is the 75th anniversary of the tragic accident when John Thomson, a Protestant, the young Celtic goalkeeper aged 22, lost his life during a game; hopes that the people of Scotland will support the Parliament’s call that John be admitted to the Scottish Football Museum Hall of Fame first and foremost on his merit in that he won four international caps, he was a goalkeeping legend and a Celtic regular at 18 years old having made 188 appearances for Celtic, his talent was recognised by so many and his following was evident when over 30,000 supporters joined the mourners at Bowhill Cemetery; considers that John Thomson is an abiding figure in Scotland’s footballing history: a decent, modest young man who enjoyed the love and affection of his family and the respect and admiration of scores of thousands of Scots and that today we would describe him as an exemplary role model for youngsters; sends its best wishes to the people of Cardenden and a strong message of support to the Scottish Football Museum when it deliberates this month over the 2006 inductees to the Scottish Football Museum Hall of Fame, and, as it does so, asks for the view of the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport to be taken into account and for Sam English to be admitted at the same time.
