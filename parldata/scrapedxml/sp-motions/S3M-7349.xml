*S3M-7349 Jim Hume: 70th Anniversary of the Norwegian Army’s Exile in Dumfries—That the Parliament recognises the 70th anniversary of the Norwegian army’s exile in Dumfries following the German invasion of Norway in World War II; further recognises that a series of events is planned in Dumfries to celebrate the role that it played in hosting Norway’s army and that these will culminate in a flag-raising event at the Midsteeple; considers that strong links remain between Dumfries and Norway and that these are illustrated by an annual wreath-laying ceremony that has, on occasion, been attended by members of the Norwegian royal family, and congratulates all of those associated with making this year’s special commemorations possible.
