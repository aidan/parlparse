*S1M-3612# Trish Godman: Tackling Under Age Drinking—That the Parliament commends the members of the Renfrewshire Council on Alcohol for their innovative and widely welcomed Young Persons Advisory Project which seeks to guide and educate young people and school children on the growing social, personal and health problems associated with underage drinking; notes that many of the youngsters that have attended the project's counselling programmes have benefited from their participation; further notes that they and their parents now have a greater awareness and a more sensible view of alcohol and its dangers; is pleased to see that there is growing interest in the project's work from as far away as the New Zealand Police, and believes that such initiatives dealing with alcohol and substance misuse amongst children and young people should receive appropriate support from the Scottish Executive.
