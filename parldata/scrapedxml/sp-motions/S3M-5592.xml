*S3M-5592 Robert Brown: Barnardo’s Scotland Fostering and Adoption Week—That the Parliament notes that the Fostering Network has calculated that Scotland needs an extra 1,700 carers; notes research from Barnardo’s indicating that people in Scotland are the least likely to consider fostering and that a perceived lack of training and support is the most common reason for this; recognises the dedication of Scotland’s foster carers; believes that fostering not only provides a loving home for some of the most vulnerable children in Scotland but can also be immensely rewarding to those who foster; welcomes the launch of Barnardo’s Scotland Fostering and Adoption Week on 18 January 2010 as one of a range of initiatives that will encourage more Scots to consider fostering, and congratulates Barnardo’s Scotland Fostering service in Glasgow for the work that it does in finding placements for children under the age of 13 with emotional and behavioural difficulties and for the training and support that it offers foster carers and potential foster carers.
