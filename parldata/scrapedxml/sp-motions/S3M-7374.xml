*S3M-7374 Sandra White: Concern over Relocation of Asylum Seekers—That the Parliament notes with serious concern the decision by the UK Border Agency (UKBA) to terminate its accommodation contract with Glasgow City Council, which could lead to the forced relocation of over a thousand asylum seekers to anywhere in Scotland; criticises the UKBA for the apparent suddenness of its communication and lack of clarity contained within, which is believed to have led to great uncertainty and anxiety not only among those in Glasgow but also the local integration networks and housing providers; believes that the UKBA policies that state that "whenever possible you will be given at least three to five days’ notice of the move" and that "you will (only) be allowed to take two pieces of luggage per person to your new accommodation" are directly opposed to the basic rights that many have fought for and more aligned with the injustices that many have fought against, and would welcome alternative proposals being brought forward. Supported by: Trish Godman*, Christina McKelvie*, Patrick Harvie*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Stuart McMillan*, Bill Kidd*, Bill Wilson*
