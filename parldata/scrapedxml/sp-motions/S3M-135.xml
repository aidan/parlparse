*S3M-135 Ross Finnie: 30 a Day—That the Parliament welcomes the British Heart Foundation’s (BHF) 30 a Day campaign, which aims to encourage people aged over 50 to invest in their health and well-being by getting active; notes that inactivity is a key risk factor for coronary heart disease, the most common cause of premature death in Scotland, as well as raising the risk of other life-threatening diseases; recognises that just 30 minutes of moderate physical activity at least five times a week can halve the risk of heart disease; notes with concern that less than half of men and a third of women in Scotland are meeting this recommendation and that these numbers decline with age; supports the view that, while personal action is key to raising physical activity levels among this age group, there are a number of policy measures that can support older adults in becoming more active, and joins the BHF in calling on the Scottish Executive and local authorities to ensure that helping people aged over 50 to get active becomes a higher priority.
