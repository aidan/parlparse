 * S2M-2558 Trish Godman:Commemoration of the Scottish Women’s Suffrage Movement—That the Parliament welcomes the decision to commemorate, by way of sculpture to be placed in the Parliament, the important heroic campaign waged by numerous members of the Scottish Women’s Suffrage Movement to attain the goal of universal suffrage and the extension of women’s rights here in Scotland and elsewhere; remembers the barbaric treatment inflicted upon those women campaigners when imprisoned in Perth Prison and other prisons; also recalls the admirable and sustained support given to the movement by a relatively small number of male politicians amongst whose thin ranks were the estimable Keir Hardie and Tom Johnston, editor of the radical newspaper, The Forward, and firmly believes that such brave, stoical women played a crucial part in the emancipation of women in the 20th century which is too often ignored by modern historians but which today can be seen as a significant element in the democratic improvement in women’s economic, social, political, community and democratic rights. Supported by: Donald Gorrie*
