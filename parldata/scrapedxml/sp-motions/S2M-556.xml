*S2M-556 Ross Finnie: Common Agricultural Policy Reform-That the Parliament welcomes the CAP Reform Agreement of June 2003 as a good deal for Scotland; endorses the objectives of the strategy document A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture, widely agreed by stakeholders, as providing the strategic focus for decision-making on the various flexibilities available to Scotland within the agreement; endorses the wide and open consultation which the Scottish Executive has now launched to canvass views across the whole range of stakeholders before final decisions are taken, and further welcomes the Executive's initiative in setting up a stakeholder group comprising representatives of a wide range of stakeholders, farming, industry, consumer and environmental, to advise on the consultation process.
