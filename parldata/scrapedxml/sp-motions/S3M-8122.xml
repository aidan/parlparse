*S3M-8122 Dr Richard Simpson: Tayside Wild Beaversâ€”That the Parliament notes that the group of beavers that have established themselves in Tayside and Angus may be the subject of proposals for capture and extermination and calls on the Scottish Government to make it clear that this action will not happen and that consideration should be given to incorporating them into an extended study of beavers to determine the effect on the environment.
