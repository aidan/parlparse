 *S3M-5819 Bill Wilson: NHS 24’s Exemplary Disability Leave Policy—That the Parliament congratulates NHS 24 on its adoption of a progressive disability leave policy; notes that section 2.2 of this policy "recognises that disabled people often face discrimination and disadvantage in the workplace and society" and states that "NHS 24 recognises and values the skills, abilities and experience of employees with a disability and is therefore committed to supporting employees with a disability by removing access barriers, tackling discrimination that they face, delivering equality of opportunity between disabled people and non-disabled people, and implementing best employment practice"; further notes that the policy makes a clear distinction between sick leave and disability leave to ensure that absences relating to an employee’s disability are managed appropriately; considers that the guidance suggests that sometimes treating disabled people more favourably than non-disabled people may be necessary in order to ensure that outcomes are equal, and agrees with Inclusion Scotland that NHS 24 should be congratulated on this policy and that other NHS boards should adopt similar disability leave policies. Supported by: Bill Kidd*, Bob Doris*, Stuart McMillan*
