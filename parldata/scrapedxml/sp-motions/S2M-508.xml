*S2M-508 Murdo Fraser: Charitable Status of Independent Schools in Perth and Kinross-That the Parliament recognises the economic contribution made by independent schools to Perth and Kinross and the contribution of some 700 jobs and Â£13 million per annum; further recognises that independent schools currently benefit from charitable status without which many would struggle to continue in existence, and accordingly calls on the Scottish Executive to safeguard the charitable status of independent schools, thus protecting parental choice and safeguarding jobs in Perth and Kinross.
