*S3M-3150 Kenneth Gibson: Making the Parliament More Scottish—That the Parliament recognises Scotland’s phenomenal contribution to world civilisation over recent centuries in medicine, science, literature, philosophy, exploration and a host of other fields; shares the disappointment of many visitors from home and abroad that the Parliament building barely reflects this; is aware that in the heart of the Parliament one could be in almost any country; believes that in the Year of Homecoming this should be rectified; considers that rooms such as TG.21, Q1.03 and Committee Room 1 and the Garden Lobby would each be better named, and should be themed, after individual Scots who have contributed both to making Scotland the nation it is today and to the creation of the modern world, and urges the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body imaginatively and decisively to give the Parliament the identity it needs.
