*S3M-3284♦ Jamie Stone: Investment in Schools in North Highland—That the Parliament recognises the impact of the quality of a school’s environment on the effectiveness of the education of its pupils and believes that the dilapidated state of a number of school buildings in the north Highlands impedes the education of many pupils; recognises Highland Council’s lack of financial resources to renovate and build schools, and regrets the lack of a funding mechanism that would allow Highland Council to initiate a much-needed schools refurbishment and new-build programme.
