*S3M-7086 Linda Fabiani: Continuously Caring Carers, The Older Families Charter—That the Parliament recognises that thousands of older people across Scotland are still caring for adult sons and daughters with a learning disability in the family at home and welcomes the Older Families Charter launched by Enable Scotland, Quarriers, Edinburgh Development Group and the Learning Disability Alliance Scotland, which states that local government should collect accurate information on the numbers, needs and location of older carers and adults with learning disabilities living in the family home to facilitate good strategic planning, that every adult with a learning disability living with an older carer should be able to have a person-centred plan that supports them in leading full lives, making and keeping friends and keeping in touch with their families if they leave home, that in each local authority area there should be a dedicated officer for older families to provide local information, support access to services, identify their needs and plan for how they will change over time, that every adult with a learning disability living with an older carer should be able to have an individual emergency plan that identifies what could be done in specific crisis situations and that every family with older carers across Scotland should have the opportunity to access independent advocacy services; believes that the five simple proposals outlined in the charter can be the first steps in addressing the needs of older family carers who are living with and caring for adult relatives with learning disabilities, and considers it worthy of support.
