*S3M-7621 Tavish Scott: Lerwick and Stornoway Coastguard Stations—That the Parliament notes that, together, the Lerwick and Stornoway coastguard stations cover very large and complex areas of sea and coastline consisting of the Northern and Western Isles, the Pentland Firth, the Minch, the West Highland coast and lochs, and large areas of the Atlantic Ocean and the North Sea including key deepwater oil fields; believes that the service that they offer to seafarers is greatly enhanced by the local knowledge that the coastguard officers in each station have of the seas, tides and coastlines in their area; fears that such knowledge would be dangerously diluted were one of the stations to close leaving the other to cover the combined area, and believes that members should resolutely oppose any plans to close the Lerwick and Stornoway coastguard stations.
