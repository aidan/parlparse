*S1M-3042 Mr Gil Paterson: Sexual Assaults-That the Parliament notes the increase in the number of sexual assaults carried out in 2001; welcomes the Lord Advocate's Review on the definition of rape and the conclusion which it reached which now firmly places rape law around consent; further notes the announcement by Harriet Harman of the intention to introduce a national network of specialist rape prosecutors in England and Wales, and calls on the Scottish Executive to look at conducting an overarching review of the current procedures set up to deal with sexual assault cases and of all legislation covering sexual assault cases in Scotland in order to combat current trends in sexual assault cases as changes should not be carried out in a piecemeal manner.
