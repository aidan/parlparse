*S1M-2335 Mr Gil Paterson: 16 Days Campaign-That the Parliament congratulates the campaigners who are organising events to mark the 16 Days Campaign, which aims to highlight through a variety of initiatives the continuing threat of domestic violence which women face in Scotland and the wider world today; urges MSPs to support the march planned in Edinburgh to highlight this, and calls on the Scottish Executive to join campaigners across Scotland and the rest of the world in celebrating 25 November 2001 as the International Day Against Violence Against Women.
