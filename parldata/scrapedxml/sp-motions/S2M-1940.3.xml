 *S2M-1940.3 Tommy Sheridan: A Better Deal for Pensioners—As an amendment to motion (S2M-1940) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from "removing" to end and insert "the introduction of a basic state pension of £150 a week to be raised annually thereafter in line with the average rise in earnings would help achieve both of these objectives, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to bring pressure to bear on the UK Government to begin the process of replacing means-testing with an earnings-linked state pension."
