*S1M-2320 Mr Murray Tosh: Water Charges Relief Schemeâ€”That the Parliament notes the unanimous recommendations of the Transport and the Environment Committee Report on Inquiry into Water and the Water Industry, that "a new more targeted relief scheme" from water charges should be established for defined voluntary organisations and charities, that the existing relief scheme should be continued until a new scheme has been put in place and that the proposed Water Services (Scotland) Bill offers an opportunity to introduce the necessary legislation and urges the Scottish Executive to introduce such legislation, extending the existing scheme as an interim measure in order to ensure a permanent Scotland-wide relief scheme at appropriate and uniform levels for charities and voluntary organisations, including churches.
