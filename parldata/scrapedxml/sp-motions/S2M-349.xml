 *S2M-349 Mike Pringle: Dedicated Bus Service to St. Peter's Primary School, Edinburgh—That the Parliament welcomes the agreement between the City of Edinburgh Council and contractors to allow the refurbishment of St. Peter’s Primary School, Morningside, to start immediately; notes that the lack of a dedicated school bus service for the current school year to take pupils to their temporary school near Tollcross has caused traffic congestion at this site and overcrowding on buses running on the A702 into the city, and calls on the City of Edinburgh Council to introduce one immediately to stop travel problems for teachers, pupils, parents and commuters.
