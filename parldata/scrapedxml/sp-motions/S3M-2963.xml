*S3M-2963 Robin Harper: Redevelopment of School Playing Fields—That the Parliament notes with concern the redevelopment of school playing fields across Scotland and the consequent loss of facilities for schools and communities; considers that the omission of Fields in Trust (FIT) Scotland, previously known as the National Playing Fields Association, as a mandatory consultee on all playing field development proposals is a bizarre anomaly, and believes that FIT Scotland should be accorded mandatory consultee status by the Scottish Government without delay.
