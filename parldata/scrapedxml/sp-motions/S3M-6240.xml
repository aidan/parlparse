 *S3M-6240 Hugh Henry: Communication Workers’ Union Ballot—That the Parliament welcomes the vote of the Communication Workers’ Union to agree a three year deal that will give Royal Mail staff a wage rise worth 6.9% and job security; hopes that this will lead to improved industrial relations; recognises the willingness of staff to actively participate in the transformation of a publicly owned Royal Mail, and hopes that early steps will be taken to resolve the issue of the Royal Mail pension debt.
