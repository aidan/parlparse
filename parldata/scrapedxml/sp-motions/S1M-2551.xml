*S1M-2551 Robert Brown: Ofgem Removal of Price Controls-That the Parliament notes with concern Ofgem's recent proposals to lift the remaining price controls on energy use in Scotland and, in particular, to lift the price caps on pre-payment tariffs which will have a detrimental effect on the less well off in paying fuel bills; believes that the energy market is not sufficiently developed to provide protection from uncompetitive pricing practices; further notes that customers with remote teleswitching meters are unable to change suppliers and therefore have no access to competition; is concerned that these proposals will compromise the Scottish Executive's ability to deliver an end to fuel poverty through measures including the Housing (Scotland) Act 2001, and urges Ofgem to withdraw their proposals insofar as they relate to electricity prices and pre-payment meter tariffs.
