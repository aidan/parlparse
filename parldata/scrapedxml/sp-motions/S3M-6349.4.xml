 *S3M-6349.4 Patrick Harvie: High Speed Rail Link—As an amendment to motion (S3M-6349) in the name of Stewart Stevenson, leave out from second "and" to end and insert "case for extending high-speed rail to Scotland; notes that the environmental case for high speed rail is dependent on a reduction in aviation capacity, which neither the UK nor the Scottish Government has explicitly endorsed, as well as on the promotion of other low-carbon transport modes; considers that demand management also has a role to play in reducing the environmental impact of transport; notes the opportunity to engage with the new Westminster administration to secure a sustainable approach to transport demand as well as Scotland’s place in a UK high-speed rail network, and supports work to bring high-speed rail to Scotland and to cut the number of domestic flights at the earliest opportunity."
