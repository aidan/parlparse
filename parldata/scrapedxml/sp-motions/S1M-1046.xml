*S1M-1046 Mr Kenny MacAskill: Use of Differential Inflation Rates In Calculating Benefits and Taxes—That the Parliament notes that in calculations for money taken through petrol duty, Her Majesty's Treasury intends to use an inflation rate of 3.3%, while for calculations for money paid out through the state pension, an inflation rate of only 1.1% will be used; believes that is unfair to use two different inflation figures, selecting the lower to work out what increase there should be in money paid out to pensioners, yet using the higher to decide what tax increase motorists should pay, and condemns this type of accounting practice as a misleading and deceitful excuse for attacking both pensioners and motorists.
