 *S2M-183 Christine Grahame: Central Borders Citizens Advice Bureauâ€”That the Parliament notes and congratulates Central Borders Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) on another year of invaluable work on behalf of its clients in dealing with 9,594 issues in 2002; applauds the work of its volunteers and its liaison with both Roxburgh and Berwickshire CABs; expresses concern that its fixed level of funding cannot keep apace with rising costs and, in particular, the severe and increasing burden of water charges which has led it to initiate a "Friends of Central Borders CAB" with the intention of raising much-needed funding, and therefore urges the Scottish Executive to examine ways and means of assisting Central Borders CAB, and other bureaux, with increasing costs and, in particular, with savage water charge increases.
