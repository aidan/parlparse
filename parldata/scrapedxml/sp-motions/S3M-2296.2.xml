*S3M-2296.2 Margaret Curran: Glasgow East By-Electionâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-2296) in the name of Kenneth Gibson, leave out from "condemns" to end and insert "notes that if a by-election is not held in Glasgow East now, the earliest that the rules permit a by-election to be held is at the end of October 2008; notes that when an MP resigns, a writ for a by-election cannot be moved during the summer, unlike when an MP dies or is elevated to the peerage; believes that the people of Glasgow East should not go without a voice for four months; supports the decision to call a by-election now, and condemns the SNP for trying to deny the people of Glasgow East a voice until the end of October."
