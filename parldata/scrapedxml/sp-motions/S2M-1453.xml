*S2M-1453 Patrick Harvie: Parkhead Citizens Advice Bureau-That the Parliament regrets Glasgow City Council's decision to award Parkhead Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) only £65,969 of the £104,845 requested in the service level agreement that was submitted for the running of core services; notes that this will result in a 40% reduction in Parkhead CAB's service to clients and will have a significant impact on the lives of people within the east end of Glasgow; further notes that last year the bureau assisted with over 7,000 client contacts and over 10,000 problems, formally represented over 300 clients at tribunals and in the Sheriff Court and secured over £830,000 in financial gain for clients; is extremely concerned that other Glasgow citizen's advice bureaux and advice providers are facing problems in securing funding for their valuable services, and therefore urges Glasgow City Council to increase substantially Parkhead CAB's grant to allow the bureau to continue to operate at its current level of service.
