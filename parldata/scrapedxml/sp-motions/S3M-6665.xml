*S3M-6665 Robin Harper: Edinburgh Farmers’ Market Celebrates 10th Birthday—That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh Farmers’ Market on the occasion of its 10th birthday; notes the superb local produce that Edinburgh Farmers’ Market offers and the hard work done by the stallholders to make this an award-winning market; further notes that this is despite the fact that stall charges are the highest in Scotland; recognises that the majority of stallholders grow what they sell; congratulates John Scott MSP for his work in developing farmers’ markets across Scotland, and wishes the Edinburgh Farmers’ Market continued success during its second decade.
