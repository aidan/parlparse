*S3M-3530 Stuart McMillan: Full Fiscal Autonomy Through Independence—That the Parliament notes the publication of Fiscal Autonomy in Scotland: the case for change and options for reform by the Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Sustainable Growth on 24 February 2009, which argues that full fiscal autonomy through independence would both help Scotland deal with short-term issues like the global downturn and put the country on the best path for a more successful future, unlike other options short of independence, and acknowledges that the Scottish Government is continuing to do everything within its current powers to ease the economic crisis, such as lowering business rates, freezing the council tax until 2012 and offering debt advice to constituents, but that more could be done with further fiscal powers.
