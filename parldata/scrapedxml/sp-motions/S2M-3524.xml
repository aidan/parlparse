 *S2M-3524 Paul Martin: British Heart Foundation’s Food4Thought Campaign 2005—That the Parliament acknowledges the steady growth in the number of overweight and obese children and accepts that this is likely to increase the future burden of coronary heart disease in Scotland, especially in our most deprived communities; welcomes the aims of the British Heart Foundation’s Food4Thought Campaign which encourages 11 and 12-year-old children to think more about what they eat and take more responsibility for their healthy food choices; recognises that children will only be able to exercise their right to choose healthy foods in a society where government, schools, industry and parents are working together to support them; calls for the removal of barriers which prevent children from making healthier choices wherever needed, and urges the Scottish Executive to play its part by legislating to restrict the sale of unhealthy foods in schools.
