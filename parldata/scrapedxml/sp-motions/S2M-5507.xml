*S2M-5507# Dr Elaine Murray: Downgrading of the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust Scottish Centre in Caerlaverock—That the Parliament regrets the decision by the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust to downgrade its only centre in Scotland, at Caerlaverock in Dumfriesshire, to that of lowest priority and to make its centre manager of over 20 years, Mr John Doherty, Director for Scotland, redundant; recognises the contribution made by Mr Doherty to the National Goose Management Review Group and the Goose Science Advisory Group; believes that Scotland is uniquely placed in terms of migratory geese and wildfowl and that this should be recognised in the priority given to the Scottish centre, and considers that the Wildfowl and Wetlands Trust should reverse this decision to manage its Scottish operations from Lancashire.
