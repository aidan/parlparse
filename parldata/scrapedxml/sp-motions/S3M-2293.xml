 *S3M-2293 Robin Harper: Climate Change—That the Parliament notes that the NHS is the largest single organisation in the United Kingdom and further notes that the energy used in NHS healthcare facilities costs £400 million annually with a total annual emission of approximately one million tonnes of carbon; commends the British Medical Association (BMA)’s recent report on how health professionals can take action on climate change; supports the recommendations by the BMA for health professionals and healthcare organisations to reduce their carbon footprint while protecting and promoting the health of the public by (a) investing in preventive healthcare and treatment for the health implications relating to climate change such as problems caused by an increase in temperature, flooding and infectious diseases and (b) applying simple measures such as using energy saving lighting, recycling and turning off electrical equipment at the plug when not in use, and commends the Royal Cornhill Hospital in Aberdeen as an excellent example of good practice of an NHS organisation taking steps to reduce its carbon footprint.
