 *S2M-1647# Margo MacDonald: Fatigue and Chronic Neurological Illnesses—That the Parliament recognises that there are many thousands of individuals living with chronic neurological illnesses in Scotland, such as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS), multiple sclerosis (MS), post polio syndrome (PPS) and fibromyalgis; notes that one of the major causes of stress in this population is fatigue associated with their condition; further notes that, given the range of illnesses and care needs, patients are often given inappropriate treatment and medications, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should consider as a first step the establishment of a centre of excellence specifically to assess, treat and research ways of managing and improving such individuals’ life quality and that any centre should be promoted in such a manner as the Scottish Executive sees fit to ensure that GPs and other health professionals are informed of this new service and are encouraged to refer patients as the need arises.
