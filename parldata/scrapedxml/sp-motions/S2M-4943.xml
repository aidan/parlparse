 *S2M-4943 Carolyn Leckie: End Mental Health Discrimination in Employmentâ€”That the Parliament recognises the discrimination suffered by those with mental health problems; notes that whilst 75% of all working-age adults are in work, only 20% of those with mental health problems are in work; further notes that one-third of those with mental health problems say they have been sacked or forced to resign because of their condition, with another 40% saying that they have been denied employment because of their history of psychiatric treatment; is concerned that despite the Disability Discrimination Act 1995, a recent survey showed that 63% of employers would not recruit people with mental health problems, and, given the scale of the problem, calls on the Scottish Executive to adopt the voluntary code for employers issued by the Westminster Government and to incorporate it into the conditions of service for public sector workers throughout Scotland.
