*S2M-3186 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Social Affordable Housing—That the Parliament condemns the intolerable standard of some of the housing available in the private and public rented sector; expresses disapproval of the complex and arbitrary nature of some council and housing association house allocation systems which do not address the needs of tenants; condemns the Scottish Executive’s housing policy which has resulted in fewer houses being built for the public rented sector and less investment in housing stock to maintain standards, and calls on the Executive to review its housing policy and start an immediate programme of house building to provide socially affordable public housing for all who require it.
