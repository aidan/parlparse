*S3M-6234 Jeremy Purvis: Nurses’ Day 2010—That the Parliament marks Nurses’ Day on 12 May 2010 by celebrating the contribution made by both regular and reservist nurses in our armed forces who are caring for the physical and mental health of service men and women in Afghanistan, elsewhere around the world and at home in the United Kingdom; thanks military nurses for their dedication, courage and professionalism while working in extremely difficult conditions, and commemorates Florence Nightingale, whose birthday is marked by Nurses’ Day each year and who, along with others, such as Mary Seacole, worked as a nurse to care for soldiers in the Crimean War and left a hugely influential legacy for the nursing profession that lasts to this day.
