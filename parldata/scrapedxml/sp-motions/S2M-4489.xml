*S2M-4489 Colin Fox: Ken Loach and Paul Laverty - Palme d’Or Prize—That the Parliament congratulates director, Ken Loach, and scriptwriter, Paul Laverty, on the success of their latest film "The Wind That Shakes the Barley" in winning the highly prestigious Palme d’Or prize at the Cannes Film Festival; notes that the film, set during the Irish War of Independence and ensuing civil war of the 1920s, was shot on location in Glasgow, and agrees with remarks made by Ken Loach on accepting the prize that "our film is a little step in the British confronting their imperialist history.
