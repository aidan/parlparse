 *S1M-3483 Tommy Sheridan: Homeless Persons Unit, Glasgow City Councilâ€”That the Parliament supports the strike by 70 members of staff in the Homeless Persons Unit in the housing department of Glasgow City Council; appeals to the council to meet the union's demands; notes that the workers are taking indefinite strike action not on pay and conditions but in defence of the specialist service that they provide to the city's growing homeless population; is concerned by the council's policy of introducing generic workers in a whole series of departments, rather than using the specialist skills that staff have to the benefit of the public; recognises that the very specific skills required for working with homeless single persons, as distinct with homeless families, cannot be sustained under the council's restructuring, which indiscriminately groups all staff together in an unworkable fashion, and condemns the council's high-handed approach in advertising the workers' jobs in the press on the eve of the legally organised strike.
