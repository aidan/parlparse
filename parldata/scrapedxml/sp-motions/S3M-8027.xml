*S3M-8027 Robin Harper: Seal Culls—That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Government has just issued licences to shoot up to 1,300 seals in 2011 where it is considered that they present a threat to fish farms; recalls that, under the Marine (Scotland) Act 2010, culling to control seals is a solution of last resort; considers that 80% of fish farms have not complied with guidance to the effect that non-lethal methods of controlling seals, including acoustic warnings, precautionary siting and double netting, should be employed if there is a danger of seal predation, and urges the Scottish Government to include current advice in regulation in order to reduce the perceived requirement for shooting licences and to consider producing a long-term plan to introduce closed containment for all fish farming activities in Scotland, whether land or sea based.
