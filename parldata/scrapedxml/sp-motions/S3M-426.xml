*S3M-426 Bob Doris: World’s Biggest Coffee Morning - Friday 28 September 2007—That the Parliament applauds the efforts of Macmillan Cancer Support in organising the World’s Biggest Coffee Morning which will take place this year on Friday 28 September; notes that last year over £650,000 was raised in Scotland alone, and recognises that, while everybody is invited by Glasgow SNP list MSPs, Bob Doris, Sandra White, Bashir Ahmad and Bill Kidd, to attend a special coffee morning between 10.30 am and 11.30 am in rooms 329-332, Baltic Chambers, 50 Wellington Street, Glasgow, other members may find it logistically easier to organise an event in their own areas to support this very worthwhile cause.
