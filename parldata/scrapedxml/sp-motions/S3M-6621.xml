*S3M-6621 Alison McInnes: Scottish Resource Centre for Women in Science, Engineering and Technology—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Resource Centre for Women in Science, Engineering and Technology (SRC) on its excellent work in helping to create sustainable change for the participation of women in the science, engineering and technology (SET) sectors in Scotland; notes that, in 2008, 29% of female graduates in SET were working in the sector that they qualified in compared with 52% of male graduates; recognises that, through running career development events, working with colleges and universities and engaging with employers, SRC is acting to address the underrepresentation of women in the SET workforce, and therefore gives its full support for SRC’s continued success.
