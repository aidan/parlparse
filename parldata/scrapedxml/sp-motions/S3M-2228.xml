*S3M-2228 Angela Constance: Congratulations to the Award Winning "Touch Bionics"—That the Parliament congratulates "Touch Bionics", based in Mid Calder, Livingston, for winning the UK’s top engineering prize, the MacRoberts prize awarded by the Royal Academy of Engineers; applauds Touch Bionics for producing the world’s most advanced commercially available bionic hand, the "i-limb"; notes that the i-limb is a prosthetic state-of-the-art device with five individually powered digits; welcomes this ground-breaking design which is cost effective and more anatomically correct with increased functionality combined with improved cosmesis; recognises that "Touch Bionics" has a proven track record in innovation as it owns a number of patents that enabled the design and manufactured the world’s first complete endoskeletal modular arm, the world’s first powered shoulder fitted for both adults and children and the world’s first partial hand fitted for children, and continues to support, enable and reward ground-breaking innovation in Scotland.
