*S2M-4690 Colin Fox: The Lost Lives of the People of Qanaâ€”That the Parliament is appalled by the brutal deaths of 65 innocent women and children in the Lebanese village of Qana as a result of strikes by Israeli warplanes in the early hours of 30 July 2006; believes that had a ceasefire been negotiated two weeks earlier, as the United Nations and others had proposed, these lives would not have been lost, and further believes that those, such as the British Prime Minister, who oppose the widespread demand to cease hostilities stand condemned alongside those who killed the people at Qana.
