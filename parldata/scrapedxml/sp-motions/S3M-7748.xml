*S3M-7748 John Park: UK Government Attacks Workers’ Rights—That the Parliament notes with concern recent proposals by the UK Government to amend employment legislation including an increase in the length of service needed to claim unfair dismissal from one to two years and the proposed introduction of a fee for starting employment tribunal claims; believes that such proposals will encourage unscrupulous employment practices in Scotland; further believes that business and government should make investment in the skills and training of their workforce a priority rather than make workers increasingly vulnerable to exploitation; dismisses anecdotal claims that tribunals are open to exploitation by vexatious complainants, and considers these proposals to be regressive and to amount to a Thatcherite attack on workers’ rights.
