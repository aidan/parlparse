*S1M-3753# Gordon Jackson: Regeneration of the Clyde-That the Parliament recognises the importance to Scotland of efforts to regenerate the Clyde; considers that the Scottish Executive and Scottish Enterprise should establish and resource a development framework for the Clyde which encourages joined-up thinking and action; further considers that the respective councils, enterprise companies, regeneration agencies and private developers should work co-operatively in reclaiming derelict land, ensuring adequate flood protection and improving the transport infrastructure, and believes that ministers should make the regeneration of the Clyde one of the top economic, environmental and social justice priorities for Scotland.
