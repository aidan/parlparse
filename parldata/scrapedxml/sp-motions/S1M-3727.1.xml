 *S1M-3727.1 Iain Smith: Proportional Representation (Local Government Elections) (Scotland) Bill-As an amendment to motion (S1M-3727) in the name of Tricia Marwick, leave out from "agrees" to end and insert "notes the Local Government Committee's Stage 1 Report on the Proportional Representation (Local Government Elections) Bill and that any change to the election system could not come into effect until the 2007 local government elections at the earliest; further notes the publication by the Scottish Executive of its Local Governance (Scotland) Bill document which fulfils the commitments made to make progress on electoral reform and deals with wider issues to encourage greater participation in local government, and, with regard to the Proportional Representations (Local Government Elections) Bill, therefore does not agree to the general principles of this particular Bill for the reason that its provisions demonstrably do not meet the extensive requirements for renewing local democracy."
