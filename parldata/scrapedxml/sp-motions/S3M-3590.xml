*S3M-3590 John Lamont: Firefighter Safety and Data Collection—That the Parliament applauds the selfless commitment of firefighters to their role in what can so often be very dangerous and extreme circumstances; notes with concern the increased number of firefighter deaths as highlighted in the Fire Brigades Union report, In the Line of Duty; further notes the lack of safety-critical operational guidance for fire authorities highlighted in that report and the deficiency of data collection in respect of firefighter deaths and other serious incidents, and calls for greater clarity and standardisation in the recording and investigation of firefighter fatalities and injuries and for more comprehensive safety guidance for fire authorities.
