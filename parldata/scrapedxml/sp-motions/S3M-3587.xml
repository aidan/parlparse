*S3M-3587 Jamie Hepburn: Royal Mail Senior Management Pensions and the UK Government’s Privatisation Plans—That the Parliament notes with concern the ongoing efforts of the UK Government to part-privatise the Royal Mail; notes that the stated impetus for this is the claimed shortfall in the Royal Mail pension fund; considers that, against this backdrop, the reported £6 million paid into the pension plan of senior managers at the Royal Mail last year, reportedly double the payment of the previous year, is totally unjustified; notes that the chief executive of the Royal Mail, Adam Crozier, has reportedly accrued a £1.1 million pension since joining the organisation in 2003, with a further £1 million paid into a private fund; calls for the Royal Mail’s senior management to reassess their own pension plan largesse; believes that the UK Government has made no convincing case for the part-privatisation of the Royal Mail; congratulates Geraldine Smith MP for lodging Early Day Motion 428 in the House of Commons on the issue of the Royal Mail privatisation, which had attracted the support of 164 MPs by 2 March 2009; agrees with the sentiments of Billy Hayes, general secretary of the Communication Workers Union, that these plans would "nationalise the pension fund and privatise the profit"; further believes that these plans are in fact motivated by Lord Peter Mandelson’s zeal for privatisation, and considers that if the UK Government is so concerned about not having the funds required to maintain the Royal Mail as a public asset then it should ditch its ill-advised plans for identity cards, estimated to cost some £5 billion, or their equally ill-advised plans for the renewal of Trident, estimated by some to cost £70 billion or more.
