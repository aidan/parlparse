*S2M-5235&lt;&gt; Ms Sandra White: Scottish Power Takeover—That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should issue a statement setting out its position in response to Iberdrola’s proposed takeover of Scottish Power; expresses concern that Scotland’s fourth-largest company may pass into foreign ownership without real debate about the effect this will have on jobs at the Glasgow headquarters, energy prices and the Scottish economy, and therefore believes that a Parliamentary debate on the issue should take place at the earliest possible opportunity.
