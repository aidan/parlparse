*S2M-5195 Dennis Canavan: Scottish Football Association Hall of Fame—That the Parliament welcomes the inclusion to the Scottish Football Association (SFA) Hall of Fame of players from other countries who have made an outstanding contribution to Scottish football but regrets the exclusion of some outstanding Scottish players such as Eric Caldow, who captained both Scotland and Rangers, and who, while captaining Scotland for his 40th cap at Wembley, tragically suffered a leg fracture which effectively ended his Scotland career; recognises that Eric Caldow also won 12 Scottish League caps, 5 Scottish League Championship Medals, 2 Scottish Cup Medals and 3 Scottish League Cup Medals; notes his exemplary record of fair play by being one of the few long-serving players who played in the tough atmosphere of Scottish football at that time but was never booked by a referee, and believes, therefore, that Eric Caldow should be included in the SFA Hall of Fame. Supported by: Phil Gallie*, Robin Harper*, Michael McMahon*
