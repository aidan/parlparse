*S2M-162.1 Shiona Baird: Water Industry-As an amendment to motion (S2M-162) in the name of Murdo Fraser, leave out from first "notes" to end and insert "recognises that the supply of clean water is a fundamental human right and therefore must remain in public ownership; acknowledges that the water industry in Scotland has suffered from chronic underinvestment and that comparisons with the privatised water industry in England and Wales are meaningless, and calls for an end to the gradual privatisation of the water industry through the continued use of expensive private finance initiative and public private partnership schemes."
