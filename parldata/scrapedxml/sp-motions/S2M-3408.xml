*S2M-3408 John Farquhar Munro: Condemnation of the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters Unit’s Decision on Annat Bay—That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Scottish Executive Inquiry Reporters Unit recommending that the Crown Estate Commission approves the application for a new salmon farm in Annat Bay, near Ullapool, overturning the democratic decision taken by Highland Council after extensive consultation with the local community; believes that it has made a mockery of the local democratic process by ignoring the views of the local community and its right to manage the local environment in its own way; notes that it is nearly three years since the Parliament voted for planning controls for marine fish farms to be transferred to local authorities; regrets the lack of urgency by the Scottish Executive in bringing into force the relevant section in the Water Environment and Water Services (Scotland) Act 2003, and calls on it to end the interim measures as soon as possible and ensure that any decisions taken under interim arrangements can be reviewed by the democratically elected local authorities.
