*S3M-1566 Annabel Goldie: Scotch Whisky—That the Parliament condemns the decision of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Rt. Hon Alistair Darling MP, to raise the duty on scotch whisky by a staggering 59 pence; notes that Her Majesty’s Government’s own figures show that the increase in duty is likely to reduce revenue; considers that this move is extremely ill-timed and will threaten sales and jobs in the whisky and associated industries, and calls on Her Majesty’s Government to reverse this decision without delay.
