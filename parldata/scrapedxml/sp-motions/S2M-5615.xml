*S2M-5615 Helen Eadie: They Suffered So That We Might Vote—That the Parliament commemorates and celebrates the struggles of 14 February 1907, a century ago, when a record number of 57 suffragettes, plus two men, appeared in court following bitter clashes that lasted for more than five hours between the suffragettes and police officers, many on horseback; notes that the battle marked the then most ferocious battle in the women’s war for the right to vote; remembers, in particular, Christabel Pankhurst and all the other key personalities who fought for this vital democratic right; pays tribute to our friends in Finland, which became the first European country to give women the right to vote, and notes that, while campaigns waged in Britain and America, Finland saw women from all social classes sworn in as members of the Finnish Parliament; further remembers that Labour’s Keir Hardie’s Women’s Enfranchisement Bill was defeated on 8 March 1907; commends to every women today in Scotland, young and old, the memory that must not be forgotten of the grim, determined, ferocious struggle that it took for women to have the right to vote; hopes that women across Scotland will celebrate this precious right by making sure that they use their vote in the forthcoming elections, and notes that they also can now apply for a postal vote which enables them to vote easily, minimising any external pressures that might otherwise present barriers to their trip to the polling station.
