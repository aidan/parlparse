*S2M-2146# Mr Kenneth Macintosh: Skin Disease to be Recognised as a Chronic Condition—That the Parliament recognises the potentially debilitating affect of skin disease on many individuals in Scotland; notes the distress, discomfort, isolation and frustration experienced by many people with skin disease; believes that the impact on people’s lives, on their self-esteem and relationships with others is often underestimated; notes that classifying skin disease as a minor ailment fails to take account of the effect it can have on people’s lives; welcomes recent initiatives, such as Skin Action Scotland, as a move in the right direction in giving dermatological services the priority they deserve within the health service, and believes that the Scottish Executive should recognise skin disease as a chronic condition, so giving residents in East Renfrewshire and elsewhere assistance with prescription charges and giving them better access to the best drugs and treatment available.
