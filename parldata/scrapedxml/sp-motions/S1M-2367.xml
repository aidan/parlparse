 *S1M-2367 Bristow Muldoon: Outdoor Access for All—That the Parliament notes the calls of 14,550 individuals and organisations from both Scotland and around the world, including the Scottish Human Rights Centre, who have supported the petition to the Parliament on outdoor access by the Scottish Environment LINK Access Network, Scottish Sports Association and Scottish Countryside Access Network and believes that the Land Reform (Scotland) Bill should establish a right to responsible access for all and improve and confirm, rather than threaten and restrict, access opportunities for all those who enjoy Scotland's countryside and for those communities that depend upon the business which derives from that access.
