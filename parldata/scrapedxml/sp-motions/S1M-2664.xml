*S1M-2664 Donald Gorrie: UK Life League-That the Parliament condemns unreservedly the tactics employed by the UK Life League, particularly in terms of the horrific practice of using photos of aborted foetuses and the personal tragedy of individuals in the public eye, for extremely dubious political ends; regrets that any group can deliberately misuse such material, particularly with the specific intention of inducing fear, misinformation and confusion amongst women; notes that the UK Life League website is a haven for such propaganda, which is almost entirely based on falsehood and lies, including the appropriation of other groups' logos and misrepresentation of them to imply their support for the "values" of the UK Life League, and reaffirms its commitment to freedom of speech for all pressure groups, including legitimate pro-life organisations, while remaining absolutely committed to the principle that it is a woman's right to choose.
