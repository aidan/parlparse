 *S2M-3118 Richard Baker: Rural Schools in Moray—That the Parliament notes with concern Moray Council’s proposals to merge or close 21 small or rural schools; notes the widespread opposition to the proposals amongst parents and local communities that has led to the Moray Save our Schools Campaign and other local campaign groups being set up; believes that small or rural schools play a vital role in ensuring the success and sustainability of rural communities; recognises that, while it is right and proper for local authorities to review and seek to improve their school’s infrastructure, this must be done in full consultation with parents and should take into account the invaluable role of sustainable rural schools, and believes that Moray Council should recognise the strength of feeling amongst parents and local communities and re-evaluate its proposals.
