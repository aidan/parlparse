*S2M-3418 Chris Ballance: Use of Scottish Airports by CIA Rendition Flightsâ€”That the Parliament notes the information from the US Federal Aviation Administration concerning the use of Scottish airports by CIA rendition flights which states that such flights have stopped at Prestwick Airport on 75 occasions and Glasgow Airport 74 times; notes that these flights transport terror suspects for interrogation in countries where torture is accepted and even commonplace; notes that torture has been illegal since 1984 under the UN Convention Against Torture, and calls on the Scottish Executive urgently to investigate and report on all CIA rendition flights that have used Scottish airports and to make a statement regarding what measures are being taken to ensure that Scotland is not complicit in, nor guilty of, aiding and abetting torture.
