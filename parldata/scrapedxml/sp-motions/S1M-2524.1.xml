 *S1M-2524.1 Tommy Sheridan: Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill-As an amendment to motion (S1M-2524) in the name of Mr Andy Kerr, leave out from "agrees" and insert "does not agree that the Scottish Local Government (Elections) Bill be passed because it believes that it is important for the health of local government that local elections be held separately from those for the Parliament and further believes that local government elections should next be held in 2002 since currently elected councillors have no democratic mandate after then."
