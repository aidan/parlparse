*S3M-6393.2 Ross Finnie: Progress Towards 18 Week Referral to Treatmentâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-6393) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, insert at end ", believes that the achievement of the 18-week Referral to Treatment standard must not be at the expense of patients waiting to access services not covered by the guarantee or patients waiting for follow-up appointments; recognises that clinical need and patient care should always take precedence over fulfilling political targets, and therefore considers that the achievement of maximum waiting times should ultimately be at the discretion of clinicians."
