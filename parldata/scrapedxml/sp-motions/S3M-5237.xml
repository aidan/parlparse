*S3M-5237 Liam McArthur: Orkney RFC Win Scottish Hydro Club of the Month—That the Parliament congratulates Orkney RFC for becoming the first island-based rugby club in two years to be recognised with the Scottish Hydro Club of the Month award and the £1,000 prize; notes that the club has enjoyed an extraordinary start to its Scottish Hydro Caledonia Division One campaign, winning 10 out of 10 games by an average of 39 points per match, which is an impressive feat for a side that begins all but one away fixture with a seven-hour ferry journey; understands that the award also recognises the club’s excellent disciplinary record and its extensive rugby development work in partnership with Scottish Rugby and Orkney Islands Council, which led to the appointment of Scotland’s first island-based jointly funded development officer, Bruce Ruthven, and offers best wishes to all the club’s players, coaches and the many volunteers who support it for continued success for the rest of the season.
