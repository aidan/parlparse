*S3M-4153 Anne McLaughlin: Saluting Learning Experience of Glasgow School Campaign Children—That the Parliament recognises that some of the most valuable learning experiences gained by children take place by engaging democratically with their local community; notes that children who participated in campaigns to save Glasgow schools and nurseries have learned valuable lessons in citizenship that will serve them well throughout their lives, such as how to write petitions and collect signatures, how to communicate with the media, how to build campaigns and how to work with elected officials; further notes that children and families gained valuable experience working with their counterparts in schools and nurseries from different cultural, ethnic and faith groupings across the city; congratulates Glasgow’s schoolchildren for the way in which they are conducting themselves during this difficult time, and wishes them well for the future.
