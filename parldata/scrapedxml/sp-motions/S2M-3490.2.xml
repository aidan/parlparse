*S2M-3490.2 Mr Adam Ingram: Children with Special Needsâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-3490) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from "recognises" to end and insert "supports the fundamental principle of inclusion that was introduced into our education system with the presumption of mainstreaming; recognises the widespread concerns that the resources made available to implement the policy have been inadequate, and calls, therefore, for a review of the operation of the policy to establish what additional means are required to ensure that every pupil with additional support needs has the opportunity to fulfil his or her potential, either within the mainstream setting or in a special school depending on their individual circumstances."
