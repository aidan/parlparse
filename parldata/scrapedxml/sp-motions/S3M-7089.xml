*S3M-7089 Willie Coffey: Kilmarnock to Carnoustie, a Long Walk for a Good Cause—That the Parliament congratulates the supporters of East Ayrshire Carers Centre on completion of a 150-mile walk from the Carers Cottage in Kilmarnock to the Carlogie House Hotel, Carnoustie; notes that the walk was designed to raise awareness of the centre’s new respite facility at the Carlogie House Hotel, which has been turned into a retreat for people of all ages who have responsibility for looking after a sick or disabled family member, and recognises that the project follows on from the success of the East Ayrshire Carers Centre at Dalmellington, which runs training courses for young carers and provides a holiday facility for children from all over the United Kingdom who look after someone at home.
