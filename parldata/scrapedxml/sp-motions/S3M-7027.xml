*S3M-7027 Maureen Watt: Unight Aberdeen—That the Parliament notes the success of the Unight scheme in Aberdeen in driving down drink-related antisocial behaviour in Aberdeen city centre; welcomes the joint approach between the pubs and clubs involved, which means that a ban from one venue for antisocial behaviour is a ban from them all; notes that drug detection rates have doubled since the scheme was introduced while serious assaults in pubs and clubs have fallen by 20%, and believes that the full involvement of licensed premises is vital in making pubs and nightclubs safer for everyone to enjoy.
