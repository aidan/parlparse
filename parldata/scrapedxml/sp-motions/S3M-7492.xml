 *S3M-7492 Iain Smith: Save RAF Leuchars—That the Parliament expresses its appreciation and admiration for what it considers the essential role in the defence of the United Kingdom played by RAF Leuchars; commends the professionalism and dedication of all the military personnel who serve or are based there; considers that those who have been deployed from Leuchars on active service have given exemplary service in the Falklands, Iraq and Afghanistan and elsewhere; believes that existing plans to deploy three squadrons of Eurofighter Typhoon aircraft at Leuchars are strategically correct; calls on the Secretary of State for Defence to confirm these plans at the earliest possible date and to recognise that Leuchars is a centre of defence excellence not only for RAF fighter squadrons but also Territorial Army 71 Engineer Regiment, 58 Squadron of the Royal Air Force Regiment, the East of Scotland Universities Air Squadron, the regimental headquarters of the RAF cadets in Scotland, the Royal Auxiliary Air Force and other units; further calls on the Secretary of State for Defence to acknowledge that RAF Leuchars is in the right place at the right time and doing the right job for which it is uniquely qualified by way of experience, expertise, preparation and capability, and invites him to confirm the long-term role of RAF Leuchars in the defence of the United Kingdom. Supported by: Jim Hume*, Tricia Marwick*
