 *S1M-2985 David Mundell: Dumfries and Galloway Managed Clinical Network for Heart Disease-That the Parliament recognises that the Dumfries and Galloway Managed Clinical Network for Heart Disease was the first of its kind in the United Kingdom and is a way of focusing and providing care across the boundaries between general practice and hospital and between different health professions with a focus on patients and their needs; notes that, although the network has only been in existence for nine months, it is having a tremendous impact on the quality of care provided, with patients, doctors and nurses involved actively in decision-making about the future of service and on the use of scarce resources; further notes that the pre-hospital thrombolysis service in the area was also the first of its kind in the United Kingdom and will allow life-saving clot-dissolving drugs to be given to patients suffering from a heart attack before they get to hospital, and congratulates all those who have been involved in Dumfries and Galloway in bringing about these cutting edge developments in health services provision.
