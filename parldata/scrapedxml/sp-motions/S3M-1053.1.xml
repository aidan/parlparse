*S3M-1053.1 Malcolm Chisholm: EU Reform Treatyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-1053) in the name of Linda Fabiani, leave out from "the UK Government" to end and insert "membership of the European Union has been hugely positive for Scotland and Britain, delivering more jobs, a single market, freedom to work and live abroad, environmental protection, security and an enhanced place for Scotland and Britain in the world; believes that the European Union needs to become more efficient, more effective and more accountable and welcomes the signing of the European Reform Treaty as a significant step towards tackling these concerns, and believes that the treaty will allow the European Union to move on from debates about institutions to concentrating on the fundamental challenges of climate change, globalisation, terrorism and international development."
