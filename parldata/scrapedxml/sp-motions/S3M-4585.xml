*S3M-4585 Pauline McNeill: Work Begins on Aircraft Carriers—That the Parliament warmly welcomes the first cut of steel for the aircraft carriers that will become HMS Queen Elizabeth and HMS Prince of Wales, large sections of which will be built on the Clyde and at Rosyth Dockyard, providing work for the foreseeable future for nearly 4,000 shipyard workers on the Clyde; further welcomes the commitment of the UK Government to the aircraft carriers that will come into service in 2016; notes the UK Government’s view that this work provides the basis for a longer-term sustainable future, thus securing jobs and skills on the Clyde, and further notes that these carriers highlight the performance and ability in Scottish shipbuilding and ship design, which continues to be of a world-class standard, and that this success allows for the largest apprenticeship programme in Scotland and as such represents a major contribution to the Scottish economy.
