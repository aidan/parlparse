*S3M-2471 Irene Oldfather: Dementia Research Network for Scotland—That the Parliament welcomes the formal opening of the Dementia Research Network for Scotland on Friday 29 August 2008; agrees that the network will play a significant role in bringing together Scotland’s leading academic and clinical experts conducting research into dementia and potential treatments; notes that the network will also collaborate with similar networks across the United Kingdom; further notes that the research hubs will be positioned across Scotland in order to allow participating patients easer access to facilities; recognises its creation as part of the wider campaign to ensure that Scotland is prepared for a large increase in the number of people with dementia in the next two decades, and looks forward to its findings in the coming years.
