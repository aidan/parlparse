 * S2M-2970 Rosie Kane: The President of the United States of America’s Gas Bill—That the Parliament is sceptical that any potential terror attack can be averted by the production of utility bills, which all visitors must present before they will be allowed near the Parliament building at the time of the G8 visit to Scotland; believes that this is an intimidating practice which serves no useful purpose, and demands that George W Bush should produce the bills that the United States of America (USA) sent to Saddam Hussein for the purchase of gas bought from the USA by the Iraqi regime and which was subsequently used in the slaughter of Kurdish people in Northern Iraq. Supported by: Frances Curran*, Carolyn Leckie*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*
