*S3M-7762 John Wilson: Insecticide Hazard to Bees—That the Parliament notes with concern the report by the Independent newspaper on 20 January 2011 that raises the potential that honeybee colonies in Britain are being poisoned by the use of neonicotinoid insecticides; further notes that this discovery follows on from research conducted in the US Department of Agriculture’s Bee Research Laboratory that found that neonicotinoid insecticides may be causing colony collapse disorder throughout the world; acknowledges that more than 1.4 million acres were reported to have been treated with these insecticides in 2008, and calls on the UK and Scottish governments to suspend the use of these chemical compounds as a precautionary measure to allow for further clarity to be sought on their effects.
