S3M-4549 Murdo Fraser: Knockhill Racing Circuit’s Teen Drive—That the Parliament commends the work of Scotland’s national motorsport centre, Knockhill Racing Circuit, for its important and proactive work to reduce young-driver accident rates in Scotland; notes that 17 to 21-year-olds make up 4.4% of Scotland’s driving population but comprise 17% of all car drivers killed or seriously injured in road traffic collisions; welcomes the work of Knockhill Racing Circuit to address this issue with its innovative Teen Drive programme, which gives youngsters aged between 13 and 16 the opportunity to drive in a secure environment as well as having racing drivers teaching the youngsters best practice habits at an early age; wishes Knockhill Racing Circuit continued success, and believes that its initiative will save lives in the long term.
