*S3M-1005 Kenneth Gibson: Widening the Gap Between Rich and Poor—That the Parliament notes with concern that the gap between rich and poor has reached levels not seen for more than 40 years with the level of social mobility in the United Kingdom among the lowest of any developed country; believes that this inequality can only be exacerbated by the abolition of the 10% tax rate, announced by the Prime Minister in his last Budget as Chancellor of the Exchequer, to be implemented from April 2008; strongly disapproves of this fiscal measure which hits those earning less than £17,000 per annum, effectively increasing the amount of income tax that they must pay; understands that those on low pay lose the benefit of the 10% lower rate and do not have enough income chargeable at the 22% rate to benefit from the cut to 20%; acknowledges that, according to analysis by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, around one-fifth of families in the United Kingdom will be worse off as a direct result of this measure and that three out of four women will pay more tax; is aware that, because the wage gap between Scotland and England is over £2,000, there are more lower-paid workers in Scotland, therefore hard-working Scots will be heavily penalised by this measure; is alarmed that, according to figures published by Deloitte, in 22 Scottish Westminster parliamentary constituencies more than 50% of workers will be worse off, including North Ayrshire and Arran, and therefore condemns what the abolition of the 10% tax rate means in practice, which is that the poor are subsidising the better off and urges the Scottish Government to lobby the UK Government to reconsider this measure.
