*S3M-1966 George Foulkes: Boiling Point for School Kitchens—That the Parliament opposes any move by the SNP-led City of Edinburgh Council to close 14 of the 18 state nursery kitchens and several primary school kitchens across the city; rejects plans to replace hot nutritious school meals made onsite with transported meals and cold sandwiches made centrally; recognises the value of hot nutritious school meals being served at school, particularly to children in deprived areas; acknowledges the January 2008 HM Inspectorate of Education report, Further Food for Thought, that highlights the adverse effects to the quality and nutritional value of food when transported; believes that serving mass-produced school dinners from silver foil trays is an insult to the skills of local school cooks; further believes that this move contradicts the SNP’s commitment to investing in and promoting healthy school meals; rejects the 10p increase on the price of school meals combined with budget cuts of £10,000 for every primary and £50,000 for every secondary school across the city of Edinburgh; believes that this contradicts all ministerial statements about the nutritional value of school meals; believes that a controversial decision of this nature should be made in consultation with pupils, parents and education officials rather than a back-door costcutting exercise by officials, and ultimately believes that the SNP, whether in the Parliament or in local government, will always put pounds signs before people and, in this case, Edinburgh’s youngest and poorest children.
