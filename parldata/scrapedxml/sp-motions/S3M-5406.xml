*S3M-5406 Stuart McMillan: Cuts to Army Cadet Force—That the Parliament expresses concern that the UK Government plans to cut the Army Cadet Force budget by £4 million; notes the UK Government’s turnaround on residency rights for the Gurkhas and planned cuts to the Territorial Army; considers that the army cadets are the soldiers of tomorrow and that these short-sighted cuts risk the future of an organisation that has given young people a taste of military discipline and leadership for nearly 150 years, and therefore calls on the UK Government to abandon proposed cuts to the Army Cadet Force.
