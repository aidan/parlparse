 *S2M-4081.4 Richard Lochhead: Agriculture Strategy—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4081) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "and approves" to end and insert "while approving many of the actions outlined in the strategy, regrets the lack of support and initiative from Ministers for the farmers’ campaign to curb the power of the supermarkets and secure a more equitable trading relationship throughout the supply chain; calls for more effort to allow agriculture to compete on a level playing field by addressing the issue of inferior imports and costly red tape; further calls on Ministers to do more to promote locally produced food, especially through the use of public procurement, not only to boost the industry but to cut the number of food miles, and urges the Executive to accelerate the production of energy crops."
