*S3M-7296 Patrick Harvie: Funding for Glasgow Fastlink—That the Parliament notes the delay by the Scottish Government in making a decision on funding for the Fastlink proposals in Glasgow; condemns the Government’s decision to consider only the £37 million route, the cheapest of the three proposals; considers that choosing this lowest price scheme is completely unacceptable when a detailed examination by Glasgow City Council and Strathclyde Partnership for Transport has deemed the middle-priced £60 million route to be best value for money; notes that similar concerns about delay and stalling by the Scottish Government were raised ahead of the cancellation of the Glasgow Airport Rail Link and a decision not to fund Glasgow Crossrail; believes that the existing public transport links to the new Southern General are poor and that there will therefore be a particularly serious impact on residents in Glasgow’s southside if Fastlink is cancelled; further believes that this government has inappropriately prioritised investment in roads projects ahead of support for public transport and active travel, and urges the Scottish Government to give Scotland’s largest city a higher priority and improved investment for public transport.
