*S3M-2702 Joe FitzPatrick: Ending Mass Rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo—That the Parliament welcomes the Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund (SCIAF) publication Ending Mass Rape in the Democratic Republic of Congo: The Role of the International Community, which highlights that sexual violence and other human rights abuses in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) ruin countless lives and threaten the peace and security of the troubled region; notes that in Shabunda region of South Kivu 70% of the women have been raped and that 50% of those women raped are aged under 18; further notes that the high number of rapes are a direct result of the continuing conflict in the eastern region of the DRC, which involves Congolese forces, neighbouring countries - including Rwanda and over 20 independent militias; condemns the use of rape as a tool of war to humiliate and destroy communities, and calls on the UK Government to step up its efforts to end this horror and increase desperately needed care for survivors.
