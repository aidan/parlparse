*S3M-3052 John Scott: Arrrest of British Missionaries in the Gambiaâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the arrest in the Gambia of Christian missionaries David Fulton, formerly of Troon, and his wife, Fiona, and the fact that they have been charged with sedition; also notes with concern that Mr Fulton is being held at a high security jail outside the capital, Banjul, and that his wife is being held with their two-year-old adopted daughter at a police station in the capital; further notes the criticisms made of the human rights and civil liberties record of the Gambian Government by international rights organisations, and calls on the UK Government to exercise all possible influence to have Mr and Mrs Fulton released.
