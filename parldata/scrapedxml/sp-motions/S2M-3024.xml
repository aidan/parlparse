 * S2M-3024 Bruce Crawford:Plea to BBC to Recognise the Contribution and Sacrifice Made by Scots at the Battle of Trafalgar—That the Parliament notes that the BBC website has an article recording the fact that it is 200 years since the British fleet defeated Napoleon’s combined French and Spanish forces at the Battle of Trafalgar; expresses its disappointment that the map of the battle, supporting the article, describes the British forces as being English, and exhorts the BBC to amend the map to reflect accurately the historical fact that it was a British fleet, therefore properly recognising the contribution and sacrifice made by the many Scots who helped secure the famous victory.
