 *S2M-2922 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Protection for Places of Worship—That the Parliament condemns the recent rise in anti-Semitic crime in Scotland and deplores all racism and bigotry, no matter what form it takes; congratulates Strathclyde Police on its current poster campaign encouraging the victims of such crime to report it to the appropriate authorities, thus helping to raise awareness and ensure that the police have a more accurate picture of this issue; notes with concern that the Community Security Trust, which monitors anti-Semitic incidents, has recorded a doubling of anti-Semitic offences in the Strathclyde area in the last two years, and urges the Scottish Executive to ensure that synagogues, mosques, churches and all other places of worship throughout Scotland have the necessary funding to increase their security as required by reopening the previously-available security fund for places of worship which closed in 2002.
