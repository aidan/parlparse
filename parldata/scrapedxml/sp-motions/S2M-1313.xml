*S2M-1313# Ms Rosemary Byrne: Screening for Teenage Killer-That the Parliament notes that cardiomyopathy, a thickening of the heart muscles, without screening grows undetected at the body's fastest growing time, the teenage years, that apparently healthy teenagers can suffer from this condition and that the condition kills a large number of teenagers annually; further notes that Scottish H.A.R.T, a registered charity, researches all forms of heart disease, raises funds for mobile screening of young people and families at risk and has raised hundreds of thousands of pounds to put monitoring equipment into sports centres, swimming pools and youth facilities across Scotland, and considers that the Scottish Executive should ensure provision of sufficient funding to make sure that monitoring equipment is provided in sports centres, swimming pools and youth facilities in line with recent funding allocations in England and Wales.
