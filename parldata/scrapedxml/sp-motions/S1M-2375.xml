*S1M-2375 Michael Russell: Literature on Scottish History, Heritage and Culture-That the Parliament congratulates Professor Michael Lynch, his editorial team, contributors and the Oxford University Press on the publication of The Oxford Companion to Scottish History; notes that 10% of the half million or so words in the companion are devoted to Scots overseas; asserts that this book will provide an indispensable and invaluable addition to the growing academic but accessible literature on Scottish history, heritage and culture, and expresses its gratitude to all those who are working to ensure that the study and practice of these subjects overcomes generations of mainstream neglect, indifference and hostility and, by so doing, contributes greatly to the re-emergence of a confident, outward looking nation which is more than capable of taking its independent place in the world.
