*S1M-3845 Cathy Peattie: Contracting out of Parliament's Mail Services-That the Parliament notes with concern the possible transfer of mail services to a new operator following the move to the new Parliament building at Holyrood despite widespread satisfaction with the existing service; considers that such major contracts should not be put out to tender without full consultation with trade unions and service users regarding the use of the tendering process and the nature and specifications of such contracts, and, accordingly, calls for a full review of the procurement procedures.
