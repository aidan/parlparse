*S3M-1350 Angela Constance: Congratulations to West Lothian Council on the 2008-09 Budget—That the Parliament congratulates West Lothian Council and the SNP-led administration on its 2008-09 budget which delivers a £13.9 million increase in service expenditure, bringing the total service expenditure to £338 million and overall total expenditure to £361 million; welcomes the freeze in council tax in addition to the implementation of the COSLA/Scottish Government concordat providing, for example, more police on the beat and the expansion of safer neighbourhood teams; notes that, despite scaremongering in relation to the removal of ring-fencing, West Lothian Council will invest an additional £4.7 million, an 8% increase, in resources for the most vulnerable, and welcomes and congratulates West Lothian Council on its decision not to ration free personal care and to fund a multi-agency service for victims of domestic abuse and their children, the first in Scotland.
