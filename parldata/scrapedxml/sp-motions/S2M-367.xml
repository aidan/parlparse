*S2M-367# Fiona Hyslop: Congestion Charging-That the Parliament considers that the Scottish Executive should reject the congestion charging scheme if submitted to it in its current form by the City of Edinburgh Council for approval, as the scheme discriminates against residents of Midlothian, West Lothian and surrounding areas commuting to Edinburgh for employment purposes and will result in such residents paying disproportionately for Edinburgh's transport problem without commensurate improvement in public transport in Midlothian, West Lothian and surrounding areas.
