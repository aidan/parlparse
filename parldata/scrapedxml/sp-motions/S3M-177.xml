*S3M-177 Bob Doris: Glasgow Housing Association Pilot Schemes On Second Stage Transfer—That the Parliament acknowledges that second stage transfer of Glasgow Housing Association’s (GHA) housing stock to responsive and accountable local housing organisations (LHOs) was a core part of the GHA stock transfer agreement; hopes that, despite regrettable delays in this process, the five pilot schemes currently being progressed within the city will be successful; further notes that the time constraint for LHOs to submit their revised business plans to the GHA is unrealistically short, and therefore urges the GHA to afford the LHOs involved in the pilot projects appropriate time to present their revised business plans.
