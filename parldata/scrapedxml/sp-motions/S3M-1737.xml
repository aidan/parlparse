*S3M-1737 Stuart McMillan: River Clyde Pilots Strike Actionâ€”That the Parliament notes with concern the strike action taking place by the River Clyde Marine Pilots Association; further notes that the pilots do a vital job in the safe navigating and manoeuvring of vessels of all sizes as such operations demand high nautical skills; acknowledges that the pilots have various concerns with the competent harbour authority, Clydeport Operations Ltd, including maritime safety, and hopes for a speedy and unanimous resolution to this dispute to ensure that safety matters are always considered and the economic performance of the River Clyde is not undermined.
