*S2M-3887 Jackie Baillie: Inclusion and Support of Young People with Learning Disabilities—That the Parliament welcomes the efforts of the Scottish Executive to enable the inclusion of young people with learning disabilities in mainstream education where it is appropriate to do so; believes that the transitions from school to further education and from further education to employment are still difficult; considers that the Executive needs to ensure a better focus at these times so that it can improve the opportunities and choices of young people with learning disabilities, and notes that continuing efforts need to be made to further ensure inclusion within the community.
