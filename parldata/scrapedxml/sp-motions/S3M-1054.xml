*S3M-1054 Bill Wilson: Parking Charges Based on Emissions—That the Parliament welcomes the City of Edinburgh Council’s approval of standing order 28 which recognised that vehicle emissions are a significant contributor to climate change and called for a report on the introduction of differential parking charges in Edinburgh based on vehicles’ carbon dioxide emissions and calls, in turn, on the Scottish Government to take note of the findings of this report and to consider encouraging local authorities throughout Scotland to adopt differential parking charges, based on emissions, should the council report suggest such a policy to be feasible and likely to be effective at reducing Scotland’s greenhouse gas production.
