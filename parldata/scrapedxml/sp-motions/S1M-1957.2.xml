 *S1M-1957.2 Mr Brian Monteith: Education—As an amendment to motion (S1M-1957) in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from "further notes" to end and insert "believes that there is no uniform homogenous educational system that can provide the right type of education for every child and that such a dogmatic approach should be replaced with a liberal and diverse system which provides specialisation by schools and more choice for parents; further believes that class size is only one aspect of educational provision which may help to improve standards in Scotland’s schools, and considers that greater devolution of decision making to teachers and parents should be the goal of the Scottish Executive.
