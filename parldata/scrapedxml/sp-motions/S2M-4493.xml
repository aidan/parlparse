*S2M-4493 Christine Grahame: Scottish National Minimum Wage Helpline—That the Parliament notes with concern the failure of the Department of Trade and Industry (DTI) to continue funding the Scottish National Minimum Wage Helpline which will have to close on 30 June 2006 following a successful pilot; notes that the helpline has helped 200 Scots to secure wage arrears of £50,000 since January 2003 and assisted 3,000 callers to resolve wage issues, thus avoiding an official complaint against their employers; notes that the service is available to individuals both as employees and employers, Jobcentres, citizens advice bureaux and other local advice centres; further notes that it provides this at an annual cost of £36,000 per annum, which is incidentally 1% of Scottish Enterprise’s overspend; recognises, while the DTI is pinch-penny, the cost-effective service that the helpline provides, and therefore considers that the Scottish government should provide this funding, particularly in light of the substantial support which, in contrast, it gives to Scottish Enterprise.
