 *S3M-6730 Kenneth Gibson: Self-Determination for Cataloniaâ€”That the Parliament notes that more than one million people marched in Barcelona on Saturday 10 July 2010 todemand the right to self-determination for Catalonia after the Spanish constitutional courtrejected articles from the Catalan statute of autonomy, whichhad beenapproved by Catalan voters in a 2006 referendum; considers that this decision is a slap in the face to the right to self-determination as enshrined in the United Nations Charter; is of the view that there is no reason why a people should not decide how they are governed, and looks forward to a time when both Catalonia and Scotland will, through independence, be permitted to engage fully in the community of nations as independent sovereign states.
