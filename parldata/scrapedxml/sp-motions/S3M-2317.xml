*S3M-2317 Helen Eadie: K’Nex Challenge Regional Finalists—That the Parliament congratulates two P5 girls from Lochgelly South Primary School, Kayleigh and Lindy, on going through to the Scottish south-east regional final of the annual K’Nex Challenge, having won two previous rounds by making a K’Nex model according to a set of instructions given on the day; applauds the initiative, organised across Scotland by SETPOINT Scotland, that encourages primary school children with an interest in design and engineering by inspiring them to use K’Nex to produce a design solution for an engineering problem, and hopes that Lochgelly South Primary School’s staff will continue to support their very talented pupils to achieve further success in future competitions.
