 *S3M-2367 Kenneth Gibson: Aids 2008—That the Parliament congratulates the success, and endorses the aims, of the XVII International Aids Conference 2008, held in Mexico City from 3 to 8 August, and its theme of Universal Action Now; recognises that 33 million people are currently living with HIV worldwide; is aware that three times more people are infected each day than begin antiretroviral treatment; believes that universal access to HIV prevention, treatment, care and support and eliminating the stigma often encountered by those suffering from HIV/AIDS is the key to reducing the spread of a disease that has killed around 25 million people worldwide over the last quarter of a century, including at least 1,600 in Scotland, and acknowledges that only continued global co-operation to eliminate poverty and full resourcing of health services and agencies battling with HIV/AIDS will lead to the eventual elimination of this scourge.
