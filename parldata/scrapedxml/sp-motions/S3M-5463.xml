 *S3M-5463 Sandra White: Scottish Development International Trade Mission to Israel—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed trade mission on 10 to 15 January 2010 organised by Scottish Development International (SDI) to Israel, a state that is currently in contravention of numerous United Nations General Assembly and Security Council resolutions and stands accused of serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law during the Gaza conflict, amounting to war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity; notes that this trade mission was postponed in January 2009 after advice from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in the wake of Israel’s December 2008 offensive, and, while welcoming the Scottish Government’s clear position on the situation in Gaza and the substantial package of humanitarian aid announced last year by the Deputy First Minister, urges SDI to reconsider its current stance while Israel continues to flout international law and stands accused of possible crimes against humanity. Supported by: Patrick Harvie*, Hugh O’Donnell*, Bill Kidd*, Christine Grahame*, Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Robin Harper*, Bill Wilson*, Aileen Campbell*, Mike Pringle*, Elaine Smith* Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
