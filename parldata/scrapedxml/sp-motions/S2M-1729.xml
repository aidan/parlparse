 *S2M-1729# Colin Fox: Stock Transfer—That the Parliament is opposed to the transfer of council housing stocks out of local authority control and into the hands of housing associations; believes that this policy represents the abandonment of the ethos of public sector housing provision; recognises the failure in the right to buy legislation to allow local authorities to reinvest monies received in new rented housing stock and the need to change this injustice; further recognises that many council properties were sold off for less than it cost to build them and that local authority tenants were, in effect, subsidising the right to buy scheme itself; believes that publicly-owned, high quality rented accommodation is badly needed in Scotland, and considers that council tenants in Edinburgh, Dundee and Aberdeen should vote against stock transfer proposals in local referenda in favour of a council house building programme that serves the need of tens of thousands of Scottish families for affordable, high quality rented accommodation which remains owned by us all and where the management remains accountable to the public it serves.
