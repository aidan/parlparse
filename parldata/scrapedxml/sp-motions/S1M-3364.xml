 *S1M-3364 Nora Radcliffe: Iraq-That the Parliament notes with concern the current situation in Iraq; acknowledges that there is, as yet, no firm evidence that military intervention in Iraq at this stage would have the support of the British public; believes that any military action in Iraq should not take place without a debate in the House of Commons followed by a substantive vote by MPs; further believes that the first priority of Her Majesty's Government must be to ensure the return of the United Nations (UN) weapons inspectors under UN auspices; considers that any further steps in relation to Iraq must be consistent with the rule of international law, and urges the Prime Minister to recall the UK Parliament as soon as he returns from the Camp David summit with President Bush, so that the international situation can be discussed in detail.
