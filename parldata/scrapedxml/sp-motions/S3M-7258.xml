 *S3M-7258 Pauline McNeill: Tennents Bar Glasgow—That the Parliament notes the recent sale of Tennents Bar on Byres Road in Glasgow’s west end; notes the strength of feeling against potential changes and is aware of petitions against the move; considers that Tennents Bar has become a landmark on Byres Road and a Glasgow institution, and recognises that it has become a much-loved establishment.
