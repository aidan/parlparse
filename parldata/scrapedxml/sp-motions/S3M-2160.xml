*S3M-2160 Jack McConnell: Congratulations to St Bernadette’s Primary School—That the Parliament congratulates St Bernadette’s Primary School in Tullibody on raising £1,100 this year for Nankhwala Catholic Primary School in Monkey Bay in Malawi through activities such as a fundraising "Mile Marathon" and a café selling healthy food; recognises that this achievement is even more impressive as there are only 75 children at the school; further recognises that this encourages children to develop positive attitudes and values, and hopes that other schools in Scotland will follow this example to build strong links with schools in Malawi and elsewhere in the developing world.
