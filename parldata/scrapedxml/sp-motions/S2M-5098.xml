*S2M-5098 Nicol Stephen: Supporting Positive Transitions from School Towards Work—That the Parliament acknowledges that the transition to adulthood is an important stage in people’s lives; welcomes the fact that the vast majority of young people successfully engage in education, volunteering, training and employment opportunities; agrees that supporting all young people to utilise these opportunities in the transition from school towards work is a national priority, and endorses the leadership of the Scottish Executive, working with schools, colleges, voluntary organisations and employers in Scotland through the NEET strategy, in seeking a successful and positive outcome for all young people.
