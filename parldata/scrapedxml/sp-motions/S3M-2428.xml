 *S3M-2428 Kenneth Gibson: Congratulations to Crosshouse Hospital Volunteers—That the Parliament congratulates Crosshouse Hospital Volunteers on presenting NHS Ayrshire and Arran with a cheque for £250,000, raised through running Crosshouse Hospital’s shop, café and ward trolley service along with a small café/shop in Ayrshire Maternity Unit; notes that this impressive donation will help purchase important equipment such as hospital scanners, beds, chairs and occupational therapy equipment; is aware that since the volunteers succeeded the Women’s Royal Voluntary Service seven years ago they have donated an incredible £1.5 million in total, making a real difference to patients, staff and visitors, and believes that the continued hard work and dedication of the volunteers to NHS Ayrshire and Arran is an inspiration to all.
