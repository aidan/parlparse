 *S3M-4331 Jackie Baillie: Amber Nectar Goes Green—That the Parliament congratulates the Scotch Whisky industry on its ambitious new environmental strategy, the first industry strategy of its kind in Scotland; understands that the targets include cutting the use of fossil fuels by 80% by 2050, saving over 750,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, the equivalent of taking 235,000 cars off Scotland’s roads; believes that the new strategy builds on more than £100 million of investment across the industry in environment-related improvements over the last 18 months, and praises the industry for understanding that a clean and healthy environment is a crucial ingredient in the production of Scotland’s national drink. Supported by: John Park*, Kenneth Gibson*, Trish Godman*, Mike Pringle*, Jamie McGrigor*, Bill Butler*, Maureen Watt*
