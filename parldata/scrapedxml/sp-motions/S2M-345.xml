 *S2M-345 Murdo Fraser: Swedish Referendum on Euro Membershipâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the convincing result of the Swedish referendum on euro membership; congratulates the people of Sweden for having the courage to vote "No" to the euro in such large numbers against the weight of the entire political, business and media establishment; agrees with the Swedish people that joining the euro would not be in the economic interests of Sweden and would have meant a substantial loss of national sovereignty, and looks forward to Her Majesty's Government calling a euro referendum here at the earliest opportunity in order that the people of Scotland can demonstrate that their opposition to the euro is every bit as strong as that of the Swedes.
