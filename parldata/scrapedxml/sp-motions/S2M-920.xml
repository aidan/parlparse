 *S2M-920# Mark Ballard: Community Right to Oppose Supermarket Developments-That the Parliament notes the report by the New Economics Foundation, Ghost Town Britain, which demonstrates the negative impact that supermarkets can have on communities and local economies; considers that a good example of the problems with superstores is the situation in Portobello where residents calculate that 41 retail outlets have closed, have become charity shops, have been converted to dwellings or have been demolished and where remaining shops are struggling and the community is faced with an application from a developer for planning permission to erect a superstore in the High Street despite the presence of one superstore in the town and a further eight within a two mile radius; believes that the Scottish Executive should provide incentives for shopping in locally-owned and run outlets and prioritise such outlets in all legislation relating to planning and urban regeneration, and further believes that a comprehensive network of post offices, rather than incorporating post office functions into superstores, is a key way of supporting local economies.
