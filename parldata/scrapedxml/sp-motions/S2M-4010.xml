*S2M-4010 Mrs Margaret Ewing: The Hidden Heroes of the NHS—That the Parliament welcomes the publication of the British Medical Association’s recent report, The Hidden Heroes of the NHS, which highlights the significant contribution that the Staff and Associate Specialists (SAS) group of doctors play in providing patient care in NHS Scotland; notes that that 1,460 SAS doctors operate in Scotland but that their work remains unacknowledged and unrewarded, despite the fact that SAS doctors account for 39% of the medical workforce in accident and emergency departments; believes that recognition of, and investment in, this group is much-needed as they are an untapped resource and essential to the modernisation of NHS Scotland, and hopes that the Scottish Executive will recognise this fact.
