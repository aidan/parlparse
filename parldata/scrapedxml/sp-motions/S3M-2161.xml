 *S3M-2161 Kenneth Gibson: Repatriation of James Hepburn, Earl of Bothwell—That the Parliament supports the repatriation from Denmark of the remains of James Hepburn, 1534-1578, Fourth Earl of Bothwell, husband and consort to Mary Queen of Scots, stepfather to King James VI and captain of the French King’s bodyguard, Le Garde Ecossais, for a Christian burial at his ancestral home, Crichton Castle, near Edinburgh, as was his dying wish; notes that Bothwell died a lonely, tragic death having been held hostage in a dungeon in Dragsholm Castle chained to a pillar for the last 10 years of his life; is disturbed that Bothwell’s mummified body was previously on view in a glass case as part of a ghoulish church display until, after protests from his descendants, it was moved to Faarvejle crypt; believes that this Scottish patriot, in his day, was regarded outside Scotland as being the only honest man among the Scottish nobility of the time; is concerned that there is growing support in France to have Bothwell honoured and his remains repatriated there and buried in Rheims Cathedral, a royal French resting place, due to his French connections, whilst his beloved native Scotland has so far made no effort to reclaim one of her last "kings"; understands that the Danish Embassy is willing to assist in directing an application to the competent authority, the Diocese of Roskilde, for the return of Bothwell’s remains to Scotland, and urges the Scottish Government, in partnership with Historic Scotland, to recognise Bothwell’s place in Scottish history and honour his dying wish.
