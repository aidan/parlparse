 *S3M-2653♦ Cathy Peattie: Fare Deal—That the Parliament congratulates the 12 charities which, on UK Older People’s Day, 1 October 2008, launched a Fare Deal campaign for the concessionary travel scheme to be extended to cover special transport schemes used by elderly and disabled people, such as Dial-a-Journey in Forth Valley; considers that thousands of people who have or are entitled to a free bus pass are missing out because they cannot use regular scheduled services, and believes that an extension to the national concessionary travel scheme to include demand-responsive community transport should be considered.
