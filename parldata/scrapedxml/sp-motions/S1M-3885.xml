 *S1M-3885 Mr Jamie McGrigor: Fishing Industry Crisis—That the Parliament recognises the severity of the crisis facing the Scottish fishing industry; believes that the effects of the conservation measures already taken by Scottish fishermen have not been taken into full consideration; notes the Scottish Executive’s £50 million aid package but questions the balance of the allocation between decommissioning and transitional funding, and further notes that the Common Fisheries Policy of collective management has been disastrous for the Scottish fishing industry and must be replaced, and that only a move to national and local control will bring sustainability to the Scottish fishing industry in the future.
