*S3M-4956 Fiona Hyslop: Role of Colleges in the Economic Recovery—That the Parliament recognises that Scotland’s colleges are central to the Scottish Government’s plans for tackling the recession and preparing for economic recovery; agrees that through the provision of flexible, locally relevant skills and training they are helping individuals and employers build for recovery; welcomes the fact that, as a result and working in partnership with other agencies, colleges are helping the communities that they serve to adapt to changed economic circumstances; notes the particular support that colleges provide to young people, and notes the continued financial support that the sector receives from the Scottish Government.
