 *S2M-2098# Bill Butler: Christmas Debt—That the Parliament notes the recent survey highlighting the amount of money spent by Scots, and particularly Glaswegians, on Christmas shopping and expresses concern at the potential impact on personal debt which may result from excessive spending over the festive period; acknowledges that people, many of them on low incomes, are under pressure to spend large sums of money and overreach their financial limits to pay for Christmas; considers that those finding themselves in difficulty with personal debt should contact independent, free, experienced debt advice providers such as Citizens Advice Scotland, Law Money Advice Centres or Money Advice Scotland, and strongly believes that debt management companies, often operating under the guise of independent, free, and impartial debt advisors but which in reality levy arrangement fees and charge on a monthly basis for their services, should be avoided. Supported by: Christine May*, Ms Wendy Alexander*, Jackie Baillie*, Robin Harper*, Christine Grahame*, Susan Deacon*, Mike Pringle*, Shiona Baird*, Donald Gorrie*, Mark Ballard*, Sarah Boyack*, Eleanor Scott*, Elaine Smith*, Bristow Muldoon*, Ms Sandra White*
