*S2M-1595 Pauline McNeill: Good Luck to Glasgow Bands in Mercury Music Awards—That the Parliament congratulates Glasgow bands Franz Ferdinand, Belle and Sebastian and Snow Patrol on being nominated for the Mercury Music Awards to be announced on 7 September 2004; notes that Franz Ferdinand is joint favourite to win this prestigious music industry album prize and sends support and best wishes to all three bands who are competing with top artists including Basement Jaxx, Jamelia, Joss Stone, Ty, Robert Wyatt and the Zutons; further notes that the only Scottish act to win this award has been Primal Scream in 1992; believes that the nominations confirm Glasgow’s place as a flourishing centre for contemporary music creativity, and considers that, with a quarter of the nominations being given to Scottish acts, the Scottish Executive should actively pursue the Mercury Music Awards ceremony being hosted in Scotland in the future.
