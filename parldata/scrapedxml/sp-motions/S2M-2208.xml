*S2M-2208 Patrick Harvie: Time for Reflection—That the Parliament condemns the use of the phrase "captives … to sexual aberrations" to describe Scotland’s lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) community; values Scotland’s LGBT community and the contribution it makes to our society and our culture; deeply regrets that any speaker would choose to use the opportunity of Time for Reflection to make such a gratuitous insult to a section of the Scottish population, and hopes that the choice of speakers at Time for Reflection will come to reflect fully the attitudes, values and beliefs which Scotland, as a modern society, encompasses.
