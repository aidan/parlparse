 *S3M-6372 Jackie Baillie: Disability Leave in the NHSâ€”That the Parliament notes the importance of implementing a disability leave policy within NHS boards to ensure equality and fairness for those employees who are physically or mentally disabled; acknowledges the fact that disability leave policies are a crucial element when securing equality of opportunity; appreciates that, where a disability leave policy is absent, steps must be taken in other policy areas to ensure the promotion of fair and equal treatment for those who are forced to miss work-days as a result, and calls on the Scottish Government to monitor and report on disability leave policies across the NHS.
