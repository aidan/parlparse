*S2M-140# Phil Gallie: Red Brae School—That the Parliament commends the experienced staff at Red Brae School, Maybole, who provide an alternative education path for pupils excluded from mainstream education for disruptive and undisciplined behaviour; acknowledges the benefits of this education which the pupils themselves appreciate, and believes that the Scottish Executive must ensure that such facilities are available across the country thereby ensuring that those children whose behaviour patterns are not suited to mainstream education are catered for in a way that steers them into becoming useful and respected members of society.
