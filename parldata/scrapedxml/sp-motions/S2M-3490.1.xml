*S2M-3490.1 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Children with Special Needsâ€”As an amendment to motion (S2M-3490) in the name of Lord James Douglas-Hamilton, leave out from "however" to end and insert "that, in order to provide for the additional support needs of all children, class sizes require to be reduced to no more than 20, and to no more than 15 for composite classes, in all state primary and secondary schools; calls for the provision of additional teachers and assistants who are appropriately trained and qualified to meet the needs of all pupils with additional support needs; further calls for senior management teams to be appropriately trained and qualified to meet the needs of all pupils with additional support needs; acknowledges that these needs can most effectively be met in well-resourced integrated community schools, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to put in place a moratorium on the closure of special schools and an immediate review of inclusion in mainstream schools."
