 *S3M-2995 Bill Kidd: International Day of Disabled People—That the Parliament welcomes International Day of Disabled People on 3 December 2008, themed dignity and justice for all of us; commends all those who have overcome their difficulties to become role models for others wishing to achieve the same, such as Julie McElroy, who, alongside 10 physically disabled teenagers, trekked through the Andes and over the highest active volcano in the world, as seen in the BBC documentary, Across the Andes: Beyond Boundaries, and notes that, to mark International Day of Disabled People, Julie will deliver a speech to Cardonald College on leadership, team-building and her motivation to succeed and, more importantly, give her audience the inspiration and self-belief to believe that nothing is impossible.
