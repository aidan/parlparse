*S2M-4636 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Creeping Privatisation of the Royal Mail—That the Parliament notes with concern the creeping privatisation of the Royal Mail and, in particular, the closure of Crown post offices in towns and cities across Scotland; further notes that franchises cannot replace the service provided to communities by such post offices and is concerned that allowing franchises to take over will serve to exploit workers who currently earn £9.60 an hour and will be expected to do the same job for £5.15 an hour, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to ask for an immediate review of the current status and number of Crown post offices in Scotland.
