*S2M-4507.4 Mr Mark Ruskell: Climate Change—As an amendment to motion (S2M-4507) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "as a serious response" to end and insert "notes that CO2 emissions from Scotland have not fallen since the current First Minister took office; is concerned that Scotland’s emissions reduction since 1990 lags behind that of England; notes that according to the Scottish Executive about half of Scotland’s emissions reduction is due to the decline of heavy industry and not due to Executive policy measures; recognises that emissions from energy use and transport, accounting for over half of Scotland’s emissions, have been increasing since 1990; is concerned that there are devolved policy measures that will result in greenhouse gas emissions that have been ignored by the Executive’s Climate Change Programme, such as motorway building and subsidies for air transport which are likely to negate savings made under the Executive’s Scottish Share; warns the Executive that unless the Scottish Share applies to all policy measures and is part of an identifiable overall target for emissions reduction it will be meaningless; calls on the Executive to implement fully the recommendations of the Parliament’s Environment and Rural Development Committee’s 5th Report, 2005: Report on Inquiry into Climate Change, including traffic reduction and energy efficiency targets; agrees with the Executive that mainstreaming climate thinking, through the carbon proofing of new policies and measures, is vital to ensuring an effective climate change response, and therefore calls on the Executive to implement carbon proofing immediately starting with all existing policies and projects."
