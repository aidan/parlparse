*S2M-1222 Carolyn Leckie: Agenda for Change-That the Parliament notes the concerns expressed by, amongst others, UNISON's national health conference with regard to Agenda for Change; further notes that "early implementers" are reporting up to 30% of NHS staff facing inferior terms and conditions following application of the job evaluation system even before taking account of loss of unsocial hours payments; believes that NHS staff in general deserve greater recognition and pay; further believes that no NHS staff member should lose out as a result of Agenda for Change and that the Scottish Executive will have to make significant amendments to the current proposals if it is to avoid large sections of the NHS workforce rejecting Agenda for Change, and urges the Executive to take immediate action to avoid the prospect of a protracted dispute by making immediate moves to address all concerns raised.
