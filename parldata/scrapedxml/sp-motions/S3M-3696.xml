*S3M-3696 Robin Harper: Congratulations to Aberdeen Foyer on Bumblebee Work—That the Parliament congratulates Aberdeen Foyer on the work that it has done planting wild flowers, nectar-bearing plants and shrubs that will provide nutrition for bumblebees and butterflies; recognises the bumblebee as the principle pollinating insect in the Scottish countryside, and calls on the Scottish Government to recognise and support the important work being done at the University of Stirling to research and find ways to overcome the threats to bumblebees that have rendered three of Scotland’s 25 bumblebee species extinct and a further seven species severely threatened.
