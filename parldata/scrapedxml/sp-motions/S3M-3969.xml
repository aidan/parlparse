*S3M-3969♦ Bob Doris: Partick Thistle Community Engagement Programme, Preparing for Glasgow 2014—That the Parliament commends the work of the Partick Thistle Football Club community engagement programme and recognises the value that this service provides to vulnerable and socially excluded groups in Glasgow; believes that football clubs have enormous potential for bringing together third sector organisations for the purposes of improving the nation’s health and wellbeing and that, while health improvements can be inspired through the popular medium of football, individual clubs can also secure their long-term sustainability by increasing community participation; notes that community engagement and enhancing partnerships are two of the five core principles of the Scottish Government 2014 Commonwealth Games legacy plan, and considers that Partick Thistle’s programme is a fine example of good practice in this area that supports efforts to steer the nation towards healthier living ahead of the Glasgow Commonwealth Games in 2014.
