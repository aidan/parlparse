 * S2M-2649 Colin Fox: Three Cheers for Chomsky—That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh University and its Palestinian Solidarity Campaign Society for hosting two outstanding lectures by the highly-respected political scholar and dissident, Professor Noam Chomsky; notes that more than 2,000 people crowded in to hear his views on US imperialism and international affairs and were enthralled at the extent of his wisdom and advice on world affairs; regards his visit to Edinburgh as both a considerable success and a highlight of the year, and thanks Professor Chomsky himself for ably standing in for the late and much-missed Professor Edward Said who had originally been invited but who died recently.
