*S3M-1076 Dave Thompson: Greater Transparency in Broadband Advertising—That the Parliament commends the Ofcom Consumer Panel for calling for a mandatory code of practice to make internet service providers offer customers clearer information about broadband speeds; notes that the code empowers customers to opt out of a contract without being penalised if their broadband speeds are below those advertised; suggests to Ofcom that the code should allow for rebates where actual speed is less than that advertised; further notes that this is a particular problem in the highlands and islands, where broadband speed and capacity is, in a number of cases, failing to meet the demand of local communities and businesses alike; welcomes this government’s commitment to improving broadband services for the highlands and islands, and implores internet service providers to offer a greater value for money service to constituents of the highlands and islands.
