*S3M-5395 Bill Butler: Oesophageal Cancer in Scotland—That the Parliament notes the publication of research by Ochre, the national oesophageal cancer charity, into the condition in Scotland; expresses its concern that Scotland has much higher rates of oesophageal cancer than other parts of the United Kingdom; considers that early diagnosis is critical to successful treatment and that GP and public awareness of the condition needs to be improved so that early symptoms can be correctly identified; notes that, according to Ochre’s research, there is often confusion regarding cancer of the throat and oesophageal cancer and that they are separate conditions; notes that the World Health Organization has warned that oesophageal cancer is predicted to rise by 64.3% by 2020, and urges the Scottish Government to ensure better access to endoscopy services at primary health care locations in order to speed up diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.
