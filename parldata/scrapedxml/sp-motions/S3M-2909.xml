 *S3M-2909 Michael Matheson: Keep London Olympics’ Toxic Waste Out of Falkirk—That the Parliament notes the reports of a proposal to dump contaminated soil from the London Olympics site in the Falkirk area; recognises the widespread local opposition to the proposal; calls on the Scottish Environment Protection Agency to ensure that no such disposal takes place in the Falkirk area or elsewhere in Scotland, and believes that such contaminated soil would be more appropriately disposed of at a site closer to its origin.
