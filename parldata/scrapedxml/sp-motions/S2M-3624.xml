*S2M-3624 Margo MacDonald: Urgent Request for a Ministerial Statement—That the Parliament requests that the First Minister makes a statement on the discussions that have taken place between himself and Home Office ministers concerning the methods used to remove failed asylum seekers from Scotland, in light of his spokesman’s statement at lunchtime on 23 November 2005 which made it clear that the First Minister had not reflected the Parliament’s opposition to the “dawn raids” in his meetings with Home Office ministers to date and believes that, in advance of his meeting on 24 November 2005 with the Home Office Minister, Tony McNulty, he must re-state the Scottish Executive’s position on this matter.
