*S3M-5499 Stewart Maxwell: The Death of Miep Gies—That the Parliament acknowledges the death of Miep Gies, aged 100, the last surviving member of the group who helped Anne Frank and her family hide from the Nazis for more than two years; admires her courage and compassion, which provided a shining example of humanitarianism in one of mankind’s bleakest times; further acknowledges that the incredible tale of Anne Frank could not have been told were it not for the brave defiance of Nazi occupation laws, and applauds her continued work in causes of tolerance long after Anne Frank’s death.
