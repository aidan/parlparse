 *S3M-7911 Hugh O’Donnell: Cuts to Scottish Refugee Council Advice Budgets—That the Parliament is seriously concerned by reports that the UK Border Agency (UKBA) proposes to cut advice funding to the Scottish Refugee Council (SRC) by as much as 62%; considers that the people using these services are some of the most vulnerable people in Scotland, often without recourse to any public funds or services; believes that this cut would be inappropriate, and calls on the UKBA to reconsider its current proposals before it damages what is considered the vital work being carried out by the SRC and other agencies working with refugees and asylum seekers.
