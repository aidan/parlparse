*S1M-3412# Bill Butler: Glasgow Airport Rail Link-That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by the Minister for Finance and Public Services on 12 September 2002 that resources are to be made available to make possible the construction and completion of a Glasgow Airport rail link; recognises the significance of this rail link as part of a modern, 21st century transport infrastructure for the whole of Scotland; believes that the most sensible option for this new rail link is one routed via Paisley Gilmour Street and Paisley St James, and considers that the Minister for Enterprise, Transport and Lifelong Learning should announce, as a matter of urgency, both his favoured option for this development and a clear timetable for its speedy implementation.
