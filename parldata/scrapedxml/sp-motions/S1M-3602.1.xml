*S1M-3602.1 Alex Fergusson: Scottish Executive Response to Foot-and-Mouth Disease Inquiries—As an amendment to motion (S1M-3602) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "and welcomes" to end and insert "; regrets the late publication of the Scottish Executive’s response to the inquiries and the curtailment of the debate on the issue; considers the response to be vague and urges the Executive to clarify its position on key issues such as the future use of vaccinations; calls on the Executive to produce clear evidence that it is working urgently with Her Majesty’s Government to reduce the risk of importing infectious diseases, and seeks reassurance that the outcome of the inquiries will form the basis for continuing vigilance and regular updated contingency arrangements in the event of a future outbreak."
