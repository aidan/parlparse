 *S2M-940 Colin Fox: Civil Service Pay Dispute-That the Parliament notes last week's industrial action in the civil service over pay; believes that starting salaries in some parts of the civil service at £9,000 are unacceptably low; further believes that thousands of civil servants suffer from low pay and have to rely on state benefits to make ends meet; supports the Public and Commercial Services Union in pursuit of its modest demands, and calls on the Scottish Executive to do all that it can to eradicate low pay from the civil service and to impress on Her Majesty's Government the need to move towards a minimum wage set at two-thirds of male median earnings as the starting point for pay scales in the civil service.
