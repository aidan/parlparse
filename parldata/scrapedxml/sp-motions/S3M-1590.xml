*S3M-1590 Bashir Ahmad: Save the Curry Industry—That the Parliament notes the benefits of a points-based immigration system; however, recognises the difficulty placed on curry restaurants and takeaways, with the new scheme making it extremely difficult to recruit specialised, experienced curry chefs from the sub-continent; further recognises that the curry industry contributes £3.2 billion to the UK economy and this could be in serious danger if the current system is not modified, and urges the Scottish Government to make representations to the Home Office regarding this matter.
