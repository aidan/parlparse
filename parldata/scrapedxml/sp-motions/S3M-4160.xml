*S3M-4160 Robin Harper: 75th Anniversary of the British Council—That the Parliament notes that 2009 is the 75th anniversary of the British Council; recognises the impact that it has had in Scotland, including supporting over 1,000 international activities in schools, managing global study and work opportunities for around 900 home and international students each year, showcasing Scottish culture to 300,000 Indian visitors at this year’s Scottish Pavilion of the Kolkata Book Fair and hosting the biennial Performing Arts Showcase at the Edinburgh Fringe, which wins the United Kingdom in excess of £1 million of bookings and has made it possible for Scottish productions to tour the globe, and wishes the British Council well for its 75th celebration reception in the Parliament’s Garden Lobby on the evening of Wednesday 20 May 2009 and for the years to come.
