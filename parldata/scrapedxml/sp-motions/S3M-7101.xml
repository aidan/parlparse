 *S3M-7101 Stuart McMillan: Union 10—That the Parliament congratulates all who took part in the Union 10 event between 24 and 26 September 2010 along the Union Canal; notes that the event celebrated the 10 years since the canal route reopened for public use; acknowledges that over 60 vessels took part and considers that this proved to be a spectacular sight to see; further notes that events took place along the canal starting at Edinburgh, including a ceilidh, jazz night and a concluding festival at the Falkirk Wheel, and believes that the interest in the event will have boosted marine tourism in central Scotland and celebrated what it considers the rich cultural heritage that Scotland has in boating.
