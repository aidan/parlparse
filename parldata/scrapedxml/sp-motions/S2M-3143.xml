 *S2M-3143 Chris Ballance: 60th Anniversary of Hiroshima—That the Parliament observes the 60th anniversary of the first nuclear attack on Japan at Hiroshima on 6 August 1945; is gravely concerned about the global proliferation of nuclear weapons, including the current development of uranium enrichment in Iran; believes that nuclear proliferation will not be prevented unless all countries disarm, and therefore calls on the UK Government to abide by the terms of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and to set an example by announcing that it intends to abandon its plan to replace the United Kingdom’s Trident nuclear weapons.
