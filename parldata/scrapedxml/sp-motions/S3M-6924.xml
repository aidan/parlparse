 *S3M-6924 Elaine Smith: Auchengeich Colliery Disaster—That the Parliament notes the anniversary of the Auchengeich Colliery disaster, which claimed the lives of 47 miners on 18 September 1959 in one of Scotland’s worst mining disasters of the 20th century; recognises that this disaster has had a lasting impact on the people of Chryston and the surrounding areas; welcomes the expansion of the memorial site, including what it considers to be a fantastic bronze statue sculpted by John McKenna, which will serve as a reminder to future generations of the sacrifice of those who braved difficult and dangerous conditions in Scotland’s mines; commends the trade union movement for its work in campaigning for stricter enforcement and higher penalties for breaches of health and safety laws; believes that health and safety in the workplace should not be compromised as a result of any potential cuts; expresses solidarity with miners throughout the world, particularly the 33 Chilean miners who are trapped 700 metres below the Atacama Desert, and wishes the men a safe return to their friends and family.
