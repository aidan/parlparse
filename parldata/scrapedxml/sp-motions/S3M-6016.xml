*S3M-6016 Margaret Mitchell: Lanarkshire’s Silver Seniors Living Life to the Full—That the Parliament congratulates the Coatbridge Silver Seniors’ Activity Club on its first birthday this month; welcomes the fact that the weekly club for older adults provides meaningful indoor leisure activities such as swimming, table tennis, badminton, art, bingo and chair aerobics, enhancing the personal health and mental wellbeing of Lanarkshire’s older population; considers that the success of the club relies on the close partnership between the participants, carers and the multi-agency partners, including NHS Lanarkshire, care home staff, social workers, leisure centre staff, local voluntary agencies and also a local taxi company, and wishes the club all the best for the forthcoming year.
