*S2M-5430 Colin Fox: RMT Union Signal Workers’ Dispute—That the Parliament notes the decision of RMT signal workers in Scotland who are employed by Network Rail to ballot for strike action over the company’s failure to implement a 35-hour working week agreement; believes that, although the agreement is being implemented across the rest of Britain, management in Scotland has reneged on its side of the deal and is attempting to enforce longer working hours and take rest day entitlements away from employees who often work in arduous conditions; extends its full support to RMT union members, and hopes that the strike can be averted by management’s return to the negotiating table and that a satisfactory outcome can therefore be reached on the issue. Supported by: Chris Ballance*, Carolyn Leckie*, Tommy Sheridan*, Campbell Martin*, Frances Curran*, Rosie Kane*, Ms Rosemary Byrne*
