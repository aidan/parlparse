*S3M-4746 Jackie Baillie: Helensburgh’s Auld Alliance—That the Parliament recognises the special relationship between Helensburgh and the medieval market town of Thouars, a Loire town in the Poitou region of France; notes that Thouars was chosen to twin with Helensburgh because Margaret of Scotland was buried there; notes that over the years there have been numerous visits, a number of work experience placements and lasting friendships that have cemented the connection between the towns, and congratulates all involved in maintaining such a strong bond, which has fostered both social and economic advantages for Helensburgh and Thouars for over 30 years.
