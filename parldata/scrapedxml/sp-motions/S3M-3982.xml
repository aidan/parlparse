*S3M-3982 Sandra White: Scottish Parliament Banking Investigation—That the Parliament believes that an inquiry into the situation surrounding the recent banking crisis in Scotland, which is having particularly serious consequences for Scotland’s traditional banking centre in Edinburgh, should be established as a matter of urgency through the mechanisms available to the Scottish Parliament, such as the creation of a special parliamentary committee, to look into the demise of RBS, HBOS and the Dunfermline Building Society in order to take evidence from the relevant bodies involved, restore confidence in the Scottish banking sector and ensure that lessons are learned.
