 *S3M-5153 Sandra White: Tackling Domestic Abuse—That the Parliament commends the Scottish Government for providing £2.4 million to fund the Caledonian System, a new comprehensive system to address domestic abuse; believes that 50,000 cases of domestic abuse recorded in Scotland in 2007-08 is too many; further believes that this new comprehensive programme will better protect women and children through intervention programmes for perpetrators of domestic violence to reduce the likelihood of reoffending, additional services for victims of domestic abuse and new protocols for the sharing of information between agencies involved with the families concerned, and calls on local authorities to apply for a share of the £2.4 million funding to help reduce the devastating effects of domestic abuse and to make progress in reducing the cyclical nature of violence.
