*S1M-2530 Karen Gillon: Railtrack and the Larkhall Projectâ€”That the Parliament notes with dismay the decision by Railtrack plc not to support the Scottish Executive funded rail link between Larkhall and Milngavie; recognises that this decision has the potential to have a particular impact on Larkhall and the surrounding communities as it jeopardises the future of a joint project between the Scottish Executive and Strathclyde Passenger Transport; re-iterates its view that this project would have brought substantial economic and social benefits to Clydesdale, and urges Railtrack plc to reconsider urgently their decision in order to ensure that this project proceeds as planned to enable the economic and social regeneration of the Larkhall area.
