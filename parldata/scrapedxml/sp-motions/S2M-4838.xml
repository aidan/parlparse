*S2M-4838 Tommy Sheridan: Housing Crisis—That the Parliament notes the record level of housing mortgage debt reached in Scotland and believes that thousands of young workers, in particular, are priced out of housing purchase and demands a co-ordinated and massive social rented housebuilding programme funded by the Scottish Executive to meet the current demand for new and affordable housing and the removal of the counter-productive, unfair and unsustainable right-to-buy policy.
