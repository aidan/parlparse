 *S2M-1978 Donald Gorrie: Co-operation between Parliament and Civil Servants—That the Parliament urges the Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body and the Scottish Executive to form a working group composed of representatives of MSPs, ministers and civil servants to examine ways in which the Parliament and Executive ministers and civil servants could work together constructively, possibly in smaller specialist groups, to develop policy, improve public services, promote economic activity and community life and raise the quality of life, without compromising parties’ right to take up different positions and criticise each other, the independence of the Parliament and the Executive or the particular relationship between ministers and civil servants.
