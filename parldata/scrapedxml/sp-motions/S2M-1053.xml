*S2M-1053 Dr Jean Turner: Financial Implications of the New Consultant Contract-That the Parliament recognises the increased financial implications of the new consultants' contract; believes that there is also the requirement for consultants to work additional hours in order to cover patient need and the training of junior doctors which is required by the Royal Colleges, and calls upon NHS boards and trusts to ensure that these additional hours are not removed in order to prevent closure of much-needed services purely to meet financial restraints.
