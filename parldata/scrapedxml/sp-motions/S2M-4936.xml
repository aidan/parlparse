*S2M-4936 Karen Gillon: Make the Connection—That the Parliament welcomes "Make the Connection", the joint campaign by energywatch and the Federation of Small Businesses to achieve a better deal for small businesses from the energy market; recognises that small businesses enjoy far less protection from regulation and industry codes of practice compared with domestic energy consumers; notes the high cost of gas and electricity for non-domestic users at a time of low wholesale prices, which can cause smaller businesses to struggle, and calls on energy suppliers to recognise the importance of small businesses as a key market of the £3 billion gas and electricity industry by improving the way in which they deal with small business customers.
