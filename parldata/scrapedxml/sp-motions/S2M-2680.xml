*S2M-2680 Gordon Jackson: Congratulations to Govan Law Centreâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Govan Law Centre as it celebrates its 10th anniversary in April 2005; notes the value of its national policy work in the field of debt, housing, education and employment law generally and, in particular, its work in preventing homelessness by stopping mortgage repossessions and evictions across the west coast of Scotland; acknowledges its role in supporting Scottish pro-health measures by drafting the Breastfeeding etc. (Scotland) Act 2005; recognises that community-based law centres have a key role to play as part of local and national social inclusion strategies, particularly in the provision of free expert legal representation, advice and legal support to those in poverty, and encourages the Scottish Executive to consider extending the community-based law centre model to other parts of Scotland.
