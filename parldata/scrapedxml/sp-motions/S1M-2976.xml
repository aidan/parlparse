*S1M-2976# Cathie Craigie: The Forth and Clyde and Union Canals-That the Parliament notes the successful reopening of the Forth and Clyde Canal; further notes that the reopening of the canal has given the communities on its banks a major boost; looks forward to the next step in this project which, on 24 May 2002, sees the opening of the Falkirk Wheel and the resulting link between the Forth and Clyde Canal and the Union Canal; congratulates the board of British Waterways, the Forth and Clyde Canal Society, the Scottish Inland Waterways Association, Scottish Enterprise, North Lanarkshire Council, Falkirk Council, Glasgow City Council, the City of Edinburgh Council, West Lothian Council, East Dunbartonshire Council and West Dunbartonshire Council on working in partnership in order to make this ambitious project a reality, and believes that the Scottish Executive should work together with VisitScotland and Scottish Enterprise in order to maximise the benefits of this project for the local economies, especially local tourism.
