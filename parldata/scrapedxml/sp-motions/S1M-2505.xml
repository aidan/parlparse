*S1M-2505 Fergus Ewing: Aggregates Tax: Lack of Scottish Exemptionsâ€”That the Parliament notes that special exemptions from the aggregates tax are to be granted to Northern Ireland following HM Treasury's pre-budget report; believes that the imposition of the tax on Scotland from 1 April 2002 will be damaging to the Scottish economy, especially in rural areas and will not result in any environmental gain but will lead to the closure of some smaller quarries, will place a greater burden of traffic on our roads and will place a particular burden upon local authorities which could lead to higher council taxes and/or cuts in building and roads repairs programmes; further believes that the failure of the Scottish Executive to accept in any way the widespread concerns on the impact of the aggregates tax and its total refusal to stand up to Her Majesty's Government on this issue contrasts poorly with the united approach pursued by politicians in the Northern Ireland Assembly and that, had the coalition parties campaigned against this tax instead of refusing to voice any word of criticism, Scotland too may have received valuable exemptions, and therefore calls upon the Scottish Executive to state exactly what, if anything, it plans to do in relation to the imposition of this tax on Scotland and to estimate what the cost to the economy will be from it.
