 * S2M-3030 Carolyn Leckie: No Reduction of Student Nurse Intakesâ€”That the Parliament expresses concern at the announcement by the Minister for Health and Community Care of a 12% cut in the intake of student nurses; believes that, with workforce planning still embryonic in the NHS, sickness absence still high, the demography of the workforce ageing, major changes such as reorganisation, the Kerr report, nurses adopting more complex roles and responsibilities with, as yet, unquantified impact on staffing numbers, skill mix, training and backfilling requirements, the reductions are unsupported by credible rationale, and further believes that the Scottish Executive should reconsider this reduction and enter into meaningful discussions with all relevant parties, including trade unions and professional organisations, to reach agreement on the number of student nurses needed to sustain, secure and develop an NHS nursing workforce equipped for the 21st century.
