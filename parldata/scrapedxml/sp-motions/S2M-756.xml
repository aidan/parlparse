*S2M-756# Maureen Macmillan: Belford Hospital, Fort William, Centre of Excellence—That the Parliament supports the proposal for the Belford Hospital at Fort William to become a centre of excellence for trauma training as part of a medical facility within the University of the Highlands and Islands; acknowledges that the Belford Hospital is already recognised nationally as one of the UK’s leading hospitals in trauma treatment because of its experience in dealing with mountain casualties, and further recognises that this proposal would go a long way to help resolve the current recruitment difficulties being experienced in some specialisms of the medical profession and would give young people within the Highlands and Islands the opportunity to train and live at home rather than relocate to the central belt.
