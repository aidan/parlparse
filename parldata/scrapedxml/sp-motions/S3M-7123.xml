*S3M-7123 David Stewart: Graduated Driving Licence Scheme—That the Parliament notes the research carried out by Dr Sarah Jones from Cardiff University in relation to the graduated driving licence scheme; notes in particular the research carried out in Scotland, which identified that, while road traffic collisions among older drivers were falling, those occurring among younger drivers remain unchanged; supports the view that, if such a scheme was introduced in Scotland, up to 22 lives per year on average could be saved from fatal collisions, with over 1,000 casualties being avoided; believes that up to £80 million could be saved every year with the introduction of a graduated driving licence scheme, and urges the Scottish Executive to work with the Department for Transport to implement a pilot scheme in the Highlands to evaluate whether this can help to reduce the deaths of young people on Scotland’s roads.
