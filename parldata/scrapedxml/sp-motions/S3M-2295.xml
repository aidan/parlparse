*S3M-2295 Jim Hume: Pringle of Scotland Job Losses—That the Parliament deeply regrets the news that Pringle of Scotland is proposing to stop manufacturing in Hawick, with the loss of eighty jobs; notes that Pringle’s history in the Borders dates back to 1815, when it was founded in Hawick by Robert Pringle, and from when it has built up a worldwide reputation as a luxury fashion brand; further regrets that due to the fragility of the Hawick economy and relatively high rates of unemployment, job losses on this scale are bound to have serious consequences unless help is urgently brought in; calls on the Scottish Government to set up a taskforce to help the staff affected by this decision, with the taskforce including Scottish Borders Council, the employment service and Heriot-Watt University, and believes that all the staff that lose their jobs should be given individually tailored help to ensure that they are either re-employed or retrained as quickly as possible.
