*S3M-2019 Jeremy Purvis: Open University and Part-Time Students—That the Parliament congratulates the 1,000 people from across Scotland who will receive Open University degrees and professional qualifications this year; notes that they come from all educational backgrounds, from the widest age range, and that most have had to fund their studies themselves; recognises that studying part-time has given them the flexibility they needed to be able to engage with higher education in a way that fits around their work and domestic commitments, without compromising their income and job security, and further notes the important contribution that part-time students make to improving Scotland’s skills base and economic development.
