*S3M-6731 Kenneth Gibson: Scotland v Catalonia—That the Parliament congratulates the Spanish football team on what is considered its deserved World Cup victory in South Africa; applauds the five Catalonia team members who played a vital role in Spain’s first World Cup win; regrets the Scotland national football team’s apparent refusal to play the Catalonia national football team because of unsubstantiated fears of repercussions from the International Federation of Association Football (FIFA); considers that the Catalonia national team has had a proud and successful history since its debut in 1904 and in recent years has enjoyed friendly matches with international teams such as Brazil and Argentina; considers that, due to the Scottish Football Association’s (SFA) apparent hesitancy, Scottish football and Scotland itself missed out on a huge opportunity, including television rights and ticket sales generated by such a game, which would have provided the SFA with a considerable financial boost considering the attention that players such as Carlos Puyol, Xavi Hernández and Cesc Fàbregas would attract; agrees that playing Catalonia would give Scotland an idea of what to expect in the European Championship qualifiers, and believes that the SFA should invite the Catalan national team to play in Scotland.
