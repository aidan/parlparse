*S3M-2244.1 James Kelly: Congratulations to Glasgow City Council—As an amendment to motion (S3M-2244) in the name of Bill Kidd, leave out from "72% of Glaswegians" to end and insert "the proposals for a local income tax (LIT) set at 3p in the pound would lead to a funding gap for Glasgow City Council of between £60 million and £133 million per annum and that, accordingly, the Scottish Government would have to set the LIT at around 4.5% to avoid this gap and maintain current levels of council services, therefore hitting hard-working families; welcomes Glasgow City Council’s findings that, because of the number of households in Glasgow in receipt of full council tax benefit, the poorest households would see no change under the LIT proposals and the problem of such households continuing to incur water and waste charges would not be resolved by the Scottish Government’s plans, and congratulates the Labour government at Westminster since 1997 on its record of tacking social injustice and poverty, noting in particular the record employment levels, the introduction of the National Minimum Wage, which will rise to £5.73, the cutting of the basic rate of income tax from 22p to 20p, the lowest for 75 years, and the introduction of tax and benefit measures, which mean that, in real terms, families with children in the poorest fifth of the population will be on average £4,050 per year better off than before 1997 and that 600,000 children have been lifted out of poverty since 1997."
