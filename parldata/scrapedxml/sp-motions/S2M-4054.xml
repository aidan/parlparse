*S2M-4054 Richard Lochhead: Threat to Future of Grampian Television—That the Parliament recognises the contribution made over the last 45 years by Grampian Television to the regional identity of the north east of Scotland and to the social cohesion of the diverse communities it services; further recognises that Grampian Television has had a consistently high standard of programming output and has been the launch-pad for many successful broadcasting careers; is therefore deeply concerned by the decision by Grampian TV’s owner, Scottish Media Group, to drop the name of Grampian Television as part of a "re-branding exercise" and considers that this would represent a loss of broadcasting heritage; believes that this decision will be unpopular with viewers and represents the further erosion of regional broadcasting with the north and north east losing a vital part of their region’s cultural identity, and calls for the regulatory authorities to ensure that those remaining elements of regional broadcasting are protected and enhanced. Supported by: Mr John Swinney*, Roseanna Cunningham*, Shona Robison*, Eleanor Scott*, Brian Adam*, Fiona Hyslop*, Christine Grahame*, Mr Ted Brocklebank*, Alex Johnstone*, Ms Sandra White*, Nora Radcliffe*, Alex Neil*, Mrs Margaret Ewing*, Tommy Sheridan*, Jim Mather*, Robin Harper*
