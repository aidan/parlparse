*S3M-5100 Patricia Ferguson: Ripped-off Glasgow—That the Parliament notes that the decision to cancel the Glasgow Airport Rail Link is estimated to have cost 1,300 jobs in the city and has been criticised by CBI Scotland, Glasgow Chamber of Commerce and local community leaders who have described it as a dagger in the heart of Glasgow; notes that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde this year received its worst funding settlement since devolution; notes that Glasgow does not receive a specific additional supplement to reflect the large number of non-residents who use its services; notes that, despite an increase in the Scottish Government’s overall budget, it is cutting the housing and regeneration budget; believes that this decision, coupled with recent cuts to the Housing Association Grant, will disproportionately affect Glasgow; believes that local families and businesses in Glasgow deserve better, and urges the Scottish Government to give Glasgow a fair deal, not rip it off.
