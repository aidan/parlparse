*S3M-1144 Christine Grahame: Midnight Footie—That the Parliament congratulates the Scottish Football Association, the Bank of Scotland and the Coalfield Regeneration Trust for their ongoing support of community football programmes like the Bank of Scotland Midnightleague and Bank of Scotland Soccer One; recognises that these two programmes will have benefited around 59,000 children across Scotland by the end of 2010; welcomes the extra funding from the Scottish Government’s Cashback for Communities scheme, which will see £2.2 million from the proceeds of crime being used to support such activities and supplements Bank of Scotland’s commitment to invest £1.5 million over three years, and calls on MSPs of all parties to support community football initiatives in their constituencies.
