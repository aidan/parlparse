 *S3M-7405 Linda Fabiani: NHS, Equality Matters—That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Health Awards 2010 were held on 11 November 2010; notes that the awards seek to give recognition to the workers in NHS Scotland and those working in health services who might be in jobs that normally do not have a high profile but who genuinely make a difference and show commitment to the NHS; recognises the importance of equality in healthcare and the work required to ensure that the needs of excluded or disadvantaged groups are met and that discrimination or prejudice in the delivery of healthcare is tackled, and, therefore, while congratulating all winners, congratulates in particular Attiq Asghar, Equality and Diversity Officer, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, resident of East Kilbride, who received the Equality in Healthcare Award.
