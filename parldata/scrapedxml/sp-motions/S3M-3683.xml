*S3M-3683 Robin Harper: EU Vote on Genetically Modified Organisms—That the Parliament welcomes the vote by EU environment ministers to maintain the right of individual countries to impose bans on genetically modified (GM) organisms; notes that the right to ban was upheld by an overwhelming majority of 22 out of the 27 member states; expresses deep regret that UK ministers voted in favour of the European Commission’s attempts to force Austria and Hungary to lift their bans; accepts that the UK Government’s pro-GM position is at odds with the bulk of public and political opinion throughout Europe, including in Scotland, and supports the continued rejection of all GM farming in Scotland as a vital protection for farmers, the food they grow, wildlife and Scotland’s public health.
