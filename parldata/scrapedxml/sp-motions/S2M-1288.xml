 *S2M-1288 Alex Fergusson: ME Awareness Day-That the Parliament notes that Wednesday, 12 May 2004 is ME Awareness Day; applauds the appointment of an ME specialist nurse by NHS Fife; recognises that ME is now accepted as a neurological disease under World Health Organisation ICD-10, rather than as a mental condition; therefore questions why benefits continue to be denied on mental health grounds and why appellants continue to be referred for psychiatric assessment, and regrets the lack of urgency shown by the Scottish Executive in respect of NHS boards' responses to its request for information on ME issues and that, two years after the publication of the Chief Medical Officer's report into ME in England and Wales, the research into, and treatment of, ME in Scotland has failed to make any progress.
