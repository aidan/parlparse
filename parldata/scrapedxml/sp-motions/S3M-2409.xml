 *S3M-2409Stuart McMillan:Birthing Units at Vale of Leven and Inverclyde Royal Hospitals Savedâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the news that birthing units at both the Vale of Leven and Inverclyde Royal hospitals have been saved following a concerted campaign by the public on both sides of the River Clyde; notes that the NHS board is to follow the recommendations of the independent scrutiny panel (ISP), which was set up by the Cabinet Secretary for Health and Wellbeing, to keep the units open for a further three years with a community education programme; considers that if the NHS board had originally implemented the recommendations of the ISP the months of unrest that followed would not have happened, and looks forward to an increased number of births at both units.
