*S2M-773 Alasdair Morgan: Parthenon Marbles-That the Parliament welcomes the visit to Edinburgh in January 2004 of the exhibition "Marbles Reunited: A Cultural Imperative", organised by the British Committee for the Restitution of the Parthenon Marbles, which digitally combines pieces of sculpture originally from the Parthenon and now separated between Athens and London to reveal what could be achieved if the various pieces of sculpture were to be reunited; notes the recent constructive proposals by the Greek Government for the return on loan of the Parthenon marbles to a new purpose-built museum close to the Parthenon, which involve putting aside the issue of ownership and instead entering into a partnership to ensure that the marbles are displayed and conserved in the best possible way; further notes that the Greek Government is willing to enter into a rolling loan agreement so that other artefacts of great significance which have never before been seen in the UK can be displayed in the British Museum; welcomes indications that Her Majesty's Government may be prepared to discuss these proposals, and hopes that Her Majesty's Government will respond positively so as to enable the marbles to be reunited in Athens in what would be a cultural gesture of world significance.
