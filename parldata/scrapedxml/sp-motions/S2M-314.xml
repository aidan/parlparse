 *S2M-314# Christine Grahame: Peebles Sheriff Court-That the Parliament notes with concern that Peebles Sheriff Court, which closed on 21 November 2001, remains closed to this day and that, despite various undertakings by Ministers to issue a consultation document on the future of court services in Peebles, no consultation has taken place to date; further notes that the retention of the sheriff court at Peebles is supported by, among others, the Sheriff Principal of Lothian and Borders and the two sheriffs who sit there, the Society of Solicitors in the Shires of Selkirk and Peebles, the Faculty of Solicitors in Roxburghshire, the Citizens Advice Bureau Peebles and the Lord Lieutenant of Tweeddale, and therefore considers that the Scottish Executive should make a statement now regarding the delayed consultation document.
