*S2M-3561 Trish Godman: Comprehensive Protection for the Nation’s Emergency Workers—That the Parliament reasserts its long-held view that emergency workers, employed in hospitals, clinics and elsewhere, must be given comprehensive protection as they go about their important work; believes that it was right and proper for the Parliament to enact appropriate legislation in order to give greater security to those who perform such vital, often lifesaving roles, but is of the view that they will continue to be vulnerable to violent assault if the courts fail to inflict condign punishment on those convicted of such vicious crimes. Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
