*S3M-4632 Nicol Stephen: Olympic-sized Swimming Pool for Aberdeen—That the Parliament supports the construction of a full Olympic-sized 10-lane 50 metre swimming pool in Aberdeen; notes with disappointment that the Scottish Government is only helping to fund an eight-lane pool, and calls on the Scottish Government to ensure that appropriate funding is made available to ensure that the 10-lane pool previously promised is delivered.
