*S3M-3396 Irene Oldfather: The Importance of Robert Burns to Irvine—That the Parliament notes the strong connection between Irvine and Robert Burns; agrees that the continued strengthening of these ties is vital to the local area in the coming years; recognises Homecoming Scotland 2009 as a way of highlighting Ayrshire to the wider global community; congratulates the Irvine Burns Club for having the highest number of consecutive Burns suppers in the world; acknowledges the wide-ranging membership of the club, including all former First Ministers, and applauds the issue of an invitation by the club to the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama; notes the commitment of the club to making the works of Robert Burns appeal today; welcomes the fact that this year saw the celebrated local writer and presenter of the BBC Four documentary, Robert Burns: The People’s Poet, Andrew O’Hagan, attend the supper as well as Welsh singer Cerys Matthews, and therefore applauds the members of Irvine Burns Club for another successful year and hopes that through their various endeavours a permanent legacy can be put in place that will assist the club to continue its traditions into the next century.
