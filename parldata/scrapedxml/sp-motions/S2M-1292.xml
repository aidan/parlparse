*S2M-1292# Cathie Craigie: Arrhythmia Awareness Week-That the Parliament congratulates the Arrhythmia Awareness Week partners, STARS, SADS UK, CMA and BCPA, for their work in raising awareness of cardiac arrhythmias and their potentially fatal consequences; notes that the condition occurs when the victim's heart goes into an abnormal rhythm from which it may not recover naturally, can strike at any age and that many people die each year due to suffering a fatal cardiac arrhythmia; further notes that many people fail to be accurately diagnosed and that there is a general lack of awareness amongst the general public and healthcare professionals, and believesÂ that the Scottish Executive should initiate a national education programme so that people who are at high risk of serious adverse events can be identified and treated.
