 *S3M-8193 Rob Gibson: Pilgrimage Route Development—That the Parliament welcomes plans to create a King James IV pilgrimage route from Edinburgh to Tain, with a possible extension south west from the capital to Whithorn; notes that the king made pilgrimages to Tain and Whithorn on several occasions; further notes that preparations are being made to launch the route in 2013, the 500th anniversary of the death of James IV; recognises the appetite for long-distance routes that can be accomplished by people of all abilities and using various means of transport; understands, in particular, that Whithorn was revered in the Middle Ages as the birthplace of Christianity in Scotland and that St Duthus Church in Tain had a strong association with the Bruce/Stewart dynasty; calls on public agencies such as Historic Scotland, Scottish Natural Heritage and VisitScotland to play a full part in this initiative in order that Scotland’s renaissance prince, James IV, may be remembered by many today who can celebrate his colourful life and achievements, and considers that the development of this pilgrimage route from north east to south west Scotland deserves the creation of local and national events along the way to celebrate the renaissance spirit of Scotland. Supported by: Robin Harper*, Gil Paterson*, Stewart Maxwell*, Jamie Stone*, Brian Adam*, Bill Kidd*
