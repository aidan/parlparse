*S2M-1662# Ms Sandra White: Opposition to Rationalisation of Medical Services—That the Parliament notes with growing concern the continuing rationalisation and centralisation of medical services in Scotland; notes the increasingly vocal public opposition to these measures, and believes that the Minister for Health and Community Care should not stay silent on this matter and that it is his duty to take action to halt further rationalisation and centralisation until full consultation involving the medical profession and the public has been undertaken and until a national strategy has been put in place.
