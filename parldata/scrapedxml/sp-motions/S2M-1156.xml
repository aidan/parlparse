*S2M-1156# Bill Butler: Siting of New Transport Agency in Glasgow-That the Parliament supports Glasgow as the location for the headquarters of the proposed Scottish transport agency, Transport Scotland; recognises the employment benefits that locating the agency in Glasgow would bring to the city; notes the significance of Glasgow to Scotland's rail and road transport networks; acknowledges the transport expertise currently within the city, which includes the existing staff in the headquarters of Strathclyde Passenger Transport and in Glasgow City Council, which currently runs the National Driver Information and Control System (NADICS) network on behalf of the Scottish Executive, and believes that the Executive should give serious consideration to Glasgow as an ideal location for Transport Scotland.
