*S3M-5696 Marilyn Livingstone: Love Maggie’s Day—That the Parliament supports the first ever Love Maggie’s Day on 26 March 2010; welcomes the fact that past, present and future fundraisers are being encouraged to do an activity that they love or for someone they love in the lead up to the event; notes that the day will be celebrated in each region across Scotland and that supporters will meet at Maggie’s centres and form a chain to hug the building; considers Love Maggie’s Day to be an excellent opportunity to raise awareness of the support that Maggie’s offers people living with, through and beyond cancer and how important fundraising is to these services; recognises that the Maggie’s Centre in Fife provides great comfort and hope to the people of Fife and their families who are affected by cancer, and congratulates the staff in the Maggie’s Centre in Kirkcaldy for the quality of care and services provided.
