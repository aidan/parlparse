*S2M-3521 Ms Sandra White: Protocol Regarding Removal of Children of Asylum Seekers—That the Parliament notes that the Scottish Executive is yet to put in place a formal written protocol to clarify the role of Scottish children’s services in future removals of asylum seeker children, despite widespread concerns related to child welfare from a number of expert sources, including the Commissioner for Children and Young People; notes that Scottish ministers have a clear remit to intervene to ensure the welfare of the child under the Children (Scotland) Act 1995, and further notes that images of children being dragged from their beds in the early hours of the morning and deported back to a country they barely know will do little for Scotland’s wider reputation abroad and indeed appears to run contrary to the Executive’s declared policy of trying to encourage families to stay and contribute to Scotland.
