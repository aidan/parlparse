*S3M-5826 Bill Wilson: Lloyds Banking Group "Bullies" Lloyds TSB Foundation and Threatens Future of Scottish Charities—That the Parliament notes with regret that, with reference to motion S3M-5377 lodged on 8 December 2009, Lloyds Banking Group (LBG) has now served notice to terminate its covenant with Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland; further notes that LBG took this action before the foundation had responded to its offer to halve the share of pre-tax profits given to the foundation to 0.5% in return for short-term funding and believes that the conditions placed on this offer would also have removed much of the foundation’s independence with respect to choosing its beneficiaries; deplores LBG’s refusal to approve the trustees’ unanimous vote to reappoint the foundation’s chair for another year; recognises that Lloyds TSB Foundation for Scotland is one of Scotland’s largest independent charitable foundations and provides invaluable support to charities across Scotland; is deeply concerned by the LBG’s behaviour toward the foundation, described by the latter as bullying; regrets its attempts to take advantage of the foundation by reportedly forcing it to accept a proposal that is not in the best interests of the foundation or the charities that it supports; congratulates the foundation for taking a stance against such behaviour, and applauds the foundation’s commitment to continue to support charities across Scotland for the next 25 years and beyond.
