 *S3M-5154 Ian McKee: Bring Down Those Walls—That the Parliament celebrates the 20th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall, widely considered to be the most significant event in history since the end of World War II, which changed Europe and the rest of the world; considers that the fall of the wall in 1989 marked the end of communism in Europe, leading to the end of the Cold War, the disappearance of the Iron Curtain and the reunification of Germany; notes the subsequent accession of eastern European countries into the European Union; considers that the Berlin Wall was a shameful object of the Cold War that divided Europe, and the rest of the world, into opposing ideologies; firmly believes that freedom and liberty are values that must always be upheld; condemns the use of physical separation to divide peoples and societies, and hopes that this 20th anniversary will act as an example and bring hope to those peoples across the globe whose beliefs and differences are still divided by walls and other physical barriers. Supported by: Mike Pringle*, Anne McLaughlin*, Bob Doris*, Robin Harper*, Liam McArthur*, Bill Wilson*, Joe FitzPatrick*
