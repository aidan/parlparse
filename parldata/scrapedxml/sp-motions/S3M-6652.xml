 *S3M-6652 Marilyn Livingstone: Construction Courses in Colleges—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposal by North Highland College to stop its roof slating and tiling course at its Alness campus despite sufficient demand for the course; acknowledges that, if the proposals are implemented, there will be no such course provision north of Arbroath; recognises that Arbroath College takes on only 14 apprentices for roof slating and tiling per year and, other than this small provision, those wishing to enrol on these courses must travel to the central belt for college training; considers that North Highland College will not receive any additional funding for running the course as it can reach its capped funding without it and that in the current economic climate if the course is stopped it will be very unlikely that it will be reinstated in the near future; is concerned that this could be the start of construction courses being terminated as colleges try to make savings, and believes that, if the Scottish Government is committed to linking procurement to training, it must secure adequate construction training facilities throughout Scotland.
