*S3M-1260.3 Ross Finnie: Povertyâ€”As an amendment to motion (S3M-1260) in the name of Nicola Sturgeon, leave out from "that tackling these challenges" to end and insert "; believes that tackling poverty requires a co-ordinated approach with the UK Government to ensure that the benefits system supports those most in need and actively encourages those able to return to education, training and work to do so; believes that a cross-party approach to increasing opportunity across Scotland is required, and therefore calls for the establishment of a cross-party inquiry, involving stakeholders, to address the causes and effects of poverty and wealth inequality in Scotland and recommend to the Parliament practical actions in areas including health, housing, training, social enterprise and the voluntary sector, micro-credit and community regeneration."
