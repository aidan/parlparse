*S2M-4382 Shona Robison: International Nurses’ Day, 12 May 2006—That the Parliament celebrates 12 May 2006 as International Nurses’ Day and recognises the excellent work that nurses across Scotland do and the vital role that they play in the National Health Service, in health promotion and health care; recognises that the Royal College of Nursing (RCN) supports the call for more school nurses as a proactive way to address poor health among Scotland’s youngsters and to tackle health inequalities; notes the RCN’s School Nurse Study which discovered that 64% of school nurses currently feel they are hampered in their ability to do their jobs because of heavy workloads and that 71% say that there are not enough school nurses in their area, and therefore believes that the number of school nurses should be increased to address these concerns.
