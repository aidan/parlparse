*S3M-1369 Pauline McNeill: The Continuing Humanitarian Crisis in the Gaza Strip—That the Parliament expresses its continuing concern about the ongoing blockade of Gaza and the Israeli Government’s decision to begin reducing the electricity supply to 1.5 million Palestinians, including children and innocent civilians, many of whom already live in poverty, 80% of whom are dependent on food aid and 55% of whom are without employment; notes that the situation continues despite warnings from the United States and others against a worsening of the humanitarian situation of the civilian population in Gaza; further notes that human rights groups working in the region argue that the cut in power supplies along with the virtual closure of much of Gaza’s perimeter by Israel violates international law and believes that this amounts to collective punishment of the Palestinian peoples, and therefore calls on the international community to respond urgently to this humanitarian crisis at the same time as working for a peaceful, just and lasting solution for all Palestinians and Israelis.
