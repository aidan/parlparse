*S3M-2898♦ Ian McKee: Recognising the Role of a Healthy, Competitive Television Industry in the Cultural Life of Scotland—That the Parliament recognises the contribution made to the cultural and social life of Scotland and, in particular, in Glasgow and Edinburgh, by a vibrant and competitive home-based television programme-making sector; recognises the role of STV as Scotland’s only commercial public sector broadcasting (PSB) provider, a function that it has provided for 50 years; supports Ofcom’s enhanced evolution option, with STV continuing to provide PSB for Scotland as part of a wider UK network; rejects ITV plc’s call for a single UK-wide brand, which would not be in the interests of Scotland; supports STV’s bid to continue to be a PSB licence holder for Scotland, and, recognising that the company is outside the ITV commissioning process, supports STV’s request to be awarded independent producer status, making it easier for other channels to commission programme production from Scotland.
