*S1M-2718# Scott Barrie: NHS Fife—That the Parliament congratulates NHS Fife on its decision to bring all domestic service, portering and catering contracts which were previously outsourced back into the direct management of the NHS; notes that due to an increase in the cleaning contract specification there will be a welcome improvement in the general cleanliness of Fife’s health facilities which will benefit patients and several hundred staff, and believes that this action recreates the "NHS team" and that this policy should be extended throughout Scotland.
