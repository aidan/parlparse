 *S3M-1517 Bill Wilson: Scotland Against Criminalising Communities and CIA Watch—That the Parliament welcomes the announcement by Scotland Against Criminalising Communities (SACC) of the establishment of a CIA Watch network to be used to circulate urgent alerts warning of the imminent arrival in Scotland of CIA aircraft implicated in extraordinary rendition; supports SACC’s call for people to sign up to this network, particularly those living within easy reach of Scotland’s main airports; notes that this new development is happening against the background of the events described in motions S3M-1491 and S3M-1119, and urges the relevant authorities to investigate, as a matter of urgency, any information passed to them by CIA Watch.
