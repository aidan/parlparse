 *S3M-315 Mary Scanlon: Shetland Bike Project—That the Parliament congratulates the Shetland Bike Project, established in 1999; supports Caroline Adamson and others who provide placements for clients from organisations such as Shetland Link-up, Moving On, Support Training Limited and Jobcentre Plus who have had problems associated with alcohol, drugs and mental health; further supports the efforts made to help clients regain confidence in their ability to return to employment and interact with others, and notes that many trainees go from their six-month placements into full-time employment, no longer requiring to be supported with employment benefits, and at the end of the process there are many restored bicycles for sale or hire to tourists and the Shetland community.
