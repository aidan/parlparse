 *S3M-2622 George Foulkes: Independence is Bad News for Business—That the Parliament notes the comments of Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, a former British ambassador to the United States of America and former head of the Diplomatic Service, regarding the negative impact that independence would have on Scotland; believes that inward investment from the United States could dry up if Scotland became independent; further believes that Scotland would have to leave the European Union with no guarantee that an application to rejoin would prove successful, putting in jeopardy rights to free movement of labour, a common market, joint action to tackle environmental hazards and other benefits of membership of the European Union; further notes with concern the news that the Republic of Ireland is now deemed to be a country in recession and that in Iceland interest rates have hit 15% and inflation 8%; also notes that these are both small independent countries that the SNP has long proclaimed form "an arc of prosperity"; believes that the SNP has never established whether it favours an Irish-style tax cutting economy or a higher tax Scandinavian-style social democracy because it cannot believe in both with any economic credibility, and concludes that the strength of the union of the United Kingdom has been the source of economic and political stability for Scotland for over 300 years and will see us through these difficult economic times.
