*S2M-3113 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Ragwort Control—That the Parliament recognises the danger posed to horses, cattle and sheep from ragwort; recognises and applauds the work done by the British Horse Society to raise awareness of the dangers of ragwort, and, in light of the society’s forthcoming Ragwort Awareness Week from 19 to 23 September 2005, calls on the Scottish Executive to bring forward legislation similar to the Ragwort Control Act 2003 which covers England and Wales at the earliest opportunity after September 2005.
