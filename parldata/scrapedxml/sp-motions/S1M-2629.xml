 *S1M-2629 Michael Russell: Burns Cottage-That the Parliament notes the difficulties faced by the Joint Board of Management of Burns National Heritage Park which includes Burns Cottage in Alloway in continuing to secure and protect the building and its contents and in ensuring continued public access; agrees that the Joint Board is responsible for a uniquely important site and for artefacts of huge significance which provide the most important commemoration and celebration of the poet to be found anywhere in the world, and calls on all of Scotland, including the Scottish Executive, to take every necessary step to assist the Joint Board in its vital task and also to ensure that Robert Burns and his vision and values are promoted vigorously.
