*S3M-7347 Christina McKelvie: End Child Detention—That the Parliament congratulates Clare Sambrook on winning the 2010 Paul Foot Award for campaigning journalism; notes that Clare is a founder member of End Child Detention Now, acitizens’ campaign to end the detention of child asylum-seekers and migrants by the UK immigration authorities; further notes that Clare’s award comes less than two months after UK immigration minister Damian Green appeared to backtrack on the pledge made in the UK Government’s coalition agreement to stop the practice of detaining children, saying that it would instead seek merely to minimise child detention; further notes that the family unit at Yarl’s Wood Immigration Removal Centre in Bedfordshire remains open and that vulnerable children and young people are still detained there; believes that this is a continuing moral outrage, and calls on the UK Government to delay no further in honouring its promise to finally and unequivocally end the practice of child detention for immigration purposes.
