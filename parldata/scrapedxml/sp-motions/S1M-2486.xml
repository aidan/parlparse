 *S1M-2486 Fergus Ewing: Scottish Transport Group Pension Scheme-That the Parliament notes that both the Scottish Transport Group Staff Pension Fund and the Scottish Transport Group Transport Operatives Pension Scheme have still to be wound up some eight years after privatisation; further notes that the Scottish Executive promised in December 2000 that a total sum of £100 million would be distributed to the pension scheme members and that this would result in a payment of an average of about £7,000 for each member; recognises that the actual total surplus of the pension funds is considerably in excess of £100 million; believes that the level of payment proposed last December by the Scottish Executive is inadequate and should be increased, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to meet representatives of the Scottish Bus Group Pensioners' Action Committee and to make available to them all relevant information to enable them to assist the pensioners in achieving a just settlement.
