 * S2M-3149 Shiona Baird: Federation of Small Businesses’ Research on Supermarket Development—That the Parliament welcomes a new research initiative by the Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) to gauge the impact on the small business sector following, or pending, the opening of new supermarkets and out-of-town retail parks; acknowledges the serious concerns expressed by many small and medium-sized businesses whose viability is threatened by the increasingly dominant supermarket sector; notes that in the United States of America a number of towns are either banning new supermarket developments or severely restricting the size of proposed stores to limit the damage to existing independent small and medium-sized businesses; believes that local authority planners must be persuaded that an overprovision of large supermarkets has a predictably catastrophic effect on the small and medium-sized business sector and the wider local economy; encourages all small and medium-sized businesses in Scotland, whether or not they are members, to participate in the FSB’s research project and respond to it with details of their individual experiences, and urges the Scottish Executive, in the interests of economic diversity and natural justice, to address urgently anomalies, such as those in the rating system, whereby supermarkets enjoy more favourable treatment at the expense of small and medium-sized enterprises.
