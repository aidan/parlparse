*S3M-3897 Cathie Craigie: The Inclusion Zone—That the Parliament welcomes The Inclusion Zone (TIZ) at St Maurice’s High School in Cumbernauld; notes that TIZ was set  up to provide support for pupils experiencing difficulty in coping with the curriculum, whether through needing additional support or having social and emotional needs that resulted in challenging behaviour; recognises the work of the two members of staff and the principal teacher in providing teaching in parallel to class work and in providing pastoral support to help pupils cope with reintegration back into mainstream classes, and congratulates pupils and staff for establishing TIZ,  which is a valued resource available to anyone at St Maurice’s.
