 *S1M-3339 Dorothy-Grace Elder: Thanks to Billy Connolly-That the Parliament joins with the people of Glasgow's East End in expressing profound thanks to Mr Billy Connolly for his magnificent effort in raising funds for the East End flood victims; is mindful of the time he gave up for free to play the SECC on three successive nights to packed audiences and how his gesture raised not only funds but also the hearts of people in Glasgow left with no possessions after devastating flooding, and salutes this international star as a true son of Glasgow, who returned to his roots at the moment intervention was most needed.
