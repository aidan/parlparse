*S2M-3795.5 Tommy Sheridan: Local Government Finance—As an amendment to motion (S2M-3795) in the name of Mr John Swinney, leave out from “welcomes” to end and insert “believes that local authorities have taken giant strides to improve efficiency but are hampered by inefficient and uneconomic public private partnership deals and the use of expensive consultants which, coupled with the inadequacy of central government funding, makes the protection and expansion of vital local government jobs and services increasingly difficult to achieve; calls on the Executive to restore the £58.5 million in efficiency savings to local government baselines and to make available to local authorities £34.7 million from the pre-Budget report consequentials on condition that this is used to deliver a real-terms freeze in council tax; recognises that these are short-term improvements to the unfair council tax that will only be resolved when the system is abolished and replaced by a local income tax based on the ability to pay, and believes the Executive must fully fund equal pay restructuring across Scotland’s local authorities to deliver economic justice to the hundreds of thousands of women workers who have been illegally underpaid for years.” Motions and amendments which have attracted additional support
