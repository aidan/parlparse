 *S3M-3778.1 Robert Brown: Alcohol Strategy—As an amendment to motion (S3M-3778) in the name of Bill Aitken, leave out from "any changes" to end and insert "tackling Scotland’s complex relationship with alcohol will require significant and long-term cultural change, and believes that any proposals for reform of the law should be targeted and evidence-based, introduced on the basis of strong public support and following meaningful consultation with all relevant interests and stakeholders to ensure that measures to address problematic alcohol consumption do not unfairly penalise the majority of individuals who enjoy alcohol responsibly."
