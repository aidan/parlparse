*S3M-5026 Hugh Henry: CWU Actionâ€”That the Parliament notes the outcome of the ballot on industrial action announced by the Communication Workers Union (CWU); recognises the service that Royal Mail staff provide in communities throughout Scotland; welcomes the willingness of the CWU to go to arbitration; believes that the potential disruption to the public and businesses warrants the intervention of ACAS; calls on the major stakeholder in Royal Mail to use its influence to bring both sides together at ACAS, and further calls on Royal Mail to agree to such intervention to allow urgent and meaningful negotiations to help prevent damaging and disruptive action.
