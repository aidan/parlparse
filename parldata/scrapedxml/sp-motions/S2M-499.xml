*S2M-499 Rosie Kane: Renewable Energy-That the Parliament acknowledges the concerns of members of the public over the inappropriate siting of on-shore wind farms; notes that Scotland potentially has many various forms of renewable energy; calls on the Scottish Executive to establish a publicly-owned renewable energy company that would encompass all forms of renewable energy, and further calls on the Executive to take the national grid into public ownership to facilitate the efficient transfer of electricity.
