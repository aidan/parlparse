 *S1M-2470.1 Mr John Home Robertson: Birthplace of John Muir in Dunbar—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2470) in the name of Michael Russell, leave out from "recognises" to end and insert "welcomes the initiative taken by the John Muir Birthplace Trust to develop the John Muir Birthplace in Dunbar High Street as a fitting tribute to the creator of America’s national parks and the father of modern environmentalism and as a centre to promote understanding of our natural environment; acknowledges the widespread support for this proposal in Dunbar and elsewhere following consultation on the planning application to East Lothian Council; notes the conclusion of the conservation architect Nicholas Groves-Raines that the building had been gutted in the 1970s with the result that none of the original interior features remain to be conserved; is confident that the sensitive redevelopment of the John Muir Birthplace will attract substantially more visitors than the 2,028, of whom only 3% were Americans, who visited the centre this year; endorses the decision of the Scottish Executive to grant consent for the necessary alterations to this important listed building, and welcomes the support of the Heritage Lottery Fund for this excellent initiative."
