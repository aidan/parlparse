*S3M-4443 Jamie Hepburn: Trident, Jobs and Scotland’s Economy—That the Parliament notes the publication by the Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament of a new report on the possible impact of any decision by the UK Government to renew the Trident nuclear weapons system; is concerned by the report’s finding that 3,000 public sector jobs in Scotland could be at risk if finance for the project is diverted from existing public expenditure as proposed by the Defence White Paper of 2006; further notes that the report finds that the cost of Trident is over £2 billion per annum and that, "instead of a stimulus to the economy during a time of recession", the replacement programme represents "a long term spending commitment at a time when the government is trying to balance the books and pay back some of our inflated National Debt"; believes that the report comprehensively rebuts claims that cancellation of Trident would result in the loss of 10,000 jobs in Scotland; supports the continuing work of the Scottish Government’s Scotland Without Nuclear Weapons Working Group, and calls on the UK Government to scrap Trident and genuinely commit to working for a world free of nuclear weapons of mass destruction. Supported by: Patrick Harvie*, Robin Harper*, Bill Wilson*, Kenneth Gibson*, Joe FitzPatrick*, Bill Kidd*, Rob Gibson*, Brian Adam*, Christina McKelvie*, Dave Thompson*, Sandra White*
