 *S1M-3821# Richard Lochhead: Crime in the North East-That the Parliament expresses concern over the level of crime in Grampian; believes that this is largely linked to substance misuse; recognises that substance misuse and consequent crime affects both urban and rural communities in the region; notes that Aberdeen has the highest level of break-ins of any local authority area in Scotland and the second highest level of overall crime; notes that Grampian has the highest level of crimes of dishonesty in Scotland; believes that the situation is not helped by the historical under-funding of Grampian Police which has one of the lowest levels of funding in Scotland and the lowest level of police officers per head of population; further believes that the situation is exacerbated by the length of time that drug misusers must wait for treatment from local services, and considers that the Scottish Executive should investigate the level of crime in Grampian and take the necessary steps to tackle the causes.
