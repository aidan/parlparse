 *S3M-2407Shirley-Anne Somerville:Post Office Closures in Edinburgh, the Lothians and South of Scotland—That the Parliament notes that the consultation on the closure of post office branches across Edinburgh, the Lothians and the south of Scotland has now commenced; opposes the closure programme which will further decimate the post office network that has been run down by the UK Government over a number of years; believes that local post offices remain the hub of the community and a vital lifeline service for many local residents, particularly elderly and disabled people; encourages all post office customers concerned about the future of their local branch to participate in the consultation; regrets that none of Edinburgh’s Labour MPs took the opportunity to halt the closure programme in March 2008 when they voted against an amendment that would have reprieved the service, and assumes therefore that they will not be opposing the closure of branches in their own constituencies.
