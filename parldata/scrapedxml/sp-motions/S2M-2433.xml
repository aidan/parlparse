 *S2M-2433 Mr Stewart Maxwell: Remarks by Ken Livingstoneâ€”That the Parliament abhors the comments made by Ken Livingstone, Mayor of London, who recently compared a Jewish reporter to a concentration camp guard; recognises that this year is the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz; urges everyone, particularly those in positions of power, to be mindful of the language they use, and expects the Mayor of London to withdraw his remarks and issue a full apology forthwith.
