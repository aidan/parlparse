 *S1M-2775# Mr Kenneth Gibson: Scotland's Participation in Future Olympic Games—That the Parliament congratulates all those who represented Great Britain in the recent Winter Olympic Games, particularly the all-Scottish women’s curling team for their magnificent achievement in winning the gold medal and Alain Baxter for his success in the men's slalom; regrets that while Scotland competes in the cricket, football and rugby world cups and the Commonwealth Games in its own right, it does not do so in the Olympics; recognises that while most Olympic teams are from independent nations, the International Olympic Committee also recognises participants from independent territories, commonwealths, protectorates and others; believes that for the Athens Olympiad in 2004 and subsequent winter and summer Olympic games, Scotland should join the other 199 countries of the Olympic movement in participating in its own right, and considers that the Scottish Executive should work to that end.
