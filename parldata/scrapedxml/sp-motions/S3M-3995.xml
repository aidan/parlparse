 *S3M-3995 Ian McKee: The Human Cost of Alcohol Misuse—That the Parliament acknowledges BMA Scotland’s recent report, The human cost of alcohol misuse: Doctors speak out, which highlights the local and national statistics on alcohol and its impact on people’s health, showing that between 2007 and 2008, 42,430 acute general discharges from hospital with an alcohol-related diagnosis were registered in Scotland and that 1,687 alcohol-related deaths were registered in 2007 alone; considers that these are worrying figures that demonstrate that Scotland’s relationship with alcohol is in need of radical change, and welcomes BMA Scotland’s recommendations, which very much reflect the Scottish Government’s proposals for tackling alcohol misuse, including the introduction of minimum retail pricing, improved product labelling and the regulation of irresponsible promotions. Supported by: Shirley-Anne Somerville*, Nigel Don*, Kenneth Gibson*, Brian Adam*, Bill Kidd*, Bill Wilson*, Rob Gibson*
