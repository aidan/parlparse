*S3M-5802 Michael Matheson: High Street Mile of Coins in Aid of End Polio Now—That the Parliament lauds the efforts of Falkirk citizens in their campaign to eradicate globally the devastating disease of polio; notes that the citizens of Falkirk have taken measures to combat this disease since 1985 when Rotary launched PolioPlus, a multimillion pound initiative to immunise every child in the world; praises this initiative, which contributed to the eventual vaccination of more than two billion children worldwide; recognises with sadness, however, that the disease continues to plague Afghanistan, Nigeria, India and Pakistan, and commends the continued efforts of Falkirk citizens and the four Rotary clubs covering Falkirk district and their aim to collect a mile of coins to place along the town’s High Street in aid of Rotary’s End Polio Now campaign.
