 *S3M-3255 Joe FitzPatrick: Sunday Post’s 90th Birthday—That the Parliament congratulates publishers DC Thomson and Co on the 90th birthday of The Sunday Post; notes that The Sunday Post was created in 1919 from The Post Sunday Special, a newspaper that was originally produced to ensure that lists of World War One casualties, which were released on a Saturday evening, could be available as soon as possible; further recognises that The Sunday Post is a Scottish institution enjoying an impressive readership of 950,000 and is home to Scottish icons The Broons and Oor Wullie; looks forward to its continued longevity and success in future years, and wishes everyone connected with The Sunday Post, both past and present, all the best.
