*S3M-2599# Elaine Smith: Summerlee - The Scottish Museum of Industrial Life—That the Parliament welcomes the re-opening in Coatbridge of Summerlee, the Scottish Museum of Industrial Life, on Friday 26 September 2008 following a major £10 million redevelopment; congratulates North Lanarkshire Council, its employees and the Friends of Summerlee Redevelopment Appeal, who have worked tirelessly to ensure the project’s completion; welcomes the £5 million contribution made by the Heritage Lottery Fund alongside the contributions from North Lanarkshire Council, the Scottish Museums Council, the European Regional Development Fund and the redevelopment appeal; encourages further donations to that appeal, which can be made up until 31 October 2008; notes that Summerlee was formerly one of Scotland’s most important ironworks; recognises the importance of keeping our industrial heritage alive through the preservation of the history of local iron, steel, coal and engineering industries; considers that Summerlee offers an invaluable educational resource providing an opportunity to reflect on the hard work and sacrifice of the working class of Scotland’s industrial heartland and to remember the difficult circumstances in which they worked and lived; further considers it appropriate that North Lanarkshire Workers Memorial is situated at the gates of Summerlee, commemorating International Workers Memorial Day, and encourages visitors to come and see first-hand the excellent facilities, which include interactive displays, a kids’ discovery zone, children’s outdoor play area, shop, café and exhibition area, ensuring that Summerlee takes its place as a leading visitor attraction and a landmark heritage facility for the 21st century.
