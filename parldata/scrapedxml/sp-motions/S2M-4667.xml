*S2M-4667 Shiona Baird: Renewables Industry Job Losses—That the Parliament expresses the gravest concern over the loss of more than 50 skilled jobs in the renewable energy fabrication firm, Camcal, due in part to lack of orders; recognises the skills developed at Camcal’s Arnish Yard in Lewis in both the offshore wind and marine renewable sector in building not only the wind turbines for the much-heralded Beatrice platform pilot project but also sections for the world-leading wave machine, Pelamis, and agrees that if the Scottish Executive is serious about tackling climate change, maintaining long-term green jobs and demonstrating its support for the Scottish renewables industry, it must play its part by reducing time delays in issuing planning consents for wind farms and speed up its plan to review support for marine renewables.
