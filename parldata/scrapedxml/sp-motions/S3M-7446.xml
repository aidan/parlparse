*S3M-7446 Karen Whitefield: Friends of Centenary Parkâ€”That the Parliament acknowledges the work of Friends of Centenary Park in Airdrie, which joined forces with Poppy Scotland to commemorate Remembrance Day by illuminating Airdrie Viaduct with poppies in what was seen as a beautiful, highly poignant and visually impressive tribute to the brave servicemen and women who have died fighting for the United Kingdom; considers that such a display constitutes a fitting tribute to those who have given up their lives in the defence of others, and unites in paying respect to the valour of the fallen.
