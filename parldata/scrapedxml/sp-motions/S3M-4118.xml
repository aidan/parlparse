*S3M-4118 Dave Thompson: Community Energy Scotland CARES—That the Parliament welcomes the appointment of Community Energy Scotland, based at Fodderty Way in Dingwall, to develop the Scottish Government’s flagship Communities And Renewable Energy Scheme (CARES); notes that the Easter Ross charity will help communities across Scotland develop green energy projects, including heat pumps, solar panels and green hydrogen fuel cells, with the scheme enabling the development of over 400 community energy projects already; hails the decision by the Scottish Government to increase by 50% the maximum grant level offered to £150,000, which will further help to increase community cohesion and confidence, skills development and support local economic regeneration, and finally encourages community groups to get in touch with their local scheme development officer to see what support is available to help their community develop its own renewable energy projects.
