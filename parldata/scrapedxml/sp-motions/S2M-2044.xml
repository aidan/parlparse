 *S2M-2044# Helen Eadie: Supported Employment Learning Initiative Fundingâ€”That the Parliament supports the simplification of the process for accessing funds for learning initiatives for organisations such as Remploy that provide supported employment to people with specific needs, removing the need for these individuals or their organisations to apply to, and liaise with, several government departments when making a request for funding, and supports the creation of a central funding budget for this purpose and access to Learn Direct funds via individual learning accounts for supported employment organisations.
