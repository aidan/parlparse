 *S1M-2969 David Mundell: Lockerbie to Leeds Rail Serviceâ€”That the Parliament notes that the Strategic Rail Authority is establishing a new Northern England franchise which will include the existing Glasgow to Leeds service; notes that this service currently passes through Lockerbie Station without stopping; further notes that Lockerbie Station is a major regional railhead for much of the south of Scotland and that there is no direct service between the station and West Yorkshire, and calls upon the Scottish Executive to do all that it can to urge the Strategic Rail Authority and the six pre-qualified bidders for the Northern England franchise to agree to stop at Lockerbie Station on the Glasgow to Leeds service as part of the new franchise. Supported by: Phil Gallie*, Michael Russell*, Mrs Lyndsay McIntosh*, Mr David Davidson*
