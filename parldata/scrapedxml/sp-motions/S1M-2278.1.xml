 *S1M-2278.1 Fergus Ewing: A Forward Strategy for Agriculture—As an amendment to motion (S1M-2278) in the name of Ross Finnie, leave out from "welcomes" to end and insert "believes that the Scottish Executive’s A Forward Strategy for Scottish Agriculture does not contain an analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the sector, does not consider the policies implemented in other European countries, does not provide or suggest any mechanism by which the aims described in the document can be achieved, nor does it provide any assurance to the small farmer or crofter that they have a sustainable long term future in agriculture."
