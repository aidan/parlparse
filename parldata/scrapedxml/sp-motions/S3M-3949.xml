 *S3M-3949 Bill Wilson: UK Government’s Admission of Complicity in Torture—That the Parliament notes the Foreign and Commonwealth Office’s recent report on human rights in which it considers that the UK Government tacitly admits to using "intelligence possibly derived through torture"; further notes Craig Murray’s statement that the names of sources are omitted from intelligence reports so that it cannot be proven that torture was used in producing that intelligence; believes that the report therefore negates the UK Government’s supposed condemnation of torture and that when it uses evidence obtained from practices such as immersing victims in boiling water, as used in Uzbekistan, or taking them to the point of drowning, as extensively practised by the United States of America under the euphemism of waterboarding, then it is as guilty as the government or agency that carries out the torture, and is of the opinion that torture does not protect lives but simply ensures that the victim provides whatever "evidence" is required by the torturer and that the use of torture can only increase hatred and violence, not reduce it.
