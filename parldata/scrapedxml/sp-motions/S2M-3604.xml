*S2M-3604 Shiona Baird: Edinburgh University Students Vote for Zero Waste—That the Parliament welcomes the decision of the Edinburgh University Students’ Association, taken at its recent AGM, to pass a motion setting itself a target for zero waste; notes that, as well as calling for waste to be reduced by half every five years, the motion also sets a charge for plastic bags in Students’ Association shops; congratulates the students at Edinburgh University for being the first group in Scotland to set a zero waste target, and calls on the University of Edinburgh and the University’s Accommodation Services to accede to student calls to set similar targets.
