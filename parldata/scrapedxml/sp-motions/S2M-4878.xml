*S2M-4878 Ms Rosemary Byrne: Protection for Polish Workers—That the Parliament applauds the support given by T&amp;G Scotland to migrant workers in recognising their role in Scotland and raising concern over the abuse of their rights; notes that Home Office figures show that 32,135 migrant workers are registered in Scotland, most of whom are Poles; notes with concern that migrant Polish workers are suffering abuse of tenancy rights, with immediate eviction of workers on termination of employment, extreme long hours, infringements on pay, rights to paid holidays, statutory sick pay and notice rights and rights to salary slips, and illegal deductions from wages; further notes that these migrant workers also face a number of challenges outwith the workplace, including language, opening bank accounts, religious issues and issues surrounding accommodation; recognises the positive contribution that migrant workers make to Scotland economically and culturally; further recognises that the abuse of these workers is indicative of the failed neo-liberal economic policies pursued by New Labour in London which destroy workers’ lives and communities, and therefore calls on the Scottish Executive to demand control of Scotland’s economy and employment legislation from Westminster and to put pressure on employers to recognise workers’ rights with regards to pay and conditions and on all landlords to recognise tenants’ rights, irrespective of nationality.
