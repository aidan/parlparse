*S3M-863 Christine Grahame: Penicuik CAB is the Tops—That the Parliament recognises the achievement of Penicuik Citizens Advice Bureau (CAB) which is the first in Scotland to achieve 100% compliance in its quality of advice audit, a scheme introduced by its umbrella body, the Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux; notes that the 100% compliance attests to the hard and immensely conscientious work done by the staff and volunteers who are so ably supported by Assistant Manager, Russell Gray; further notes that Penicuik CAB is also one of the few CABx to offer representation at employment tribunals, providing a valuable service for individuals who otherwise would not have access to representation in this increasingly complex area of law, and congratulates all who have contributed to Penicuik CAB’s award.
