*S3M-4900 Bill Kidd: No to Savage Cut to Child Benefit—That the Parliament notes with concern the suggestion by Liberal Democrat Leader Nick Clegg that, as part of a package of savage cuts, child benefit, a universal benefit with a high uptake and paid directly to mothers, be made subject to means-testing and considers that such a savage cut would fall on mothers and children, adding to child poverty and inequality for mothers and that, by such a measure, children and mothers would effectively be made victims of a banking financial crisis for which they were not responsible. Supported by: Aileen Campbell*, Alasdair Allan*, Kenneth Gibson*, Bill Wilson*, Rob Gibson*, Christine Grahame*, Anne McLaughlin*, Bob Doris*
