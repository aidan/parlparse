*S3M-7580 Patrick Harvie: Unacceptable Gender Impact of Spending Cuts—That the Parliament notes the result of UK Women’s Budget Group’s gender impact assessment of the UK Government’s budget of June 2010 was that, of the planned £8.1 billion to be saved in cuts, 72% of this will be borne by women compared with 28% by men; argues that the impact of policies must be looked at when cuts are being proposed and that a gender assessment should have been carried out; believes that this is a symbol of how deeply unfair and unjust the spending cuts are; welcomes the separate assessment of the equality impacts of the Comprehensive Spending Review by the Equality and Human Rights Commission, and commits to ensure that Scottish budget choices are fully informed by an analysis of equality impacts.
