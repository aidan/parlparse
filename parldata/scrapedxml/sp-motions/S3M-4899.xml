 *S3M-4899 Margaret Smith: Scotland’s Students are Overstretched and Overdrawn—That the Parliament notes the report by NUS Scotland, Overstretched and Overdrawn, showing that the majority of students are in some form of debt, with over half suffering from commercial debt; notes the finding that students from lower socio-economic backgrounds (NS-SEC classes 4-7) are more likely to be concerned about commercial debt; further notes the finding that 70% of students are being forced to work more than the 10 hours a week limit recommended in the Cubie report while studying full time; expresses concern at evidence showing clear failings in current child care support, and calls on the Scottish Government to use the £30 million considered in the Supporting a Smarter Scotland consultation to increase student loans, bursaries and improve childcare support system for students in Scotland, as called for by NUS Scotland, student associations across Scotland and the main opposition parties.
