*S1M-1683# Richard Lochhead: Removal of Reliefs for Water and Sewerage Charges for Charitable Organisations—That the Parliament expresses concern over the decision to phase out reliefs for water and sewerage charges for charitable bodies starting from 1 April 2001; recognises that if implemented this decision will mean an estimated additional bill of £27 million for Scotland’s voluntary sector in 2001-02 and more than double that for the following year; notes that the additional costs that will result will threaten the ability of many voluntary organisations engaged in helping the more vulnerable members of our society and tackling social exclusion; questions the level of consultation that has taken place with the sector over these proposals, and believes that this decision should be revisited as a matter of priority.
