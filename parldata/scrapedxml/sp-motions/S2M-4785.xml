*S2M-4785 Stewart Stevenson: Record Prisoner Numbers—That the Parliament notes the continuous increase in prisoner numbers in Scotland’s prisons from an average of 5,362 in 2000-01 to an actual number of 7,178 as at 1 September 2006, an increase of over 33.86%; recognises that the record increase in prisoner numbers over the last six years has taken place during a period of sustained operational efficiency cuts that have resulted in significant reductions in the Scottish Prison Service (SPS) staff complement at all SPS establishments; acknowledges the additional strain placed on staff and the prison system by such record prisoner numbers; recognises that such overcrowding in Scotland’s prisons is having a detrimental effect on the health and safety of staff and prisoners, and calls on the Scottish Executive to review urgently the current operational budget allocation of the SPS.
