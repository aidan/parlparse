 *S2M-1294# John Swinburne: Recognition of Elder Abuse-That the Parliament condemns the apparent prevalence of abuse of old, vulnerable and frail people being cared for in Scottish society, most recently highlighted by the investigative reports by the Daily Record; acknowledges that this problem stems from the poor perceptions held about older people in society and agrees with Action on Elder Abuse that older people should not have to face the humiliation and degradation that they suffer from such abuse simply because they have become old and dependent in today's Scotland; believes that elder abuse should receive the same recognition, attention and action by the Scottish Executive as child abuse and domestic abuse, and therefore considers that the Executive should begin to recognise the prevalence of elder abuse by commissioning a cross-party inquiry into the effectiveness of current systems of care, as was recently carried out by the House of Commons Health Committee, in order to identify the types and settings of elder abuse and the reasons for its prevalence and suggest recommendations for action in order to eradicate this unacceptable problem from society.
