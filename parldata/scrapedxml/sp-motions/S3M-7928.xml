 *S3M-7928 Ken Macintosh: The Life and Works of the Rev Ernest Levy—That the Parliament congratulates Edinburgh’s library service for its work in preserving and exhibiting the archives of the Rev Ernest Levy; recognises the warmth and humanity of what it considers this remarkable individual, qualities that endured despite his ordeal at the hands of the Nazis in the concentration camps of the Second World War; praises the work of Ernest Levy in sharing his experience as a Holocaust survivor with successive generations through his writing, interviews and particularly his talks with school pupils; appreciates the generosity of Ernest’s family, including his daughter, Judithm, in gifting his manuscripts, pictures, music and memoirs to Edinburgh City Libraries in his adopted homeland of Scotland, and welcomes the legacy that Ernest has left, not of bitterness and suffering but of life and hope.
