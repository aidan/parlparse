*S1M-3275 Christine Grahame: Presbytery of Jedburgh-That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed closure of Leslie House, the Church of Scotland's eventide home in Fife; further notes that the Presbytery of Jedburgh agreed the following deliverance: "(i) The Presbytery of Jedburgh believes the Scottish Executive is neglecting responsibility in adequately funding the care of elderly people in residential homes; recognises that it is this situation and that of increased regulation which has forced the decision ratified by the General Assembly of 2002 to close Leslie House; and urges the Scottish Executive to attend to the plight of the elderly in residential care homes and to make provision for the adequate funding of their care and (ii) Presbytery instructs the Clerk to transmit this deliverance to the Scottish Executive, to local MSPs and to the Board of Social Responsibility"; fully supports the Presbytery of Jedburgh in this deliverance, and accordingly calls upon the Scottish Executive to address the care gap as a matter of urgency. Supported by: Mr Adam Ingram*, Mr Lloyd Quinan*, Irene McGugan*, Ms Sandra White*, Fiona McLeod*, Colin Campbell*, Brian Adam*, Mr Kenneth Gibson*, Shona Robison*
