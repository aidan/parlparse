*S3M-3996 Bill Wilson: Israel’s Militarised Society—That the Parliament commends Jewish Voice for Peace for drawing attention to what it considers to be the Israeli Government’s harassment of Israeli peace activists belonging to New Profile, involving the confiscation of their computers, their being called for interrogation and their subsequent release on condition of promising not to contact their political friends for 30 days; agrees with New Profile that Israel need not be a militarised society and that the recent acts of the Israeli Government confirm that the militarism of society in Israel harms the sacred principles of democracy, freedom of expression and freedom of political association, and calls on the Israeli Government to cease the harassment of peace activists immediately, to recognise the right of conscientious objection and to release all those imprisoned for refusing to serve in a military capacity in support of the ongoing occupation of Palestinian territory and in support of the continued violation of the human rights of both Palestinians and many Israelis. Supported by: Gil Paterson*, Robin Harper*, Stuart McMillan*, Bill Kidd*
