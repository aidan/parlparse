 *S3M-6094 Jamie Hepburn: Green and Ethical Investment by Publicly-owned Banks—That the Parliament notes the announcement in the UK Budget of a £2 billion fund toward establishing a green investment bank; considers that this sum, while welcome, pales in comparison to the hundreds of billions of pounds spent on bailing out high street banks and financial services companies; believes that, as a majority shareholder in the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and a major shareholder in the Lloyds Banking Group, the UK Government should be using this influence to encourage ethical and green investment decisions by these institutions; welcomes a campaign by the World Development Movement (WDM) calling for such decisions to be made and notes with concern reports by WDM that RBS investment in OPTI Canada is helping to fund exploitation of tar sand areas in Alberta, which is leading to the poisoning of natural resources and food and water sources used by local indigenous communities in those areas; believes that public ownership of UK banks presents an unrivalled opportunity to encourage sustainable, ethical and environmentally friendly investment, and calls on the UK Government to develop a strategy for such investments by the banks it owns on behalf of the taxpayer.
