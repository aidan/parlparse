*S2M-4159 Mark Ballard: Commercial Activities in Schools—That the Parliament welcomes the publication by the Scottish Consumer Council of Guidance on Commercial Activities in Schools; acknowledges that the guidelines are a step in the right direction but notes that they are legally binding on neither schools nor local education authorities; recognises that highly subjective commercial activities may conflict with the essentially objective nature of education, exposing children to what amounts to advertising and leading to "pester power"; believes that commercial sponsorship or advertising has no place in the education of our children, and calls on the Scottish Executive to tighten up these guidelines and make them legally binding.
