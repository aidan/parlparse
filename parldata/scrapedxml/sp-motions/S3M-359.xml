 *S3M-359 Karen Gillon: Clydesdale Health Facilities—That the Parliament believes that there must be no delay in the building of the new community casualty unit and community hospital in Lanark; recognises that people in Clydesdale travel significant distances to access health services and that these new developments would bring these services much closer to local people, in line with the recommendations of the Kerr report, and calls on the Scottish Executive to ensure that any review of NHS Lanarkshire’s document, A Picture of Health, retains the previous commitment to build these facilities in Lanark.
