 *S3M-3347 Bill Kidd: UK Closer to Scrapping Nuclear Weaponsâ€”That the Parliament welcomes the comments by General Sheehan, a former NATO Supreme Allied Commander Atlantic, stating that he believed that the United Kingdom is very close to becoming the first permanent member of the UN Security Council to do away with nuclear weapons; echoes the sentiment that such a decision would create a much-needed impetus for other nuclear powers to follow suit, and urges those campaigning for nuclear disarmament to maintain and strengthen the pressure on the UK Government to ensure that such a decision is taken.
