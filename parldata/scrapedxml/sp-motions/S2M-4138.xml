*S2M-4138 Christine Grahame: The Borders Forest Trust—That the Parliament congratulates The Borders Forest Trust which celebrates 10 years of restoring native woodlands this year; notes that since its establishment in 1996 it has planted over 800,000 native trees and shrubs and currently supports 29 community woodlands, reconnecting people with their local woods and utilising local hardwood timber resources and woodworking talent; further notes that these ideals were merged in 1996 to form the Trust and Woodschool, which itself received double honours in 2005 at the Dynamic Places Awards, winning the Sir Robert Grieve Award for sustainability and being highly commended in the Connected Places category; recognises that the Trust and Woodschool have had a substantial effect on the Borders’ economy and are fine examples of sustainable and sympathetic development, and therefore encourages people of the Borders and beyond to take part in the many events running throughout the year in celebration of this 10th anniversary.
