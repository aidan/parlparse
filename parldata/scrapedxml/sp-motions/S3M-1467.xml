*S3M-1467 Jim Hume: EU Sheep Identification Rules—That the Parliament notes with concern the proposed new double tagging rules for sheep; recognises that this proposed system of double tagging every animal, given the large flock size of many farms in Scotland, will be unworkable, impractical and will put additional pressure on livestock producers at a time when strict traceability rules are already in place and proven to be effective, and calls on the Scottish Government to represent Scottish farmers’ interests in Europe and to strongly resist the implementation of double tagging proposals.
