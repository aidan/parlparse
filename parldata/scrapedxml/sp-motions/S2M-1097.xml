*S2M-1097 Alex Fergusson: Man's Inhumanity to Man-That the Parliament welcomes the launch and display of the exhibition "Crying Forever" within the Scottish Parliament as the first step of its tour to parliaments in London, Brussels, Washington and Astana in Kazakhstan; abhors the fact that between 1940 and 1990, 607 nuclear devices were purposefully detonated by the Soviet regime in the Semipalatinsk region of Kazakhstan, equivalent to the size of Wales, intentionally exposing the 1.5 million inhabitants, as guinea pigs, to the equivalent strength of 20,222 Hiroshima bombs with disastrous consequences for both the people and the environment alike; notes with horror that within the Semipalatinsk region cancers run at five times the national average and that birth defects are three times the national average, that many women choose not to have children because of the high risk of physical and mental deformity amongst the new born, that many young men are impotent and that suicides amongst the young are common; offers the Parliament's support to the people of Kazakhstan as they struggle to overcome this prime example of man's inhumanity to man, and affirms the importance of democracy in protecting individuals, communities and the precious environment that we live in.
