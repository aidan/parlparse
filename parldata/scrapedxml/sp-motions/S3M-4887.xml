*S3M-4887 Bill Kidd: The Hidden Costs of Trident—That the Parliament notes the publication of a new report by Greenpeace that refutes the UK Government estimates of the costs of renewing the Trident missile system; is concerned by the report’s finding that the total cost of replacing Trident will be £97 billion over the system’s 30-year life span; notes that the cost estimate of £20 billion provided in the Defence White Paper 2006 does not take account of the cost of conventional military forces directly assigned to support Trident nor the cost of new installations that would be required at the Atomic Weapons Establishment at Aldermaston; believes that, in light of these distended costs and a £500 million cut in the Scottish budget ordered by the UK Government, this report highlights the continued urgency of dropping Trident; supports the aims and work of the Scottish Government’s Working Group on Scotland Without Nuclear Weapons, and calls on the UK Government to relinquish its dogged commitment to squandering precious public resources on a weapons system that is unnecessary and irrelevant.
