*S3M-2579 Aileen Campbell: Campaign to End Child Poverty—That the Parliament commends the efforts of the Campaign to End Child Poverty on its work to raise awareness and meet the challenge of the unacceptable situation of one-in-four children living in poverty in Scotland; notes that to halve this number by 2010, a further 60,000 children need to be lifted out of poverty; further notes that the campaign, whose members include Barnardo’s Scotland, Citizens Advice Scotland, Child Poverty Action Group in Scotland, One Parent Families Scotland, The Poverty Alliance and Save the Children, will be recognised at a reception in the Parliament on 24 September 2008, and believes that government and people across Scotland should unite in increased action to end child poverty in Scotland.
