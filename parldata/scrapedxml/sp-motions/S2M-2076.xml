*S2M-2076# Janis Hughes: Network Rail GSM-R Masts—That the Parliament notes the erection by Network Rail of 29 metre-high Global System for Mobile Telecommunications (GSM-R) masts throughout Scotland, beginning with a pilot programme of 84 masts in the Strathclyde area; acknowledges that, despite giving assurances that communities would be fully informed in advance of any work, Network Rail has erected several masts with little or no prior direct notification to elected representatives or local residents; asks Network Rail to give an absolute assurance that masts erected using permitted development rights will not be used at any point for commercial purposes, and acknowledges that, whilst rail safety must always be paramount, the Scottish Executive should examine Network Rail’s permitted development rights in relation to GSM-R masts and, in particular, the role that both Network Rail and local authorities should play in consulting local residents. Supported by: Robert Brown*, Jackie Baillie*
