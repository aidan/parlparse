*S3M-7895 Marilyn Livingstone: Congratulations to Kinghorn Lifeboat Station—That the Parliament notes that Kinghorn lifeboat station was the second busiest station in Scotland last year, with the boat being launched on 70 occasions, including 25 call-outs in the dark, and rescuing 92 people; understands that the volunteer crew at Kinghorn spent nearly 77 hours at sea and many more hours training and preparing for the next call-out; commends the fact that, despite the recent severe weather, Kinghorn lifeboat station has not had a single day off service because of the conditions; believes that it was due to the determination of the volunteer crew that they and the lifeboat were able to go out to sea whatever the weather, and applauds the generosity of people in the Kirkcaldy constituency, even during difficult economic times, which funds all rescues carried out by Kinghorn RNLI.
