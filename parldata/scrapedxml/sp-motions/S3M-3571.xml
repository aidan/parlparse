*S3M-3571 Bill Wilson: Recent Reports on Victims/Survivorsâ€”That the Parliament congratulates Victim Support Scotland on its report, Do you know how supporting victims of crime is helping Scotland, and Sarah Nelson and Lynn Jamieson on their report, Care and Support Needs of Men Who Survived Childhood Sexual Abuse; welcomes the fact that Scotland is described in the former as the best country in Europe at supporting victims; notes, however, the identification by both reports of multiple significant links between crime, deprivation, substance-abuse and sexual, emotional and physical abuse; believes that the reports make clear the significant benefits not only to victims/survivors but also to society at large of adequately supporting victims/survivors, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to act on the information that these reports contain and to do what it can to enhance further the support services available to victims/survivors and encourage the long-term and secure funding for programmes with proven records.
