*S2M-182# John Swinburne: Ten Years of Council Tax—That the Parliament considers the impact of the operation of the council tax following its 10th anniversary; notes with concern the 80% increase in the tax over these 10 years; acknowledges that pensioners’ incomes rise more slowly than those of working-age people as pensioners’ incomes rise only in line with prices, which grow more slowly than earnings, thereby placing an unfair burden on older people; recognises that the council tax accounts for an average 5% of pensioners household income compared with 3% for working-age households, and therefore believes that the Scottish Executive should take action to reduce the financial misery faced by less well-off pensioners.
