 *S3M-3111 Angela Constance: The Guide Dog Week Campaign—That the Parliament congratulates the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association on the Guide Dog Week campaign; recognises that a series of successful public education events were held across Scotland including at Almondvale Centre in Livingston; commends the purpose of these events, which was to demonstrate to the public the best and safest way to guide visually-impaired people, including guide dog owners, who might require assistance in complex circumstances such as at a busy road junction, in a railway station or in a busy shop; applauds the opportunities taken to highlight good practice in approaching and assisting a guide dog owner; notes the good advice offered to members of the public who should not distract or stroke a guide dog when it is wearing its harness and working, and commends the contribution made by the Guide Dogs for the Blind Association in helping to educate members of the public and retailers about blindness and access issues.
