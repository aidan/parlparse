*S1M-3868 Ms Wendy Alexander: Paisley Threads-That the Parliament recognises that running a home and being a parent is a hard job on the reduced income that young people usually receive; commends the support given by Barnardo's Paisley Threads to tenants and parents aged 16 to 21 living in Renfrewshire to take control of their lives through the pooling of information and advice on an individual and group basis in an unintimidating setting; acknowledges the role that Barnardo's plays in supporting 7,000 vulnerable children, young people and families in Scotland each year through 54 community-based services such as Paisley Threads, and realises that the short-term funding for such projects can hamper consistency of service for clients and their families.
