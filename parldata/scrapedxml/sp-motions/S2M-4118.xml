*S2M-4118 Carolyn Leckie: Unbearable Cruelty—That the Parliament supports PETA’s campaign to stop the Ministry of Defence from using bear pelts to make headpieces for the five Guards’ regiments and start having the hats fashioned from faux fur instead; considers that the use of real bear fur causes unneccessary cruelty to bears; notes that one bear in seven is not killed immediately when shot, that some escape wounded, possibly dying later from blood loss or starvation, and that others are ensnared for days in cruel traps; considers the slaughter of animals for their fur to be totally unneccessary and shameful, and urges the UK Government to set a compassionate example and switch to a humane and progressive alternative material for soldiers’ headwear.
