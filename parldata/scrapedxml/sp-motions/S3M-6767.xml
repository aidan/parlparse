 *S3M-6767 George Foulkes: Jail Guitar Doorsâ€”That the Parliament welcomes Jail Guitar Doors to HMP Saughton; recognises that the initiative established and promoted by Billy Bragg aims to provide guitars to prisons that are using music as a means of rehabilitating prison inmates; considers that this is an innovative idea that has a legitimate and valid place in the rehabilitation process; believes that the initiative has helped prisoners elsewhere in the United Kingdom process problems in a non-confrontational way; further believes that new approaches to the rehabilitation of prisoners should be welcomed, and encourages other Scottish prisons to consider adopting the Jail Guitar Doors initiative.
