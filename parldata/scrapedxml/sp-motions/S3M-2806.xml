*S3M-2806 Irene Oldfather: EU Council of Ministers Call for Action on Alzheimer’s Disease—That the Parliament welcomes the acknowledgement by the Council of the European Union that Alzheimer’s disease is a European priority; agrees that Alzheimer’s disease is a major challenge for all European societies; notes that the council has acknowledged the importance of better understanding, detecting, preventing and finally combating the mechanisms that trigger neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s; further notes that the council has recognised the value of strengthening co-operation, co-ordination and financial support for research efforts across Europe; acknowledges that the current EU Presidency has also made a commitment to Alzheimer’s, and therefore calls on the Scottish Government to amend its European priorities to include action on Alzheimer’s as a key priority area and to work with key Scottish stakeholders to recognise the contribution that Scotland can make to developing innovative approaches to neurodegenerative disease Europe-wide.
