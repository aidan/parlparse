 *S1M-3922 Mr John McAllion: United States of America Government Ban on Importation of Glenfiddich Havana Reserve Malt Whisky-That the Parliament condemns the ban by the Government of the United States of America on the Glenfiddich Havana Reserve single malt entering the United States; notes the absurdity of banning a Scotch malt on the grounds that it is matured in Cuban rum barrels; further notes that this ban highlights the absurdity and iniquity of the oppressive Helms Burton Act that seeks to punish any contact or trade with Cuba, and looks forward to closer links between Scotland and Cuba through trade, tourism and ties of friendship.
