*S3M-4786 Mike Pringle: Welcome to Lothian Buses’ Pink Top—That the Parliament applauds the responsiveness of Lothian Buses to the needs of its passengers; notes that since 2000 the company has provided easy access buses culminating in an entire fleet of low-floor easy access vehicles, and welcomes the trialling of the pink top service 22, which provides a dedicated unfolded buggy space in addition to wheelchair space thus increasing the travel capacity for disabled passengers and those with young children and folded or unfolded buggies.
